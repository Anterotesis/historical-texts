         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

well obſerveth (Eliſim <hi>piorum Clyp. Queſt. 12.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et the light of the Scripture is ſufficient; as to all
neceſſary ſaving Knowledge about it; And as
for Curioſities and needleſſe Subtilties, which are
a ſhell in the Controverſie, we may throw them
them away, and eat the Kernel. It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
both by <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that the
Controverſies about <hi>Original Sinne,</hi> are of very
great importance. <hi>Stapleton</hi> chargeth us (<hi>Proleg.
Diſput. de peccat. Originali</hi>) with two capital
maternal Errours, the one about the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>
the other about <hi>Original Sinne,</hi> as if theſe two
were the <hi>Joachin</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>z</hi> our Temple is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as if theſe were the two breaſts from which all
other erroneous Doctrines ſuck their peſtiferous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
We again on the other ſide, do propugn theſe
two Principles (the former whereof we may call
<hi>Principium cognoſcendi,</hi> and the later <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium
eſſendi</hi>) as the two fountaines of Doctrinal
<pb facs="tcp:57719:3"/>
and Practical Piety, ſo that to deſtroy any of theſe,
is <hi>to lay the ax to the root of the tree,</hi> that ſo no
more fruit in Religion may grow thereupon. The
<hi>Pontificians</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are generally agreed
in this (for ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but few diſſent from
their own Party herein) that there is ſuch a thing as
<hi>Original Sinne;</hi> and that it is truly, properly and
univocally a Sinne; only they complain of us, as
too direfully and tragically amplifying the nature of
it. Hence <hi>Hoffmeiſter, Eccius</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſſander</hi> grant
a conſent in this; onely they think the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
words and expreſsions are capable of a perfective al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
The expreſſe Adverſaries therefore to
this Doctrine were the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> of late; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<hi>a late Engliſh Writer Dr.</hi> Taylor (<hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Neceſſarium, and in other little Pieces</hi>)
(Proh nefas!) <hi>like a ſecond</hi> Julian <hi>in triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
language, hath with much boldneſs and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity
decried it, as if it were but a</hi> non ens, <hi>and
the Diſputes needleſs about it.</hi> For although
ſometimes he would make the world believe he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Original Sinne,</hi> yet theſe are but words, <hi>ad
frangendam invidiam,</hi> as <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old would
uſe the word <hi>Grace,</hi> for when it cometh to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
he meaneth no more than an <hi>Original
Curſe,</hi> or elſe the <hi>meer Naturals</hi> (that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of, complying with <hi>Pelagius</hi> and ſome <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in
that notion) whereby having loſt the gratuitals our
nature was at firſt crowned with, it is caſt into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſſ
<pb facs="tcp:57719:4"/>
for the Kingdom of Heaven. What learning
and abilities the Author may have, I doe not detract
from, only it's greatly to be lamented, that he ſhould
contrary to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others, take the Gold he
had in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and carry it into <hi>Egypt</hi> to build
an <hi>Idol</hi> there. He hath fully improved his <hi>liberty
of Propheſying,</hi> and waving reverence to the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Councils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> yea, and the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> in whoſe Obedience he doth
ſo glory in (as appeareth by the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Article,</hi> and the
Order of Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm</hi>) by a ſceptical

for ſo the denial of <hi>Original ſinne</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
been accounted. Neither let this <hi>Writer</hi>
think that his induſtrious affectation of words and
language, will make falſhood to be truth. There is
great difference between <hi>skin</hi> and <hi>bone, words</hi> and
<hi>arguments</hi> in any Theological Diſcourſe. Neither
are Tractates <hi>veriores quia diſertiores,</hi> there is

really or by colluſion, it is done ſo ſlightly, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
wholly according to the Popiſh Meridian;
and yet in ſome reſpects it is his great diſparagement,
that one of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould appear at leaſt in ſome
meaſure for an ancient Truth, while at the ſame time
one pretending to be of <hi>Sion</hi> ſhould oppoſe it. But
enough of this troubleſom matter.</p>
                  <p>I now come to acquaint the Reader with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
I propound in this Book, which is first to handle
the <hi>An ſit</hi> of Original Sinne; Secondly, The <hi>Quid
ſit;</hi> which done, I proceed to the <hi>two-fold Subject of
it,</hi> mentioned by the Learned; The <hi>Subject of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi>
And herein, I ſhew particularly and largely, how
<hi>every power of the Soul</hi> is infected by this Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;
which accompliſhed, I paſſe to the <hi>Subject of
Predication,</hi> ſhewing, That it is in every one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
born of a woman, That <hi>omnis homo,</hi> and
<hi>totus homo</hi> is thus corrupted; and then cloſe with
the conſideration of the <hi>Properties and Effects of
it.</hi> All which I have endeavoured to manage <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi>
as well as <hi>doctrinally,</hi> knowing the great and
excellent improvement in a ſpiritual way, that may be
made of this truth, as I experimentally found by the
attestation of godly hearers in the preaching thereof;
and I doubt not but if the Miniſters of Chriſt did
more largely inſist on this Point, they would finde
very good ſucceſs thereby, for the through Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their people, the information about Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb facs="tcp:57719:5"/>
and the Nature of it; it would awaken not
only the <hi>prophane,</hi> but the <hi>civil</hi> and externally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized
perſons. This would keep a man ſerious in
the wayes of God, attending to the treacherous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
within, and thereby avoid the temptation, to be
tranſported by curious and unneceſſary Queſtions; but
above all, this will prepare to <hi>exalt Chriſt in his
Mediatory Office.</hi> This will be the foundation

                        <p>ANd becauſe in Theological Debates two Queſtions are neceſſary, The <hi>An
ſit,</hi> and the <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> Whether there be ſuch a thing, and, What it is;
and in both theſe the truth of God meeteth with many adverſaries.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall firſt inſiſt on the <hi>Quod ſit, That there is ſuch a natural and curſed
pollution upon every one that is born in an ordinary way.</hi> The firſt Text I ſhall faſten
this Truth upon, is this I have mentioned, which deſervedly, both by Ancient
and Modern Writers is thought to have a pregnant and evident demonſtration,
That there is ſuch a natural contagion upon all.</p>
                        <p>To underſtand this the better, take notice of the <hi>Coherence</hi> briefly. The
Apoſtles ſcope is, to incite the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to Thankfulneſs, by the conſideration
of that great love and infinit mercy vouchſafed to them by God; and becauſe
the Sunne is moſt welcome out of a dark gloomy cloud, one contrary doth
more illuſtrate another. He compareth their preſent ſtate of Grace, with their
priſtine condition of miſery and wretchedneſs, which is ſummarily expreſſed,
<hi>That they were dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes,</hi> a farre more dreadfull eſtate, than if
they had been dead and rotting in their graves. This internal corruption is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
from a twofold external cauſe,</p>
                        <p>1. The courſe aud cuſtom of the world.</p>
                        <p>2. The power and efficacy of the Devil, the Prince of the power of the Air
working in them.</p>
                        <p>Now leſt this ſhould be thought true only of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> becauſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
he brings in himſelf alſo, and the <hi>Jews</hi> equal with them both in <hi>actual
ſinnes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. We all had our converſation in times paſt in luſts of the fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> is <hi>[We]</hi> that is, <hi>we all,</hi> as in the beginning of this verſe: For
ſeeing the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children, in which they ſo much boaſted, and
therefore are called <hi>Jews</hi> by nature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. and the natural branches, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 21. They might eaſily think, others indeed were by nature ſinfull, yet for
themſelves, they would think that glorious diſcent they had from <hi>Abraham</hi> might
be a priviledge to them, but here it is true, though <hi>Jews</hi> by nature, yet ſinners
by nature, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were.</p>
                        <p>2. There is the <hi>Predicate, Children of wrath,</hi>

and ſignifieth one wholly expoſed to wrath, as if wrath were the mother, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57719:18"/>
gave them their whole being. Thus the children of <hi>Belial,</hi> and the ſons of <hi>death</hi>
are often in Scripture. By <hi>wrath</hi> is meant <hi>Gods wrath;</hi> Now <hi>becauſe Gods wrath
is juſt, and doth alwayes preſuppoſe ſinne; Hence is inevitably deducted, That we
are alſo by Nature full of ſinne:</hi> So that though wrath be immediatly the miſery

Inſomuch that it is a manifeſt falſhood to ſay, the word never ſignifieth
that which we have by birth. And indeed, as is well obſerved by <hi>Zanchy,</hi> The

<hi>Children by nature of wrath;</hi> So that children by nature is oppoſite to children
by Cuſtom, Imitation, Adoption, or any other way. Thus the firſt exception
is removed.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>In the next place, The</hi> Socinian <hi>puts in his Caveat, after this manner,</hi>
That muſt be underſtood by the phraſe <hi>[Children of wrath by nature]</hi> which
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were now by the grace of God freed from; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks in
the time paſt, <hi>You were by nature children of wrath, but now are quickned by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57719:19"/>
the grace of God,</hi> therefore the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were now freed from that eſtate: But
according to the Doctrine of thoſe who maintain Original ſinne, that abideth
in every man, though regenerated, and is not aboliſhed but by death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this ſtone is eaſily removed: For although original ſinne abide in
the godly, yet the guilt of it is not imputed; So that though by nature we
were obnoxious to the wrath of God through its guilt, yet when grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
this guilt is taken away, ſo that though it be in us, yet it is not imputed
to us.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>Laſtly, They object,</hi> It muſt be underſtood of <hi>actual ſins,</hi> for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpoke of ſuch before, and to be a ſonne of a thing denoteth the quality
inherent in a man, as given to ſuch a way; ſo in the former verſe the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of diſobedience,</hi> that is, thoſe who voluntarily give themſelves to ſuch
rebellion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> But to this it is anſwered, That in the former expreſſion is not the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>: So that the Apoſtle doth here lay the Ax to the root of the Tree;
and becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> might be thought by the priviledges they enjoyed as ſoon
as born to excell the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> Therefore he demonſtrateth the Fountain and
Well-head of their iniquity, though ſecret and under-ground, as ſprings are
uſually very difficultly diſcovered.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, We will readily grant, That this expreſſion doth denote an habitual
inclination to all actual evil, and that the Apoſtle mentioneth it as the curſe and
bitter root of all the actual impieties that are committed in the world; ſo that
there is a reference to actual ſins, but in the cauſe of them, which is this original
pollution.</p>
                        <p>And thus much for vindication of this noble Text, we have endeavoured to
throw out all that earth, which the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> had caſt into this fountain, what
elſe may be objected, will in time be taken notice of. And from hence
obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That all men by nature are born full of ſinne, and ſo expoſed to Gods infinite
wrath and vengeance.</hi> Every Infant coming into the world is deſtitute of the
Image of God, and in a more dreadfull condition than the young ones of the
bruitiſh creatures, that are not expoſed to eternal torments; ſo that although
there may be joy that a man-child is born, yet much humiliation, becauſe a
child of wrath is born.</p>

how.</p>
                        <p>This original ſinne is a natural ſinne, not indeed as we had our nature at firſt

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>You muſt know that although Original ſinne be not a
Scripture-name, but called ſo firſt by</hi> Auſtin, <hi>forced thereunto by
the</hi> Pelagians, <hi>yet the truth of it is in the Scripture;</hi> And it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to uſe new words though not in Scripture, when the matter
is contained therein, to diſcover and diſtinguiſh Hereticks. Now we call it origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſin in a three-fold reſpect:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe we have it from our firſt parents fallen, who were the original
and fountain of all mankind.</hi> It's not an actual voluntary ſinne, immediatly and
perſonally committed by us, but it is in us antecedently to our own perſonal
will, both our mind and will comes into the world habitually darkned and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
againſt what is good.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Its original, Becauſe we have it as ſoon as we have our being.</hi> It's
bred in us, and can no more be taken from our natures in an ordinary way, than
mortality from our bodies: For although it be not the ſubſtance and eſſence of
a man, yet the Scripture calling it the <hi>old man,</hi> and <hi>our members,</hi> not in <hi>Illyricus</hi>
his ſenſe, doth thereby ſignifie the intimate inheſion of it in us, that it is in us, as it
were, leven in the whole lump, which ſoureth all; we have it in our being, which
made <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſay, <hi>Cujus ortus in vitio eſt,</hi> which <hi>Auſtin</hi> often mentioneth; yea,
we <hi>were conceived in it,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. And therefore another was not afraid to
ſay, we were <hi>damnati priuſquam nati,</hi> with <hi>Auſtin</hi> often it's called <hi>Damnata
radix, damnata maſſa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>It's called Original, Becauſe from this floweth all the actual evil in the
world;</hi> From this corrupt tree groweth all the corrupt fruit that is, as is to be
ſhewed; therefore the Scripture deſcribes original ſinne, though not as <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
actuale,</hi> yet <hi>actuoſum,</hi> not as an actual, but an active ſin. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.
it's made to be a forge, or ſhop from whence ſparks of luſts do continually riſe.
The heart of man is even like hell it ſelf, whoſe fire of luſt is unquenchable: So
our Saviour ſpeaks of a <hi>hard heart</hi> which is as an <hi>evil treaſure.</hi> Mat. 12. 35. There
is an evil treaſure in every mans heart, you may ſee all ſorts of wickedneſs come
from it, old and new ſins, and though he ſinne never ſo much, yet ſtill he can
ſinne more. This ſea of corruption will never be dried up in this life. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. complaineth of the activity and vigor of this ſinne in him, that it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſeducing, yea, captivating of him, although ſanctified in part; Inſomuch
that although a man be loathſom in reſpect of his actual impieties, yet much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57719:20"/>
more becauſe of the original fountain of evil within him; The greateſt part of
our wickedneſs is in our natural inclination and propenſity of ſpirit: Oh how
deep and piercing ſhould the thoughts of this depravation be within us, as we
are all over full of ſinne, ſo we ſhould be filled up with ſhame and confuſion of
face, we never go deep enough in our Humiliation and Confeſſion, till we come

                        <p>IN the ſecond place, <hi>It's good to take notice of the evident utility, and neceſſity
of being clearly and powerfully informed about this Subject.</hi> This truth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
and frequently to be preſſed, we are not to give it over, although it may
ſeem burdenſom and tedious unto you; The reaſons of the neceſſary diſcovery
of this are divers, ſome <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> and ſome <hi>Practical.</hi> As</p>
                        <p>1. If a man be erroneous or heretical in this, he cannot be orthodox, or
ſound in many other ſubſtantial parts of Religion; What <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Trinity, is true alſo in ſome meaſure concerning this; We may erre eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here, and dangerouſly alſo: eaſily, for ſuch is the ſelf-fulneſs, the ſelf-flattery
that is in every one, that he is difficultly perſwaded that he is thus undone and
miſerable; The light muſt ſhine as clear as at noon-day, yea the Spirit of God
muſt convince and ſet this home, elſe a man will never believe it, and then the
errour herein is dangerous, becauſe if this Pillar fall to the ground, almoſt the
whole edifice of Religion doth tumble down with it: As for inſtance, If a man
erre about original ſinne, denying it either in part or in whole, he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
hold <hi>Free-will,</hi> for this is the Cockatrice his egg, and the other is the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice
it ſelf; from a venemous womb muſt come a venemous brood; Take
away original ſinne, and then you eſtabliſh <hi>Free-will,</hi> then man hath the ſame
power to do good he had in Creation; There may be indeed ſome wounds and
debilitations upon him, but not a ſpiritual death; Then if Free-will be eſtabliſhed,
the grace of God, that is alſo evacuated, there is no abſolute neceſſity of it, its
only <hi>ad facilius operandum,</hi> as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, to make us work more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
and readily. Thus the very Sunne of Righteouſneſs is preſently taken out
of our Heavens. Furthermore, If we do not believe aright about original ſin,
we muſt alſo miſ-believe about Juſtification, that cannot be made ſuch a glorious
act of Gods grace, becauſe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs imputed unto us, as indeed
it is; Then we ſhall ſet up our <hi>Dagon</hi> againſt Gods Ark; neither will the work
of converſion be ſolely aſcribed to the power of Gods grace, as it ought to be,
for at the beſt they will make grace but an adjuvant cauſe, or a partial one with
our Free-will, and ſo the praiſe ſhall be given partly to our ſelves, and partly to
God. But above all, he that doth either deny, or diminiſh the guilt and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of this ſinne can never exalt Chriſt in all his Offices as he ought to do: He
that denieth the diſeaſe muſt needs derogate from the Phyſician, <hi>The whole need
not the Phyſician,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 12. And therefore it's of
great conſequence to be fully perſwaded about the depth, breadth and length of
this ſinne, that thereby we may be able to comprehend the dimenſions of Chriſts
love to us; Not that Chriſt came only to take away the guilt of original ſin, as
ſome Papiſts affirm, but becauſe this is the womb wherein all other ſins are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
This is the wound of the whole nature, actual ſins only infect the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a man; We may then eaſily ſee the neceſſity of being truly informed
about this Subject; for this is like miſcarriage in the firſt concoction, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be amended by that which followeth; And therefore this conſideration
ſhould quicken you up in a diligent attention to the whole Doctrine, which ſhall
be delivered about it.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>He that doth truly believe in this point, will quickly ſilence all thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
if not blaſphemous complaints that are uttered by many againſt nature,
becauſe (as they ſay) it is ſuch an hard ſtep-mother to mankind,</hi> Non tam editi
quum ejecti, <hi>ſaid the Heathen.</hi> I call them blaſphemous complaints, becauſe
what is ſpoken againſt Nature, redounds upon God the Author of Nature.
Hence in the Scripture, what Nature doth, God is ſaid to do. Now then, if
we conſider, what impatient expoſtulations the Heathens have made, why man
of all creatures ſhould be by Nature moſt miſerable? No true anſwer could ever
be given to ſatisfie, but this, becauſe man comes ſinfull into the world: The
young ones of beaſts and birds, are not ſo miſerable as our Infants, becauſe not
corrupted with evil in their Natures, as they are; So that if we ſee our very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
which yet (as the Scripture ſaith) cannot diſcern between the right
hand and left, and have not done actual good or evil, ſubject to grievous diſeaſes,
and death it ſelf: Wonder not at this, for they have in themſelves through their
native ſinfulneſs, a deſert not only of this pain, but eternal torments in hell.
Hence it is that the Scripture inſtructs us in that which all Philoſophy could never
inform us, <hi>viz.</hi> the cauſe and original of all thoſe diſeaſes and pains, yea of
death it ſelf, which reigneth over all mankind: Inſomuch that thereby we ſee,
though there were not one actual ſinne in the world, though all men had no
more ſinne upon them, then what they had in the womb, and in the cradle,
yet there was demerit enough of that vengeance of God, which upon mans
tranſgreſſion was threatned in the Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. The main cauſe, why God
brought that univerſal deluge upon the whole world, was not ſo much their
actual wickedneſs, as ſuch, but becauſe it came from a polluted fountain, which
would never be wholly cleanſed. Their hearts were ſo many ſhops, wherein were
conſtantly formed all manner of impieties; yea by this we ſee not only the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
upon man, but all the bondage an vanity that is upon the whole world:
That there are any barrenneſs, any famines, that the ground brings forth thorns
and thiſtles, that the woman brings forth with ſo much labour and forrow; all
theſe things come by original ſinne; God did not at firſt create things in ſuch
diſorder and confuſion: If therefore thou wouldſt quiet thy heart under all tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and vexing thoughts, to ſee the manifold miſchiefs and miſeries mankind is
ſubject unto; This <hi>Grave jugum ſuper filios Adam,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> often out of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus,</hi>
this heavy yoke upon the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> have recourſe to a ſerious
meditation about original ſin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The true knowledge of this natural defilement, will alſo ſatisfie us in
thoſe doubtfull Queſtions, which ſome have greatly tormented themſelves with, <hi>viz.</hi>
How ſinne comes to be in the world? And whence it is <hi>Auſtin</hi> (in his ſeventh
Book of his Confeſſions, and fifth Chapter) doth there bewail before God the great
agonies and troubles of mind he was in about the beginning of ſinne, whence it did
ariſe? For ſeeing every thing that God made was exceeding good, this exceedingly
puzzled him to know how evil ſhould be. <hi>Yea, this knot was ſo hard to unty in
ſome mens judgments, that it made many, of the</hi> Marcionites <hi>hereſie, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſaw men commit evil, as ſoon as they were born, and yet withall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convinced,</hi> That God was good, and could not be the beginning of evil; <hi>They
therefore maintained two principles of all things, the one</hi> good, <hi>of all good
things; The other</hi> evil, <hi>of evil things. Thus men have wonderfully plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves into boggs and quagmires of danger and deſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57719:21"/>
not acquainted with this main Truth of Original ſin.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>For want of knowledge herein, that main duty ſo much commended
both by Scripture, and the Heathens,</hi> viz. <hi>To know our ſelves, can never be put
in practice.</hi> The Heathen ſaid, <hi>è Coelo deſcendit,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. And as for the
Scripture, How often is it required, <hi>That we ſhould ſearch and try our hearts;
That we ſhould examine our ſelves, and commune with our own hearts, and be ſtill,
Pſal.</hi> 4. Now theſe duties can never be effectually done, without a firm belief of
that deſperate pollution which is in our heart; And till we acknowledge with
<hi>Jerem. 17. The heart is deceitfull above all things, and deſperately wicked, Who
can know it?</hi> Yea, we ſee <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19. 13. though a godly man, and much
enlightned thereby, being enabled to make deep ſearch into his ſoul, and having
the Sun beams, could diſcern thoſe atoms and motes of ſinne, which man in the
dark could not do, yet he crieth out, <hi>Who can underſtand his errors? Cleanſe
me from ſecret ſins,</hi> that is, ſuch ſins that lie latent and lurking in my heart, that
never yet I could find out. If then this duty be ſo great of knowing our ſelves,
that ſome make all Religion to be in theſe two things, The knowledge of our
ſelves, and of God; then how neceſſary is it, that we ſhould be thorowly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this heart, and nature-ſinfulneſs, for without this we can never
know how vile and loathſom we are? Our actual impieties, though never ſo
groſs and numerous, do not demonſtrate our loathſomneſs ſo much as this bitter
and ſour leven within; Theſe are the ſtream, that is the fountain; Theſe are the
effects, that is the cauſe; Therefore the greateſt ſtrength of our wickedneſs
lieth in a defiled Nature, as you ſee in a Serpent or Toad, that venom it ſends
forth at any time, is nothing to the venom in its nature; If you look upon a
<hi>Cain, a Judas,</hi> though his outſide be ſo deteſtable, yet his inwards are much
more abominable, ſo that a mans heart is like <hi>Peters</hi> great ſheet, which he ſaw
in a viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 6. which was full of four-footed beaſts, and wild beaſts,
and creeping things, all unclean; ſuch a receptacle is mans ſoul of all impiety:
A man cannot tell what is in the ſea, what monſters are in the bottom of it, by
looking upon the ſuperficies of the water which covers it, ſo neither canſt thou
tell all that horrid deformity and wretchedneſs which is in thy heart, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
thine outward impieties. Oh then that you would turn your eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as it were, an introverſion is neceſſary: Then you will ſay, O Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I knew the Nature of original ſinne, I was not perſwaded of my vileneſs,
of my foulneſs! Oh now I ſee that I am beyond all expreſſion ſinfull, now I ſee
every day I am more and more abominable! O Lord, formerly I thought all my
ſinne was in ſome words, in ſome actions, or in ſome vile thoughts, but now I
ſee, this was the leaſt part of all that evil that was in me; Now I am amazed,
aſtoniſhed to ſee what a ſea of corruption is within me, now I can never go to
the bottom, now I find ſomething like hell within me, ſparks of luſt that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Where there is not a true knowledge of this native corruption, there
our Humiliation, and Repentance can never be deep enough; for it's not enough to
be humbled for our actual ſinnes, unleſs alſo we go to the cauſe and root of all.</hi>
When a godly man would repent of his luſts, of his unbelief, or any other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
tranſgreſſion, he ſtayeth not in the confeſſion of, and bewailing thoſe
particular ſins, but he goeth to the polluted fountain, to the bitter ſpring,
from whence thoſe bitter ſtreams flow, and commonly this is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
an <hi>Ahabs</hi> Humiliation, and a <hi>Davids; Ahab</hi> humbleth himſelf only
for his actual impieties, and that becauſe of judgments threatned and impending
over him; but <hi>David,</hi> even when he heareth God had forgiven his iniquity, yet
hath great humiliation for his ſinnes; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. thinketh it not enough to
bewail his adultery and murder, but to confeſs, <hi>That in iniquity he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi>
his actual ſinnes carried him to the original. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57719:21"/>
when he miſerably complaineth of that impotency in him to do good, that he
could never do any good as perfectly, fully, purely and cheerfully, as he ought
to do, preſently he goeth to the cauſe of all this deordination, the Law of ſinne
within him, that original ſinne which was like a Law within him, commanding
him to think, to deſire, to do ſinfully, and obeyed it in all, though againſt his
will, inſomuch that he ſaith, <hi>He was carnal, and ſold under ſinne.</hi> This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
doth complain of, as the heavieſt burden of all; So that an unregenerate
man may by the light of nature, bewail and complain of his actual impieties, he
may cry out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am,</hi> for being ſuch a beaſt, ſuch a devil, ſo
exorbitant and exceſſive, but whether he can do this for the body of ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, that may juſtly be queſtioned; And therefore you ſee then
the troubles and workings of conſcience in ſome men to miſcarry greatly; They
ſeem to be in pain and travails of ſoul, but all cometh to nothing: Oh how many
in times of danger, and under fear of death, do ſadly cry out of ſuch ſins they
have committed! Oh the promiſes and reſolutions they make, if ever God give
them recovery again! But all this paſſeth away, even as mans life it ſelf, like a
vapour, like a tale, that is told: And one cauſe of the rottenneſs and defect of
this humiliation is, becauſe it did not go to the bottom of the ſoare; there was
the inward and deep corruption of original ſin that ſuch never took any notice
of, and ſo in all his ſorrow did omit that which is the moſt aggravating cauſe of
all grief and trembling: O Lord, I have not only done this wicked thing, but I
had an heart, an inclination of ſoul to carry me to it, and therefore actual ſinnes,
though ten thouſands of them, they paſs away, the guilt only remaining; but
this original pravity continueth in the pollution of it.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Ignorance of original ſinne makes us alſo miſtake in the crucifying and
mortifying of ſinne; No man can truly and ſpiritually leave a ſinne, unleſs he doth
conquer it and ſubdue it in ſome meaſure in the original and root of it;</hi> and this is a
ſure difference between a regenerate and unregenerate man about leaving or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of ſinne; They both may give over their wonted actual impieties; They
both may <hi>have eſcaped the pollution of the world, and that through the knowledge
of the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. but the one leaveth only the acts of ſinne, the other
mortifieth it gradually, though not totally in the cauſe and inclination of the
ſoul. Thus <hi>Paul.</hi> Rom. 7. though he complain of thoſe actual ſtirrings, and
impetuous motions of ſinne, yet withall he can truly ſay, <hi>I delight in the Law
of God, in the inner man.</hi> Now no hypocrite, or unregenerate man can ſay ſo;
Though he be outwardly waſhed, yet he hath a ſwiniſh nature ſtill, his inward
parts are as loathſom, as noiſom as ever before: Though there be a fair skinne
drawn over the wound, yet in the bottom there is as much corruption, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction,
as ever before: <hi>Samſon</hi>'s hair is only cut, it's not plucked up by the
root, ſo that it's not enough to have given over thy former profaneneſs; Thou
thankeſt God thou art not the man once thou wert: Oh but conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinne in the root of it, as well as in the branches of it, doth wither and die
daily. A diſeaſe is not cured, till the cauſe of it be in ſome meaſure at leaſt remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
As long as originall ſinne is not in ſome degree mortified, thy old ſins, or
ſome other will break out as violently as ever, here is the fountain and root of all
within thee.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>He that is ignorant of the nature, and extent of this natural defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he muſt needs groſly miſtake about the nature of converſion, and be wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what regeneration is;</hi> As you ſee in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> John. 3. 6. though a
maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet groſly miſtaking about a new-birth, and what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it? That appeareth by our Saviours argument to prove the neceſſity of it,
<hi>Whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> implying by this, That if <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had
known, that by natural generation he was nothing but fleſh, that is, ſinne and
evil, his ſoul, his mind, his conſcience, all was fleſh in this ſenſe, as well as his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57719:22"/>
body, then he would quickly have diſcerned the neceſſity of being born again,
then he would not have continued a day, an hour, a moment in ſuch a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
condition. And what is the cauſe that moſt people are ſtill ſuch ſots and
ſenſleſs men about regeneration? Yea, learned and knowing men are as blind
and bruitiſh in this, as the ſimple and poor people are, doth not all ariſe from
this? That they feel not, neither do perceive that original ſin like a leproſie hath
run over the whole man, both ſoul and body, eſpecially there would not be theſe
three miſtakes about the work of grace, which are very common; As</p>
                        <p>1. A Philoſophical Reformation,<note place="margin">Three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſtakes about the work of Grace.</note> by the Dictates and Principles of Moraliſts,
ſuch as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> give, would not be taken for Regeneration: For
although their ſayings and directions are admired, and there may be ſome good
uſe of them, yet they do not go to the root of the matter, they are not an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
againſt original ſinne that defileth the nature, and therefore cannot promote
Regeneration, which doth properly cure that in ſome degree. <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> way
to make a man a virtuous man, <hi>viz.</hi> by frequent and conſtant actions, at leſt to
acquire an habit is abſurd and repugnant to Scripture, for by that, the tree muſt
be made good, and a man muſt be born again, ere he can do any thing holily. Hence
God promiſeth to give a new heart, to take away the heart of ſtone, and then
to cauſe us to walk in all holineſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19. Theſe divine principles muſt be
infuſed before there can be holy actions. So</p>
                        <p>2. Civility and an ingenuous temperate diſpoſition, will be but a gliſtering
dunghill, a painted ſepulchre, when original ſinne is known: He will preſently
ſee, for all his civil and inoffenſive life, his heart is full of all noiſomneſs; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
civil men of all men do moſt need this light to ſhine into their breſts; we are
ready to think of our ſelves, becauſe ſo harmleſs and innocent, as was ſaid of
<hi>Bonaventure, In hoc homine non peccavit Adam.</hi> ſuch were born without ſinne,
and brought better natures into the world than others; but if you ſearch into
the Scriptures, it will appear that all are born children of wrath, and are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtitute of that image of God, and then, as when the pillars of an houſe are
removed, the houſe it ſelf muſt fall into its own rubbidge. Thus when that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
righteouſneſs was loſt, man is prone to runne into all evil, and every man
would be like a <hi>Judas,</hi> or a <hi>Cain,</hi> even the moſt civil man that is, did not God
reſtrain original ſin.</p>
                        <p>3. Gifts and abilities which many have in religious exerciſes, will preſently be
ſeen not to be Regeneration. Though we ſhould preach with the tongue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
though admirable in prayer, and other holy duties, yet theſe and original
ſin in the power of it may ſtand together, and ſo many looking to the flowers,
but not the dead corpſe they are upon, conclude themſelves to be alive, when
indeed they are dead.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="4" type="section">
                        <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                        <p>I Shall mention ſome few more ſpiritual Advantages, that come by the full and
undoubted perſwaſion of this original corruption; for ſo of old we are adviſed,
<hi>Firmiſſimè texe, &amp; nullatenus dubita,</hi> &amp;c. Believe moſt firmly, and doubt not
in the leaſt manner, but that by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, all his poſterity becomes ſinfull
and obnoxious to Gods wrath. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>upon the Knowledg of originall ſinne we evidently ſee, our impoſſibility to
keep the Law of God.</hi> That when the Law requireth a love of God, with all our
heart, mind and ſtrength; and alſo doth prohibit all kind of luſt, and ſinfull
concupiſcence, even in the very firſt motions and ſtirrings of it. The Law (I
ſay) requiring ſuch univerſal perfection, and we being wholly dead in ſinne,
upon the comparing of the Law, with our condition, we cannot but conclude,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57719:22"/>
That we fail in all things, That the Law is ſpiritual, but we are carnal; And if
he be <hi>curſed that doth not continue in all things the Law requireth,</hi> how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
muſt he be that is not able to perform any one thing? All thoſe opinions
that diminiſh original ſinne, do alſo plead for a poſſibility of keeping Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
Now this ſelf-flattery is imbred in all. Do not moſt of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people think they keep the Commandments of God? Do they believe that
the curſes of the Law do belong to them every hour? Oh if ſuch convictions were
upon them, how greatly would it humble them, and make them debaſed before
God, but they truſt in this, they readily and confidently ſay with that young
man. <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth up,</hi> Mat. 9 20. Oh then inform
thy ſelf more about this natural defilement and loathſomneſs that is upon
thee, and then thou wilt find the Law to accuſe and condemn thee in all
things.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>The right knowledge of this will make even the godly and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
though in ſome meaſure delivered from the power and dominion of it,
yet to ſee, that becauſe of its ſtirrings and actings in them, there is imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
in every thing they do.</hi> And truly, this is one of the moſt profitable
effects of true knowledge herein, for hereby a godly man is made to go out of
all his graces, and his duties, hereby he is afraid of the iniquity of his holy things,
and cals his very righteouſneſs <hi>a menſtruous ragge.</hi> This is clear in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.
How ſadly doth he complain of the vigorous actings of this original ſinne in him;
For the preſent I take it as granted, that that part of the Chapter muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of a regenerate perſon (though vehemently denied by ſome) as is in time
to be ſhewed. That Law of ſinne was alwayes moving, when he ſet himſelf to
any thing that was holy, he deſired to obey the Law perfectly, to love God
compleatly, but this Law of ſinne would not let him: So that, becauſe of this
natural defilement, evil is mixed with all the good we do, inſomuch that there
would be a woe, and a curſe to all our gracious acts, if ſtrictly examined. Thus
it is with a godly man in this life, as thoſe <hi>Hetruſcan</hi>-robbers reported of by
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and mentioned by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who would take ſome live men, and bind
them to the dead men, which was a miſerable way of periſhing: Even thus it is
here, original corruption is conſtantly adhering, and inſeparably to him, who
is alive in holineſs, and by this means, there is unbelief in his faith, coldneſs in
his zeal, dulneſs in his fervency; Inſomuch that the Apoſtle crieth out of himſelf,
<hi>Oh wretched man that I am!</hi> And that becauſe of this very thing, the Papiſts,
though they hold original ſinne, yet maintaining, That after Baptiſm it's quite
taken away, and that though there be ſome languor and difficulty in a man, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of what is good, yet if we do not conſent to theſe motions of luſts within
us, they are not truly and properly ſins, do conſequentially conclude, that there
is not neceſſarily droſs and ſinne in every holy duty we do, but the evidence of
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. is too great to be contradicted. So that preaching of original ſinne is
not only neceſſary to the unregenerate, but even to the moſt holy and godlieſt
man that liveth; Let him deſire to know more of it, for it may do him alſo much
good, and this is the reaſon, why the more godly any are, the more they are
diſpleaſed with themſelves, and do the more highly eſteem of Chriſt, not but
that they grow in grace, only they grow alſo in the diſcoveries of more filth and
unworthineſs in themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>By the true knowledge of this we come to be acquainted with that
combate and conflict, that is between the fleſh and the ſpirit, ſo much ſpoken of
by Divines,</hi> who uſually ſay, <hi>In every godly man there are two men,</hi> two I's, as
the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) diſtinguiſheth, <hi>I Paul carnal, ſold under ſinne, doing
the things, I would not, and I Paul ſpiritual, delighting in the Law of God
in the inwardman, and thanking God the Father through Chriſt, becauſe freed
from condemnation;</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſpeak of this combate, while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57719:23"/>
as a Legaliſt, as ſome ſay, but as truly converted, will appear, if we
conſider, that in another place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of all the godly,
as thus exerciſed, <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the
fleſh;</hi> So that whatſoever is done holily and godlily, it is alwayes <hi>cum luctâ car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
and therefore grace is the mortifying of the fleſh: Now our ſins will not
be put to death, without ſome pain and reluctancy to the carnal part. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is a perpetual concomitant of every godly man, he hath a combate and
ſpiritual conflicting within him, and this makes him often in ſo many agonies,
this makes him ſo earneſtly watching and praying againſt all temptations; now
come we to natural people, they feel not the leaſt ſtrugling within them, all is
quiet, and at eaſe, becauſe they are wholly in their original ſinne, they were born
in; And this makes it plain likewiſe, that all their praying, hearing, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
duties they ever performed, were never done in an holy and godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
becauſe there was no reluctancy, or inward combate, but they did them in
a cuſtomary, formal way, without any ſpiritual life or motion, for fleſh will
not fight againſt fleſh. Indeed there is a combate between conſcience in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and corruption, even in ſome unregenerate men, as in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
man, as diſtinguiſhed from his intemperate, and that is known, of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
video meliora, proboque, deteriora ſequor,</hi> I ſee and approve better things, but
follow the worſe: And ſome would have <hi>Paul</hi>'s combate to be no other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cals it, <hi>The Law of his mind, fighting with the Law in his members,</hi> but
that is not cogent, as is more largely to be ſhewed in its time. Though therefore
there be a reluctancy in ſome unregenerate men, yet that is not like the conflict
in the godly, becauſe amongſt other differences, this is one principal. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man being regenerated in every part of the ſoul, though not perfectly, his will
is ſanctified as well as his mind: Hence the combate and oppoſition in a godly
man, is between the ſame faculty ſanctified, and the fleſh ſtill abiding in that part,
his holy will againſt his corrupt will; ſo that not only his mind and conſcience
is againſt ſinne, but his will alſo, ſo farre as ſanctified: Hence the ſame Apoſtle
makes the oppoſition between will and will, <hi>What I would not, that I do, and
though captivated by luſt, yet at that very time, delighting in the Law of God,
in the inward man;</hi> whereas in unregenerate men, they have only an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between their conſcience, and their heart. The mind ſuggeſts one thing,
but the will and affections wholly incline another way; Therefore that light
in their conſciences is a trouble and vexation to them, they do all they can to
extinguiſh it.</p>
                        <p>The Doctrine then of original corruption, informing us. That it abideth ſtill
in a man, while he liveth upon the earth, doth inform the truly godly, that they
muſt alwayes expect agonies and conflicts within, like fire and water met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo will grace and corruption be; Therefore by this very combat, we may
diſcern true grace, and it's counterfeit; for preſumption, which would be
thought faith, is eaſie, we find no oppoſition to it, but faith is put forth with
much difficulty; ſo godly ſorrow put forth upon pure and ſpiritual motives, is
greatly aſſaulted by the fleſh within us, but worldly ſorrow or mourning, though

from a propenſity within, from a love to our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Hence laſtly, <hi>The main and principal effect of the true knowledge of our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
defilement, is to bring the ſoul humbled and burdened under it, to a true
and real eſteem of Chriſt, and his Grace.</hi> So much as we take off from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne, making it either no ſinne, or the leaſt ſinne, or quite aboliſhed after
Baptiſm, ſo much do we take off from the grace of God in Chriſt. Hence the
Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. when he maketh that famous oppoſition between the firſt
<hi>Adam</hi> and the ſecond, the gift of grace by one, and the condemnation by the
other, he pitcheth upon that firſt diſobedience, by which we are made ſinners,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57719:23"/>
as the original of all that calamity we are plunged into; and therefore the ſame
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he poured out a large complaint about this Law of ſinne working
in him, at the cloſe of all he runneth to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 35. It is the true
knowledge of this only, that will make us ſee the neceſſity of Chriſt all the day
long, and in every duty, in every performance; As we have none ſpeak ſo much
of Grace and Chriſt, as <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo none ſpeaks ſo largely and fully about original
ſinne. In the fifth Chapter of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he aſſerts the Doctrine of it; and
in the ſeventh Chapter, he declares the power of it, which he felt experimentally
in himſelf, though regenerated: Do not then think this is a Philoſophical diſpute,
or that to erre in this is like erring in thoſe points, wherein one Chriſtian is to
bear with another; but with <hi>Auſtin</hi> account it a fundamental, and that to deny
it, is to overthrow that Law whereby we are Chriſtians.</p>

being: Even as we call death natural, becauſe it followeth all mankind;
Rich men die, and poor men die; learned men die, and fooliſh; None are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from it: Thus alſo it is with this ſinne, All that are born in a natural
way of mankind have this contagion. The ſonnes of Noblemen and Princes,
though they glory in their blood and their deſcent, yet they are as full of ſin, and
the children of wrath, as well as the children of the baſeſt; ſo that though in
civil reſpects they boaſt of their birth, and are above others, yet in a theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and divine reſpect, all are alike; yea the children of godly parents, though
they have a promiſe to their ſeed, and in that reſpect their children are ſaid to be
holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. yet they come into the world with inherent corruption in them; They
do not generate their children, as godly men, but corrupt men, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
it, A circumciſed man begat a child uncircumciſed, and the Husbandman,
though he ſoweth his ſeed out of the chaff and husk, yet that brings up others

it doth extend to the whole humane Nature, as it is in every one that parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of it in a natural way. So that as Divines do diſtinguiſh of infirmities and
evils; There are ſome that are ſpecifical, which follow the <hi>Species,</hi> as death;
and ſome are accidental, which follow the individual nature: Thus there are ſome
ſinnes, which follow the particular nature of a man, and theſe are actual ſinnes.
Every man is not a drunkard, an adulterer, but ſome are defiled one way, ſome
another; but then there is a ſinne, which followeth the whole and univerſal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                           </gap>ſe, <hi>not</hi> per accidens. This is a great part of that definition,
which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> giveth of Nature, now we may in a moral ſenſe apply it to our
purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, I ſay, <hi>It's the inward principle of all the ſinfull motions, and workings
of the Soul.</hi> For as the nature of the ſtone is the cauſe of its motion downward,
as the nature of the fire is the cauſe of the fires motions and operations: Thus
is original ſinne the intrinſecal cauſe, and root of all the actual evil we are guilty
of. It is farre from me to juſtifie <hi>Flacius</hi> his diſcourſe or opinion of original ſin,
making it the natural ſubſtance of a man, and not an accident, though he ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57719:24"/>
expreſſeth himſelf, that ſome think its his Logical and Metaphyſical errour, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Theological: Only that which I aim at, is to ſhew, That this birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinne,
is naturally ours, becauſe from it doth flow all the ſinnefull and
evil operations of the whole man; So that we may ſay, as it is natural to the
ſtone to deſcend, to the ſparks to flie upwards, ſo it is natural to man to think
evil, to ſpeak evil, and to do evil. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth (<hi>Lib. 2. Ethic. cap.</hi> 1.)
this, as one property of things by nature, that there the principles are before the
actions; A man hath the power to ſee, or hear before he can actually do either,
but in moral things, the actions are before the habits. As it is natural to the Toad
to vent poiſon, and not honey; ſo when a man ſinneth, it's from his own, it's
natural to him, but when inabled to do any thing that is good, this is wholly of
grace: Now, I ſay, It's an inward principle of all ſinne within us, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
it from external cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the devil or wicked men, who ſometimes may
tempt and cauſe to ſinne; Therefore the devil is called <hi>The tempter,</hi> Mat. 4. 3.
Inſomuch that it is made a Queſtion, Whether there be any ſinne a man commits,
that the Devil hath not tempted unto, but that I attend not to at this time: This
is enough, that the Devil is but an outward cauſe of ſinne, and therefore were
there not that original filth in us, his ſparks could never kindle a fire, he cannot
compell or force to ſinne; In ſomuch that whatſoever ſinne we do commit, we
are not to lay the fault principally upon the Devil, but our own corrupt hearts:
Though <hi>Ananias lied againſt the holy Ghoſt, becauſe the Devil had filled his
heart;</hi> And <hi>Judas betrayed Chriſt, becauſe Satan had entred into his heart,</hi> yet
the devil could not have come into their hearts, had they not been of uncleane
and corrupt Conſtitutions: before it was an evil heart, and therefore the devil
took poſſeſſion of it. The Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> cap. 1. 14. doth notably diſcover the
true cauſe, and natural fountain of all the evil committed by us, and that is, <hi>The
luſt and concupiſcence, that is within us,</hi> he ſaith, We muſt not charge God with
our ſinnes, as if he were to be blamed, becauſe we are not kept from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
neither doth he bid us, Charge it upon the Devil, though he doth tempt
us, but upon our own corrupt luſt within. Thus then you ſee, that as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
of thoſe, who are in Chriſt, <hi>They no longer live, but Chriſt within them,</hi> Gal.
2. 20. So we may on the contrary affirm of every man by nature, that he doth
not ſo much live, as ſinne within him; for when our phyſical nature cauſeth us to
think, or ſpeak, or do, then alſo ſinne like our moral nature, doth make us
think, and ſpeak ſinfully: Even as the lame horſe can never move himſelf to go,
but he halteth in that motion. Surely, this conſideration ſhould make all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
mourn in ſackcloth, and roll it ſelf in aſhes: What ſhould a man
do in his whole life, but as <hi>Anſelm</hi> ſaid, to deplore his whole life, <hi>in totâ
vitâ totam vitam deplorare,</hi> for he cannot move, or ſtirre, or do any thing, but
he ſinneth; If he cateth, if he drinketh, if he worketh, yea, if he prayeth, in
all theſe he ſinneth, as is more to be ſhewed. We ſee then, that becauſe this
original ſinne is by way of a principle within us of all our irregular motions;
Therefore though there were no Devil to tempt, no examples for men to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
yet their corrupt nature within would carry them to it; Did not <hi>Cain</hi>
murder <hi>Abel,</hi> when there had been no ſuch ſinne in the world before? We
many times wonder how children, yea and ſometimes grown men ſhould commit
ſuch ſinnes, that they could not ſee practiſed before their eyes; but we need not
wonder, when we conſider what a ſhop of all impieties every mans heart by
nature is. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the uprightneſs God made man in, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
7. 29. he inſtanceth in the effects of original ſin, as oppoſite to that uprightneſs,
that it makes a man ſeek out many ſinfull inventions, he doth not only ſin by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but invention.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is added in the definition, That nature is the principle of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>perſe,</hi> and not <hi>per accidens:</hi> If a man move a Bowl, and make it runne, it's
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57719:25"/>
not a natural motion, becauſe the principle is from without, and it's by accident;
yea thoſe <hi>automata,</hi> thoſe artificial inſtruments, which ſome have made, that
move themſelves, yet that is not a natural motion, becauſe the principle is not in
them <hi>perſe,</hi> but by accident. Now this property is very applicable to man; for
when he ſinneth, it's not by accident, or from unexpected occaſion, but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and from himſelf; Therefore to do as a man, to walk as a man, denoteth
ſinfulneſs, in the Scripture phraſe, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 1. When there are envyings, ſtrifes
amongst you, Do ye not walk as men?</hi> Obſerve that, <hi>To walk as a man,</hi> is to do
a thing ſinfully, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5. when the Apoſtle in his reaſoning made a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God being unrighteous, if he took vengeance, addeth <hi>[I ſpeak as a man]</hi>
Theſe inſtances declare, that to do a thing as a man, is to do it ſinfully, as he
ſaid, <hi>Humanum eſt errare.</hi> Thus when Chriſt would expreſs the naturality of the
Devils wickedneſs, he ſaith, <hi>He ſinneth of his own</hi> (John 8. 44) when he
ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own: So when thou art proud, worldly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing,
thou doeſt this of thy own; You wonder that ſome have lies ſo ready
at hand to excuſe iniquity, even young children, they are like the Devil in this,
they do it of their own, ſo that ſinne only we can call our own; our wealth is
not our own, our lives are not our own, theſe we have from God, but that
propenſity to ſinne is our own, it ariſeth from our ſelves, as from the rotten
tree come thoſe worms that conſume it: Oh what deep humiliation ſhould this
cauſe in thee! Thou haſt nothing thou canſt call thy own but ſinne; That which
God only hateth and loatheth, that is only thine; he looketh on thee, and ſeeth
thy ſoul, that he gave thee; he ſeeth thy body, that is his workmanſhip alſo,
but then he beholdeth the pravity and ſinfull diſpoſition in thee, and this is none
of his. It was not of God, but it came through <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience; ſo that
when we ſinne, we then doing it of our own, it is no wonder that when there is
no Devil to tempt, no example to imitate, yet men can readily commit any
ſinne.</p>

if it be alwayes and conſtantly ſo. The Poets ſaying, <hi>Naturam expellas,</hi> &amp;c.
Though you uſe all art, or violence, to barre out nature, yet that will recurre,
it will recurre again; Though you violently ſmother, and keep down the flames,
yet no ſooner have they paſſage, but they will aſcend, becauſe what Nature
doth, it's conſtant and invariable in, and this is too true in reſpect of this original
ſinne, it doth conſtantly and certainly work in us, even as often as our ſoul
doth put forth any vital actings at all. Thoſe things that are by accident, they
ſeldom fall out, but what is by nature is frequent, you may know the Sunne will
riſe again, though it be night, till God put a period to the courſe of nature: And
thus it is concerning man, as ſoon as ever he is born, you may conclude this child,
as ſoon as ever he can think, he can underſtand, or will, as ſoon as he can love,
or be angry, he will do them all ſinfully; Even as when ye ſee a young Serpent,
you may certainly conclude, this will poiſon as ſoon as ever it can ſting, and the
reaſon is, becauſe it's a conſtant pollution of the ſoul, and therefore it is in every
thing the unregenerate man doth, <hi>Gen. 6. 5. The imagination of the thoughts
of a mans heart is only evil, and that continually;</hi> it's continually, becauſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

To have this flux of blood, that no act or humane skill can ſtop? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith,

higheſt actings of the groſſeſt impieties that can be.</hi> As they ſay, Nature
doth act alwayes to the higheſt it can. Thus it's true in reſpect of this natural
corruption, it doth incline every man to be as vile, and as enormous as any are;
For although this original corruption doth not deprive him of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and will, making of him an irrational beaſt, yet it doth ſo captivate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall
the whole man; That though to underſtand and to will be of nature, yet
this underſtanding and willing in a ſinfull manner will alwayes be, becauſe it's
corrupted nature; and therefore it would hurry every man even as the Devil did
the Swine into the ſea of perdition: Every one would be a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> if his
corrupt nature were left to it ſelf, and if you ask, Why then are not all men
turned into ſo many beaſts and Devils? Why is not the whole world in conſuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
How comes there to be any civility or morality? Why is not every place
like an hell, if all men are thus vile by nature? It's anſwered, God hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
and reſtraining grace; If this later may be called Grace: Now thoſe
that God reformeth, and inwardly ſanctifieth; They are made to delight in the
Law of God; They have the fear of God put into their hearts, and ſo they keep
from ſinne out of love to God; but then there are others, and God layeth a
reſtraint upon them, he puts a bridle in their mouths: So that although they
have an inſatiable appetite to ſinne, and do not put forth the whole abundance
of that evil, which is within them, yet they have a principle inclining thereunto,
only God ſtops them; as he did <hi>Balaam,</hi> whoſe heart was deſirous to curſe the
people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though he was reſtrained from it; As it is with the ſea, by its
own natural motion, it would overthrow the whole world, but that God hath
put his bounds to it, ſaying, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go and no further.</hi> Thus God
hath a ſupreme dominion even over the ſinfull heart of man, ſo that it cannot
ſinne, when and how, and as much as it liſteth, but it's under the providence
of God, <hi>Cui nihil eſt malum,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, becauſe he can turn it unto good.
But all this is no thanks or praiſe to man; Say then with thy ſelf, If I <hi>runne not
into the ſame exceſs of riot with others;</hi> If I be not ſo abominable and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
as many others are; It's not becauſe I have a better nature, or come leſs
polluted with original ſin into the world, but becauſe God puts limits to me, for
as you ſee in the little Acorn is contained all the huge branches and boughes,
which by length of time, it groweth up into. Thus let man alone, let him have
opportunities to ſinne, let not God reſtrain him, and you will quickly ſee him to
be an incarnated Devil, and the reaſon is, becauſe this evil being natural, and
withall the ſeed of all evil, therefore he would be hurried on to the committing
of it: Even as <hi>Adam</hi> had in the image of God, the ſeminals of every godly acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo that none could ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> had not a power to do ſuch and ſuch a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
work. Thus it is with original corruption ſucceeding in the room thereof, it
naturally defiles all over, and ſo hath a womb, as the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 1. 14.

the exerciſe of ſome groſs impieties are ſubject to our power in ſome meaſure, a
man is not in this ſenſe neceſſarily a drunkard, or an adulterer; but when we
ſpeak of this inward filthineſs, it's ſo natural, that it's neceſſary: Neither the
being of it, or the immediate motions of it are ſubject to our reaſon and will,
but they are in us antecedently to our own conſent; and this conſideration doth
greatly aggravate our guilt, for we are not only habitually and actually, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
ſinfull, but naturally and neceſſarily ſo. Now as it is the great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Gods holineſs, that he is not only actually holy, but naturally, yet vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily:
So it muſt be our great condemnation, that we are not only actually
and voluntarily ſinfull, but even naturally and neceſſarily, yet this neceſſity taketh
not off from voluntarineſs, and delight in ſin.</p>
                        <p>It's Ivy twiſted about, and eaten into our Nature, whether we will or no;
So that it is ours, not becauſe we will it, and make it ours by conſent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it's inherently in us before the leaſt deliberate actings of the ſoul: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that as <hi>Suarez</hi> well obſerveth, If a man grown up in years ſhould by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal,
formal, and explicit conſent agree to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, yet that would only
be a perſonal ſinne in him, it would not make <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne his; And the reaſon
is, becauſe this ſinne doth now deſcend upon us by natural propagation, not by
voluntary agreement, yet this neceſſity of it doth not at all abate from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and pleaſure that we find in the actings thereof: Neither is it ſuch a natural
neceſſity, as hunger or thirſt, which are not culpable, becauſe they are not
contrary to the Law of God, neither were at firſt contracted by <hi>Adam</hi>'s free
choice, but are a neceſſary concomitant of mans conſtitution in an animal life,
whereas this neceſſity is the iſſue of <hi>Adam</hi>'s free-will, and is ſubjectively in our
will, whereby a man is carried out at the ſame time to ſinne, both neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and yet voluntarily, and ſo agreeth rather with thoſe who have contracted
an habit of ſinne, who ſinne in ſome reſpect neceſſarily, as the Prophet expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it, <hi>Jer. 13. 23. Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the Leopard his ſpots?
then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>

                        <p>WE proceed to further diſcoveries of this Truth, <hi>viz. The Naturality of
this evil:</hi> And that</p>
                        <p>In the ſixth place will further appear, <hi>In that it is more near to us, than any
actual or habitual ſinne; That it is nearer than any actual ſinne, is plain, Becauſe
that is tranſient, and abideth not in us.</hi> But for habitual ſinne, that is conſtantly
fixed in us, when once ſetled there. Now it may be thought, that original ſinne
cannot ſtick cloſer than that, an habit being a kind of ſecond nature: Inſomuch
that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes ſuch who have acquired habits of ſinne, to ſinne neceſſarily,
and that there is not ſo much voluntarineſs in their offences, as in other faults.
But now original ſinne is more naturally and intimately in us, than theſe acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
habits of ſinne, for we are not made thus originally filthy by frequent
actings of ſinne, but we are born and bred ſo, ſo that whereas habits of ſinne,
as drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the product of many actions; Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and often ſinning begets ſuch an habit that cannot be left off. This original
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57719:26"/>
ſinne is the cauſe of ſinful actions, not the effect of it: Becauſe we are thus ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and polluted by nature, therefore all our actions are likewiſe ſo polluted. Now
then if the Scripture make it ſuch an impoſſible thing for a man accuſtomed only
to evil to become a changed man, that impoſſibility lieth upon a man, who is
naturally ſo; For though cuſtom be called a ſecond Nature, yet certainly the
firſt Nature is more implanted, and ſo more active in a man. This particular
therefore may greatly humble a man, in that ſinne is ſo deeply rooted in him, it's
worſe than an habit or cuſtom of ſinning; It goeth as neer to thy very eſſence
and ſubſtance, as it can do, and yet not be thy ſubſtance; Therefore the Scripture
cals it, <hi>Fleſh and blood, The members of a man, The Law of ſinne in his fleſh.</hi> If
a man hath a thorn in his fleſh, how reſtleſs and pained is he? <hi>Paul</hi> compared
that heavy temptation, he grapled with, to a <hi>Thorn in the fleſh;</hi> but although by
nature, we have this thorn, not only in our ſides, but even all over the whole
man, yet we can lie down in eaſe, and live in pleaſure, as if nothing ailed us; but
this is one deadly effect of original ſinne, that it takes away all ſenſe and feeling,
whether there be any ſuch thing or no. Oh then, let the thoughts of this ſinne
go as deep into thee, as the ſinne it ſelf! Sinne is got into thy heart, let ſorrow
get thither; Sinne hath entred into thy bowels, and filled the whole man brimme
full (as we ſay;) Oh let ſhame and holy confuſion be as deep, and as complete
in thee!</p>

                        <p>SEventhly, This naturality will appear, <hi>If we conſider that original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
which God created man in:</hi> For our original ſinne comes in the place
thereof, and ſuch a perfection as that was to the ſoul, ſuch a defect is this to us.
Now the Orthodox do maintain againſt Papiſts, <hi>That that original righteouſneſs
was not a ſupernatural perfection ſuperadded to mans nature, but a due and
natural perfection concreated with him; For as</hi> Adam <hi>being made to glorifie
God, was thereby to have a rational ſoul, ſo alſo ſuch perfection in that ſoul,
which might make him capable of his end, otherwiſe man would have been
created in a more imperfect and ignoble condition than any creature.</hi> It is true
indeed, That Righteouſneſs and Holineſs <hi>Adam</hi> had, which the Scripture cals
<hi>Gods Image,</hi> did not flow from the principles of nature, neither was it a natural
conſequent thereof; but yet it was a moral condition or perfection due to <hi>Adam,</hi>
ſuppoſing God created him to ſuch an end; and therefore we are not to conceive
of that Image of God, as an infuſed habit or habits which were to rectifie and
guide the natural faculties and affections of the ſoul, which otherwiſe would
move in repugnancy and contrariety to one another, but as a natural rectitude,
and innate ability of thoſe powers and affections of the ſoul to move regularly
and ſubordinately to Gods will: Though therefore in reſpect of God, that
Righteouſneſs <hi>Adam</hi> had might be called ſupernatural, becauſe it was his gift, yet
in reſpect of man, the ſubject, ſo it was connatural, and a ſuitable perfection to
his nature. This being taken for a ſure Truth, then it will exceedingly help us to
the true underſtanding of the naturality of this evil, for original ſinne ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſtead thereof, is not (as ſome Papiſts affirm) like the taking of cloaths
from a man, and ſo leaving him naked; or like the taking away of a bridle from
an horſe, all which are ſuperadded, and external helps, as it were; but it's like
death that takes away the life of a man, in reſpect of what is holy and godly,
and like an heavy diſeaſe that doth much hinder and debilitate even the natural
operations. This original ſinne then is like the ſpoiling of an inſtrument of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
or the deordination of a Clock or Watch, when not able to perform their
proper ſervice they were made for: So that original ſinne is partly the want of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57719:27"/>
this original Righteouſneſs that was ſo connatural, and partly thereby a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
and inclination to all evil; For as when the harmony of the humours is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
preſently diſeaſes ariſe in the body: Thus when that admirable rectitude,
which was at firſt in the whole man, was broken, then all inordinacy, all perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and crookedneſs preſently began to poſſeſs the whole man: As then original
Righteouſneſs was not as an infuſed habit, but the faculties of the ſoul duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
whereby they did regularly move in their ſeveral wayes; ſo original ſin
is not to be conceived, like ſome acquired habit, polluting the powers of the
ſoul, but as the internal defect and imperfection that is cleaving to them; Even
as the paralitical hand whenſoever it moveth, doth it with feebleneſs and trembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wanting ſome ſtrength within: If therefore we would truly judge of the
horrible nature of this ſinne, we muſt throughly underſtand the excellency and
wonderful nature of that original Righteouſneſs which is now loſt, then all things
in the ſoul were in an admirable ſubordination to that which is holy; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the ſenſitive appetite, was then carried out to ſome ſenſible object, yet
it was with a ſubordination to the underſtanding; ſo that in that ſtate of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there did not need, as the Papiſts ſay, Righteouſneſs as a bridle to curb in the
paſſions and affections, which otherwiſe would be inordinate, for this were to
attribute a proneneſs to ſinne in us to God himſelf, for he is the author of every
thing, which is natural in us, but all the affections and ſenſitive motions, were
then ſubjected to the command of reaſon, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> had power to love
when, and as long, and in what meaſure he pleaſed; All the affections of his
ſoul were both <hi>quoad originem, gradum</hi> and <hi>progreſſum</hi> under his dominion;
Even as the Artificer can make his Clock ſtrike, when, and as many times as he
pleaſeth. But wo be unto us, all this excellent harmony and ſubordination is
now loſt, and our affections they captivate and rule over our judgments, and all
this is becauſe <gap reason="foreign">

of grace ſanctifying, which is the proper remedy to cure this imbred defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
For the grace of Regeneration is chiefly and principally intended to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
ſinne, as it did corrupt the nature, and ſo by conſequence, as we were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
corrupted; Therefore the tree muſt firſt be made good; ere the fruit can
be good, as the tree is in its nature evil, and then it brings forth evil fruit: So
that God in vouchſafing of this grace of Regeneration, doth not principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make thee leave thy actual ſinnes (for that is by conſequence only) but
to make thy nature better to repair his Image in thee: Even as when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eliſha</hi> would make the waters ſweet, he threw ſalt into the ſpring and
fountain of them: Thus becauſe it's from a polluted nature that all our actual
ſinnes flow, therefore grace regenerating is principally ordered to take away or
conquer that by degrees, which is the cauſe of all: If this be ſo, then let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
What this grace is, which doth inable us to do any thing after a godly and
holy manner? This is a ſupernatural gift of God, and an inſuſed quality into the
ſoul, whereby it's inabled to work above its own proper and natural operations:
If then to do any thing that is good be wholly of grace, it's Gods gift, then to ſin
is natural and proper to thee. The Scripture is copious and plentiful in affirming
this, That Chriſt as our head is the cauſe of all our ſupernatural actings, <hi>We receive
of his fulneſs,</hi> and ſo are inabled by him. Grace then being ſupernatural, to love
God, to repent of ſin, to do any thing ſpiritually, being thus wholly above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it neceſſarily followeth, that when we ſin, and do evil, that we do it naturally.</p>

                        <p>FOr, Firſt, We do not ſay, That the Nature of man as it was created firſt,
had this imbred pollution in it, No: it came out of Gods hands pure and
clean, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. ult. God made man upright.</hi> It was after Gods own Image that
he made him, he had no experimental knowledge of any evil within him. But
as it was with the earth after mans fall, it brought forth bryars and thorns, being
curſed, which (as it is thought) it would not have done ſo before. Thus upon
<hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, then, and not till then, was his ſoul curſed ſpiritually, to
bring forth nothing but bryars and thorns, ſuch luſts as were fit combuſtible
matter for hell fire: Therefore every Infant almoſt may underſtand this, That
the maintaining of this Truth doth not at all redound to Gods diſhonour, for
we ſee the like in the Devils, Are not they become wicked ſpirits? Is there not
an utter impoſſibility in a Devil to do any thing that is good? Are they not <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places?</hi> Epheſ. 6. 12. as if they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but all over wickedneſs, yet the Devil, though ſo vile and abominable,
was made a glorious creature. None of this poiſon was at firſt infuſed into him,
but the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 6, layeth it wholly upon themſelves, <hi>That they kept
not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation.</hi> The Devils then, though ſo
full of wickedneſs, yet are not a reproach to God their Maker, but it was through
their own wilfulneſs, they became ſuch Apoſtates.</p>
                        <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>Adam</hi> when he firſt tranſgreſſed that command of
God, and thereby involved all mankind in darkneſs and miſery, did it from a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
free principle within, there was no internal or external neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
him to ſinne, for he was made with the image of God in him, and that
matter wherein he did tranſgreſs, he might eaſily have attained from God, giving
him liberty to eat of all other trees, ſo that it was meerly, and ſolely from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
own will, that he undid himſelf and all his poſterity. It is true, God if he
had pleaſed could have prevented his ſinning, he could have confirmed him in
ſuch grace, as we ſee he did the other Angels that fell not, whereby he would
certainly have been preſerved from all ſinne, but God is the ſupreme Sovereign,
and is not tied up as men are to inferiour Laws. It is true, he is an eternal Law of

of his creatures as he pleaſeth; and from this it was that he created man
with power to fall, as well as to ſtand, making him mutable and changeable,
whereas the glorified Saints in Heaven ſhall be delivered from ſuch mutability,
and there ſhall not be in them a <hi>poſſe peccare,</hi> a power to ſinne, ſo greatly ſhall
their ſouls be perfected in Heaven: So that ſtill you ſee, God is freed, and mans
deſtruction is of himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Hence alſo in the third place, when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned at firſt, it was not after the
ſame manner, as we ſinne; for when we ſinne, this floweth from a corrupted
nature within, <hi>Jam. 1. 17. Every one is tempted and drawn aſide with the luſt that
is within him;</hi> But in <hi>Adam</hi> there was no ſuch vicious principle. It is therefore a
falſe and dangerous poſition of the <hi>Socinians, That we ſinne in the ſame manner
that he did, That we have no more corrupted Nature in us, then he had, but
as he had a free-will, by which he choſe either good or evil, ſo it is with us.</hi>
But this ſpeaketh open defiance againſt the Scripture; For was <hi>Adam</hi> by nature
the child of wrath? Were the imaginations of his thoughts only evil, and that
continually? Could <hi>Adam</hi> ſay, He found a Law of ſinne in his Members, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
againſt the Law of his mind? <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne therefore came from the meer
mutability and changeableneſs that was in his will, there being no antecedent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in him: Inſomuch that it hath greatly exerciſed learned Divines, to ſhew
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57719:29"/>
how <hi>Adam</hi> could ſinne, and wherein the imperfection did firſt break forth, he
being made after the Image of God; but in us our ſinfulneſs ariſeth from a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
contracted by the firſt voluntary tranſgreſſion, and ſo have a corrupt
nature which inclineth to all corrupt actions. <hi>Adam</hi> was in ſome ſenſe a good
Tree, and yet did bring forth bad Fruit, a ſweet Fountain, and yet did ſend forth
bitter Streams; Here we might ſay, a Vine brought ſorth Thorns, and a Fig
Thiſtles; but we are bad Trees, poiſoned Fountains, Briars and Thorns, only
from the paralleling of our ſelves with <hi>Adam,</hi> we may conclude our incurable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as alſo the danger we are in, by every temptation; For if <hi>Adam;</hi> though
without any corrupt principle within him, though without the leaſt ſpark of any
luſt, was yet ſo eaſily inflamed by a temptation; What may we expect who
have the ſeed of all evil within us? If the green Ivy ſhall take fire ſo ſoon, what
will the dry Tree do? Oh take heed of coming near any occaſion of ſinne! As
our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Remember Lots wife,</hi> ſo do thou <hi>Adams</hi> wife, yea and <hi>Adam</hi>
himſelf. Theſe, though created holy, though without any luſtful inclination,
yet did preſently yeeld to the temptations of ſinne, What then wilt not thou do?
If <hi>Samſon</hi> with his ſtrength cannot reſiſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> much leſs, when that is
gone, can he withſtand them. But of this difference between <hi>Adam</hi> and us in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
more in its time.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place, God is to be juſtified, though we be born full of ſinne,
becauſe we are to diſtinguiſh between nature it ſelf, and the corruption cleaving
to it. We ſay, our Nature, our Eſſence and Subſtance, our Souls and Bodies in
reſpect of their natural Being are the work of God, and we are with <hi>David, to
admire the curious workmanſhip of God,</hi> in reſpect of our <hi>Bodies;</hi> The excellent
compoſition of all the bodily parts, did convince even <hi>Galen,</hi> though otherwiſe
an Heathen. God therefore as a Creator is to be praiſed and glorified by us;
only, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, we muſt not ſo praiſe <hi>Deum Creatorem,</hi> as to make <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluum
Servatorem;</hi> We muſt not ſo celebrate the name of God, as a Creator,
that thereby we ſhould make a Saviour ſuperfluous and unneceſſary, <hi>Sub laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
naturae latent inimici gratiae,</hi> under the praiſes of Nature, the enemies of
Grace hide themſelves; and ſo under the praiſes of God as a Creator, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Chriſt, as a Saviour, ſhelter themſelves. Nature then, we ſay, is good,
our Subſtance and Being is of God onely, the defilement annexed inſeparably
thereunto is of man: Even as in our bodies, the ſubſtance of them is of God,
but God did not make death, that diſſolution ariſeth from ſinne. We do not ſay,
That ſinne is natural to us <hi>conſtitutivè,</hi> or <hi>conſecutivè,</hi> but <hi>tranſitivè</hi> and <hi>inhaeſivè,</hi>
it doth not conſtitute our Being, neither is it an internal conſequence of it, but it
deſcends with our Nature, and is inherent in everyone.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe only do give God his due glory, and vindicate him againſt all ſinful
complaints, who do maintain original ſinne; For it was the ignorance of this
made the Heathens utter ſuch impatient complaints againſt Nature, or rather the
God of it, becauſe they were not informed of this, they thought, <hi>God dealt more
unkindly with man, than any other creature.</hi> Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> taketh notice of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
who greatly complained of Nature, <hi>Rem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vidit, cauſam neſcivit,
(Lib. 4. contra</hi> Julian. <hi>cap. 12.) latebat enim cur grave jugum eſſet ſuper filios
Adam;</hi> and this was, Becauſe (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) not being inſtructed out of the
Scripture, he was ignorant of original ſinne. So that there is no ſuch remedy
againſt thoſe damnable Doctrines of the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> as by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
of our ſelves with the Truth in this point, for hereby we are inabled
upon juſt and ſolid grounds both to juſtifie God, and condemn our ſelves.</p>

                        <p>LAſtly, They that hold <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt created with a pronity to ſinne, and
that it was natural in him to have the ſenſitive appetite rebel againſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional;
and therefore original Righteouſneſs was given as a bridle to curb and
keep the inferiour faculties in ſubordination to the ſuperiour. Theſe (I ſay) do
hold that Doctrine, which makes <hi>God to be the Author, if not of ſinne, yet of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to it.</hi> For, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, <hi>That death was natural to man in his firſt
Creation, only ſinne made it neceſſary, end by way of a curſe.</hi> So the Papiſts ſay,
<hi>That even in</hi> Adam <hi>at his firſt Creation there would have been a rebellion between his
appetite and reaſon, had not there been grace ſuperadded to regulate it; For</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>this is natural, and it abideth in all men ſtill, and is not a ſin.</hi> But we ſhall
in time (God willing) ſhew the falſhood of this, and prove the inclination of the
ſenſitive appetite to any ſuitable object, as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> was not irregular,
but in us it is in all things exceſſive, we not being able to move regularly, becauſe
we have loſt that inward ſtrength we were created in. As you ſee in the Palſie
member, that moveth very faſt, not from ſtrength, but from weakneſs, ſo is it
with us now in all our motions to any object, but God. There is a paralitical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
we cannot love or fear, but we do it too much. Now to ſay, it was thus
in <hi>Adam,</hi> would be to diſhonour God, and to make him the Author of that ataxy
and confuſion which is now in man.</p>

hereafter: But for the preſent, this may ſtop the mouth of any caviller, though
it be as wide as a Sepulchre.</p>
                        <p>1. That as God was not neceſſitated to create man, neither did he make man out of
need of him, ſo when he had made him, he being ſupreme Lord and Sovereign, might
deal with him upon what terms he pleaſed: <hi>It pleaſed him therefore to covenant
with</hi> Adam <hi>not as a ſingle perſon, but as a common head and univerſal perſon,
as appeareth</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>by the collation that is made between the firſt</hi> Adam, <hi>and the

                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore ſecondly, <hi>God taking ſuch a way, all the good</hi> Adam <hi>ſhould have
had upon his continuance in obedience, would not have been in himſelf only, but to
all his poſterity</hi> Then in him, we had all obeyed, <hi>By his obedience we had been
all made righteous,</hi> and by him life would have entred into the world; ſo that it's
great Juſtice in God, to tranſmit all the evils of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
who would have communicated all the good promiſed to them upon his
obedience. And thus we have anſwered that Objection, which is brought againſt

ſecretius,</hi> It's eaſily known that there is ſuch a thing, but what it is, is a

                        <p>In the words we have a further and clearer Declaration of that Collation made

obſcurely ſpoken, deſcribing two Originals, or common Fountains, the one of

                        <p>In this Collation or Compariſon, I am only to take notice of the <hi>Protaſis</hi> or

and <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is called diſobedience; yea ſome learned Divines ſhew,
That the proper ſpecifical nature of this ſinne was diſobedience, there were alſo
many ſins ingredient thereunto, this the Apoſtle doth to aggravate the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it: Inſomuch that <hi>Peltan</hi> the Jeſuite doth wickedly accuſe the Proteſtants
for aggravating the guilt of it ſo much. <hi>Apud illos</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>omnia ſunt quaſi
tragica &amp; infernalia, (De pecc. orig.</hi>) They have nothing but tragical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and proclaim hell and damnation becauſe of this pollution; For this is the
Apoſtles ſcope in this place, to heighten the conſideration of it, that ſo Chriſt
may be the more magnified: Even as an Hiſtorian, who would make a parallel
between two great Generals, yet intending to preferre one before another, doth
in the firſt place amplifie the gallantry, the warlike power, the military ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
of the one, that ſo he may the more advance that other General whom he
intends to preferre above him. Thus doth the Apoſtle here, he makes original
ſinne to be exceeding ſinfull, that ſo the grace of Chriſt may be exceeding rich,
and precious grace. <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne then, which is imputed, and made ours (as
you heard) is diſobedience.</p>

imputation of Adams ſinne to us, and our natural pollution flowing from it.</hi> Yea,
<hi>Paul</hi> guided by the Spirit of God, finds out that myſtery, which none of us ever
could diſcover, by reading the Hiſtory of Mans Fall, related by <hi>Moſes;</hi> For
there indeed we could ſee the cauſe of death, how that came upon all mankind,

                        <p>IN the next place, We have the Effect of this diſobedience, with the Extent of

<hi>all are made ſinners.</hi> Therefore it's a dangerous Expoſition of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Senenſis</hi> relateth, which affirmeth, <hi>Not all, but ſome only to be infected with</hi>
Adam<hi>'s ſinne, exempting</hi> Abel, Noah, <hi>and others from this pollution;</hi> For (1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.) the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In Adam all die;</hi> and in this Chapter at <hi>verſ. 12. All

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57719:31"/>
yea, Infants have been grievouſly poſſeſſed with the Devils, and tormented by
them: Now this could not be, if they were not guilty of ſia: If therefore death
be by natural Propagation, then ſinne the cauſe of it, muſt alſo be in that

                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This compariſon made between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> communicating ſin, and
the ſecond, communicating Righteouſneſs, doth fully evince this: For we are made
righteous by Chriſt, not only as if he were a patern, and example of Righteouſneſs
unto us, but by an hidden and ſecret infuſion of holineſs into our ſouls, whereby we
are made new creatures, and ſaid to be partakers of the Divine Nature: <hi>For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Papiſts would argue, as they think, very ſtrongly for our Juſtification by
inherent Righteouſneſs from the parallel made between</hi> Adam <hi>and Chriſt;</hi> As (<hi>ſay
they</hi>) we are made ſinners, not by imputation onely, but by inherency through <hi>Adam</hi>'s
diſobedience; ſo we muſt be made righteous by Chriſt, not by imputation, but inherently.
<hi>We retort the Argument, and ſay,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin is imputed tous, wherby we are
made ſinners, ſo Chriſts obedience is made ours, whereby we are conſtituted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<hi>Yet we grant further,</hi> That by Chriſt we are made inherently righteous,
though by that we are not juſtified; and this inward renovation comes not from Chriſt
by example, but a powerfull and ſecret transformation of the whole man, ſo that as
to partake of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, we muſt be born naturally of <hi>Adam;</hi> For if God ſhould
create ſome men in an extraordinary manner, not by natural deſcent from him, they
would not have this natural contagion cleaving to them; ſo to partake of Chriſts
Righteouſneſs, it's neceſſary we muſt be new born by the Spirit of God. <hi>Thus you
ſee many Reaſons, compelling us to underſtand the manner how by</hi> Adam<hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
we are made ſinners, to be by natural Propagation: For, if this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be not laid ſure, the whole fabrick will quickly fall to the ground. We come
then to the Obſervation, which is,</hi>

The Text is ſo clear that we would wonder any ſhould be ſo deluded, as to
confront the Truth contained therein: Every one that is naturally born of <hi>Adam,</hi>
is thereby, and in that reſpect made a ſinner, though he ſhould have no actual
tranſgeſſions of his own: An Infant, that liveth not to be guilty of any actual
evil, yet becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed, is thereby made a ſinner, and ſo a child of Gods
wrath. Certainly, the Apoſtle would not have been ſo large and induſtrious in
affirming this Truth: But becauſe of the evident neceſſity to know it, and the
great utility that may come to us, if duly improving this knowledge. To be ſure
he layeth this as a foundation, to exalt and magnifie the grace of God by Chriſt:
So that they who deny this original contagion, muſt needs rob Chriſt and his grace

                           </gap>, becauſe they would chuſe out
ſome opinions from all the Sects that were: So doth this man moſt unhappily
ſometimes ſelect what is moſt deformed in thoſe ſeveral parties. With this Writer
we ſhall encounter as often as we find him throwing earth into the pure ſprings.
Although the word <hi>Sinner</hi> in ſome places, is as much as to be an offender, to be
obnoxious to puniſhment; yet in this place we muſt underſtand more, as is to be
ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>For there are three things we are ſubject to by <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, There is a participation of the very actual tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> that
very ſinne he committed, is imputed to us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is the guilt of this ſinne, whereby <hi>Adam</hi> was obnoxious to
death, and eternal condemnation, this alſo we partake of.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, There was the deprivation of Gods Image, the loſs of that upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, ſo that his ſoul, which was before full of light, and a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
harmony, upon this diſobedience, became like a chaos and confuſion. And
in this ſtate we are born, not ſucceeding <hi>Adam</hi> in the Image of God,
he once had, but in that horrible confuſion, and darkneſſe he was plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into.</p>
                        <p>Theſe three things then, we partake of by <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience; but that which
is chiefly intended here, and which alſo my purpoſe is to treat of chiefly, is, <hi>That
inward filth and defilement we are fallen into by</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſin.</hi>

                        <p>1. <hi>THerefore, when it is ſaid,</hi> That we are made ſinners by <hi>Adam, this is</hi> not all,
<hi>as if thereby we were put into a neceſſity of dying, or that death is now
made a curſe to us: For thus much the</hi> Socinians <hi>grant,</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne did
hurt us thus farre, That although death was natural to <hi>Adam</hi> even in the ſtate of
integrity, yet it was not made neceſſary nor penal, but upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience,
<hi>But</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. This is falſe, That death would have been natural to <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had
not ſinned, as is to be ſhewed. And</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, Death as a curſe, or as made neceſſary, is not all that we
are obnoxious unto by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, for the Apoſtle makes that a diſtinct effect
of his diſobedience: for he ſheweth, That by <hi>Adam</hi>'s offence ſinne did firſt paſs
over the whole world, and after ſin, death; So that to be a ſinner is more than
to be obnoxious to death, for the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth theſe two.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, why ſhould death fall upon all mankind for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, if ſo be that that
offence was not made every mans, and all had not ſinned in him? Indeed <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>
of old expounds this <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>,
ſubject to puniſhment and death; as if to be ſinners, were no more than to be
mortal. Though <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> in ſome places ſeemeth not to hold original ſinne,
yet in other places he is expreſly for it.</p>
                        <p>This Interpretation of <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> is received by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author above-mentioned,
with much approbation, as if to be a ſinner, were to be handled, and
dealt with as an offender; But the Apoſtle maketh ſinne and death two diſtinct
things, the one a conſequent from the other, becauſe we are ſinners, we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mortal. Beſides, to be a ſinner, is oppoſite to be righteous in the Text;
If then, that ſignifie an inherent qualification, denominating truly righteous,
this muſt alſo an inherent corruption, whereby we are truly made ſinners: So
that this Interpretation hath no probability. Yea from <hi>Chryſtom</hi> himſelf on
the place, we may have a Conſutation of this Expoſition: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one
to be made mortal by him of whom he is born, is not abſurd, but by anothers diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to be made a ſinner, What congruity is there in that? Now what juſtice is
there that one ſhould be made mortal by another mans ſinne, unleſs he partake of his
ſinne?</hi> Yea, he ſaith, a little before, <hi>For one to be puniſhed for another mans ſinne,
it hath no reaſon, and yet all along the Chapter affirmed, That by</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſinne we
are all made ſubject to death.</hi> This is no good Harmony.</p>

                              </gap>s</hi> inclineth much that way, though in
ſome things different. Yea, <hi>Arminius</hi> and the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> they conceive, that
to be a ſinner by <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, implieth theſe two things, and no more:
Firſt, <hi>That</hi> Adam<hi>'s actual ſinne is truly and properly made ours,</hi> (and thus farre
they ſay the truth.) But then ſecondly they affirm, <hi>That this is all the original ſin
we have.</hi> They grant, that by this there is a <hi>reatus,</hi> a guilt upon all, <hi>but not any
thing inherent, that hath truly and properly the notion of ſinne.</hi> They will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
yeeled, <hi>That we are by nature the children of wrath; But</hi> (ſay they) <hi>not for
any inherent pollution, but becauſe of</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſinne imputed to us.</hi> But though
theſe two muſt neceſſarily be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, and
the participation of that guilt thereby, yet this is not all, that the Apoſtle mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57719:33"/>
when he ſaith, <hi>We are by his diſobedience made ſinners;</hi> for he intends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, the <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> depravation of the whole man, which now
in eccleſiaſtical uſe, is for the moſt part called original ſinne. And there are theſe
Reaſons to evince it:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That it's more than guilt, or an obnoxious condition to eternal wrath,
becauſe the Apoſtle having ſpoken of that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that judgement to
condemnation, which cometh upon all, he doth in this verſe declare the inward
cauſe and demerit of this in our ſelves, and thereby declareth the juſtice of God:
For, if we had no ſinne in our ſelves inherent, but that only imputed, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God would not be ſo manifeſt in condemning of us. It is true, we muſt
not ſeparate or diſ-joyn this inherent ſinne from that imputed ſinne, yet we muſt
not confound them, or make imputed ſinne all the ſinne we have by nature. The
Apoſtle therefore doth in this Text, give a reaſon of that condemnation, which
hath paſſed on all, becauſe there is ſin inwardly adhering to all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, To be a ſinner is more than to be onely guilty, Becauſe (as you
heard) of the oppoſition made between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt. Now the
Righteouſneſs that we are inveſted with by Chriſt, is truly and properly a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;
It's not only a claim or title to eternal happineſs, it is not only a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from guilt, but an inherent conformity to the Law of God: So that as in
and by Chriſt there is an imputed Righteouſneſs, which is that properly that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth,
and as the effect of this, we have alſo an inherent Righteouſneſs, which
in Heaven will be completed and perfected: Thus by <hi>Adam</hi> we have imputed
ſin with the guilt of it, and inherent ſin the effect of it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If this ſhould be granted, That we are only guilty by <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and not inherently ſinfull, then it would follow, that we had free-will
to what is good, that we are not dead in ſinne, <hi>That the natural man might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the things of God;</hi> For by this opinion, Though we are made guilty by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
tranſgreſſion, yet not inherently ſinfull. And thus while they avoid <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſm</hi>
in one ſenſe, they are deeply plunged into it, in another ſenſe. We muſt
therefore neceſſarily conclude, That original ſin is more than guilt, it denoteth
alſo an inward contagion and defilement of ſoul.</p>

                        <p>IN the third place, <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne imputed to us, is not <hi>all</hi> our original ſinne;
for this is alſo affirmed by many, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual tranſgreſſion is made
every mans ſinne; So that <hi>there is but that one original ſinne common to all, and
every one that is born hath not a particular proper original ſinne to himſelf.</hi> This
opinion, they think, is only able to withſtand thoſe ſtrong Objections, that are
brought againſt the imputability of any thing inherent in us, as truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſinne, while we are Infants, and cannot put forth any acts of reaſon or will;
Yea hereby they ſay, that intricate and perplexed diſcourſe about the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of original ſinne, will be wholly needleſs; ſo that they conclude on this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
as labouring with the leaſt inconveniencies and difficulties. Their Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, <hi>That</hi> Adam<hi>'s actual ſinne is made ours by imputation, and that is all the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne we have, an Infant new born having nothing in it, that is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a ſinne, it hath</hi> (they ſay) <hi>many things that have</hi> rationem poenae, <hi>but not</hi>
culpae, <hi>a proneneſs to ſinne, when it groweth up, is not a ſinne, but a puniſhment; it
is the effect of original ſinne, not the ſin it ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though this may ſeem ſpecious and plauſible, yet this will not ſatisfie the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
expreſſions, which, beſides that original imputed ſinne, doth plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
an inherent one. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, When we have plain Texts that do aſſert any Divine Truth, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſeparably
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57719:33"/>
to adhere to that, though the wit of man may raiſe up ſuch ſubtil Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
that it may ſeem very difficult to anſwer them; Is not this ſeen in the
Doctrine of the Trinity, of the eternal Deity of Chriſt, of the Reſurrection of
the Body, of Juſtification by Faith alone? In all, or moſt of theſe points here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
heads have raiſed up ſuch a ſoggy miſt before our eyes, that ſometimes it is
hard to ſee the Sunne that ſhould guide us: And thus it is confeſſed, That in
maintaining of original inherent ſinne, as truly and properly a ſinne, there are
ſome weighty difficulties, but yet not ſuch as ſhould preponderate or weigh down
clear Scripture; And therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth ſometimes confeſs, <hi>That though he
were not able to anſwer all the Objections could be brought againſt this original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement,
yet we were to adhere to the clear places of Scripture.</hi> Hence it is that
by Epiſtles he conſulted with <hi>Hierom</hi> in this caſe, acknowledging the many ſtraits
he was intangled in.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, there are clear Texts of Scripture, affirming this inward
pollution in all, and that as ſinne; for the Apoſtle in this diſcourſe of his doth
diſtinguiſh ſinne and puniſhment, yet both theſe, he ſaith, come by <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſinne: If then by ſinne were meant only puniſhment, as ſome would have it,
then the Apoſtle in ſaying, <hi>Death came by ſinne,</hi> ſhould mean, that God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
puniſhments with puniſhments, for one puniſhment he ſhould inflict another.
Thus whereas the Adverſaries make it abſurd, that a ſinne ſhould be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a former ſinne, they fall into a greater abſurdity, making one puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the puniſhment of another. Beſides, that it is ſinne inherent in us, and not
only imputed, appears by <hi>David</hi>'s acknowledgement, <hi>Pſal. 51. In ſinne! was I
born, and in iniquity did my mother conceive me.</hi> But of this more in time. You
ſee by what hath been ſaid, That our original ſinne is more than meer guilt, or
<hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſinne imputed to us, it denoteth withall an inherent contagion of
the whole man. Therefore it is abſurdly and falſly ſaid by that late Writer, It may
be called original guilt, rather than original ſin.</p>

                        <p>IN the fourth place, there are thoſe yet who draw a more narrow line in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than the former: For when this Queſtion is put, Whether original inherent ſin
be <hi>truly and properly a ſin?</hi> They then diſtinguiſh between <hi>Peccatum</hi> and <hi>Vitium;</hi>
It is <hi>vitium</hi> (ſay they) but not <hi>peccatum,</hi> or when it is called <hi>peccatum,</hi> it is in a large
ſenſe, not ſtrictly and properly; For with theſe, nothing is a ſinne properly,
but ſome action repugning to the word of God; and becauſe original ſinne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be an action, therefore (ſay they) it's not properly a ſinne; In which ſenſe
they deny habits of ſinne to be <hi>peccata,</hi> but only <hi>vitia.</hi> Though this be to play
with words, ſeeing the ſame thing is intended; And although <hi>Auſtin</hi> abſtaineth
much from the word <hi>peccatum,</hi> as if that alwayes did ſuppoſe a <hi>reatus,</hi> yet that
is a needleſs ſcrupuloſity, men may uſe words as they pleaſe; Therefore <hi>Hierom</hi>
thought, (<hi>Vide</hi> Whitak. <hi>de peccato orig. lib. 3. cap 6.) vitium</hi> was more than
<hi>peccatum,</hi> contrary to <hi>Auſtins</hi> notion, when he ſaid, Some man might be found
without vice, but not without ſinne. They ſay indeed a thing may repugn the
Law of God three wayes; Either, <hi>Efficienter,</hi> ſo the Devils and wicked men
do, yet they are not ſinnes. 2. <hi>Materially,</hi> and thus the act of every ſinne
doth. 3. <hi>Formally,</hi> and ſo the obliquity in the act only doth; and this they
make only truly and properly a ſinne; But whether this will ſtand good or no,
will be examined in the Objections; As alſo that Aſſertion of a learned man,
(<hi>Molinaus, vide infra.) That original ſinne is condemned by the Law, but not
prohibited, it being abſurd</hi> (as he thinks) <hi>to appoint a Law for one grown up, that
he ſhould have been born without ſinne.</hi> It is true, in aſſigning the proper notion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57719:34"/>
of ſinne to it, hath ſome great difficulty; Neither doth it become us to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious
in this point above what is written, remembring that original ſinne came
in, by deſiring too much knowledge. I ſhall therefore treat of it ſo farre, as it
may tend to edification, not to ſatisfie curioſity. For when <hi>Auſtin</hi> was puzled
with ſuch doubts, he brings that known Apologie, (<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 29.) of one who
fell into a deep pit, and being ready to be ſuffocated, he crieth out to one paſſing
by, to help him out; The man asketh him, How he came in? Do not, ſaith he,
ſtand diſputing of that, but help me out. Thus (ſaith he) every man being
fallen into this deep pit of original ſinne, it's not for us to be curiouſly and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly
inquiting how we came in, but ſpeedily ſeek for the grace of God, to
deliver us our.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 1. That the Scipture ſpeaking of it, doth conſtantly call it ſo, and
therefore we are not to recede from the proper interpretation, unleſs ſome weighty
reaſons compel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

be imputable to us, or to have the proper eſſence of evil, becauſe with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
none are blamed for thoſe things they have by nature, or are not in their own
power; For it's plain, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> underſtood nothing of this original pollution,
and by his Philoſophy, we muſt alſo quit many fundamental points in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſaith. It is enough that the Scripture ſpeaking of it, and that purpoſely
doth call it <hi>ſinne,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. this Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. often,
<hi>It's the Law of ſinne working in us:</hi> So that this want of Gods Image, and
an inclination to evil, is not to be conſidered, as a meer puniſhment, or as a
ſpiritual diſeaſe, and weakneſs upon nature, but no ſinne at all; For it's as truly
a ſinne, as an actual ſinne, yea, in ſome reſpects, it is a more grievous and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
ſinne than actual ſinnes, (as is to be ſhewed;) For the cauſe hath
more in it, than the effect. It is from this evil heart that all actual evils do
flow.</p>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:57719:34"/>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. It's truly and properly a ſin, <hi>Becauſe thereby a man is made obnoxious
to death, and eternal condemnation; The wages of ſinne is death, and by nature we
are children of wrath;</hi> If then for this inherent corruption, we die, we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 3. That which is made oppoſite to Righteouſneſs, that is truly and
properly ſinne;</hi> For not puniſhment and Righteouſneſſe, but ſinne and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
are two immediate <hi>Contraries.</hi> Now it's plain, That this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
corruption makes us ſinners, ſo that we need to be made righteouſ by
Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 4. The Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth</hi> Adam<hi>'s imputed ſinne, and inherent
ſinne, as two ſinnes, and ſo they have a two-fold diſtinct guilt,</hi> (as is to be ſhewed)
though ſome think it hard to ſay ſo. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>By one mans offence,
ſinne entred into the world:</hi> Therefore <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſinne, and that ſinne which
entred thereby, are two diſtinct ſinnes, and differ as the cauſe and the effect. By
imputed ſinne, we are ſaid to ſinne in him actually, as it were, becauſe his
will, was our will, but by inherent ſinne, we are made ſinners by intrinſecal
pollution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. This original inherent ſinne is truly and properly a ſinne, <hi>Becauſe
it is to be mortified, to be crucified.</hi> We are to ſubdue the reign of it in our hearts,
which could not be, if it were not properly a ſin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. It is a true and proper ſinne, <hi>Becauſe by this our perſons are made
unclean, ſo that naturally we cannot pleaſe God;</hi> We are corrupt fountains, we
are bad trees, and all this before we commit any actual ſin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum. 7. If</hi> Adam <hi>had ſtood, that which would have been communicated to
his poſterity, would have been truly and properly holineſs.</hi> An Infant new born
would have been called righteous in a proper ſenſe; Therefore are we now born
ſinfull in a true and proper reſpect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. This is a ſinne properly, <hi>Becauſe it is againſt the Law of God.</hi> We
want that perfection which we ought to have; we are bound not only to actual
obedience, but to do this from an holy and unſpotted principle within: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is truly ſaid, Original ſinne is in ſome ſenſe forbidden in every Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and original Righteouſneſs is commanded in all, but becauſe this is
ſo much vexed by Objections, we are to ſpeak more to it in anſwer to
them.</p>
                     <p>We have brought in ſeveral Arguments to prove original ſinne to be a ſinne
<hi>properly</hi> and truly ſo, and this was the rather to be done, becauſe of ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
but eſpecially <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
it to be ſo. But from Scripture it is clear, that it is as true a ſinne, as actual,
and therefore that diviſion of ſinne into original and actual, is of an univocal
<hi>genus</hi> into its <hi>ſpecies,</hi> both the members of that diviſion partaking in a proper
manner of the nature of ſinne. It being therefore the foundation of this point,
and all our fabrick, which in times ſhall be raiſed, being bottomed of this, we
ſhall <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> offer two or three Arguments more, to prove that it is a
ſinne, not in a large, or a metonymical lenſe, but rigidly and properly: And
the firſt in order is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum 9. From the neceſſity of Infants in reſpect of a Saviour; Thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
that die in their Infancy, and go to heaven, cannot obtain this glorious bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
but by Chriſt: If therefore Chriſt be a Saviour to ſome Infants then they are
loſt and undone in themſelves: But not for any actual ſinnes: Therefore for origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
This fully demonſtrates every Infant, though but a day, but an hour old,
to be truly a ſinner, Why? Becauſe even they need Chriſt a Saviour; if they
had no ſinne, they needed not a Jeſus; And this muſt neceſſarily be confeſſed,
That either Infants cannot be ſaved, and are not to be accounted of the people
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57719:35"/>
of God, and of his Church; or if they be, that they have ſinne from which they
are to be cleanſed and ſaved. The former is rarely aſſerted, and therefore the
later muſt be granted: And indeed when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21.
Chriſt is called <hi>Jeſus, Becauſe he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes:</hi> As alſo
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25, 26. Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to give himſelf for his Church, that he may
cleanſe it, ſo as to be without ſpot or wrinkle;</hi> Either we muſt ſay, Infants are
none of Chriſts people, they belong not at all to his Church, or if they do, they
have true and proper ſinne in them, which the Scripture cals uncleanneſs; and
it is evidently applied to Infants in that ſenſe, <hi>Job. 14. 4. Job. 15. 14. who can
bring a clean thing out of an unclean? And who is is born of a woman, that he ſhould
be righteous?</hi> Where to be unclean is made directly oppoſite to be righteous.
Therefore when the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old would evade this Argument, ſaying, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
needed a Chriſt to bring them to the Kingdom of Heaven, though they had no
ſinne. Auſtin</hi> well urged, <hi>That they divided thoſe two names of our Saviour, Chriſt
and Jeſus, making him a Chriſt, where he was not a Jeſus: Certainly to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Infants implieth, in themſelves they are leſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Hence in the next place, <hi>The initial Sacrament which God hath
appointed alwayes in his Church for Infants doth fully demonſtrate, they have ſinne
in a proper formal ſenſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Sinne to be remitted, and to be aboliſhed.</hi> In the
Old Teſtament, every Infant eight dayes old was to be circumciſed, and that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
did plainly declare the ſinne and corruption that was in them, though ſo
young, for <hi>Rom. 4. Circumciſion was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs by Faith,</hi>
which is a Goſpel-righteouſneſs by Chriſt, whereas if they had no ſinne within,
ſuch a Seal would have been ridiculous and abſurd; <hi>As for Chriſt, who though he
had no ſinne, yet was circumciſed and baptized,</hi> that was upon another account,
for having voluntarily made himſelf ſubject to the Law, it beloved him to fulfill
all the Righteouſneſs thereof, but Infants have not that conſideration; If then
Infants needed a righteouſneſs through faith, this plainly demonſtrated
they had nothing but ſinne in themſelves. beſides, The cutting of the fore skin
in the Sacrament of Circumciſion, did denote the throwing away of that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
pollution of their Natures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 16. Therefore <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. God
promiſeth to <hi>circumciſe their heart,</hi> which was to regenerate them, of which
Circumciſion was a ſign. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth of
a <hi>Circumciſion of the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>a Circumciſion of the ſpirit;</hi> If then Infants needed
a Circumciſion of the Spirit; If they needed that the ſinfull fore-skin of their
heart ſhould be cut off, of which their external Circumciſion applied to them,
was a Seal, it followeth unqueſtionably, that they had an univerſal pollution all
over them, before they had committed any actual ſinne. Thus alſo for <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
an initiating Sacrament in the New Teſtament, that is to be applied to Infants;
For though <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do now deny it, yet the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, (though ſo
exceedingly preſſed by this Argument, That Infants were baptized for Remiſſion
of ſinne, but it could not be <hi>actual,</hi> therefore it was <hi>original,</hi> which was in them.)
They never dared to deny their Baptiſm, but ranne to other evaſions. I take it
for a Truth at this time, becauſe ſo fully proved by thoſe who have writ on this
Subject, That Infants are to be baptized; and if ſo, it's alſo plain by Scripture,
That Baptiſm in the nature of it, ſignifieth Remiſſion of ſinnes and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which priviledges, if Infants want, they muſt neceſſarily have that which is
truly and properly a ſin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Laſtly, Every Infant new born comes into the world with that,
which is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> a ſinne, <hi>Becauſe the Scripture makes it the peculiar
Character and property of Chriſt, that he was wholly without ſinne.</hi> Therefore
the Angel in his diſcourſe to <hi>Mary</hi> cals him the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>that holy thing which
ſhall be born of thee,</hi> Luke 1. 35. And the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>It behoved us to
have ſuch an High prieſt, who was tempted like us in all things, ſin only excepted,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57719:35"/>
Heb.</hi> 4. 15. Theſe places do clear, that Chriſt only was born without ſinne, and
all others are polluted with it: And the reaſon why Chriſt is exempted, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was not of <hi>Adam, Quoad ſeminalem rationem,</hi> but <hi>corpulatam ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiam,</hi>
as the Schoolmen ſay, He was not the ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
but by a miraculous conception. It is true, The Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
up Chriſts Genealogy, aſcends up to <hi>Adam,</hi> as if he were the ſonne of
<hi>Adam,</hi> but that is becauſe he was the ſuppoſed ſonne of <hi>Joſeph</hi> his father, he
was accounted his legal father, though he was not his natural.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> think they only have found out the true reaſon, why Chriſt
contracted not original ſinne from <hi>Adam,</hi> nor was not in his loins; <hi>For</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>Chriſt was not is</hi> Adam, <hi>as a common parent, and ſo ſinned not in him,
becauſe he did not come of a woman, by that firſt command,</hi> Increaſe and multiply,
<hi>but by a new and ſingular promiſe which God made to</hi> Adam <hi>after his fall,</hi> viz. <hi>That
the ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the ſerpent.</hi> But though it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That Chriſt was born of a woman by a ſingular promiſe, yet that alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the miraculous operation of the holy Ghoſt, would not have cleanſed the
humane Nature of Chriſt from ſinne, eſpecially if that be true, which ſome
learned men ſay, That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did, in ſome meaſure, concurre actively
to the body of Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt is called, <hi>The fruit of her womb,</hi> and
is ſaid to be of the <hi>ſeed of David,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 8. So that being the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
her ſelf was unclean, till the holy Ghoſt over-ſhadowed her, none could bring
that which was clean out of her, but God in a miraculous and extraordinary
manner ſanctifying that maſs, of which Chriſts body was made. Beſides, we
read of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that he was born by the virtue of a ſingular promiſe, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s
womb being as good as dead, yet for all that he was not free from
original ſinne; Therefore the holineſſe of Chriſts humane nature, and that
in the very conception muſt be attributed to the wonderfull operation of
the holy Ghoſt; If then this was peculiar to Chriſt alone, <hi>It followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily,
That all thoſe who in a natural manner deſcend from</hi> Adam <hi>come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world unclean, and infected with this pollution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we have laid ſure and firm foundations to maintain this Truth, That ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne is <hi>truly and formally</hi> a ſinne deſerving eternal condemnation, as well
as actual ſinne.</p>

And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That which is a famous and obvious Objection, owned by all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
to this Doctrine, is, <hi>The neceſſarineſs and involuntarineſs of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> Every ſinne (<hi>ſay they</hi>) muſt be voluntary; <hi>This is a principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed,
as they conceive, in the conſcience of a man:</hi> No man is to be faulted,
or blamed for that which is not in his power to prevent; <hi>And they preſs
that known Rule of</hi> Auſtins, Vſque adeo voluntarium peccatum eſt malum, quod
non ſit peccatum, niſi voluntarium, <hi>If it be not voluntary, it cannot be any ſinne
at all.</hi> Now (<hi>ſay they</hi>) this original ſinne comes upon us by natural neceſſity, it
lieth no more in our power to prevent it, then to hinder our being born; Shall then we
conceive God willing to damn a man, eſpecially an Infant, for that ſinne which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in his power, or his will to do? <hi>This they think cannot be admitted.</hi>
Therefore though ſome of them grant, <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſinne may be made ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our will is interpretatively in his, yet not this inherent corruption, becauſe
this is a particular perſonal ſinne, and ſo requireth a perſonal actual will to make it
a ſinne. <hi>And this ſeemeth to have ſome plauſible colour, while we attend only
to principles of humane Reaſon, and Arguments of Philoſophy: But let us
ſee, whether it will not be too light, if weighed in the balance of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We muſt underſtand in what ſenſe any ſinne at all can be called vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
and that is, not as if any man could will ſinne, no not he that ſinneth
maliciouſly, as it is ſin. This is granted by all moral Philoſophers, That no man
willeth ſin, as it is ſin, becauſe <hi>bonum,</hi> either real or appearing ſo, is the adequate
object of the will: As in the underſtanding, that cannot aſſent to any thing that
is apparently falſe; ſo neither doth the will chooſe any thing that is manifeſted to
be evil, as evil, but when it imbraceth any ſine, there is ſome deceivable good
or other, which deceiveth the ſoul. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> when he tranſgreſſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, he did not will this as a ſinne, nor did he poſitively intend the
damnation of his poſterity (For we ſuppoſe that he knew himſelf to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Parent, and that he received a common ſtock for all mankind) But
he willed that action, to which ſinne was annexed; And thus no wicked
man, when he ſinneth, doth will the damnation of his ſoul formally, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57719:36"/>
conſequentially by willing that to which this guilt doth belong.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Although it be granted, That every ſinne muſt be voluntary, yet
(as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old anſwered) this ſinne may be called voluntary, as it is in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
becauſe their will is interpretatively in <hi>Adam,</hi> and we therefore are all
ſaid to ſinne in him: <hi>Adam</hi>'s will may be ſaid to be our will two wayes:</p>
                        <p>1. By way of delegation, as if we had choſen him to be our common parent,
and had tranſlated our wils over to him, as amongſt men, it is uſual in arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and then they are ſaid to will, that which their Arbitrator hath done, though
it may be they diſlike it, and in this ſenſe, <hi>Adam</hi>'s will is not our will, for we had
no actual being or exiſtence in him. Hence</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Adam's</hi> will may be ſaid to be ours interpretatively, God appointing him
to be the univerſal principle of mankind; what he did is interpreted, as if we
had done it, and the equity of making <hi>Adam</hi>'s will ours, ariſeth from the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
will and Covenant of God, that would have it ſo: But more eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God then dealt with <hi>Adam</hi> in a Covenant of works, which if broken and
violated, carrieth condemnation to all his off-ſpring, as appeareth by the curſes
threatned in the Law. This original ſinne then is voluntary, becauſe committed
by <hi>Adam</hi>'s will, which by Gods imputation is made ours; ſo that as in <hi>Adam</hi>
upon his actual diſobedience, the Image of God was loſt, and in ſtead
thereof came an univerſal pollution of his whole man; which was in
him truly and properly a ſinne; So it is in every Infant deſcended from
him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If it be granted, That every ſinne muſt be voluntary, yet this
alſo will hold good in Infants ſinne; for a thing may be ſaid to be <hi>voluntarium
in cauſa,</hi> but <hi>involuntarium in ſe.</hi> With moral Philoſophers, all habits of ſinne
are involuntary in themſelves, but voluntary in their cauſe; thoſe actions that
did produce them; And thus is original ſin inherent in mankind, it is voluntary
in its cauſe, which was <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, who urgeth voluntarineſs in ſinne, yet afterwards
conſidering how the <hi>Pelagians</hi> made uſe of it, he anſwereth, <hi>That this is to be
underſtood of actual ſinne, not original ſinne;</hi> Every actual ſinne muſt be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
it's not neceſſary original ſinne ſhould be perſonally and formally ſo: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he limits that Rule to ſuch ſins as are meerly ſins, not puniſhments alſo, but
original ſin is both a ſin and puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, He grants this to be true amongſt the Laws of men, and therefore cals
it <hi>politica ſententia;</hi> And no wonder if Philoſophers required a formal will in
every ſin, elſe not to make it imputable, becauſe they were wholly ignorant of
this Truth.</p>
                        <p>But in the laſt place, our Divines do deny that voluntarineſs is requiſite to
every actual ſinne; for there are ſinnes of ignorance for which Sacrifices were
to be offered; And <hi>David</hi> prayeth to be <hi>cleanſed from ſecret ſins,</hi> which he did not
know, and if ſo, they muſt be involuntary; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly cals that a ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
which yet was againſt his will, although it may be granted, that even in theſe there
is ſome kind of voluntarines; For a thing may be voluntary either in its cauſe, or in
it ſelf, or abſolutely involuntary, but comparatively voluntary, as when we do
things for fear, or there may be a mixture of voluntarines and involuntarines, which
<hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth to acknowledge in himſelf, yet ſtill the proper notion of a ſinne
lieth in the contrariety of it to the Law of God: Therefore <hi>John</hi> defineth ſinne
by that, whether it be voluntary or not, he doth not take notice of. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by ſome Scholaſtical Writers, eſpecially <hi>Holkot (De imputabilitate
peccati</hi>) anſwereth this Objection fully to our purpoſe, where he poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
<hi>That ſinne is not therefore imputable unto us, becauſe it was in the power
of the will, but as righteouſneſs is therefore praiſe-worthy, becauſe it is righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo unrighteouſneſs is therefore culpable, and damnable, becauſe it is unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57719:37"/>
(that is, if I may interpret him) <hi>becauſe it's againſt a Law.</hi> Hence he
proceedeth to ſhew, <hi>That a thing is not righteous or vnrighteous meerly becauſe it
was in the power of the will, for the will of a child would have been made righteous
by God,</hi> ſine proprie motu, <hi>without any proper motion of the childs will; And then
why may it not as well be ſinfull without any ſuch voluntary motion in an Infant?</hi>
So that he concludeth, <hi>It's as proper to original ſinne to be naturally contracte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> or
derived from another, without any proper act of the will, as it is to an actual ſinne,
to have the will one way or other conſenting to it: Even as in the ſtate of integrity,
original righteouſneſs in Infants would have been propagated, but actuall Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
voluntarily performed.</hi> And theſe things may ſatisfie this firſt Objection,
yet hereafter we ſhall ſpeak more to this.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>THe ſecond Objection is in effect to this ſenſe,</hi> What is a puniſhment cannot be
a ſinne: But the deprivation of Gods Image in man upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience
is a puniſhment; And therefore it cannot be a ſinne. Original ſinne, if not totally,
yet principally conſiſts in the loſſe of that original Righteouſneſſe and rectitude,
which God made man in: Seeing therefore the privation of this came upon man by
way of puniſhment, when <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſed; We cannot conceive it (<hi>ſay they</hi>)
to be a ſinne alſo, for a puniſhment and a ſinne, are wholly contradictory; a ſinne
muſt be voluntary, a puniſhment involuntary, a ſinne is an action, and a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a paſſion; a ſinne is an evil, and God cannot be the author of it; a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is good, and an act of Juſtice; ſo that God cannot be ſaid to permit that, but
to inflict it.</p>
                        <p>This Argument (at the firſt view) hath likewiſe ſome colour, but upon the
examination of it, it will quickly vaniſh: I ſhall not anſwer in a large diſpute
about that famous Queſtion, Whether the ſame thing may be a ſin and a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Or, whether God doth puniſh one ſin with another, but ſhall ſpeak as much,
briefly, as is convenient for this Objection. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, You muſt know that <hi>Arminius</hi> began to diſlike this Doctrine of original
ſinne (<hi>Reſponſ. ad Artic.</hi> 31.) which was mentioned in their publique Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,
upon this very reaſon, becauſe it was a puniſhment; and he gave this
Reaſon to the Miniſter then conferring with him, <q>Becauſe if God did puniſh
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne with this ſinne, then he muſt puniſh this with another, and that
other with another, and ſo there muſt be a <hi>proceſſus in infinitum.</hi>
                           </q> But his followers
the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> (in their Apology for their Confeſſion <hi>contra Cenſuram</hi>)
ſeem to diſclaim this opinion, <q>That our original corruption is either <hi>malum
culpae,</hi> or <hi>poenae,</hi> properly ſo called, Becauſe where there is an evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it muſt be for ſome ſinne: But Infants have committed no voluntary
ſinne, and therefore could not deſerve ſuch a puniſhment.</q> So that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
themſelves to be of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his mind, whether he retracted it, or not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they are not certain, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is a <hi>morbus,</hi> a <hi>vitium,</hi> a <hi>languor,</hi> an
imbecillity of nature, but neither the evil of ſinne or puniſhment. Some Papiſts
as <hi>Pighius, Catharinus, Mayro,</hi> and ſome <hi>Scotiſts</hi> hold, <q>That native
pollution to be no ſinne, becauſe it's a puniſhment, and that for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne
imputed to all, concluding on this, That it cannot be a ſinne, becauſe it's a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
The <hi>Socinians</hi> they ſay, The neceſſity of dying with other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is the puniſhment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne; and therefore that repugnancy
and contrariety which is between the fleſh and the Spirit, is from our very
Creation; The ſenſitive appetite rebels againſt the rational, from the very firſt
Creation of man, and would have been whether <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned or no; yea,
it was from this vehement oppoſition of the appetite to reaſon, that he did ſin.</q>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57719:37"/>
I ſhall conſider the ſtrength of their Objection, as it lieth in this, The ſame
thing cannot be a ſin and a puniſhment too. The Remonſtrants affirm this, and
Papiſts likewiſe, but with ſome explication. And</p>
                        <p>1. It is confeſſed, That there are ſome puniſhments of ſinne, which are not
ſinne, as when God for <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience hath made man obnoxious to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to ſickneſs and death; Theſe are not ſinnes; It comes from ſinne to have
pain, and to die, but they are not ſinnes; and the Reaſon is, Becauſe theſe are
<hi>malum naturale,</hi> not <hi>morale,</hi> they are a natural evil, not a moral.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, and he ſaith it truly from Scripture, <q>That
original inherent ſinne, which he calleth concupiſcence, is both a ſinne, a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſinne, and a cauſe of ſin; Even as blindneſs of mind, or hardneſs
of heart, is both a ſinne, a puniſhment, and a cauſe of further ſinne, (<hi>Lib. 5.
contra</hi> Juhan. <hi>cap. 3.)</hi>
                           </q> That it is a ſinne appeareth by the many Texts already
brought: And <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Reaſon in that place is very cogent, <hi>Quia ineſt illi ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientia
contra dominatum mentis;</hi> There is in it a diſobedience againſt the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of mind and ſpirit, therefore the Spirit luſteth againſt it. That it is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
is manifeſt by the event, for upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience he loſt Gods
Image, and ſo hath blindneſs in mind, perverſneſs in his will, and a diſorder
over the whole man, in which dreadfull and horrible eſtate we all ſucceed him:
and this the Text in hand ſpeaketh to. That it is the cauſe of ſinne is manifeſt,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. for from that corrupt heart of man, it is, <hi>That the imaginations of a
mans heart are only evil, and that continually.</hi> This is a furnace red hot, which
alwayes ſends forth thoſe ſparks. Thus you ſee that original ſinne is all theſe three,
a ſin, a puniſhment, and a cauſe of ſin.</p>
                        <p>3. It is very clear and plain by Scripture, that God doth puniſh one ſinne by
another; So that when a man hath committed one ſinne, he is juſtly given up by
God to commit more. Amongſt the many inſtances that may be given, I ſhall
pitch on two only, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11. where you have a ſinne mentioned that
God will puniſh, viz. <hi>They received not the truth of God in love:</hi> A ſinne that is
very ordinary: But then obſerve how dreadfully God puniſheth this, <hi>God ſhall
ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie;</hi> This is their puniſhment;
a ſpiritual puniſhment, more than any corporal one; and that this is a ſinne, as
well as a puniſhment, is plain, Becauſe to believe a lie is a ſinne, to take falſhood
for truth, the deluſions of the Devil, for the voice of Gods Spirit; This is a ſinne
and a very hainous one. The other inſtance is <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. where you have the
Heathens ſinnes mentioned, <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him
not.</hi> &amp;c. There you have their puniſhment, <hi>to be given up to uncleanneſs, to all
vile luſts and ſins againſt nature.</hi> None can deny but theſe were ſinnes, and that
they were a puniſhment for corrupting their natural light implanted in them, is
plain, for the Apoſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24, 26, 28. ſaith, <hi>For this cauſe, or therefore God
gave them up to theſe luſts,</hi> and <hi>verſ</hi> 27. the expreſſion is obſervable, <hi>That they
received in themſelves that recompence of their error which was meet.</hi> Hearken to
this with both ears, and tremble all you who live under Goſpel light, if natural
light corrupted bring ſuch heavy ſoul-judgments, no wonder, if ſupernatural;
And therefore if you ſee men, notwithſtanding all the preaching of Gods word,
yet given up to be beaſtly ſots, or obſtinate malicious men in their wickedneſs;
Wonder not at it, for they receive in themſelves a juſt recompence for the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of that light God hath vouchſafed to them. Many other inſtances there are,
wherein it is plain, That God makes one ſinne a puniſhment of another; Yea,
it's ſaid, That every ſinne ſince the firſt, is both a ſinne and a puniſhment; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the want of Gods Imagine us, as ſoon as we are born, with a proneneſs to
all evil may be the puniſhment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual diſobedience, and yet a ſinne
in us.</p>
                        <p>4. As for the diſtinction aſſigned between ſinne and puniſhment, the one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57719:38"/>
and an action, the other involuntary and a paſſion. Though there be
learned men, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, <hi>viz. Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this by inſtances, yet (if it be granted) it will not hinder or enervate
our Poſition, That original inherent ſinne is both a ſinne, and a puniſhment alſo;
For when the learned ſay, <q>That ſinne may be a puniſhment of a ſinne, they
do not mean ſin, <hi>quâ</hi> ſinne, <hi>peccatum, quâ peccatum,</hi> for that is, wholly of
man, but <hi>peccatum quâ poena,</hi> as a judgment it is of God.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To underſtand this therefore, take notice, That in ſinne there is the Obliquity,
and the Action to which this Obliquity is annexed; Now ſinne in the Obliquity
of it, ſo it is not a puniſhment, but in the action or <hi>materiale</hi> of it, to which it
doth adhere: As for inſtance, Thoſe vile and unclean luſts the Heathens were
given up unto, were a puniſhment of their rebellion unto the light; Now as
they were ſinnes in their formality, ſo they were onely <hi>permiſſivè</hi> and <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè</hi>
of God; but take the Actions ſubſtracted to that Obliquity, which was
in them, ſo they were <hi>efficienter</hi> of God, and he gave them up to their
luſts.</p>
                        <p>2. When God doth puniſh one ſinne with another, the meaning is not, as if
he did infuſe this wickedneſs, but only he denieth that mollifying and ſoftning
grace, which if a man had, he would reſiſt the temptations of ſinne, as in this
particular of original ſinne; You muſt not conceive of God, in the Creation
of the ſoul, as if a man were pouring poiſon in a veſſel, ſo he did put ſinne into
our natures, but he denieth to give and continue that Righteouſneſs <hi>Adam</hi> had,
and then our ſouls do neceſſarily receive the clean contrary, darkneſs for light,
Atheiſm for faith, diſorder for order: Even as if God ſhould withdraw the Sunne
at noon-day, continue the light thereof no longer to us, it would upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
be immediately dark, there needed no other cauſe to introduce it:
Thus it is here upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, God denying to continue his Image, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
righteouſneſs in us, original ſinne without any other poſitive cauſe cometh
in the ſtead thereof; and therefore we are not, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old well obſerved, to
ſeek after the <hi>cauſa efficiens,</hi> but <hi>deficiens peccati,</hi> ſin hath no efficient, but defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Therefore thirdly, In this original ſinne we may conſider that which is <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
and ſo it's evil, and that which is <hi>poena,</hi> and ſo it's good; For as you look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, being the deprivation of that rectitude which ought to be in a man, ſo it
is a ſinne; but as you conſider it to be the denying of that holineſs on Gods part,
which once we had, ſo it's <hi>poena,</hi> or rather <hi>punitio;</hi> The denying of this Image o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
God at firſt was <hi>punitio,</hi> but this loſs continued is <hi>poena;</hi> ſo that the want and
loſs of that righteouſneſs which once we enjoyed, if conſidered on Gods part,
who continueth his denial of it, is a juſt puniſhment, and a good thing ordained
by God; but if you conſider it as inherent in man, who hath deſerved this at Gods
hand, ſo it's an evil, and properly a ſin in him.</p>
                        <p>4. The ſame thing may be a ſinne and a puniſhment alſo, in divers reſpects, As
it may be a ſinne in reſpect of a ſinner, but a puniſhment in reſpect of others.
Thus <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s ſinne was a ſinne in reſpect of himſelf, but a puniſhment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>David;</hi> So Parents ſinnes may be ſinnes in reſpect of themſelves,
but puniſhments in reſpect of their children; and we are eſpecially to take
heed of ſuch ſinnes, as are not our ſinnes onely, but others puniſhments,
ſuch are paſſions and unmortified anger, this is a ſinne to thee, and a puniſhment
to others.</p>
                        <p>5. Every ſinne is a puniſhment, in this reſpect, That it brings anxiety, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and fear with it, a guilt of conſcience is contracted upon every ſinne. Thus
ſome expound that known ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Juſſiſti Domine, &amp; ſic eſt, ut omnis
animus inordinatus ſit ſibi ipſi poena;</hi> O Lord, thou haſt ſo commanded, and thus
it is, that a ſoul immoderate any way, ſhould be a puniſhment to it ſelf. Thus,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57719:38"/>
as the moral Philoſophers ſay, <hi>Virtus eſt ſibiipſi praemium,</hi> ſo <hi>peccatum eſt ſibiipſi
poena,</hi> Virtue is a reward to it ſelf, becauſe it brings ſweetneſs and comfort of
conſcience, ſo a ſinne is a puniſhment to it ſelf, becauſe it brings terror and fear
with it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The ſame thing may be both a ſinne and a puniſhment, both <hi>poena dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
and <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> a puniſhment of loſs, and ſo every ſinne, in that it is a ſin,
depriveth the ſoul of that ſpiritual good and glory which it ought to have, and
ſo is a kind of diſeaſe or death it ſelf; and then in ſome ſins they are a puniſhment
of ſenſe, as in envy and anger. Thus when <hi>Ahitophel</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> hanged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
their ſelf-murder was both a ſinne and a puniſhment of loſs, and ſenſe
alſo.</p>

                           <hi>IN the third place it is objected,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> If original inherent ſinne be made a diſtinct ſin
from <hi>Adam</hi>'s imputed ſinne, we do needleſly make two guilts, and ſo multiply
ſins without neceſſity, for all the guilt that is in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne imputed, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Nature which floweth immediately from it, doth not make a new ſin,
but makes the former more hainous: As if (<hi>ſay they</hi>) a man ſhould by ſome
ſin loſe his eyes, that act whereby he put out his eyes was a ſinne, but then it's
not a new diſtinct ſin in him, to be without eyes: Or if a Commander, who
had a Caſtle to keep, upon which depended the good of a Town adjacent, if he
prove perſidious, and give it up to the enemy, his perfidious act at firſt is all the
ſinne, if the Town adjacent have much miſery thereby, it is an aggravation of
his ſin, but it doth not make him guilty of two ſins.</p>
                        <p>This hath made ſome think,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That our original pollution, as diſtinct from
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne imputed, is not a ſinne; and that whenſoever the Fathers call it
a ſinne, they underſtand it, as connexed with <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne. Thus the learned
<hi>Voſſius</hi> in his <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hiſtory. But the truth no doubt is on their ſide, who
hold a twofold diſtinct guilt, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne imputed to us, and that inherent
are two diſtinct ſins, though one doth neceſſarily imply an order to another,
and the later is alwayes to be looked upon, as a relative to the former. Neither
doth that ſimilitude of a man wilfully putting his eyes out, make to this purpoſe:
For when a man hath loſt his eyes, there is a natural impotency ever to have
them again; Neither is there any obligation, or Law binding him thereunto:
But beſides the guilt of imputed ſinne, we are bound to have that inherent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude
we once loſt, and therefore being defective in that we ought to have, it's
truly a ſinne. The loſs of a mans eyes is <hi>malum naturale,</hi> this is <hi>morale;</hi> And
thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> determined that a drunken man, who committed any ſin worthy
of puniſhment, was to be twice puniſhed both for his drunkenneſs, and the other
ſinne committed. Thus <hi>Rivet</hi> alſo in the matter of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
while he was ſo drunk, that he could not tell what he did, inclineth to
their opinion, who ſay, <q>That <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt was not only a puniſhment of his
drunkenneſs, and ſo an aggravation of his ſinne, but truly and properly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt;
ſo that he had two ſins, and was twice guilty.</q> Some learned men do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
<q>That if a man commit ſuch a ſin, upon which other ſins do uſually
follow, though while they do them, they cannot avoid them, not knowing
what they do, yet thoſe ſubſequent ſins are to be charged upon them, beſides
the firſt that was the cauſe of all; as murder is to be charged, as a diſtinct ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a drunkard, though happily in his drunkenneſs he knew not that he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſuch a ſin.</q>

                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                           <hi>this is thought a powerfull weapon againſt this
Truth, viz.</hi> It cannot be truly and properly a ſinne, becauſe it is not againſt any
Law. The Apoſtle makes contrariety to the Law, to be of the eſſence of ſinne: If
therefore Infants new-born, or before they are born, are not under a Law, then they
are not capable of any ſinne; and truly it hath a ſeeming abſurdity to ſay, Infants
are commanded by Gods Law, to be born without ſinne, ſeeing that is no more in their
power than to be born. This conſideration did preſs that learned Divine <hi>Molinaus</hi>
(Enodatio graviſſ. Quaeſt. de peccato <hi>origin.</hi> pag. 130.) <hi>to acknowledge,</hi> That no
ſuch Law was upon Infants, and therefore he ſaith, That the Law doth condemn
original ſinne, but not prohibit it. But this ſeemeth very ſtrange, For how can the
Law condemn a thing, but becauſe it is againſt it? And how can it be againſt it,
but becauſe it doth prohibit? If therefore the meaning of that learned man be, that
original ſinne is not immediately and proximely forbidden, that is readily granted,
for ſo only actual ſins are, but mediately and remotely, both the habits of ſinne, and
original, muſt neceſſarily be prohibited, if they be condemned. The learned <hi>Voſſius</hi>
alſo affirmeth, That original ſinne is not forbidden by the moral Law, though he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
it is by the natural Law, which was at firſt in the Creation of man, but that
primordial and original Law is the ſame for ſubſtance with the moral, though differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſome reſpects.</p>
                        <p>To the Argument therefore we ſay,</p>
                        <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That as this original ſinne is voluntary, <hi>voluntate cauſae,</hi> which was
<hi>Adam</hi>'s will, ſo it is alſo againſt a Law which was enjoyned <hi>Adam;</hi> For although
<hi>Adam</hi> had not a Law upon him in reſpect of the beginning or original of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
he had, he being created in that, and ſo was not capable of any Law,
yet in reſpect of the preſervation and continuation of this for himſelf and his
poſterity, ſo he had a Law impoſed on him, and therefore violating of that Law,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57719:39"/>
we in him alſo did violate it: You ſee then this original ſin is a tranſgreſſion of that
Law which <hi>Adam</hi> was under, <hi>viz.</hi> the continuation of the righteouſneſs he was
created in, both for himſelf and his poſterity.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Even by the moral Law, or the Decalogue, this original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is forbidden. The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſheweth, <hi>That he had not known luſt to be
a ſinne, had not the Law ſaid, Theu ſhalt not luſt:</hi> So that as the Law forbiddeth
actual luſting, thus it doth alſo the principle and root of it; for the Law is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and in its obligation reacheth to the fountain, and root of all ſin, it doth
not only prohibit the ſinfull motions of thy ſoul, but the cauſe of all theſe:
Even as when it commands any holy duty, to love God; for inſtance, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that inward ſanctification of the whole man, whereby he is inabled to
love God upon right and induring grounds, otherwiſe if this were not ſo, the
habits of ſinne would not be againſt Gods Law, nor the habits of Grace
required by it, as therefore it was with <hi>Adam</hi> his actual tranſgreſſion,
was directly and immediately forbidden by the Law of God; but that
habital depravation of the whole man, which came thereupon, was forbidden
remotely and by conſequence: Thus it is with that native contagion we are born
in, and this ſhould teach us in every ſin we commit, to think the Law doth not
forbid and condemn this actual ſin only, but the very inward principle of it; ſay
to thy ſelf, Alas I ſhould not only be without ſuch vain thoughts, ſuch vain affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but without an inclination thereunto; Therefore mark the Apoſtle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 22, 24, 25. When he had exhorted them to <hi>put off the old man,</hi>
that is original ſinne, and to <hi>put on the new man, which is the Image of God,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
oppoſing that; See what he inferreth thereupon, <hi>Wherefore put away
lying,</hi> they muſt leave that actual ſinne, becauſe they have in meaſure ſubdued
original ſinne. Thus it holds in all other ſins, put away pride, earthlineſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs,
becauſe the old man is firſt put away in ſome degrees, But oh how
little do men attend to this? They think of their actual ſins, they ſay, This, I
have done, is againſt Gods Law, but go no deeper, they do not further conſider,
but God forbids and layeth his axe to the root, as well as the branches &amp; the fruit.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, A ſinne doth not therefore ceaſe to be a ſin, becauſe the Law doth
not now forbid it, it was enough, if it were once forbidden, and contrary to
Gods Law, otherwiſe we might ſay, That all ſins which are paſt, are no ſins;
for the Law doth not require, that what hath been done, ſhould be undone again,
or not to be done, for that is impoſſible <hi>ex natura rei;</hi> If therefore ever original
ſinne hath been under a Law prohibitive of it, that is enough to make it a ſin,
though now it cannot be helped. Hence <hi>Almain</hi> the Schoolman hath a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Debitum praecepti,</hi> and <hi>Debitum ſtatuti</hi> (which other Schoolmen alſo
mention) now they apply it thus, <q>To be born without ſin, is not (ſay they)
<hi>Debitum praecepti,</hi> it doth not become due by any precept or command, but it
is <hi>Debitum ſtatuti,</hi> that is, God had firſt appointed ſuch an order, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhould come of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould be born in that righteouſneſs, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was created in, and was to preſerve for himſelf and his poſterity; ſo that
though there be no direct <hi>Praeceptum divinum,</hi> yet (they ſay) there is <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio
divina,</hi> that we ſhould have been born without ſinne.</q> Although we
need not runne to this, becauſe it is now againſt the moral Law of God, as
you heard proved.</p>

                        <p>To anſwer this:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Firſt, It is not my purpoſe at this time to enter into that great
Debate, Whether the ſins of parents are puniſhed in their children? And it ſo,
How it ſtands with the Juſtice of God? It is plain, That in the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is ſaid, <hi>That God being a jealous God, becauſe of Idolatry, he will viſit the
ſins of ſuch perſons, to the third and fourth generation.</hi> The ſame likewiſe is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

alſo in the deſtruction of <hi>Sedom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> as alſo in the drowning of
the world, doth abundantly teſtifie this; For no doubt there was in thoſe places,
as God ſaid of <hi>Ninevch,</hi> many little ones, that did not know the right hand
from the left, and ſo could not have any conſent to the actual iniquities of their
Parents. To reconcile therefore that place of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. where God ſaith, <hi>The
child ſhall not bear the iniquity of his Father,</hi> with thoſe former places, hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
the thoughts of the moſt learned men variouſly, endeavouring to unty
that knot. Though I find ſome of late, underſtanding that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> only for
that particular occaſion, as it did concern the <hi>Jews,</hi> in their particular judgment
of Captivity, who complained that for their fathers iniquities they were tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a ſtrange Land; So that they think it not to be extended univerſally, but
limited to that people only, and at that time, and that alone to that Land of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
becauſe they were driven from their own Countrey: But whether this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation

being in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſinning in him, (for which our puniſhment is juſt and due)
by that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb</hi> 7. 9, 10 where <hi>Levi</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to pay Tyths to Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech
long before he was born, becauſe he was in Abrakams l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it may be granted, that there is ſome diſproportion, <hi>Abraham</hi> not being ſuch a
common parent to <hi>Levi,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> was to all mankind; yet <hi>Sceinus</hi> his exception
is very frivolous. The Apoſtle ſaith, he uſeth that diminutive phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
<hi>as I may ſo ſay,</hi> which doth demonſtrate, that it was not a proper ſaying. To this
we anſwer, That if you do regard <hi>Levies</hi> actual paying of Tyths, as it he had an
actual exiſtence, then there was ſome impropriety, which made the Apoſtle uſe
that phraſe, but not in regard of the truth of his paying in a moral conſideration.
Thus when we ſay, <hi>All ſinned in Adam,</hi> we may well uſe that phraſe, and ſpeak
thus, <hi>As we may ſo ſay,</hi> we did all actually will <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, we did all actually
tranſgreſs that Commandment; Thus it is a diminutive expreſſion in <hi>relation to
our actual exiſtence, but not to our ſinne;</hi> For by Gods Covenant we were looked

ſome ſay was a fig-tree:</q> Howſoever it be, you ſee that place in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth
not reach to our caſe in hand.</p>
                        <p>2. That place will overthrow the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves alſo; For they grant,
<hi>That by</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſinne, death though otherwiſe natural, is now made neceſſary and
penal,</hi> inſomuch that we actually die, becauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience. And</p>
                        <p>3. That place in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it is commonly interpreted thus, <hi>The child ſhall not
bear the Fathers ſiane,</hi> viz. <hi>if he be innocent, and not guilty of it, as well as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
I do not diſcuſs, whether this be the full interpretation of that place: But
if it be ſo, then our puniſhment, becauſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> hath no injuſtice in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by that actual tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are made ſinners, as well as he,
and ſo have in our ſelves, though new born, a juſt deſert of all the wages of ſin.
The Infant dying becauſe of that particular inherent ſin, which is in him, ſo that
it is both <hi>Adams</hi> and his own, in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, to anſwer this Argument, take notice, That though it be
of the will of God, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is made ours, for if he pleaſed, he might have
done otherwiſe; Yet we are not to ſay as the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> That God imputeth
this ſinne to mankind, meerly becauſe he will, as if the thing in it ſelf were indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent:
Even as God appointed things ſhould be unclean in the Old Teſtament
meerly and ſolely from his will, becauſe he had appointed ſo, for it is from his
Juſtice alſo, ſuch is the hatred of God againſt ſinne, and withall dealing with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
according to the Covenant of works, the curſe of that, if violated, would
deſcend from parents to children, as appeareth in <hi>Moſes</hi> his curſes, pronounced
againſt thoſe <hi>that ſhould not continue in the Law,</hi> it was to them and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Therefore ſome learned men expound that paſſage of Gods ſaying, <hi>The
child ſhall not die for the iniquity of his Father,</hi> which is alſo mentioned <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 29.
to belong to the Evangelical Covenant, but according to the Legal Covenant,
the child muſt ſuffer with the father, and this interpretation they urge, becauſe <hi>v.</hi>
31, 32. preſently followeth the declaration of Gods Evangelical Covenant, he
will make with his people: But let this prove as it can, this we muſt conclude of,
That God doth not impute <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne to us, meerly becauſe he will, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his Juſtice alſo inclining him thereunto. So that the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſpeak
too ſlightly of it, as if it were only a diſpenſative imputation to make way for
grace through Chriſt. But I ſhall hereafter have occaſion to ſpeak more fully
to this particular; as alſo to the other Objections, which may again frequently
interpoſe themſelves.</p>

have this Doctrine wholly buried; for man is naturally proud and ſelf-righteous,
hardly brought to be thought ſo miſerable a ſinner: If therefore any <hi>Doctors</hi> ſhall

Nature of it, or what it is; For that is not true of the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants,</hi>
which ſay, <hi>Original ſinne can be proved only by two or
three places;</hi> although if there were no more, it's certain, that
out of the mouth of two or three ſuch Divine Witneſſes, the Doctrine about it
may be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p>I come therefore and ſelect one or two places out of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that
ſo you may ſee this Truth was alwayes acknowledged in the Church of God, and
that even in the times of the Old Teſtament, where divine light and knowledge
was not ſo plentifully communicated, yet there was full and clear evidence about
this.</p>
                        <p>The Text I have read is deſervedly both by the ancient and later Writers
eſteemed a powerfull place, to prove our natural uncleanneſſe and ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
                        <p>To underſtand it therefore conſider, That whereas <hi>Job</hi> in the former verſes
had aſſerted the vanity and mortality of man, comparing him to a flower, which
though ſweet for a while, yet is preſently cut down. Thus all the comforts, all
the joyes thou haſt in this world, they are but a Poeſie, which have a pinne
within them to prick thee for the preſent, while thou ſmelleſt on them, and will
quickly wither away. But becauſe flowers alſo have ſome ſubſtance and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the preſent, in the next place he reſembleth our life to a ſhadow, which
as he ſaid was <hi>nigrum nihil,</hi> a black nothing; There is both emptineſs and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſs
in all theſe things; and hitherto all the Heathens have arrived, They
all perceived theſe miſeries and troubles we are obnoxious unto: But then in my
Text, we have the cauſe of this, which they were either totally or in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
ignorant of; God then did not make man like a ſhadow thus at firſt; but
ſinne brought this corruptibility into the world, and that not actual ſinne, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57719:41"/>
original; If there had been none but this, yet all theſe miſeries would have fallen
upon mankind.</p>
                        <p>In the words therefore we have a full and clear Deſcription of that <hi>original ſin
or birth-ſinne</hi> we are guilty of; Yea the Text ſaith, It is impoſſible, it ſhould be
otherwiſe: So that the Scripture, and thoſe that deny original ſinne are diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally
oppoſite one to another: They ſay, there is no ſuch birth-ſinne: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſaith, It cannot be, but that there muſt be ſuch an original contagion.</p>
                        <p>In the Text, we have the Interrogation, and the Anſwer; The Interrogation
is therefore put to ſhew the vehemency and peremptorineſs in affirming this truth,
it's more than if it had been barely ſaid, <hi>That none can bring a clean thing out of
an unclean;</hi> The meaning is, That every man being by nature unclean, it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that every one born of man therefore ſhould be unclean.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> is meant <hi>ſinne,</hi> as appeareth by comparing this with <hi>Chap. 15.
14. Chap.</hi> 25. 4. where you have this expreſſion uſed, and it is oppoſed to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and to be juſtified before God. It is therefore an uncleanneſs not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or bodily (as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old would have wreſted it) but ſpiritually
oppoſite to Righteouſneſs, and ſuch as depriveth a man of Juſtification: Yea,
the word unclean, is applied to ſignifie hainous pollution: Hence the Devils are
ſo often called unclean ſpirits, ſo that the Devils and mankind are in this
alike.</p>
                        <p>The Hebrew Prepoſition <hi>Min,</hi> is by ſome underſtood of mutation, by others
of origination, but one is neceſſarily connexed with the other; of mutation in
this ſenſe, <hi>Who ſhall give</hi> (for ſo it is in the Hebrew) that is, Who can make
pure, him that is impure? Who can change that which is naturally filthy? No
man by his free-will, or power can; or elſe it is for the originals, and that doth
ſeem the moſt genuine, for <hi>Job</hi> is ſpeaking what belongs to every man naturally,
and thus the ſenſe is, <hi>From that which is unclean, none can bring that which is clean:</hi>
Even as our Saviour ſaith in another caſe, <hi>None can gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
thiſtles,</hi> Mat 6. 16. or as the Apoſtle <hi>James, A ſweet fountain cannot ſend forth
bitter ſtreams, ſo neither can a bitter fountain ſweet ſtreams,</hi> Jam. 3. Now when
it is ſaid, <hi>Of an unclean thing cannot come a clean:</hi> Hereby <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is excluded, for he was made holy, and came not out of that which was
unclean; and alſo Chriſt is hereby excluded, for although he is ſaid to be <hi>born of
a woman,</hi> yet that was in a miraculous and extraordinary manner: As for
the Diſpute about the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe freedom from original ſinne, ſome
have with great vehemency maintained, that ſeemeth not any wayes probable,
as is to be ſhewed. It is alſo good to obſerve the emphatical expreſsion in the
word, <hi>Out of unclean thing,</hi> which implieth, That man by nature is all over ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

Theſe make the ſenſe to be, That God alone, and no other can deliver out of this
uncleanneſs. Hence alſo ſome make that expreſſion, <hi>Who can forgive ſinne, but

of that which is hot of it's own nature: So of unclean to make clean, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

as our Tranſlators do, and hereby is demonſtrated, That there is not one
in all mankind born in a natural manner, but he is ſinfull, and polluted: This
ſame is expreſſed more fully, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15 14. The <hi>Socinians</hi> give in their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                        </p>
                        <p>1. That which is <hi>corporal</hi> and <hi>bodily,</hi> man being born ſo loathſomly, that even
the Heathens have abhorred themſelves, becauſe of it, when they came into the
world: it did ſo debaſe them, that even the higheſt did refuſe thoſe hyperbolical
honours, which their flatterers would have put upon them. In the ſixteenth of
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> you have this bodily filthineſs at large deſcribed, and thereby is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the uncomely and impotent condition of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
to promote her own welfare, no more than a little Infant new born is able
to help it ſelf; Yea this place is alluſively brought by ſome to deſcribe our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
uncleanneſs: The child comes not more naked and polluted into the world
bodily, then the ſoul doth ſpiritually, being denuded of the Image of God, and
full of ſpiritual ulcers and fores, like a <hi>Job</hi> full of botches, like a <hi>Lazarus</hi>
all over ſpiritually ulcerous, though few take notice of this, and lay it to
heart.</p>
                        <p>2. There is a <hi>typical and ceremonial uncleanneſs,</hi> ſuch as was appointed in the
Law, of which there were two ſorts, one more hainous, and ſo did caſt a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and longer ſeparation from the company of men, and the publique worſhip
of God: The other leſs, and ſo more eaſily purified, and that in a ſhorter ſpace;
and the former kind of uncleanneſſes, We read <hi>Levit.</hi> 12. That a woman upon
her bringing forth a child was guilty of: Inſomuch that in the legal diſpenſation,
every woman that brought forth a child was to be ſeparated ſo many dayes, as
unclean to be kept from the publick worſhip of God, and at laſt to bring an
offering for to cleanſe her. Now it's diſputed, why God appointed ſuch a law
about a womans uncleanneſs, and purification in bringing forth children. Although
ſome, as <hi>Bonfretius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> make it to no more ſignification, than of other
impurities that were legall, yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, and <hi>Calvin</hi> are very poſitive,
that this was to informe them of the curſed and ſinnefull eſtate, that the child
was brought into the world with. The father and mother (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) by
this ceremony were taught with what humiliation and ſorrow they ought to look
upon that natural pollution, the infant was born in, and in his comment on the
place, he inſinuateth two Anſwers to thoſe two Objections, that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the typifying of original ſinne thereby, as that this uncleanneſs and ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification,
did belong to the child as well as the mother. For the Objectors ſay,
<q>It could not denote original ſin, becauſe it related to the mother only, and not to
the child;</q> but <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, it belongeth to both, and that by <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 22. it may be
proved. And <hi>Grotius</hi> preferreth thoſe Copies which have the plural number, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
their purification, relating to the child, as well as the mother: But <hi>Junius</hi> doth more
probably think, it belonged only to the mother. Another Objection is, That
the mother was longer unclean by a female, than a male, which if it were for
original ſinne, would argue the female had more of it, than the male. To this,
<hi>Calvin</hi> giveth this conjecture, <q>That therefore there might be ſo much ſpiritual
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57719:42"/>
ſignification to the female, that ſo the defect in circumciſion, the females not
being to be circumciſed, might be made up this way.</q> But the difference of
time is commonly attributed to a phyſical conſideration; Howſoever theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
be, yet <hi>Junius,</hi> as well as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth acknowledge, This was done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of original ſinne, though he had actual ſins alſo. As for the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
who <hi>offered according to the Law, when her time of purification was expired,
Luke</hi> 2. 22. if it did relate to the child, as well as the mother, that did not argue
Chriſt to be born in ſinne, no more than circumciſion argued a duty of putting
off the foreskin of the heart in him, but it was <hi>to fulfill all righteouſneſs,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now made ſubject to the Law. Not that ſuch a ceremonial uncleanneſs is ſtill
under the Goſpel-times, as ſome ignorant ſuperſtitious women think, for all ſuch
ceremonial Rites were aboliſhed by Chriſts coming into the world, onely in the
general, that Ceremony in the Jewiſh Church, did teach us the nature of birth-pollution.</p>
                        <p>3. There is a <hi>moral uncleanneſs, and that is ſinne, which is a pollution of the

is upon every Infant, though but a day, or an hour old; and of this uncleanneſs

                        <p>TO underſtand the foulneſs of it, let us firſt compare our ſpiritual uncleanneſs
with the worſt legal uncleanneſs in the Law, even that of Leproſie, and
we ſhall ſee, how fitly they agree. For</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>The legal unclean, eſpecially the Leper he was to keep aloof off from all men and
company, even his wife and children (only ſuch as were to provide neceſſaries for them)
and to cry, He was unclean, unclean.</hi> In what a ſad and miſerable condition did ſuch an
unclean perſon apprehend himſelf to be, no body to come near him, none to have
any civil commerce with him, but to ſit pining and mourning alone? Thus ought
every man in this original pollution, for by it he hath deſerved to be deprived of
every comfort, he is now curſed by the Law with all curſes thereof, ſo that no
creature in the world might give him any creature; The whole creation began to
groan, as ſoon as man fell: Hence it is, that though we truly ſay, Every man,
though in his natural condition hath a civil right to the comforts he enjoyeth, yet
he hath not an holy and ſanctified right, being not in Chriſt, ſo that what is our due
by nature, as ſoon as we are born, is hell and damnation, the wrath and anger of
God. Though we ſhould beg here as <hi>Dives</hi> did in hell for a drop of water, it might
be denied us; Oh miſerable then and unclean man, who is thus to ſtand aloof
off from all creatures and comforts, ſaying, Wo unto me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>The legal unclean perſon did make unclean every thing that be touched, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he laid his hand upon, that was preſently made unclean;</hi> yea, as appeareth,
<hi>Hag.</hi> 2. If he did touch any holy thing, he made that unclean, the holy thing
did not ſanctifie him. Now is not this too true in every man, who is by nature
ſpiritually unclean? The Apoſtle ſpeaks this with evident conviction to all that
will not wilfully ſhut their eyes, <hi>Tit. 1. 15. Vnto them that are defiled and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is nothing pure.</hi> So then what a loathſom Leproſie of ſinne is upon every
one by nature, that he defileth all he medleth with; if he eat, he makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
eating; if he work, he makes it unclean working; yea, if he prayeth, if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57719:43"/>
he heareth, he makes it unclean and impure praying and hearing to him: Oh what
a thunder-bolt ſhould this be in our ears! What a polluted wretch am I, that
in all places, at all times, in every thing I do, have this uncleaneſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me!</p>
                        <p>The uncleanneſs every man is born in, hath been partly conſidered, and a
compariſon made between every man in his natural eſtate, and the ceremonial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
perſon in the old legal conſtitution. Now that we may be the more affected
with this lamentable and wofull condition we are all born in: Let us conſider it
abſolutely in it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The uncleanneſs in the Text is not a natural or ceremonial, but moral unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
For although with us in our common ſpeech, and ſometimes in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>uncleanneſs</hi> is taken more ſtrictly for the pollution of the <hi>body</hi> in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
way, yet it is here taken largely for <hi>ſinne</hi> in the general, and therefore to
be <hi>righteous</hi> is the oppoſite to it, as <hi>Job</hi> 15. In this ſenſe it is uſed, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1.
where <hi>a fountain</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be ſet open for ſinne and uncleanneſs.</hi> Seeing therefore
the holy Ghoſt doth pronounce us all by nature to be unclean, yea ſo unclean,
that no power either humane or Angelical can make us clean; but it is God alone,
that maketh grapes to grow of theſe thorns, or rather turns thorns into vines:
Let us examine what is comprehended in this expreſſion <hi>unclean.</hi>

                        <head type="sub">What is comprehended in this Expreſsion Uncleanneſs.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>There is evidently declared the loathſom and abominable objects we are to
God, as ſoon as ever we have a being.</hi> We are unclean, that is, filthy, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
abominable, ſuch as the pure eyes of God cannot behold with the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:
Hence <hi>Job</hi> 15. 16. man is called <hi>abominable and filthy,</hi> ſo that no
Toad or noiſom creature can be more irkſom and loathſom to our eyes, than we
are to God, while abiding in this natural pollution: God indeed when he made
man at firſt, ſaw that all was exceeding good: If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
then there had the clean been brought out of the clean, then man would
have been glorious and comely, thirſting after, and drinking down righteouſneſs
like water, then the imaginations of the throughts of his heart would have been
holy and good, and that continually; but now we are become ſinfull, and thus
polluted of our own making; It is from us, that of once clean we are made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;
For although none but God can make the unclean clean, yet <hi>Adam</hi> by the
liberty and mutability of his will, did quickly make the clean unclean: Oh then
how deeply ſhould this thought pierce us, that we came into the world abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and loathſom in Gods eyes! The object of his wrath and diſpleaſure, finding
nothing of that holy Image in us, which was at firſt put into us: Oh conſider
how great, and glorious, and powerfull that God is, to whom thou art thus
loathſom! If all men and Angels ſhould abhorre thee, it is nothing to this, that
God abominates thee.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This alſo implieth, <hi>That we ſhould be loathſom and abominable in our
own eyes; that when we are grown up, and ſhall be truly informed upon what terms
we come into the world, we ſhould be as ſo many ſpiritual monſters in our own eyes.
Job,</hi> you ſee here, though ſo godly a man, and who had ſuch a glorious chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
given him by God himſelf, yet becauſe of this doth loath himſelf. The ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and ſores upon his body, for which he ſate abhorring of himſelf upon the
dung-hill, ſeem not more to affect him then this ſpiritual vileneſs and loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that is upon him. It's obſerved, That though <hi>Herod</hi> and others have kept a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57719:43"/>
feſtival Commemoration of their birth-day, yet we never read that ever any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man did ſo, (though <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, it's <hi>mos vetuſtus,</hi> and ſo not <hi>vituperabilis,</hi>
becauſe of the good uſe may be made of it) in the Scripture. Indeed the day of
their death hath been celebrated and called their birth-day, becauſe then, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
till then did they begin indeed to live; And if <hi>Solomon,</hi> meerly becauſe of the
miſeries and vexations that do accompany this humane life, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 2. praiſed
the <hi>dead</hi> above the living, and he that never had been, that was not born, better
than both: How much rather will this bold true, if we conſider, how man is
born in a ſinfull eſtate, and cannot but ſinne all the day long? Certainly, we
may ſay, it had been farre better thou hadſt never been born, if not new born,
if not delivered from this native filthineſs, as if thou muſt have a being, better
have been any bruitiſh creature than a man, better be a Toad, a Tyger, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
than a man, if not waſhed by the bloud of Chriſt from this uncleanneſs;
For although we have cauſe to bleſs God that he made us men, rather than bruit
beaſts, in reſpect of natural conſiderations, yet in a theological ſenſe, becauſe
they are not ſubject to hell and damnation, as man is, therefore their eſtate is not
ſo miſerable. For</p>
                        <p>In the third place, <hi>In that men is born unclean, thereby is proclaimed, That he
cometh into the world upon farre more dangerous and wretched terms, than other
creatures do.</hi> The bruit creatures they are not unclean; God doth not loath and
abhorre their young ones; They are not by nature the objects of his wrath, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they expoſed to eternal torments, but thus is the ſinfull off-ſpring of all
mankind; Thou canſt not ſee a worm crawling on the ground, thou canſt not
hear a ſnake hiſſing in the hedge, but thou mayeſt think theſe are not as bad as I
am, theſe have no ſinne in their natures, God is not angry with theſe, as he is
with mankind: For though Hiſtory report of a devout man, who ſeeing a Toad
fell a weeping, becauſe of the goodneſs of God, who had made him a man, and
not that Toad, yet upon the conſideration of original ſinne, he might as deeply
have mourned, becauſe he was worſe, than that Toad. Thou canſt not ſee the
fatted beaſts driven to the ſlaughter, but thou mayeſt ſay, They are happier than
I am, for they are killed, and there is an end of them, but I am a miſerable and
wretched man, born in ſinne, and if not cleanſed from it, muſt neceſſarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
to all eternity. <hi>Luther,</hi> while in the deeps, troubles and ſorrows of heart,
becauſe of his ſinne, had this paſſage, <hi>Oh quoties optavi me uunquam fuiſſe homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem!</hi>
He went from place to place, his heart aking and throbbing, crying out,
<hi>Oh that I had never been a man!</hi> So that by ſinne a man is not onely
made like the beaſt that periſheth, but worſe, for the beaſt periſheth totally,
but ſo ſhall not he.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>In our natural uncleanneſs is declared our manifeſt ſimilitude and
agreement with the Devils themſelves, that we and they are now under the ſame
conſideration, for man is naturally unclean, and the Devils have this appropriated
attribute all along the New Teſtament for the moſt part, that they are the unclean
ſpirits.</hi> The Devil is an unclean ſpirit, and man is unclean in body and ſpirit;
Hence becauſe of this natural pollution, we are all by nature the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
The Devils is ſaid to rule in us, and we are therefore under his Kingdom,
for being not born in a ſtate of grace, but of ſinne, we are therefore under his
dominion; and upon this ſuppoſition even in <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time there were exorciſms
uſed at the Baptiſm of Infants, which was not a Scripture inſtitution, no more
than giving honey and milk to the baptized child, which was very ancient, and
yet now laid aſide even by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church it ſelf, that amongſt other Rites in
Baptiſm, they had this of exorciſmes and inſufflation, by which they ſignified,
not that the child was poſſeſſed bodily with the Devil, but that it was under the
power of him. This <hi>Auſtin</hi> inſtanceth in, to <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> where he tels
him, <hi>Ipſe à toto orbe exufflandus eſſet, ſi huic exufflationi qua princeps mundi
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57719:44"/>
ejicitur for as contradicere voluiſt is;</hi> I mention not this to allow or commend that
Ceremony, for it was an abſurd one, though brought into the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>etimes,
for it had been happy, if the Church alwayes had contented her ſelf, with the pure,
plain and ſole inſtitutions of Chriſt, but to inform you, what even the ancient
Church thought about Infants new born, that they were wholly under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Devils. Yea the <hi>Heathens</hi> had ſome kind of confuſed knowledge about
this (as in time may be ſhewed) for they had a cuſtom with them of expiating
and cleanſing of their Infants, as being unclean.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>This expreſſion of uncleanneſs, doth denote our unfitneſs and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to come into Gods preſence, or to perform any holy duty,</hi> no more than a perſon
full of his vomit or loathſomneſs, or a man with the noiſom plague fores, is fit
to come into the preſence of a great King: As the legal unclean perſon, was not
to come into the Temple, or to touch any holy things; And this was typified in
<hi>Adam,</hi> when he was caſt out of Paradiſe, and flaming ſwords ſet to keep him out,
all this denoted, That God had excommunicated <hi>Adam,</hi> and (as it were) all
mankind in him, ſo that now they have no fitneſs or decency, no worth or ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
to any holy duty. And certainly, this ſhould deeply humble us, yea at
this our hearts ſhould tremble and move out of their places, to conſider, that
though none need God more than we do, none have more need to pray inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
to him, yet ſuch is our pollution, that we are not fit to pray, or to draw
nigh to God, yea, our duties, while performed by us, in this our original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
are a provocation to God, and they become new ſinnes; for if no clean
thing can be brought out of an unclean, then no clean prayer, no clean holy
duty can come from thee, who art unclean. It is true, though we are thus pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
it is our duty to pray; by our original Apoſtaſie we are not freed from
Gods commands, we are bound to pray, and to pray with as holy and heavenly
frame of heart, as <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity, but though it be our duty, yet we have loſt
all power and ability: Yea, and beſides this, there is an unfitneſs and unworthineſs,
even as when the frogs crept into <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s chamber: And to this <hi>Bernard</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>luded,
when he called himſelf, <hi>Ranuncula repens in conſpectu Dei,</hi> How dare ſuch a
loathſom frog as he, creep into the preſence of ſo holy a God? Certainly, if the
Angels, though without any ſuch blemiſh, yea not having the leaſt ſpot, do yet
not cover their feet, but their faces, the nobleſt part (as it were) becauſe of
the glorious and holy Majeſty of God, how much more muſt ſinfull and unclean
man? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. When the Prophet had beheld God in his glory, he crieth out,
though a regenerated man, <hi>Woe be unto me, for I am of pollutea lips!</hi> This made
him afraid to make mention of God: How then may every natural corrupt man,
cry out, Wo be to me, for I am not only a man of polluted lips, but alſo of a
polluted mind and heart!</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>This title of being naturally unclean, maketh us to be in the moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> to God that can be.</hi> To ſay, Man that is born of woman had been
miſerable, frail, ſubject to dangers and outward evils, would not have denoted
any immediate oppoſition to God, but calling him unclean and unholy; This
ſheweth, that we are by nature in direct contrariety to what he is, for he is by
nature pure and holy, yea it is that glorious Attribute which makes all others glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
becauſe his Wiſdom is holy Wiſdom, becauſe his Power is holy Power,
therefore it's admirable Wiſdom and Power; Hence thoſe Angels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. of all
the Attributes of God ſingle out that to celebrate, when they cry out, <hi>Holy,
holy, holy;</hi> Now man is born unclean and unholy, being herein directly contrary
to God: So that though man be indowed with many natural perfections, yet this
original uncleanneſs defileth them all; he hath reaſon, but it's unclean reaſon;
he hath an underſtanding, but it is an unclean underſtanding; he hath a will, but
it's an impure and unclean will; So that of all the ſeveral Arguments, which
man hath to humble him, he may chuſe out this, as the chiefeſt of all, crying
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57719:44"/>
out, <hi>unclean, unclean, unclean,</hi> why is it that upon the diſcovery of this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
to God, we do not more abhor our ſelves?</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>This attribute of uncleanneſs, proclaimeth the abſolute neceſſity of
Gods grace, and of Chriſts blood, for theſe only can make us clean.</hi> Did a man
truly conſider, how it is with him in regard of his birth-eſtate, he would tremble
to ſtay an hour in it, he would neither eat, drink, or ſleep, till he be delivered
out of it; for being wholly unclean, he can never, while ſo, enter into the kingdom
of Heaven: So that as no legal uncleanneſs was removed, but with ſome ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and waſhing, much leſs can any moral uncleanneſs be waſhed away without
Chriſts bloud; therefore that is ſaid, <hi>to cleanſe us from all our ſinnes,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7.
and without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion of ſinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. Oh
then this natural uncleanneſs ſhould teach us highly to eſteem Chriſts blood, for
we could never weep water enough, though our heads were fountains to waſh
us, nothing can get out this ſpot, but Chriſts blood! and this every Infant,
though but a day old needeth; Chriſts bloud then muſt purifie us, elſe we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,
and with this alſo there is requiſite grace, both juſtifying and ſanctifying,
for theſe alſo tend to the cleanſing of us; Juſtification that is partly a cleanſing
and awaſhing away of our iniquities, as God promiſeth, <hi>Zech. 13. 1. He would
ſet open a fountain for ſinne and uncleanneſs;</hi> a fountain, ſo that there is plenty
and fulneſs of grace to waſh away this filthineſs. Thus alſo <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. I will
ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs.</hi> Beſides
this, there is alſo grace ſanctifying neceſſary, and this is a formal internal clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of us; ſo that becauſe of this work of grace, we are made clean, yet not
ſo, but that we need ſome waſhing daily, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 10. He that is waſhed, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not ſave to waſh his feet, for this uncleanneſs will not in this life be quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, but is like that of the Leproſie, which ſtuck ſo to the wals of the houſe,
that though it were ſcraped off, yet it would riſe again, and ſo could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
till the very houſe was demoliſhed. Thus while death lay this
houſe of clay in the grave, there will alwayes be ſome uncleanneſs adhering
to thee.</p>

                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction. <hi>Can none bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Then
this ſheweth, <hi>That thoſe who from the youth up, have lived civil, ingenuous and
chaſte lives, are not to reſt in this, for thy nature is foul and loathſom, as well
as of all others, though thy life may be cleaner.</hi> The Snake hath a gliſtering
skinne, though ſhe hath a poiſoned body: Thus thou haſt a defiled ſoul, an
heart full of filthineſs, though thy outward converſation be unblameable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if an Infant but a day old be thus unclean, and needeth the bloud of
Chriſt to cleanſe it: Doeſt thou flatter thy ſelf with ingenuity and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?

                        <p>THe Doctrine of our natural uncleanneſs and ſinfulneſs by traduction from
<hi>Adam,</hi> being eſtabliſhed out of theſe words, we come to anſwer ſome
Objections; That as the ſhaking of the Tree, makes it root faſter and deeper, ſo
doubts about it, when cleared, may the more confirm us.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Objection, which I ſhall bring, ſeemeth in expreſs terms to deny any
ſuch uncleanneſs, at leaſt to Infants of bellevers: So that it ſhould ſeem, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
                           <pb n="56" facs="tcp:57719:45"/>
believers are clean; Therefore their children are brought clean out of them.
<hi>The place that gives fuel to this Argument is known, being much vexed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
in theſe dayes, eſpecially in the controverſie about Poedobaptiſm, it is</hi>
1 Cor. 7. 14. Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy; <hi>where it is
poſitively ſaid,</hi> That the children, though but of one believing Parent, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that anſwereth the Hebrew word in the Text; yea the contrary
to this is affirmed, That they are holy.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not range into all the controverſal Diſputes about this point, only in the
general we may ſay, That this place doth not at all contradict my Text,
for <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, That by nature <hi>none can bring a clean thing out of an unclean,</hi>
but if God by grace doth it, that doth not oppoſe <hi>Job;</hi> yea, we told you,
ſome render the later clauſe interrogatively; <hi>Art not thou he alone,</hi> viz. <hi>that can
bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Certainly, though no humane or Angelical
power can thus ſanctifie, yet God can; For, what do all thoſe glorified Saints
in Heaven made perfectly holy, but proclaim this, for they were once unclean,
and impure, but now God hath made them fully clean without the leaſt ſpot or
blemiſh? Thus there is no contrariety between theſe two Texts, for one ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of what we are in a natural way, the other, what ſome are by a gracious and
ſupernatural way.</p>
                        <p>But yet in the ſecond place, It's good to have a more thorow diſcuſſion of
theſe words, though not ſo amply, as polemical Divines have enlarged it; and
the rather, becauſe the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines do boldly and peremptorily charge it
upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as if they denied original ſinne in all the children of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
And although they cannot be ignorant in what ſenſe the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
this holineſs of believers children, yet they conſtantly calumniate in this
point, as if ſomething would ſtick upon them howſoever.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in the third place, there are three or four Interpretations, that are
competitors about this Text.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is of thoſe, who by uncleanneſs do mean a ſpurious baſtard-brood,
and by holy, a civil ſanctity, as it were, that is true and legitimate; as if the
Apoſtles meaning was, in anſwering the doubt of a believer, Whether they
might continue in marriage with unbelievers (for in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, all the <hi>Jews</hi>
that had ſo married, were commanded to put away their wives?) did inform them,
that their marriage would be lawful, otherwiſe their children would be baſtards, but
they were legitimate. Thus the <hi>Lutherans</hi> generally ſome of the Ancients are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
alſo, and <hi>Muſculus</hi> upon ſecond thoughts cometh off to this Interpretation,
confeſſing he had formerly abuſed it againſt <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> But this might eaſily be
rejected, if it were our buſineſs in hand: For,</p>
                        <p>1. Marriage even among Heathens, is true lawfull marriage, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are legitimate; for although their very marriage, as all things elſe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
to them in a ſanctified ſenſe, becauſe they are impure, yet marriage in it
ſelf is a lawfull thing to them, ſo that it is not to be judged fornication. And</p>
                        <p>2. The Apoſtles argument would not conclude, for thoſe that doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their marriage was lawful, would alſo have doubted, whether their children
were legitimate, and therefore this could not be an argument to prove their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
lawfull.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, There are ſome who underſtand this holineſs of inward
true inherent purity; ſo that their judgement is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, all godly
parents have holy children, and if it fall out otherwiſe in ſome caſes, they ſay,
it's an indefinite, not an univerſal propoſition, which if it be true, for the moſt
part, it is enough; but experience ſeemeth to confute this; Neither is believer
here taken ſtrictly, for one who did in a ſaving way believe, but largely for one that
did profeſs faith in Chriſt, and therefore is oppoſite to an Infidel; Now all that were
not Infidels, were not preſently, truly godly, though they did believe, as ſome are
ſaid, <hi>Joh. 2. To whom yet Chriſt would not commit himſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57719:45"/>
3. Therefore there are thoſe, who underſtand this of Heatheniſh uncleanneſs
and Idolatry, and ſo they ſay, One born of believing Parents, is free from that,
eſpecially, if we do regard the hopes that are in his education: Therefore
ſome expound this holineſs only in reſpect of the deſigning and dedicating of ſuch
unto real holineſs. Hence <hi>Eſtius</hi> he underſtands this, <hi>De filiis adultu,</hi> of children
grown up; For it may be ſuppoſed, That if the unbelieving husband will not
leave his wife, but abide with her, that therefore he will yeeld to her, and let her
educate her children in the faith of Chriſt, and be no enemy, or oppoſet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. is brought to expound this place; ſo that they make this
holineſs to be only <hi>quoad ſpem,</hi> and <hi>diſciplinam;</hi> For the believer may by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
godly life, gain both the unbeliever and the children; and thus <hi>Hierom</hi> is
ſaid to anſwer a Queſtion propoſed by <hi>Paulinus,</hi> concerning this place; <hi>Lapide</hi>
conſents to this, and oppoſeth <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> concerning this foederal holineſs,
as alſo <hi>Tirinus</hi> on the place, becauſe the Church is not like a civil Commonwealth,
but is a ſupernatural Society, ſaith <hi>Lapide;</hi> This is no Reaſon; for though it be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Society, yet God may give what ſpiritual priviledges he pleaſeth to
them and theirs; and therefore <hi>Salmeron,</hi> he underſtands this holineſs of a Church-holineſs,
that they are eſteemed children of that; And in his Comment on that
place, brings that Promiſe, which the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> uſe to do, <hi>I will be thy God, and
the God of thy ſeed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence the fourth and laſt Interpretation, which is juſtly deemed moſt genuine
and orthodox, is to expound this holineſs of a Covenant and foederal holineſs, of
a Church-priviledge, That being born, though but of one believing parent, yet they are not unclean, as <hi>Heathens</hi> and their children, who have no right or
claim to any Church-Ordinance, but are holy by the gracious favour and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God, who taketh in believers and their ſeed. When parents are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, their children alſo, or Infants are received in with them, not that all
are made internally holy, only they have a right to Church-memberſhip; and
therefore the initial ſign ought not to be denied to them: So that the hope of
godly education, or to be candidates of the true faith, is not enough, but both
are requiſite, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old mentioned, both <hi>ſeminis praerogativa,</hi> and
<hi>inſtitutionis diſciplina:</hi> Though therefore children of both, or one believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
are in this ſenſe clean and holy, yet by nature they are unclean; neither
doth this external holineſs deliver them from inward contagion; Yea, ſuppoſe
ſome ſhould be regenerated in the very womb, as <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was, yet this Text
holdeth true in him; for he was by nature unclean, he had not the holy Ghoſt by
natural deſcenſion from his parents, for then all children ſhould be ſo ſanctified,
but it was Gods grace and power that made him clean of unclean; <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt
therefore was conceived in ſinne, and by nature a child of wrath, but the grace
of God made him clean, yet not totally and perfectly, as if no uncleanneſs was
in him; for even <hi>Job,</hi> though in ſo high a degree ſanctified, yet ſpeaks this truth
in the Text, to himſelf as then, and at that time conſidered, not to what he
was once before his converſion, but even in that renewed eſtate he was in, if God
ſhould caſt his eyes upon him, and judge him with ſeverity, he would find much
uncleanneſs adhering unto him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond Objection is propounded by</hi> Socinus,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                           <hi>who ſaith,</hi> It cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that one actual tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould infect the whole nature of
man, one Act cannot contract an habit of ſinne: <hi>So then he ſaith,</hi> It's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that one ſinfull act, ſhould all ever defile <hi>Adam,</hi> and make him totally
ſinfull, much leſſe that it ſhould infect the whole nature of man. <hi>And the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants
<hi>they purſue this Argument,</hi> If (<hi>ſay they,</hi> Apolog, pro Confeſſione
exam. Cenſ. cap. 7. pag. 85.) that one act of ſinne did expel all grave in <hi>Adam,</hi>
then it did it, either <hi>quatenus peccatum,</hi> as it was a ſinne, and if ſo, then
every little ſinne the godly man commits, much more groſſe ſinnes would caſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57719:46"/>
him out of all grace, would root out the ſeed of God in him, which yet (<hi>ſay they)
the</hi> Calviniſts will in no wiſe endure; Or it cometh ſo from ſome <hi>peculiar
ordination,</hi> and divine appointment of God; If ſo, <hi>they bid us,</hi> bring out that
order, and manifeſt ſuch an appointment, that one ſinne onely ſhould deprive
a man of the whole Image of God, when now one ſinne doth not, or cannot
extirpate the habit of grace; but every godly man hath ſinne and grace alſo
in him.</p>
                        <p>To this many things are to be anſwered:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, That it is a vain and an abſurd thing to give leave to our humane reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that ſuch a thing cannot be, when the event diſcovers it is ſo. It is plain,
That upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual tranſgreſſion he was deprived of the Image of God
he was created in. <hi>Adam</hi> therefore having loſt that ſpiritual and ſupernatural
life, we need not curiouſly diſpute, how one ſtab, as it were of ſin could kill him;
Certainly, even the leaſt ſin is preſent poiſon, and would kill immediately, if Gods
grace did not prevent.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That one ſinne may ſuddenly deprive the ſubject of all Grace it
hath, appeareth plainly in thoſe Apoſtate Angels, Did not the firſt ſinne?
which was in them a thought or an act of the will, (what it was it is diſputed)
Did not that immediately throw them out of their divine and bleſſed Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
And by that one and firſt ſinne, was not a glorious Angel made immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
a black Devil? It is true indeed, We cannot ſay the Devils have original
ſinne, In this ſenſe, As if becauſe when the firſt Angel ſinned, all the reſt ſinned
in him, as if all their wils were bound up in him; No, They all ſtood upon their
own bottom, they all ſinned perſonally and voluntarily by their own actual
tranſgreſſion, though happily it might be by imitation and conſent to him that
firſt ſinned; yet for all this, we ſee plainly, that in every Apoſtate Angel, one
ſinne was enough to deprive him of all the good he had, and to fill him with ſuch
inveterate enmity to all goodneſs, That the Devil, though of ſuch natural
light in his conſcience, yet is not able to do one good work, or have the leaſt holy
thought.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Sinne doth expel grace, both formally, or (as ſome call it) effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
and meritoriouſly alſo; it expels it formally, as darkneſs doth light, as
diſeaſes do ſickneſs, or death, life, and meritoriouſly deſerving, that God ſhould
deprive us of all holineſs, and deny any further grace to us. The <hi>Remonſtrants</hi>
they call this folly and abſurdity, to ſay, <hi>Sinne expels grace actually and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
alſo; For if it do actually, what need is there of meritoriouſly? If a
man actually put out his eyes, it's abſurd to ſay, he deſerveth by that to have
them put out; Or if a man wilfully throw away his garments, making himſelf
naked, that he deſerveth to be naked.</hi> But theſe inſtances do no wayes enervate
this Truth; for in that ſinne doth thus actually and meritoriouſly alſo deprive us
of grace, we ſee the hainouſneſs of it; one ſheweth, how ſinne is in it's own
ſelf like poiſon that preſently kils, and the other, how odious it is to God, that
if it did not of it ſelf deprive us of ſpiritual life, yet it doth ſo provoke God, that
becauſe of it, God would not continue his daily grace to us. Beſides, though
ſinne doth formally expel the grace that is inherent in us, yet Gods grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, his preventing cooperating and continuing grace, without which we
could not abide a moment in the ſtate of grace, that it chaſeth away meritoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
only; So that <hi>Adam</hi> in his firſt ſinne did both chaſe away the Image of God
in him, and deſerve, that God ſhould withdraw his aſſiſting and preſerving
grace, without which he could not have continued in his good eſtate; yea, ſinne
doth ſo meritoriouſly expel grace, that could <hi>Adam</hi> by his own power, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
recovered himſelf, and inſtated himſelf into the condition he was
in, yet he deſerved for that former tranſgreſſion, that God ſhould have
outed him of all: As they ſay, A man that hangeth himſelf, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

to him by the Father; and indeed ſuch preſent meltings and remorſe of ſoul, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Nathan</hi>'s admonition, without any rage, malice, or fury at the Prophet,
who rebuked him, intimate, That the ſeed of grace was not quite overcome
within him.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>Pſalm</hi> it ſelf, that is Supplicatory, wherein <hi>David</hi> wreſtleth in ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
with God, for to obtain mercy, uſing ſeveral Arguments; One from the
<hi>Mercy,</hi> yea the <hi>multitude of mercy,</hi> that is in God: Another is, from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi>
and <hi>deep ſenſe of ſinne in his ſoul,</hi> he acknowledgeth it, and it is alwayes
before him, he never puts it out of his memory: Whither ſoever he goeth, and
whatſoever he is doing, ſtill his ſinnes are (as it were) ſo many Devils appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in horrid ſhapes before his eyes.</p>
                        <p>A third Argument is in the Text, from the aggravation of thoſe actual ſinnes
he committed; They were not ſinnes to be conſidered meerly in themſelves, but
from the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>root</hi> whence they ſprang, even the <hi>defiled and corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that was in him,</hi> it being not ſo much thoſe actual, though ſo horrid ſinnes
that made him ſo guilty, as that they did flow from ſuch a defiled fountain within
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57719:47"/>
him: Thus he aggravateth thoſe actual ſinnes from the root and cauſe within him;
For although he was regenerated, and ſo delivered from the dominion of original
corruption, yet it was with him, as with <hi>Paul,</hi> The Law of ſinne did ſtill warre
within him againſt what was good, ſinne dwelt in him ſtill, and was apt upon all
occaſions, like a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> to betray him into the hand of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> into
the power of ſome ſoul tranſgreſſions. It is true, ſome have thought, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſpeaks this to extenuate and leſſen his ſinne; as if his meaning had been,
<hi>Lord, it's true, I have committed theſe foul ſinnes in thy ſight, but they are the
more venial and pardonable, becauſe my nature is corrupt: It is no wonder, that
being not an Angel, or a man in integrity, as</hi> Adam, <hi>or confirmed in grace, as the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Saints in Heaven, but the ſon of corrupted</hi> Adam, <hi>that I have thus tumbled
into the mire;</hi> And it cannot be denied, but that this truth of our original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
may be pleaded, both for aggravation to puniſh, and alſo for pity to
ſpare: Hence <hi>Gen. 6. 5. Becauſe every imagination of mans heart, was only evil,
and that continually,</hi> therefore God was provoked to deſtroy the world by water,
yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 21. the very ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe a mans heart is evil from his
youth, is made a reaſon, why God will not ſmite the earth again with ſuch an
univerſal deſtruction. But it ſeemeth farre more genuine and conſonant to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
ſcope in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to make theſe words by way of aggravation; for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
is humbling and debaſing of himſelf, deſirous to juſtifie and clear God, and
therefore he layeth himſelf as low, as poſſibly he can, digging into the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of all that evil, which cleaveth to him.</p>
                        <p>In the words therefore we may take notice of the matter confeſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
with the introductory particle, to make it more conſiderable. It is
not an ordinary or ſlighty thing, he is to ſpeak of, and therefore he begins with
that note <hi>Behold;</hi> This <hi>Ecce</hi> may be called the <hi>Aſterisk</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, or
the Bibles <hi>nota benè;</hi> It is commonly uſed either for Attention or Admiration, or
Caution; and it may have this three fold uſe here.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>Attention,</hi> the matter being of ſo great concernment, ſo little minded or
believed by moſt men; for <hi>David</hi> doth not ſpeak here, as if it were his particular
caſe alone, as if none were born in iniquity, but him; yea, rather it followeth,
if <hi>David,</hi> though ſo eminent and godly, ſo bleſſed by God, was yet born in
ſinne, then no doubt, but all others are likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Again, It may be a note of <hi>Admiration,</hi> becauſe of the myſterious depth of
this original defilement: It is unſearchable, and the more he conſiders of it, the
more amazed and aſtoniſhed he is; even as <hi>David</hi> at another time, <hi>Pſal</hi> 19.
crieth out, <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> when he hath ſet himſelf with his
whole might, to ſathom all the evil that is in him, yet he cannot do it: Hence
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 17. ſpeaking of this deceitfull and deſperate heart of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the native pollution of it, ſaith, <hi>Who can know it?</hi> And then anſwers,
<hi>It's God alone that ſearcheth it,</hi> God knoweth the depth of all that evil, which
no man can reach unto.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It may be a note of <hi>Caution [Behold]</hi> and take heed of it; for you
ſee even <hi>David</hi> betrayed by it, the holieſt man that liveth may quickly and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall into the moſt enormous ſins, becauſe of it.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, we have the thing it ſelf confeſſed, and that is in two
things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> that is the firſt: The word is many times applied to
the bringing forth of a child, and doth properly ſignifie to bring forth with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and pain; Hence ſome render it, <hi>I was born in iniquity,</hi> and ſo it may very
well be tranſlated; but if we render it ſhapen, or formed, then this ſheweth,
That in the forming of the parts of the body, and diſpoſing of it for animation,
even then ſinne is there initially; ſo that before we are born, as ſoon as that maſs
is enlivened and animated, ſo ſoon is original ſinne in a man.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57719:48"/>
The other expreſſion is, <hi>That in ſinne did his mother conceive him;</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word is, <hi>Did warm him,</hi> or <hi>nouriſh him;</hi> So that this doth not ſo much
relate to the actual conception, as to that whole time his mother did bear him in
the womb, all that while this pollution was in him. Hence <hi>Aquila</hi> renders it,

                           </gap>, yet there are thoſe, who make that word em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical,

ſome inward heat did tranſport her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Others make it to ſignifie a multiform appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
from the colour of that Bird. Well, howſoever it be, the word from the
Hebrew is to be extended to that whole time, the child is carried in the mothers
womb, being warmed and nouriſhed there; So that not only, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of
old, we may ſay, <hi>Hominis ortus in vitio eſt,</hi> a mans birth is in ſinne, but as ſoon
as ever that maſs of fleſh in the womb is informed and animated, ſo ſoon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſinfull. It is true indeed, the parts of the <hi>body</hi> are along while in forming
before the ſoul be inſpired, and ſinne is not properly, till the ſoul be united to the
body, yet becauſe that is part of man, and tends to it, we may ſay ſinne is there
inchoatively and imperfectly, becauſe it is in tendency to make up man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was, that Chriſt being to be man, yet without ſin was to be conceived by the
holy Ghoſt, The very corpulent ſubſtance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> from which his
body was made to be purified and ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p>In the laſt place, we are to take notice, in what he is thus formed and born, and
that is alſo in two words, <hi>Gnanon</hi> and <hi>Cheteh,</hi> both which ſignifie, that which is truly
and properly a ſin: So that it's plain, when <hi>David</hi> could have no actual will, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his own, yet then ſin and iniquity was truly in him. This place therefore is
very evident and unanſwerable, to prove this, <hi>That all by nature are born in ſin.</hi> The
Fathers of old, before <hi>Pelagius</hi> aroſe did expound it ſo, and generally after <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>'s
time; The Popiſh Interpreters alſo grant it a clear place to prove this truth;
yea, the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> they from hence alſo prove original ſinne, and ſay, it hath
ſeven names in the Old Teſtament, whereof two that they mention, <hi>viz. The
fore-skin of the heart,</hi> and <hi>an heart of ſtone,</hi> are without all doubt applicable unto
it: Inſomuch that they who deny this Doctrine, in theſe dayes, muſt needs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
put a veil before their eyes.</p>
                        <p>It is true, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> hath a paſſage, which would ſeem to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                        <p>BUt let us hear, what is objected by the Adverſaries to this clear Text?
And</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                           <hi>It's ſaid by ſome,</hi> That <hi>David</hi> doth not here bewail his own ſins, but his
parents in begetting of him, as if it was their ſinne he acknowledged, and not
his own.</p>
                        <p>This is a miſerable ſhift;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for, Firſt, <hi>David</hi> was not begotten in adultery,
neither were his parents unlawfully joyned together, therefore in begetting of
him, they did not ſinne; for <hi>Marriage is honourable, if the bed be not defiled</hi>
with adultery or fornication: Therefore if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in the ſtate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
there would have been procreation of children; ſo that his parents did
no more ſinne in this, than in eating and drinking, or any other lawfull act
God hath appointed, either for the propagating of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or conſervation
of the <hi>individuums.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, This Interpretation is againſt the ſcope of <hi>David</hi> in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
which is to debaſe himſelf, to humble himſelf from what is in him, not what is in
others, <hi>I will acknowledge my ſinne, and my iniquity is alwayes before me,</hi> and ſo
proceedeth to bewail this original, or birth-ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If his intent were to confeſs his parents ſins, why doth he inſtance in
his <hi>mother only, In ſinne did my mother conceive me?</hi> he ſaith, Why did he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bewail the ſinne of his father, who begat him, who would have been a
greater ſinner, than his mother in that matter, if it had been a ſinne
at all?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly, It's good to take notice of what</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>in the Expoſition of this
place, though a Papiſt ſaith,</hi> It may be to prevent ſuch calumnies, that future
Hereticks would raiſe, the holy Ghoſt in this Text would uſe no word, that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and directly relate, either to the fathers begetting, or the mothers immediately
conceiving thereupon, for this might ſeem to attribute ſinne to that, which yet is of
Gods appointment, and if true, would neceſſarily condemn marriage, as unlawfull;
<hi>So that as he obſerveth, The words do properly relate to the child afterwards in
the womb, when formed and nouriſhed there.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A ſecond Objection is,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> That what <hi>David</hi> ſaith here is <hi>hyperbolical. Thus the</hi>
Socinians, <hi>David</hi> doth not mean, as if he were born in ſinne, but doth <hi>hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
aggravate his wickedneſs, in that from his youth up he did quickly fall into
ſinne, <hi>and they compare two places (amongſt others</hi>) Pſal. 58. 3. Iſa. 48. 8.
<hi>where wicked men are ſaid to be</hi> tranſgreſſors from the womb.</p>
                        <p>But firſt,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Seeing <hi>David</hi> intends to abhorre himſelf before God, there is no
ſenſe to go from the plain words, otherwiſe we might turn all the Scripture into
tropes and figures, and ſo make no certainty at all; And as for thoſe two places,
they confirm this Text, for how come men to be tranſgreſſors from the womb,
to act wickedneſs ſo early, to ſinne as ſoon as ever they are able to act any thing?
Doth not all this demonſtrate they were born in ſinne?</p>
                        <p>Beſides, thoſe places are not parallel, for they ſpeak of the facts of men after
they come out of the womb, and in ſuch particulars an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> may ſometimes
be admitted; but this relateth to <hi>David</hi> while in the womb, and not to his own
action, but that wherein he was paſſive.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly, Another</hi> Socinian <hi>ſaith,</hi> It is to be underſtood of actual ſinnes, and
not original, becauſe it is in the Plural number, whereas original ſinne is
but one.</p>

                           <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57719:49"/>
The Anſwer is, That indeed the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> they
render it in the Plural number, <hi>in iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. And thereupon it's diſputed by
the Schoolmen, Whether original ſinne be one or more ſinnes? Some (though
but few) ſay, it's more; Others, but one, and excuſe their vulgar Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by ſaying, that it may be called ſinnes in the Plural number, becauſe it is
the root of many, or becauſe it being a body of ſinne, hath (as it were) many
parts and members. <hi>Arminius</hi> likewiſe among other exceptions, brought this
againſt their publick Catechiſm, becauſe it ſaid <hi>Innata peccata</hi> in the Plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as if original ſinne were many ſinnes: But all this Diſcourſe is needleſs, for
in the Hebrew it is in the <hi>Singular number,</hi> and ſo our Tranſlators render it, and
that <hi>David</hi> cannot mean actual ſinnes, is plain, becauſe he was born in this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
he ſpeaketh of.</p>
                        <p>The Text then thus vindicated, firſt from the note of Attention, <hi>[Behold.]</hi>
Obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the true Doctrine about original ſinne, is not only to be believed, but we are
diligently to meditate and conſider about it. Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I was ſhapen
in iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Great will be the ſpiritual advantage, that a man may reap here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;

<hi>hyperbolize,</hi> he ſpeaks it not only <hi>humiliter,</hi> but <hi>veraciter;</hi> he doth in his own
experience, find that there is ſuch a bitter root within him, ſuch a corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that if left to it ſelf, would immediately flame out into moſt accurſed and
abominable tranſgreſſions; and therefore <hi>David</hi> knowing, that the ſtrength of
all his actual ſins, was in this original, he compoſeth himſelf in a ſerious and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
manner to acknowledge that.</p>
                        <p>That we are not only to believe there is ſuch a thing,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> as original ſinne in us, but we
are ſadly to bewail it, and to be humbled for it all our dayes.</p>
                        <p>This is not a truth in Divinity, that is to be in a ſpeculative and barren man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
diſputed about, but we are to deſcend into our own hearts, to diſcern the
wofull and bitter effects of it upon our own ſouls: It is not enough for you to be
of this ſaith, That there is original ſinne, that it is the ſinne of the whole world,
and of all mankind; but you are to take notice of, and to be affected with that
particular and proper original ſinne, which difſuſeth it ſelf over thy whole man:
Original ſinne is not one ſinne, as there is one Sunne, and all partake of the light
of it; or like one <hi>Intellectus agens,</hi> as ſome Philoſophers dreamed, but it is in
every man that cometh in the world, every one that is born hath his birth-corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;
Therefore <hi>David</hi> doth not ſpeak of that iniquity, as it is in all mankind,
but as it was his caſe, and as he was born in it: So that it is not enough for you
to ſay, It is true, it cannot be denied, but that all are ſinfull by nature, but you
muſt come home to your own heart, you muſt take notice of the dung-hill and
hell that is in your own hearts. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> as you heard, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
2. 3. to humble them, and to lay them low, that they might ſee all the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
and guilt that was upon them, before the grace of God was effectual in
them, he informeth them not onely of thoſe groſſe actual impieties they had
walked in, but that <hi>they were by nature the children of wrath.</hi> But you may ſee
this duty of bitter and deep humiliation, becauſe of original ſinne, notably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. moſt of that Chapter is ſpent in ſad groans and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
becauſe of its ſtill working and acting in him. It was the ſenſe of this,
made him cry out, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am?</hi> Doſt thou therefore flatter thy
ſelf, as if there were no ſuch law of ſinne prevailing upon thee, when thou ſhalt
ſee <hi>Paul</hi> thus ſadly afflicted becauſe of it? Therefore it is, that I added in the
Doctrine, <hi>We are to bewail and acknowledge it all our lives;</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks
here (whatſoever <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay to the contrary) in the perſon of
a regenerate man, <hi>Who did delight in the Law of God in the inward man;</hi> and yet
theſe <hi>thorns</hi> were in his ſide, <hi>Original ſinne in the luſts thereof, was too active,</hi>
whereby <hi>he could not do the good he would,</hi> and when he did, he did it not ſo pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57719:50"/>
and perfectly, as he ought. So that you ſee, the work you are to do, as long
as you live; Though regenerated, though ſanctified, you are to bewail this
ſinne, yea none but the truly godly do lay it ſeriouſly to heart. Natural men,
they either do not believe ſuch a thing, or they have not the ſenſe of it, which
would wound them at the very heart; Therefore we read <hi>only of regenerate men,</hi>
as <hi>David, Job</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who becauſe of this birth-pollution, do humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo low under Gods hand. But let us ſearch into this truth.</p>

<hi>David</hi> here profeſſeth altogether needleſs and ſuperfluous, but they go upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
grounds: <hi>For,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, All ſuch who do abſolutely deny any ſuch thing, they muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
all ſuch confeſſions to be lies and falſhoods, that it is but taking of
Gods name in vain, when we confeſs ſuch a thing by our ſelves, if it be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in us: For if <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Behold, God created me in iniquity,
and formed me in ſinne,</hi> would not this have been horrible lying to God, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheming
of his Name? No leſs is it; If their Poſition be true, <hi>That we are
born in the ſame condition and eſtate that</hi> Adam <hi>was created in,</hi> derogatory to
God, and a bold preſumptuous lie, for men in their prayers to acknowledge ſuch
a ſinne dwelling in them, when indeed it doth not; So then, if this be true,
That we are not born in original ſinne, then <hi>David</hi> doth in this penitential
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> fearfully abuſe the Name of God, ſpeaking that which is a lie, and a moſt
abominable untruth; But whoſe fore-head is ſo hardned, as to affirm this?
Yet all ſuch who deny there is any birth-ſinne, they muſt alſo ſay, there
is no confeſſion to be made of it, neither are we to humble our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Others there are, that though they hold it to be <hi>a ſinne, yet</hi> (they
ſay) <hi>it was abſolutely forgiven in Baptiſm; and if it was then totally forgiven,
what neceſſity is thereof confeſſion and acknowledging it afterwards?</hi> That <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne was forgiven to all that were baptized,</hi> was the opinion of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who
yet did more earneſtly propugn this Doctrine of original ſinne, than any of the
Fathers: Yea in his time, theſe two ſeemed to be <hi>Catholick Doctrines</hi> of the
whole Church, <hi>viz.</hi> an univerſal efficacy of Baptiſm in all Infants baptized, to
purge away original ſinne, as alſo the neceſſity of damnation of thoſe Infants
which died without it. The Papiſts alſo, they generally conclude, <hi>That this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne is forgiven to all baptized perſons;</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> in his Expoſition of this
place, approveth this Poſition, <hi>That it is not to be confeſſed;</hi> Yea, it cannot be
denied, but that ſome learned Proteſtants, adverſaries both to <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi>
as <hi>Davenant, Ward,</hi> have affirmed alſo, <hi>That all baptized perſons
have their original ſinne forgiven them, and ſo dying in their infancy, muſt without
doubt be ſaved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly, There are others, and ſuch are the</hi> Remonſtrants, <hi>who affirm,</hi> That
upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall. God entring into a new Covenant of Grace with fallen mankind,
by Chriſt our Mediator; Therefore it is (<hi>they ſay</hi>) that none is damned for ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, no not Heathens or their children, but that by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> viz.
Chriſt, there is taken off all that guilt which came by <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion. <hi>So
that in this reſpect, they make the children of Heathens, and believers all alike:</hi>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57719:51"/>
So that by theſe mens Poſitions, though going upon ſeveral grounds, we ſee it
affirmed, That original ſinne is pardoned, and that before there is any confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
humiliation and ſorrow for it; Whether indeed, though it be pardoned,
ſome of the fore-mentioned Authors will not hold it neceſſary to confeſs it, and
to beg for the pardon of it, may well be doubted, (I ſay, ſome of them)
For how prophanely and arrogantly doth a Remonſtrant <hi>Adolphus Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
in his <hi>Apologia contra Miniſtros Dordracenos,</hi> ſpeak in this matter,
as he is cited by <hi>Sandaus</hi> the Jeſuite (for I have not the Book it ſelf) in his
<hi>Hydrus Hollanda, lib. 2. cap. 20. pag.</hi> 268.) where, when from the diverſity of
opinions about original ſinne, he concludeth, <hi>There is ſcarce any certainty about
it,</hi> addeth, <hi>Etiam hinc intelligi poteſt, nihil eſſe, quia nemo in ſe reperiat, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
conſcientiae, vel accuſationem suiipſius ob peccatum ante quinquies mille, &amp;
quingentos annos in Paradiſo comiſſum; Ego ſaltem non ſenſi, nec credo Derdrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
fratres propter illud vel ingentem conſcientiae ſtimulum perſenſiſſe, vel copiam la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymarum
profudiſſe:</hi> How wretchedly doth this man ſpeak? Certainly <hi>David,</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> had other apprehenſions of this original ſinne, with the immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
thereof. For the Orthodox hold againſt the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> 
                           <q>That though
our ſins be pardoned, yet we may, yea, ought upon ſpecial occaſions to confeſs
them, and to renew our humiliation again for them, as <hi>David</hi> prayeth,
<hi>God would not remember the ſinnes of his youth;</hi> and here in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he
prayeth to be <hi>purged</hi> and <hi>waſhed,</hi> which relateth to all that uncleanneſs both
original and actual, he had formerly confeſſed: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth ſeveral
times with humiliation and ſelf-debaſement make mention of his former perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and blaſphemies he had been guilty of.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly. Whatſoever may be the opinions of men about this ſinne, either
denying it wholly, or making it univerſally pardoned to all mankind, or at leaſt
to ſome when baptized, of which more is to be ſaid, when we treat of the effects
of original ſinne; Yet from this example of <hi>David,</hi> and from other Texts of
Scripture, we ſee, <hi>It is our duty, as long as we live in this world, to groan under
it, and bewail our miſerable condition, becauſe of it.</hi>

                        <p>LEt therefore <hi>David</hi>'s example here in the Text, be more to thee, than what
ten thouſand cavillers may ſay unto thee, onely you muſt know, that
when we ſpeak of ſorrow and repentance about this ſinne, we may take repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<hi>largely</hi> or <hi>ſtrictly</hi> for any kind of <hi>holy ſorrow</hi> and humiliaton of ſoul, and
that <hi>becauſe God is diſpleaſed with us,</hi> becauſe we have that which is contrary to
his holy Law, and ſo is offenſive to him, and damnable to us; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
we are in a deep meaſure to humble our ſelves for original ſinne, as being
a moſt grievous and hainous ſinne, the guilt whereof would preſs us into the
loweſt hell, did not Gods grace interpoſe, or elſe it may be <hi>ſtrictly</hi> taken for a
<hi>change of our mind,</hi> or an alteration of that purpoſe and will we once had: Now
in this ſtrict ſenſe, though it be our duty with ſorrow to be humbled for original
ſinne, yet we cannot be properly ſaid to repent of it, becauſe it was not a ſinne
ever committed by us perſonally, or through our own actual will. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we may not ſo properly (it may be) exhort men to repent of this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, yet we muſt preſs them to a deep and daily humiliation under it, and
that not as a puniſhment, or an affliction only, but as a true and proper ſin; So
that as without confeſſion and ſorrow no actual ſinne will be forgiven unto a man,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57719:51"/>
ſo neither will original ſinne, and therefore we do by conſequence in the Lords
Prayer, when we ſay, <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes,</hi> pray not onely for the pardon of
actual ſinnes; but original alſo, whatſoever the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſay, neither is their
Argument againſt it of any worth, when they ſay, then the meaning likewiſe is
in the clauſe following, <hi>That we forgive men their treſpaſſes,</hi> and their original
corruption againſt us, for the compariſon lieth not <hi>in the Nature of the ſins,</hi> but
<hi>the manner of forgiveneſs;</hi> otherwiſe, when the Church prayeth for the pardon
of Idolatry, or any ſinne againſt the firſt Table, adding, <hi>As we forgive others,</hi>
the meaning ſhould be, As we forgive them their Idolatries, or ſins againſt the
firſt Table, which would be abſurd and blaſphemous. Beſides, we are not onely
to forgive the actual treſpaſſes of thoſe who wrong us, but even their thoughts
and inclinations to hate us; If therefore original ſinne be a ſinne, and will damn
us without Chriſts bloud, and Gods gracious pardon thereby, then we pray for

of original ſinne, either actual ſinnes or original?</q> If original, why then
are they called the reliques of it? Yet we may ſay, The phraſe is very proper,
for it ſuppoſeth original ſinne not to be wholly extinct, but buſie and acting,
even in the godly, and therefore we may truly ſay, <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. complained
of the reliques of it.</p>
                        <p>It is our duty (we heard) from this example of <hi>David,</hi> to humble our ſelves
for the original ſinne that is in us, as long as we live. Hence whatſoever <hi>Auſtin</hi>
ſaid at other times, yet in one place he ſpake moſt truly in this point, <hi>Propter
vitium quantum libet praeferimus, eſſe nobis neceſſarium dicere dimitte nobis
debita noſtra, cum jam omnia in Baptiſmo dicta facta, cogitate dimiſſa ſint.
(Epiſt.</hi> 29) Becauſe of original ſinne, although we have never ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited,
yet we are to pray, that God would forgive us our ſins.</p>
                        <p>This truth is the more diligently to be preſſed upon us, by how much the
more doctrinal opinions have riſen up againſt it; for thoſe that deny any ſuch
thing, they muſt needs make confeſſions of it to be a lie, and a meer mockery.
And as for the Papiſt, though moſt of them hold original ſinne to be truly a ſinne,
yet they ſay, Baptiſm is inſtituted for the remiſſion of that, as repentance is for
actual ſins: So that it ſhould ſeem by their Doctrine, Confeſſion and godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
are required only to take away actual ſinne; but as for original, Baptiſm in
the very <hi>opere operato</hi> doth remove it; for no Infant can put an <hi>obex</hi> to hinder the
effect of that Sacrament: Hence it is that <hi>Almain</hi> a rational Schoolman, (<hi>Opuſ. de
peccato orig. pag.</hi> 72.) maketh this Objection, <q>Suppoſe an <hi>adultus,</hi> a man
grown up, be to baptized, and at that very time he puts ſome <hi>obex</hi> by a groſs
ſinne to hinder the fruit of Baptiſm; How then can that man (ſaith he) ever
have his original ſin pardoned; for there is not a ſecond Baptiſm, and repentance
is only to take away actual? To this he anſwers, That ſuch a man is not indeed
either to have attrition or contrition, or confeſſion of original ſinne; for as
it was not contracted by our free-will, ſo it doth not require ſuch a nolition,
whereby I would not have been born in it;</q> Therefore ſuch a man, in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is to repent of that ſinne which was the <hi>obex,</hi> and then when that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of, original ſinne is forgiven by the very receiving of Baptiſm. I bring
this inſtance, to ſhew, That according to the Popiſh Doctrine, which yet holds
original ſinne, yet there is to be no ſorrow, no contrition or confeſſion, yea
that we are not to have a nolition of it, becauſe it was not committed by our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> likewiſe (<hi>lib. 1. de Sacramento Baptiſmi, cap.</hi> 9) ſaith, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginale

                        <head type="sub">The Difference between Godly Sorrow for Original Sinne and Actual.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>Repentance, or change of our minds and wils, is not ſtrictly and properly
for original ſinne, becauſe that was not actually committed by, us</hi> neither was it
ever in our own ſingle perſons to have prevented it, yet in reſpect of ſorrow,
deteſtation, and ſelf-abomination, ſo we are as much, if not more, to bewail our
ſelves, than for actual ſin.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Again, In actual ſins, there is this neceſſity in our repentance,
<hi>That we do ſo no more,</hi> he only truly repents, that doth not commit thoſe groſs
ſins again, at leaſt not <hi>habitually or cuſtomarily,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid to one, <hi>Go
thy way, and ſin no more;</hi> but this will not hold in original ſinne, we cannot
ſay, we will have it no more within us, we cannot ſay, this <hi>Jebuſite</hi> ſhall abide no
longer within our borders, for we ſhall alwayes carry about with us this body
of ſinne.</p>
                        <p>And therefore in the third place, Original ſinne and actual differ exceedingly
in this, That actual ſinne when pardoned, both the ſinne itſelf, and it's guilt is
removed, but in original ſinne, though the guilt be removed in the godly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it imputable to them, yet the ſinne it ſelf in ſome meaſure and power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
with us, as is more largely to be ſhewed in time; Onely you ſee ſome
difference there is, in our ſorrow and humiliation, between original and actual,
yet not ſuch, but that in <hi>reſpect of deep confeſſion, and humble acknowledgement,</hi>
both are alike; ſo that we cannot have any pardon of either without ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
hearts, as the Scripture ſpeaks of; and it is good to conſider the grounds,
why we ought to be greatly debaſed, and to lay our ſelves ſo low under this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

                        <head type="sub">Reaſons why we muſt be humbled for Original Sinne.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>Becauſe original ſinne is in ſome ſenſe all ſinne;</hi> It is the univerſal conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of all the parts of the ſoul; it hath <hi>Maculam univerſalem,</hi> all actual ſins
they have only their particular ſpot or ſtain, and do more immediately pollute
that power or faculty of the ſoul, it is immediately ſubjected in, as blindneſs of
mind doth properly infect the underſtanding, not the will or affections: ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy
in the will, doth not but by conſent or ſympathy, as it were, infect the
mind, but original ſinne doth pollute all over, it's like a Gangrene over the whole
body, whereas actual ſinnes are like ſo many ſeveral ſores: Thus original ſinne
is univerſal ſubjectively, there being no part of a man, no not his mind, or his
conſcience, but it is all over defiled, whereas no actual ſinne hath ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
defilement with it: Oh then what cauſe is here, why our hearts ſhould bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
mourn and even roar out, for this ſinne makes thy ſoul all over like a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor!
Thou mayeſt behold thy ſelf in the glaſs of Gods word, and not ſee one
fair ſpot; it is a leproſie upon the whole ſoul, ſo that it leaveth nothing good in
thee. It's true, the ſubſtance and faculties of thy ſoul are left ſtill, yet they are
ſo corrupted and vitiated, that in a moral conſideration there is nothing whole or
ſound in them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, From hence it is, <hi>That it hath as it were an univerſal guilt,</hi> it
makes the <hi>underſtanding</hi> guilty, the <hi>will</hi> guilty, the <hi>affections</hi> guilty, even guilt
all over; Every actual ſinne hath its <hi>proper formal guilt;</hi> the guilt of theft is one
thing, the guilt of adultery is another thing, but now original ſinne is as it were
an univerſal guilt: As God is that <hi>bonum, in quo omnia bona,</hi> ſo in ſome ſenſe original
ſinne is that <hi>malum, in quo omnia mala,</hi> not onely effectively, of which in the
next place, but becauſe of the general guilt accompanying; For as it hath a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>maculam,</hi> ſo it muſt have ſuitably a general <hi>reatum.</hi> This is greatly to be
laid to heart; for as original righteouſneſs was not the perfection and glory of
one faculty only, but the univerſal rectitude and general harmony of the whole
man; Thus original ſinne is not any particular guilt of one kind of ſinne, but
it's the ataxy, the diſſolution of that curious workmanſhip which God at firſt
made in man, and ſo is a general guilt; and therefore the more are we to bewail
this condition, ſaying, Lord, It is not one or many ſins, it is not this, or that
peculiar guilt I am to humble my ſelf for, but I am all over guilty, as the Land of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to be, <hi>Iſa. 1. 6. From the ſole of the foot to the head, there is no
ſoundneſs, nothing but wounds and putrifying ſores.</hi> Thus are we to judge of our
ſelves in reſpect of this overſpreading contagion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, We are greatly to bewail and humble our ſelves under this birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollution,
<hi>Becauſe it's the fountain and root of all the actual evil we do commit.</hi>
This is enough, if there were no external temptations to plunge us into all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.
I ſhall not here diſpute it rigidly, Whether every ſinne committed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of that original defilement within us, of that we are to ſpeak hereafter. It
is enough, that the Scripture doth attribute all actual evil to this, as the cauſe,
<hi>Jam. 1. 17. Every one is tempted and drawn aſide by the luſt which is within him;</hi>
and <hi>out of the evil heart, as an evil treaſure,</hi> our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat. 12. 35. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all evil thoughts, words and actions.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Geneſ. 6. The imaginations of
the thoughts of a mans heart are evil, and that continually,</hi> but of this more in its
time; onely take notice of this conſideration in this place, as a full and clear
ground, why thou ſhouldſt with all thy might all the dayes thou liveſt, abhorre
thy ſelf, and loath thy ſelf: It's from this original ſinne <hi>David</hi>'s adultery and
murder did flow: And thus there is no actual iniquity, which lieth as a load upon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57719:53"/>
thee, but it did flow from this bitter fountain at firſt: Wilt thou therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the fruit of a Tree, and not much rather the root? Wilt thou abhorre the
ſtream, and not much rather the fountain? Oh remember that here lieth the
ſtrength and power of ſinne, and therefore the ſtrength of thy ſorrow ought to
bend that way likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, We are deeply to humble our ſelves for this birth contagion, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in it ſelf it is a moſt grievous and hainous ſinne.</hi> It's a diſpute, Whether ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne be not <hi>graviſſimum peccatum,</hi> the heavieſt and greateſt ſinne that is;
It is true indeed, many ſins may exceed this in ſeveral reſpects, but yet if we lay
all things together, we have cauſe to judge it the heavieſt ſinne that is; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> minceth the matter, and ſaith, it is <hi>minimum, peccatum,</hi> the
leaſt ſinne in this reſpect (though he acknowledge it very hainous otherwayes)
becauſe it hath <hi>minimum de voluntario,</hi> yet we muſt not judge of the greatneſs of
a ſinne by a Philoſophical notion, but according to the judgement of God, who
beſt knoweth the hainous nature and guilt of ſinne; now by Gods puniſhing of
it in ſuch a manner, it appeareth to be the greateſt ſin, the event doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
it; In that we read not of any ſinne puniſhed by God in ſuch an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as original ſinne was in <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt parent, in whoſe loms we are; For
whereas all other ſinnes bring only the temporal and ſpiritual curſe upon the
offender himſelf, this doth upon all mankind: Indeed God doth viſit ſometimes
the ſins of Parents to the third and fourth generation, but here it is as long as
there ſhall be a generation: And beſides, it's not onely temporal evils we ſuffer
for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, in which reſpect many may ſuffer for other mens ſinnes, as in
<hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>David</hi>'s caſe, but it is in ſpiritual deſtruction likewiſe, all mankind is
obnoxious to eternal damnation for this tranſgreſſion: That therefore muſt
needs be an horrid ſinne, and of a crimſon nature, for which we ſee God to be ſo
ſevre, yea not only mankind, but all the creatures likewiſe are curſed for this; ſo
that had not God provided a new Covenant of grace for ſome of mankind thus
fallen, the whole race of men, would have been eternally damned, and that for this
ſinne alone, though there had not been one actual ſinne committeed in the world
by any one man ſince the fall: Oh then tremble under this conſideration, becauſe
the anger of God is thus ſtirred up againſt that one ſin, morethan all the ſins that
are committed! For though the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt be in this reſpect
more terrible than original ſinne, becauſe God will never pardon that, whereas
original ſinne is pardoned to all believers, and as Antiquity hath thought, even to
<hi>Adam</hi> himſelf; yet in other reſpects, original ſinne is in a more extenſe and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
manner curſed than that: Do not then go to extenuate this ſinne, to ſay,
It was but the eating of ſome for bidden fruit; or original ſinne, it hath none of
my will, I cannot help it (for we joyn original, imputed, and inherent at this
time together, becauſe of their inſeparable connexion;) but rather conſider
the great anger of God that is gone out againſt all mankind, becauſe of
it, and then thou wilt look on it with the ſame abborring eye that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
doth.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, We are greatly to bewail this original defilement, <hi>Becauſe it makes
us wholly incurable, it depriveth us of all ſpiritual ability and power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
our ſelves;</hi> We are thus ſhapen in iniquity, and ſo muſt live and die, and
go to hell in it, if Gods grace doth not interpoſe: Doth not <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 14. 4.
make it impoſſible for any man, <hi>to bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> So that
all mankind is born in an abſolute impotency to help it ſelf, if we would give
thouſands of worlds to come out of this loſt eſtate, we could not help ourſelves:
Hence it is that the Scripture attributeth all the good we have to the alone free
grace of God.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, We are to bewail it, <hi>Becauſe it makes us ſenſleſs, ſtupid, depriving
us of all ſpiritual ſenſe and feeling:</hi> So that by it we are put into this ſad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piexity,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57719:53"/>
for none need, or are bound more to bewail this ſinne, than an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
man, and yet he cannot ſend forth the leaſt ſigh and groan, becauſe of
it: So that hereby we have contracted ſuch an unavoidable exigency upon us,
that we cannot turn our ſelves any way; mourn and cry we muſt for this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
yet mourn and cry we cannot, becauſe this is one inſeparable effect
of it, to take away all tenderneſſe and mourning: Hence the ſtony heart
mentioned by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 11. 18. is in a great meaſure original ſinne: Till
therefore we are regenerated, as we ſee in <hi>David, Job</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> we cannot truly
mourn under it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, This is a work to do as long as we live, <hi>Becauſe it's inſeparable
from our natures, while we live in this world.</hi> God indeed could in our
life time, wholly free us from it, as well as at death, but he lets theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
continue, that our tryumph at the Day of Judgement may be the greater,
<hi>Vivum captivum reſervantur ad tryumphum,</hi> Captives are preſerved alive for
the greater trymph; And the rather God doth this, that ſo even his
very <hi>Pauls,</hi> his moſt eminent and choiceſt ſervants may have matter of
debaſement within themſelves, and more earneſtly groan for a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of the Chapter, the Apoſtle informeth
us, That no Goſpel priviledges, or Evangelical grace
amplified to the higheſt, may encourage to ſinne, for the
Apoſtle maketh an Objection himſelf from the Doctrine
he delivered; If grace abound where ſinne doth abound,
then why may not we ſinne more, that grace may abound
more? Thus there have alwayes been ſome who have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bread into ſtones, and fiſh into ſerpents, making the
grace of God to exclude our duty, and a tender care
againſt ſinne. But the Apoſtle, as if blaſphemy were in this Objection, tryeth
out, <hi>God forbid;</hi> You ſee with what indignation and deteſtation we ſhould look
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57719:56"/>
upon all thoſe Doctrines, which under pretence of advancing Grace, do cry
down Duties and an holy life, making it a legal and a ſervile thing.</p>
                        <p>Now the Apoſtle bringeth an Argument againſt indulgence in ſinne, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Gods grace, Becauſe we are dead to it, and then how can we live to it?
Would it not be a monſtrous, and an afrighting ſight, to ſee dead men come out
of their graves, to live and walk amongſt us? Thus alſo it ought to be no leſs
wonderfull, yea terrible, to ſee a Chriſtian give himſelf to any evil way. And that
we are dead to ſinne, he proveth by our Baptiſm, concerning which he ſpeaks
admirable and ſublime matter: So that if we conſider what great things are here
ſpoken of it, we may wonder to ſee, how cold and rare our meditations are about
it; for he makes it to be that Sacrament, in the right uſe whereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we put on
Chriſt, yea that thereby we are ingraffed and implanted into him: Hence <hi>ver.</hi> 5.
he uſeth that word <hi>of being planted into him;</hi> a metaphor from the Husbandman,
who by planting his Science into, another ſtock, doth thereby make it partake
of the life or death of the Tree; if the Tree liveth, that liveth; if the Tree di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that dieth; ſo it is with us and Chriſt. By the phraſe then is intended no
more than our communion with, and intereſt in Chriſt, and that both in his
death, and his reſurrection: For you muſt know, that the Scripture doth not
only make Chriſts death and reſurrection to be the cauſe of the death of our ſins,
and of our ſpiritual reſurrection to holineſs, but alſo makes them types and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances
of ſuch things in us, That as Chriſt died in his paſſible body, ſo we
ſhould die to ſinne; and as Chriſt after his death did riſe again to glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
thus we ſhould riſe out of ſinne, to walk in newneſs of life, and both
theſe are ſignified in Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>1. Our Communion with Chriſt in the efficacy of his death and reſurrection.</p>
                        <p>2. The Repreſentation of this; that what was corporally done to Chriſt,
ſhould be ſpiritually fulfilled in us; and therefore ſome think, that the Apoſtle
doth allude to that primitive Rite and Cuſtom which was in baptizing; when the
baptized party was firſt put under the water for a little ſeaſon, which repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſts burial, and our death to ſinne. 2. There was the emerſion, or riſing
again out of the waters, which ſignified Chriſts Reſurrection, and alſo our riſing
again to holineſs and godlineſs.</p>
                        <p>This is the Summe of the Apoſtles diſcourſe concerning Baptiſm in its ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
ſignification, which he amplifieth further in my Text, and that as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why we ſhould not live to ſinne who were baptized into Chriſt, <hi>viz. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Old man is crucified with Chriſt;</hi> Both becauſe Chriſt in being crucified
did ſubdue thereby the dominion of ſinne, and alſo we are to do to the body of
ſinne within us, what was done to Chriſts body, to crucifie it, and thereby to
deſtroy it. There is nothing more to be enquired into in the Text, but what is
meant by our <hi>Oldman?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They limit it too much that underſtand it only of the habit, or acquired cuſtom
of ſinne, which we live in before Regeneration, as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeemeth to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
But we are to take it, as both Popiſh and Proteſtant Commentators do
interpret it, for that vicious and corrupt nature, which we all derive from <hi>Adam,</hi>
putting it ſelf forth into ſeveral luſts and ungodly actions, wherby there is an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
inveterated cuſtom at laſt in ſin; ſo that although we may underſtand luſts
and actual impieties with long cuſtom therin, under the phraſe of the <hi>Old man,</hi> yet
principally and chiefly we are to interpret it of that polluted nature we have from
<hi>Adam;</hi> and this will eaſily appear to be ſo, if you conſider the other two places,
where this expreſſion is uſed, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 22. That ye put off the Old man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
that ye put on the New man.</hi> Col. 3. 9, 10. <hi>Ye have put off the Old man with his
deeds, and have put on the New man.</hi> Where,</p>
                        <p>1. You ſee the <hi>Old man</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from the effects and deeds of it, which
are actual ſins. And then</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57719:56"/>
2. <hi>Old man</hi> and <hi>New man</hi> are made two immediate oppoſites; now the <hi>New
man</hi> is plainly expreſſed by the Apoſtle, what it is, <hi>viz.</hi> not ſo much actual ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
as the Image of God repaired in us, ſo that as the <hi>New man</hi> is the Image of
God, and that holy nature repaired in us, ſo the <hi>Old man</hi> is the contrary to this,
<hi>viz.</hi> a deprivation of that Image of God, and and an univerſal pollution of all the
whole man: So that whereas ſometimes the word <hi>Old</hi> is uſed abſolutely, as the <hi>old
Serpent</hi> (there is no new Serpent) which is the Devil; So here its uſed comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and called <hi>Old</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>New man,</hi> the work of grace ſucceeding therein.</p>

                        <p>HAving therefore hitherto ſhewed the <hi>Quod ſit</hi> of original ſinne, <hi>That there
is ſuch a thing,</hi> maugre all adverſaries, and that by the mouth of <hi>two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi>
out of the New Teſtament, and two out of the Old (not but that there
are many more, only I ſhall (God willing) treat on them upon ſome different
notions.) I now come to inform you of the <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> What it is; for here is
much oppoſition likewiſe; And becauſe in knowing what a thing is, there is the
<hi>Quid nominis,</hi> and <hi>Quid rei,</hi> what the name is, and what the thing is.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall firſt beginne with what the Name is, for that way <hi>Socrates</hi> did uſe to
commend, from the name to go to the nature of a thing: And whereas this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-pollution
hath Scripture names, Eccleſiaſtical, uſed by the Fathers, and
Scholaſtical uſed by the Schoolmen, yea the Rabbins ſay, it hath ſeven names in
the Old Teſtament. I ſhall only pitch on the Bible names, and that not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally,
but upon ſome eminent and chief ones, which it hath in the Scripture, from
which alone we ſhall be beſt able to diſcern the nature of it.</p>
                        <p>The firſt whereof is here in the Text, wherein it is called the <hi>Old man;</hi> From
whence obſerve,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the natural or birth-pollution we are barn in, is called by the Scripture, The
<hi>Old man</hi> that is in us.</p>
                        <p>Several names indeed the Scripture giveth it, and ſome are applied to it by
Divines, of which, yet ſome queſtion may be made; as when Chriſt is ſaid, to be
<hi>the Lamb that takes away the ſinne of the world,</hi> John 1. 29. By that they ſay is
meant original ſinne, for that is not ſo much my ſinne or thy ſinne, as the ſinne
of the world, and therefore he ſpeaketh in the ſingular number, <hi>The ſinne,</hi> not
the ſins of the world; but this is not ſo probable, for Chriſt came into the world
to take away not only original ſinne, as ſome Papiſts have thought, but actual
alſo. Others apply that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. to it, <hi>The ſinne that doth ſo eaſily beſet us;</hi>
And indeed that is a very proper word to explain original ſinne; but whether the
Apoſtles ſcope be ſo immediately to point at that, may be further enquired into.
I ſhall therefore take only ſome few clear and undoubted Titles, that the Scripture
giveth to it, of which this in the Text is a notable one, <hi>The old man;</hi> And before
we inform you, how comprehenſive this is, let us remove a twofold miſtake, or
erroneous apprehenſion that may be about it.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt is that of <hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> who becauſe the Scripture uſeth ſuch
concrete and ſubſtantive terms about original ſinne, calling it a man, a
body, therefore he erred in a contrary extremity to the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> and ſome
Pontificians, making original ſinne not to be an <hi>accident,</hi> but the <hi>eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57719:57"/>
of the ſoul;</hi> but of this more when we come to ſearch out the nature of it;
only you muſt know, that original ſinne is not the ſubſtance of a man, but an
univerſal diſeaſe adhering to it; as the Leproſie in a Leper, it's not his body, it's
not his corpulent eſſence; the body is one thing, the Leproſie is another thing;
and thus in man, his ſoul and body are one thing, his original corruption is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing: Though as in an univerſal Leproſie, you cannot touch one part of
the body, but it is infected; ſo neither can we name one part of the ſoul, but it is
polluted; we muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between nature and ſinne, to avoid <hi>Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianiſm;</hi>
yet we muſt not ſeparate or divide one from the other, to avoid <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſm;</hi>
but of this more in its time.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We muſt not conceive that it's called the <hi>Old man,</hi> becauſe of any
impotency or weakneſs, as if it were not able to put forth into vigorous acts and
lively luſtings of ſinne, as old men have all their natural ſtrength and vigour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying:
No, though it be called the <hi>Old man</hi> in us, yet it's conſtantly working,
drawing aſide, captivating and enflaming of us, yea making warre daily againſt
any thing of God within us.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us conſider, why the Scripture giveth it ſuch a
name, for it might ſeem a very harſh expoſition, to call that which is an accident
or a quality in a man, by the name of an <hi>Old man.</hi>

                        <head type="sub">Why Original Sinne is called Man.</head>
                        <p>THerefore let us ſee the reaſon, why it's called <hi>Man,</hi> and then the <hi>Old man;</hi>
original ſinne may be called a <hi>Man,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe that ſo farre as we are men,</hi> quanti ſumus, <hi>we are all over pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
So that the old man is the whole man polluted in this ſinne before he be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated:</hi>
Inſomuch that this phraſe may ſadly and deeply humble us, that the
Scripture gives the name of man to ſinne, as if that were all we are: Hence (as
you have heard) to walk as a man, to ſpeak as a man, is to do a thing ſinfully,
as farre as thy humanity reacheth, ſo farre thy pollution reacheth; So that the
very calling of thee a man may greatly debaſe thee; for though thou art a rich
man, a great man, yet this <hi>Old man</hi> doth infect thee.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In that original ſinne is called a <hi>Man,</hi> there is implied the <hi>Subject</hi>
of it to be <hi>every man,</hi> as well as <hi>every part of man, Totus homo,</hi> and <hi>totum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
yea <hi>ad omnis homo,</hi> not one exempted that is by natural propagation: So
that every little Infant hath this <hi>Man</hi> in it; Every one that needeth a Chriſt, that
wanteth a Saviour, hath this <hi>Old man</hi> abiding in him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It's called <hi>Man, Becauſe of the heap or collection of all ſinne that is
in it;</hi> For as a man is not one part of the body, the finger, the eye, or the
hand, but the whole Compages and Fabrick of all the parts united together.
Thus original ſinne is not one particular ſinne, but the maſs or ſpawn of all; It's
not a ſtream, but the ocean, and therefore this ſheweth the horridneſs alſo of it,
that it is the womb wherein all ſinne is conceived; Let a man be totally cleanſed
from this, as the glorified Saints in Heaven are, and then no actual ſin can come
from him.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It's called a <hi>Man, Becauſe of the intimate and tenacious adheſion of it
to the whole man, there being no way to ſever our Natures and that, while we abide
in theſe mortal bodies:</hi> So that it ſuppoſeth ſinne to be in us, as fire in the iron
when it is red hot (though there is ſome diſſimilitude alſo) that we cannot ſee
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57719:57"/>
the colour and ſubſtance of the iron for the fire, nothing appeareth but fire; Iron
though of it ſelf black and cold, yet by the fire in it is altered; ſo the ſoul of a
man; yea the whole man that was at firſt made upright and holy; now through
this pollution manifeſts nothing thereof, yea the clean contrary; in ſtead of the
Image of God, there is the image of the Devil, there appeareth nothing but of
the ſinne and the Devil in a man; for if <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>He no longer lived, but
Chriſt in him,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. when yet grace was not full and complete in him, How
much rather may we, while abiding in our natural eſtate ſay, We no longer live,
but ſinne in us, for ſinne moveth all, and doth all, having full dominion
over us?</p>

                        <head type="sub">Why it is called Old-man.</head>
                        <p>IN the ſecond place, It may be called the <hi>Old man;</hi> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it came from</hi>
Adam <hi>the firſt man, and moſt antient:</hi> Thus it is a ſinne of great antiquity,
it hath been in the world ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion; Moſt things have had
their times and their ſeaſons, but this hath been alwayes; There was never any
age, wherein men were not born ſinfull, though ſome actual ſins have abounded
more at one time than another, though <hi>Adam</hi> be dead thouſands of years ago,
yet the ſin liveth and is propagated.</p>
                        <p>2. It is <hi>Old, Becauſe it is from every mans particular beginning:</hi> Thou canſt
not think of the number of thy years, or how old thou art, but thou mayeſt
with groans remember alſo that ſinne is juſt as old as thou art; Haſt thou lived
to threeſcore or an hundred years, even thus old ſinne is? Alas we are apt to
complain of old age, to count it a diſeaſe; we ſay, Alas now our beſt time is gone,
we are weak old men: Oh but there is an old man within that is more to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented!</p>
                        <p>3. It's the <hi>Old man, Becauſe of the craſt and ſubtil wayes that this ſinne
hath within us:</hi> Inſomuch that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complaineth <hi>Chap</hi> 17. None can find
out the depth of ſinne, none but God can ſearch thy heart: This is the old
ſubtil fox within thee, and therefore it's ſaid to deceive and to tempt us.</p>
                        <p>4. It's the <hi>Old man, Becauſe it is to be renewed; That which is old</hi> (ſaith the
Apoſtle) <hi>is to vaniſh away.</hi> The Old Teſtament was removed that the New might
ſucceed. Thus the Old man is to die, is to continue no longer, that the New may
be eſtabliſhed in us.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It's called the <hi>Old man, Becauſe there is no lovelineſs or comelineſs in it;</hi>
For old age is like winter, making the bloſſoms of beauty to fall: Thus the name
Old man argueth the uncomelineſs of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction, To acquaint your ſelves with this Old man in you, young
and old, rich and poor, all have this Old man, that will at laſt betray and damn
you: Oh conſider you carry your own bane about with you, out of thy own
bowels, thy own heart, will ariſe that which will deſtroy thee, and this Old man is
in every one; The Phariſees told the blind man, <hi>He was wholly born in ſinnes;</hi>
They thought it was the condition of ſome miſerable afflicted people to be ſo
born, but it is the condition of all, and therefore expect no heaven or ſlavation,
till this Old man be crucified, and the New man repaired in thee.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter is the common ſeat and proper place, wherein the
nature of original inherent ſinne is expreſly handled; ſo that he
who by reading of this Chapter ſhall not be convinced that there
is ſuch a thing as original ſinne, and that in ſome meaſure putting
it ſelf forth in the godly to their great grief and miſery, I think
we may ſay, he would not believe any ſuch thing, though men
ſhould riſe from the dead, and come and preach it to us. I ſhall in time (God
willing) fully improve the chief matter herein contained; for herein is deſcribed
that Chriſtian conflict which is in all the godly between the regenerate and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
part, as alſo the conſequents thereof: For the preſent, I muſt take two <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes,</hi>
or Suppoſitions for granted, which in time (God willing) I ſhall fully prove.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, That the Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſuch a ſharp combate within him
between the Law of his mind, and the Law of ſinne, <hi>doth not aſſume the perſon of
another,</hi> as of a carnal unregenerate man, or a Legaliſt convinced by the Doctrine
of the Law, yet his heart carrying him in the clean contrary way, but ſpeak it of his
own Perſon, and that as regenerated. The former way go the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and ſome
Papiſts, and all <hi>Socinians,</hi> but the later way generally go the Proteſtants, even
as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, retracting the former opinion he once had; yea the beſt and
choiſeſt Commentators of the Papiſts, <hi>Salmeron, Pererius, Eſtius</hi> and <hi>Lapide,
&amp;c.</hi> do adhere to this Expoſition. So that you muſt not think, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
here ſpoken of, is like that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribes his incontinent perſon
by, that doth like <hi>videre</hi> and <hi>Probare meliora,</hi> but <hi>deteriora ſequi,</hi> which is only a
<hi>fight between an inlightned conſcience, and a corrupt heart.</hi> Nor</p>
                        <p>2. Is it like thoſe <hi>preparatory and initial works anteceding ſometimes converſion,</hi>
which <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth notably ſpeak of in himſelf, deſiring to be freed from ſinne,
and yet afraid his prayer ſhould be heard; ſo that he was alwayes going, but yet
never did thorowly go to God, till at laſt he found that <hi>gratia Dei vorti cordis,</hi>
which no hard heart can reſiſt, becauſe it is given on purpoſe to take away the
hard heart: But the Apoſtle doth here not only doctrinally affirm ſuch a thing
as original ſinne, but experimentally he declareth the actings of it: So that he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57719:58"/>
doth not only write a doctrinal and dogmatical Truth, but alſo an Hiſtory of
what he obſerved in himſelf.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Suppoſition to be granted is, that by <hi>fleſh</hi> the Apoſtle doth not
<hi>only mean the ſenſitive or ſenſual part, but the whole man, ſo farre as corrupted.</hi> So
that with the Apoſtle, the ſoul is <hi>fleſh,</hi> the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> are <hi>fleſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all are corrupted with original ſinne; Of which more in its time.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two things premiſed, you may know, that this Text read is the Epilogue
or ſummary Concluſion, which the Apoſtle makes from that doctrinal and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
diſcourſe about himſelf (to wit) that there are <hi>two principles</hi> in him, <hi>two
ſelves, two men,</hi> as it were; There was both a ſweet fountain and bitter within
him, and from theſe did flow two ſuitable ſtreams, <hi>The Law of the mind,</hi> did
incline him to ſerve <hi>the Law of God,</hi> but the <hi>Law in his members, the Law of ſin;</hi>
Not that the Law of ſinne and members are two diſtinct things, as <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>Beza</hi> thought, making the <hi>Law of ſinne,</hi> to be <hi>original ſinne,</hi> the <hi>Law in the
members</hi> to be <hi>the actings and ſtirrings</hi> of this in the whole man; for <hi>ver. 23. The
Law of ſinne</hi> is expreſly ſaid to be in the <hi>members;</hi> And whereas the Apoſtle in
that verſe ſaith, <hi>He ſeeth a Law in his members bringing him into captivity to the
Law of ſinne,</hi> that doth not argue a diſtinction between theſe, but according to
the uſe of the Scripture, the Antecedent is repeated for the Relative; the ſenſe
being. That the <hi>Law of his members</hi> did bring <hi>Paul</hi> into captivity to it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the <hi>Law of the mind</hi> with in him, as <hi>Gen. 9. 16. I will remember</hi>
(ſaith God himſelf) <hi>the everlaſting Covenant between God</hi> (that is my ſelf) <hi>and
every living creature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>We ſee then in theſe words, that the Apoſtle giveth another name to that
original ſinne, which dwelleth in him, he calleth it very emphatically <hi>The Law of
ſinne</hi> in him; Original corruption is even in <hi>Paul,</hi> though converted, how
much more in all unregenerate perſons by way of a <hi>Law:</hi> From whence obſerve,</p>
                        <p>That the Scripture cals original ſin the Law of ſin Within us.</p>

                        <p>TO underſtand this, take notice of theſe things:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle in his Epiſtles doth delight to uſe the word <hi>Law,</hi> and
that when ſpeaking of contrary things, <hi>The Law of God, the Law of Works;</hi> This
he mentioneth properly, but then he cals it, <hi>The Law of faith,</hi> becauſe the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
word for <hi>Law,</hi> ſignifieth no more than <hi>Doctrine,</hi> for <hi>Torath</hi> either comes,
they ſay, from a word that ſignifieth to <hi>appoint</hi> or <hi>teach,</hi> or from a word
that ſignifieth to <hi>rain,</hi> becauſe (ſaith <hi>Chemnitius</hi>) as the raine is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in the clouds, not to be kept there, but to be emptied
on the earth, that ſo it may be made fruitfull. Thus the Law of God was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, not meerly to be written in the Bible, but alſo to be implanted
in our hearts. The word then in the Hebrew ſignifying <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the general,
no wonder if the Goſpel be called, <hi>The Law of Faith;</hi> So Regeneration, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. is called, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life;</hi> as in other places it is, <hi>The Law of
God written in our hearts;</hi> but the Apoſtle doth not only apply it to theſe things,
but eſpecially in this Chapter he cals it; <hi>The Law of ſinne,</hi> not ſin only, but the
<hi>Law of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the Law in our members;</hi> why the Apoſtle doth ſo, you ſhall
hear anon. Only</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, you muſt conſider, when the Apoſtle cals it, <hi>The Law of
ſinne,</hi> it is in an improper and abuſive, or alluſive ſenſe; for a <hi>Law</hi> properly is
only of that which is good, the matter of a Law, muſt be honeſt and juſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Law is <hi>pars juris,</hi> and <hi>Jus</hi> is <hi>à juſto;</hi> Therefore <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
Laws are rather <hi>violentia,</hi> than <hi>leges.</hi> Yea <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, Such Decrees are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                           <hi>Leges,</hi> nor <hi>ne appellandae quidem,</hi> yet the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>who make
iniquity a Law,</hi> Pſal. 99. 20. or <hi>who frame miſchief for a Law. Tacitus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
of the multitude of Laws in his time, and ſaith, The Commonwealth
groaned, <hi>ut flagitiis ita legibus;</hi> So that although the properties of a Law are to
be good and profitable, yet by alluſion, all unjuſt and hurtfull Decrees are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Laws, and thus the Apoſtle cals it <hi>the Law of ſinne,</hi> alluding to thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
or effects, which a Law hath; What the Law of God doth in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man, the contrary doth the Law of ſinne in a natural man.</p>

                        <p>ORiginal ſinne therefore may be compared to a <hi>Law,</hi> in theſe reſpects:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, A Law doth teach and direct, <hi>Lex eſt lux, It informeth and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what is to be done.</hi> Thus the Schoolmen, they make <hi>Direction</hi> the firſt thing
neceſſary to a Law; The work of grace in a godly man, is called by the Apoſtle,
<hi>The Law of the mind,</hi> in this Chapter; Becauſe grace within a man doth teach
and direct him what to do; Hence 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. the godly man is ſaid to have <hi>an
anointing within him;</hi> The Law of God is <hi>written in his inward parts,</hi> and ſo from
within, as well as by the Word without, they are taught what to do: Thus on
the contrary <hi>the Law of ſinne</hi> in a natural man, <hi>doth teach and prompt him to all
kind of evil;</hi> This <hi>Law of ſinne</hi> doth not indeed teach what we ought to do, but
it doth wonderfully ſuggeſt all kind of wickedneſs to us; and from this cauſe it is,
that you ſee children no ſooner able to act, but they can with all readineſs runne
into evil; ſinnes that they have not ſeen committed before their eyes, they can
with much dexterity accompliſh: What a deal of inſtruction and admonition is
requiſite to nurture your young ones in the fear of the Lord? And all is little
enough, And why is this? <hi>The Law of God is not in their hearts,</hi> they have not
that in them, which would direct and teach holineſs; But on the other ſide, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
need not to be taught wickedneſs, you need not inſtruct them how to ſinne,
they have much artifice and cunning in an evil way, And why ſo? The Law of
ſinne is in them, this is that they are bred with: So that as the young ones of
Foxes and Serpents, though they have no teacher, yet from the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
within them, they grow ſubtil and crafty in their miſchievous wayes:
Thus the Law of ſinne doth in every man, he is ingenious and wiſe to do
evil. As the ground ere it will bring forth corn doth need much labour and
tillage, but of it ſelf bringeth forth bryars and thorns: Thus all by nature
are ſo fooliſh and blind, that without heavenly education and inſtitution you
cannot bring them to that which is holy, but of their own ſelves, men have
ſubtilty and abilities to frame miſchievous things: And why is all this?
They have a Law of ſinne within them, which directs, ſuggeſts and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to do much evil: So that we are not to put all upon the Devil, to
ſay, He put it into my minde, he ſuggeſted ſuch thoughts to me; No,
the Law of ſinne within thee, can ſufficiently prompt thee to all
evil.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>A Law doth not onely teach, but it doth inſtigate and incline, it
preſſeth, and provoketh to the things commanded by it,</hi> Thus the Law of the
mind in a godly man, <hi>doth greatly inſtigate and provoke him to what is good;</hi>
It is like a goad in his ſide, it is like fire in his bowels, he muſt do that
which is good, elſe he cannot have any reſt within him: You read when <hi>David</hi>
refrained for a while from ſpeaking good, at laſt he could hold no longer, but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57719:59"/>
the fire did break out: So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us;</hi>
Thus the true believer he hath a principle of grace within him, which is like a
Law upon him, he cannot do otherwiſe, he muſt obey it: Thus on the
contrary, Original ſinne in a natural man, is like a Law within him, it
provoketh him, it enflameth him to all evil; Whenſoever any holy duty
is preſſed upon him, this Law of ſinne ſtirreth him up againſt it, makes
him rage at it, as the Apoſtle doth abundantly teſtifie in this Chapter, he
tels us, <hi>This Law of ſinne did warre and fight againſt the Law of God, it
did lead him captive,</hi> it conquered and ſubdued him againſt his will: If then
a godly man find this Law of ſinne ſo powerfull, and operative in him;
No wonder if men wholly carnal and natural, they finde the Law of ſinne
as fully prevailing over them, as the Devils did on the herd of Swine, which
they hurried violently into the ſea without any resiſtance. As then
the Devil when he poſſeſſed ſome bodies, provoked and moved them to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
violent and ſudden actions, which they could not gainſay: Thus doth
the Law of ſinne in men naturally, it provoketh, it inſtigateth, it turneth
the ſoul upſide down, it is continually preſſing and enclining to evil, which
makes the Scripture ſay, <hi>Gen. 6. That the imaginations of the thoughts of mans
heart is only evil, and that continually.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Original ſinne is a Law, becauſe by this a man is bound and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivated
to the luſts thereof, there is an indiſſoluble union till death.</hi> Thus
the Apoſtle argueth from the Law of an Husband and his Wife, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
marry another, while her Husband lives; Neither can we be married to
Chriſt, while this is predominant, yea, we muſt die, ere we be wholly
freed of it.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Original ſinne is called a Law of ſinne within us, becauſe of the
injurious command and rule it hath in every man by nature:</hi> And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is the moſt explicite and formal reaſon, why it is called a Law; for to
a Law there is not onely required a directive power, for ſo counſels and
admonitions have, which are no Laws; but there muſt be alſo a preceptive
and commanding power; ſo that a Law hath <hi>vim coactivum,</hi> a compelling force;
to have a thing done; and in this reſpect, the Apoſtle gives it this Title
of a <hi>Law of ſinne within us,</hi> for even in the perſon of a regenerate man;
What ſad complaints doth he make of this tyrannical power of ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him? He is not his own man, he cannot do what he would, yea he doth
what he would not; inſomuch that he cals himſelf <hi>carnal, and ſold under
ſinne:</hi> Theſe expreſſions are ſo great, that therefore ſome have thought
they could not be applied to a godly man; For it is ſaid of <hi>Ahab,</hi> as a
ſure Character of his wickedneſſe, <hi>That he ſold himſelf to do evil,</hi> 1 Kings
21. 20. but <hi>Ahab</hi> did that willingly; <hi>Paul</hi> is here paſſive, he is ſold againſt
his will, becauſe ſinne hath ſuch tyranny over him: Therefore the afflicted
<hi>Iſraelite</hi> did not more groan to be delivered from his oppreſſion, than <hi>Paul</hi>
crieth out to be <hi>delivered from this body of ſinne;</hi> Well therefore may this
birth-pollution be called, <hi>The Law of ſinne within us,</hi> for it ruleth all, it
commands the whole man; what ſinne bids us think, we think; what it bids
us do, we do; No natural man can do othewiſe: The Apoſtle ſpeaks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily,
<hi>They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God?</hi> Rom. 8. 7, 8. <hi>And
the carnal minde is not ſubject to God, neithe indeed can be:</hi> Oh the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and unhappy eſtate we are all then in by this original ſinne! We cannot
but ſinne, we do not love that which is good, neither can we; The Law
of ſinne hath wholly enſlaved us: Though all the curſes of the Law be
denounced againſt us, yet we cannot but ſinne: As venemous creatures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
vent that which is ſweet, but neceſſarily that which is poiſon, yet (as
<hi>Bernard</hi> of old ſaid well) <q>This neceſſity in ſinning doth not take off from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57719:60"/>
voluntarineſſe and delight in it, neither doth the delight take off from the
neceſſity.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It may be called, <hi>The Law of ſinne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aquinas) Becauſe it's
that effect of Gods penal Law inflicted upon mankind, becauſe of</hi> Adam's <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion;
So that upon</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſinne, God hath ſo ordered, that it ſhould be
by way of a puniſhment upon us, to be prone unto all evil.</hi> For (as you
heard) this original ſinne, is both a ſinne and a puniſhment; So that as
God hath appointed that every man ſhould die, it is a Law that ſhall never
be repealed; ſo likewiſe that every one born of man in a natural way ſhould
be unclean, and have a fountain within him daily emptying it ſelf into poiſonous
ſtreams.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> To be informed, whence it is that thy heart is ſo out of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
evil, whence it is that no godly thing is pleaſing to thee, whence it is
that upon ſearching into thy heart, thou findeſt a noiſom dunghill there,
that thou art never able to go to the bottom, whence it is that luſt is ſo
ready at hand alwayes, that ſinne alwayes appeareth firſt in thy ſoul; All
this is, becauſe original corruption is by way of a Law in thee; That teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to ſinne, that inſtigateth to ſinne, yea that commands and imperiouſly
puts thee on to all manner of evil: If you do not feel this heavy thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and preſſure upon you, it is not becauſe it is not there, but becauſe
thou art dead in ſin, and haſt no feeling of it. <hi>Solemon</hi> ſpeaking of a good woman,
hath this notable expreſſion, <hi>Prov. 31. 26. The Law of kindneſſe is in her lips</hi> (The
Law of kindneſſe) <hi>ſhe cannot but be loving and friendly in all ſhe ſaith.</hi> Now on
the contrary, The Law of ſinne is all over thee; The Law of ſinne is in thy
heart, the Law of ſinne is in thy mind, the Law of ſinne is in thy eyes, in thy
tongue, thou canſt not but ſinne in, and by theſe.</p>

                        <p>We therefore proceed to another name that we find here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to us in this Text, <hi>viz. The ſinne that dwelleth in us.</hi> The
Apoſtle you heard (as we take for granted) doth here ſpeak in his own perſon,
and ſo of every regenerate man, that there is a conflict, and a combate between
the fleſh and the Spirit. In all ſuch there are two Twins ſtrugling in the womb
of the ſoul, which cauſeth much grief and trouble of heart, which the Apoſtle
doth in a moſt palpable and experimental manner relate in this paſſage, <hi>verſ. 15.
That which I do, I allow not; for what I would, that I do not, but what I hate,
that I do.</hi> Now you muſt underſtand this aright, leſt it prove a ſtumbling bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ck,
For,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle ſpeaks not this, as a man meerly convinced, but yet carried
away with ſtrong corruptions; This is not to patrocinate thoſe who live in ſinnes
againſt their conſcience, but have ſome check and bitter reluctancy ſometimes, ſo
that they can ſay ſometimes, <hi>I do the things I allow not, yea I hate;</hi> When the
Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. Chap.</hi> 1. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. ſpeaketh of ſome Heathens, that had their
conſciences accuſing of them, and <hi>that they detained the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi>
he ſuppoſeth, That thoſe who yet never taſted of the power of the Goſpel, may
have ſuch truth and light in their conſciences, that it ſhall ſuggeſt what is to be
done, yet love to their luſts will hurry them the contrary way, but as in time is
to be ſhewed, the combate between reaſon, and the ſenſitive appetite, is a
farre different thing from the conflict between the fleſh and the ſpirit in the
godly.</p>
                        <p>Neither ſecondly muſt you underſtand <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of groſs and foul ſins, as
if when he ſaid, <hi>The evil he would not, that he doth,</hi> were to be underſtood of
<hi>ſcandalous</hi> and <hi>wicked enormities;</hi> No, but it is to be interpreted of thoſe motions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57719:61"/>
to ſinne, and conſtant infirmities, which cleave to the moſt holy. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any prophane perſon, that cuſtomarily walloweth in his impieties, excuſe
himſelf with this, It is true, I am ſuch a beaſt, I do ſuch ſoul things ſometimes,
but I may ſay with <hi>Paul, The things that I allow not, yea that I hate, thoſe I do.</hi>
This is to turn honey into poyſon; This is to make the Scripture an incentive to
thy impiety; No, <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſuch as thou art, differ as much as the Sunne and
a dunghill; <hi>Paul</hi> did not mean, the drunkenneſs, the uncleanneſs that he would
not do, that he did, but he meaneth ſuch corruptions and infirmities that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
flow from the polluted nature within us, from which we are never through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleanſed in this life.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Neither when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The good he would, that he doth not,
and the evil he would not, that he doth:</hi> Is thus to be ſo underſtood, as if it were
perpetual, and in every particular act, as if ſinne had alwayes the better, and
grace the worſe, as if in no action he did, grace did conquer ſinne; for in other
places, the godly are ſaid <hi>to have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts
thereof:</hi> As alſo, <hi>That ſinne ſhall not have dominion over them;</hi> but ſometimes in
ſome temptations they are captivated againſt their wils.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Neither may you thus underſtand <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>He would
do good, but evil ſtops him,</hi> as if he had only the ſluggards will and wiſh, who
would eat, but doth not labour, who would be rich, but yet lets his field be full
of briars and thorns, ſuch velleities and incompleat wiſhes many formal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
have; ſo that ſuch lazy and ſluggiſh deſires without efficacious operations
are not to ſhroud themſelves under <hi>Paul</hi>'s expreſſion.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Therefore <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning is, <hi>That the good which he would do, be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it perfectly, he cannot do it with that alacrity and fervency, as he would do;</hi>
Though the fleſh do not wholly conquer the ſpirit, yet it doth ſtop and hinder
it. Therefore <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls it the <hi>Echineips,</hi> the fiſh that ſtops the ſhip
that it doth not go ſo ſpeedily, though it doth not drown it.</p>

the regenerate and unregenerate; So farre as he is regenerate, he doth not do

not <hi>excuſe;</hi> which is the rather to be obſerved, becauſe of thoſe <hi>Carpocrations</hi> of

that do ſuch things, but the fleſh within them,</hi> and ſo make a mock of all ſinne: yea
ſome of late have arrived to ſuch horrid blaſphemy, as to ſay, <hi>It's not they that
do ſuch and ſuch evil actions, but God in them;</hi> Neither doth the Apoſtle lay the
fault upon the Devil, it was not his, but the Devil, as many are apt to do, but
upon that fountain, and root of all the bitterneſs in his heart and life, which is
original corruption, here deſcribed to be <hi>the ſinne dwelling in him.</hi> From whence

                        <p>
                           <hi>That original ſinne is an inherent, in-dwelling ſinne in us.</hi> It is the ſinne that

                        <p>
                           <hi>Some will confeſs,</hi> That there is original imputed ſin, but not inherent, where doth

                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57719:61"/>
But firſt, They grant original imputed ſinne, yet <hi>Where doth the Scripture call
it imputed ſinne?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And ſecondly, we ſay, The Scripture cals it inherent in this Text, <hi>The ſinne
that dwelleth in us,</hi> that is the ſame in ſenſe, with the ſinne inherent in us. So
then, original ſinne is the ſinne that dwelleth, inheretit and abideth in us. To
open thus,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Take notice, That there are three kinds of ſinnes, as to our purpoſe,
<hi>Original, Habitual,</hi> and <hi>Actual; Actual</hi> ſinnes are all ſuch which are a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of Gods Law, whether by thought, word or deed; for the ſinnes
of the mind and the heart are actual ſinnes, though never committed bodily and
externally; Now theſe actual ſinnes, they cannot be called ſinnes that dwell in
us, for they are tranſient, and when committed, they are paſſed away, onely
the <hi>guilt</hi> remaineth, <hi>viz. An obligation to eternal wrath;</hi> Neither doth the
Apoſtle ſo much complain in this Chapter of the actings of ſinne (though
that be part) as the Law of ſinne in his members, which is the fountain
of all.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, There are <hi>Habitual</hi> ſinnes, ſuch as are acquired by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
acts, and daily commiſſions of ſinne; and theſe indeed muſt be confeſſed
to be in-dwelling and fixed ſinnes in us; and theſe habits of ſinne do much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and ſtrengthen our original corruption, making it more vigorous; and if
ſo be that cuſtom be a ſecond nature, how miſerable is an unfegerate man, who
hath as it were a two-fold nature inclining him to ſinne? Original corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
which is like an innate habit, and cuſtome in ſinne, which is like an
acquired: So that as the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>who are twice dead,</hi> ſo
we may ſay, Theſe are twice alive, in reſpect of their vigorous propenſity to
ſinne; Therefore the Scripture ſpeaks ſometimes of men, that have theſe double
chains of wickedneſs upon them: Thus when the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 3. 10, 11, 12,
&amp;c.</hi> doth from ſeveral places in the Old Teſtament apply thoſe things which are
ſpoken of men in an high nature flagitious, to every one by nature, that doth
comprehend both their innate and acquired impiety, and therefore might well
by the Apoſtle be applied to all, becauſe all by nature would be carried out
to ſuch enormous rebellions. The <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> becauſe of original and habitual
ſinne in ſome perſons, hath a notable expreſſion, <hi>Pſal. 5. 9. Their inward part
is very wickedneſſe,</hi> or <hi>wickedneſſes,</hi> as in the Hebrew, <hi>Their inward part is
nothing but wickedneſſe.</hi> Now although therefore habitual ſinnes may truly be
called ſinnes dwelling in us; yet the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here of ſuch habitual
ſinnes, for he ſpeaks all along of <hi>one ſinne,</hi> as the <hi>mother,</hi> as the <hi>fountain</hi> and
<hi>root</hi> of all; And beſides, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of a regenerate man,
could not complain of the acquired habits of ſinne within him, for in <hi>Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there is an expulſion of all habitual ſinne;</hi> and in this ſenſe, <hi>Thoſe that are born
of God,</hi> are ſaid, <hi>not to ſinne,</hi> viz. <hi>habitually and cuſtomarily,</hi> as wicked men do,
although ſome actual ſins, and thoſe of a very hainous nature, may conſiſt with
the work of grace, yet habites of ſinne, and habits of grace can no more conſiſt
together, than light and darkneſs: It is evident then, that the Apoſtle not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
habitual ſinne, muſt underſtand original, in the immediate actings and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of it, for this will alwayes be a troubleſome and moleſting inmate; This is
not conquered but with the laſt enemy, death it ſelf.</p>

                        <p>THis premiſed, Let us conſider, why original corruption is called the Inherent
and In-dwelling Sinne, and that even in a godly man.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, <hi>The Apoſtle cals it, the ſinne, (<gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) Becauſe of the propriety,
and proper right it hath to us.</hi> As a man is ſaid to dwell in his houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath a right to it, and it is his own: This original ſinne is in every man,
as in its proper place, as the ſtone doth reſt in its center, and will not move fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
So that as hell is ſaid to be the proper place of <hi>Judas. He went</hi> (ſaith the
Text) <hi>to his own place;</hi> Thus is the heart and ſoul of a man, the proper and
fit ſubject for all the natural impiety that cleaveth to us; and therefore, though
the Devil be alſo ſaid, <hi>To rule in the hearts of wicked men,</hi> he dwels alſo in
them, as well as ſinne, for which he is compared <hi>to an armed man, keeping the
houſe;</hi> yet this is more extrinſecal, and from without; The Devil could <hi>not find
a room ready ſwept and garniſhed</hi> for him, but becauſe of this native pollution:
Hence the Apoſtle doth not in this Chapter complain of the Devil, but ſin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in him; He doth not ſay, <hi>I would do good,</hi> but the Devil hinders me (though
that be ſometimes true) <hi>but ſin dwelling in him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, This expreſſion of <hi>ſinne dwelling in a man;</hi> denoteth, <hi>The quiet
and peaceable poſſeſſion it hath in man by nature, it dwels there, as in its own
houſe, nothing to diſturb or moleſt it:</hi> Hence it is, That all things are ſo quiet in
a natural man, there is nothing troubles him; he is not diſquieted in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
he feeleth no ſuch burden or weight within him, as <hi>Paul</hi> here complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of; ſo that you would think many civil and natural men in a more holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than <hi>Paul;</hi> They will thank God, <hi>They have a good heart, and all is quiet
within them;</hi> but this is not becauſe original ſinne doth not dwell, and live, and
work in them, but becauſe they are ſenſleſs and ſtupid, ſinne is in its proper place,
and ſo there is no trouble and reſtleſneſs in their conſcience; Therefore its thy
want of experimental diſcoveries that makes thee queſtion original ſinne, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
thy own heart would be in ſtead of all books to thee in this particular. Indeed
in godly men, though <hi>ſinne dwelleth in them,</hi> yet it hath not peaceable poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is as a tyrant in them; Therefore the regenerate part maketh many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and great reſiſtances; There is praying, watching and faſting againſt
it; They are as ſollicitous to have it quite expelled, as ſome were to have Chriſt
caſt out the Devils from their poſſeſſed friends; otherwiſe in the natural man
original ſin prevaileth all over, and there is no noiſe, no oppoſition, yea great
delight, and content there is in ſubjection thereunto, ſo that they reſiſt Grace,
and the Spirit of God by the Word, which would ſubdue ſinne in them.</p>

Actual ſinnes they are committed, and ſo paſſe away, yea when

Phariſaical and hypocritical man know nothing of it; <hi>Paul</hi> while a Phariſee, and

is an in-dwelling ſinne, an inherent corruption, from whence floweth all that
actual filth which is in our lives. And why is it that we hear no more groaning
and labouring under it? Is it not becauſe the ſpiritual life of grace is not within
them? Oh why are all things ſo ſtill and peaceable within thee! Is it not becauſe

Why alſo is there ſuch a neceſſity of watching, praying, of holy fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling?

combat of conſcience with corruption, which may be in natural men, alledging
places out of the Poets, and <hi>Epictetus,</hi> where ſome have ſaid in the like manner,
they knew it was evil they did, and they do not allow it, but yet their frail fleſh
compelleth them to do it, ſo that they do not what they would, and what they
would not, that they do: As alſo bringing in a <hi>Pagan</hi> out of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> ſaying,
That he ſinneth, <hi>Non quia velo, ſed quia cogor,</hi> the fleſh being ſo ſtrong in him.
Theſe are but low and philoſophical notions, arguing the ignorance of the work,
of Gods Spirit in a man, and the repugnancy thereunto by the unregenerate part:

becauſe they do ſo intend the ſignification; <hi>Paul</hi> then finds ſinne alwayes
at hand, when his heart is ready to do any good, to pull him back, to preſs him
down, and ſo he is like the bird tied in a ſtring, which aſſaying to flie up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
immediately is plucked back again; Now this ſinne thus preſent, is not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
habitual, or an accuſtomed ſinne; Though <hi>Gratius</hi> relateth it to the cuſtom
of ſinne, even as he doth (<hi>Lib. 2. de Jure belli cap.</hi> 12. 26.) expound that of
the Apoſtle <hi>[By nature the children of wrath]</hi> making nature to be cuſtom,
ſaying, <hi>The Apoſtle doth not ſo much ſpeak of his own perſon, as of the</hi> Romans
<hi>amongſt whom he then lived.</hi> For Regeneration delivers from the cuſtom of ſinne,
but it is that original ſinne, that corrupt nature, which doth alwayes cleave to
us, as the ſhadow doth the body, or rather, as the Ivy the Tree, ſecretly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it. From whence obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That original ſinne is the adjacent ſinne, or the ſinne that is alwayes troubleſomly
preſent with as:</hi> So that whereas we may go from one company to another, from
one place to another, yet we can never go from this original ſinne, but we carry
it about with us at all times, in all places, in all duties, and that even the moſt
holy do, whereby it is that they are kept ſo low, and humble in themſelves; Why
is it, that when we are regenerated, we ſhould not be like Saints in Heaven, <hi>without
any ſpot or blemiſh?</hi> Why ſhould we not delight in God, and heavenly things,
more than in earthly? Why ſhould there he the leaſt difficulty and unwillingneſs
in us to any thing that is good? Is not all this, becauſe this ſinne is thus readily
preſent with us, it lieth not at the door, but in the very heart of us all?</p>
                        <p>But let us explain, What is comprehended in this Epithete given original ſinne,
<hi>That it is preſent with us?</hi>

                        <head type="sub">What is implied in that Epithete.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>It implieth, That this ſinne putteth it ſelf forth firſt in the ſoul: The
motions and thoughts of ſinne ariſe firſt in us, before grace can prevent them.</hi>
The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> ſpeak of the <hi>motus primò primi,</hi> the very immediate and firſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the Soul, before the will gives any conſent, or the mind hath any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
and theſe are <hi>ſinnes,</hi> becauſe <hi>contrary to the Image of God;</hi> But whence
come they? Even from this womb of original corruption: So that it is like a
furnace alwayes ſending forth ſparks: The Scripture expreſſeth it notably, <hi>Gen. 6. 5.
where every imagination of the thought of the heart is ſaid to be only evil, and that
continually. Valentia (Analyſis Diſ. de peccato originali</hi>) and other Papiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<hi>That we aggravate originall ſinne too much, we ſpeak too tragically about
it,</hi> and indeed the Subject is very diſtaſtfull to every man; how unwilling is he
to bear, that he is all over thus ſinfull? This is to make them like <hi>Devils,</hi> and
to ſend them to hell, they think; but what can be ſpoken more terribly againſt
man in regard of original ſinne, then God himſelf here ſpeaks, where every
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57719:64"/>
word is like ſo much thunder and lightning, as is to be ſhewed? Only for the
preſent purpoſe obſerve, that he ſaith, <hi>Every imagination of the thought of a
mans heart is evil;</hi> Imagination, or framing, and faſhioning the heart of a man,
is compared to a ſhop of wickedneſs, and every thing framed or faſhioned there,
is only evil. Sinne then is preſent in a powerfull manner, when there cannot ſo
much as riſe a motion in thee, a ſtirring of thy ſoul, though never ſo involuntary
and indeliberate, but it is only evil: Oh it was not thus in the ſtate of integrity,
then every imagination, every motion was good, and only good; but now our
gold is become droſs, and wine water; Let a natural man obſerve his heart, and
he ſhall ſee what riſeth firſt in his ſoul is all filth, like the muddy fountain it comes
from; Yea, even in a godly man, How many thoughts and motions riſe up in
his heart, that he abhorreth and trembleth at? It is true, ſometimes the devil
injecteth vile and blaſphemous thoughts; ſo that his heart is not at all active in
them, and therefore are not ſinnes, but compared to the Cup in <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s ſack,
they knew not how it came there, and it is a great dexterity in caſuiſtical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſo to direct a Chriſtin, that he may know when ſuch motions ariſe from the
devil alone, ſo that they are my afflictions, but not ſinnes, or when they come
from my heart, and ſo are truly imputable to me; of which in its due time,
it may be; but for the preſent we may ſigh and groan under this conſideration,
That evil is ſo preſent with us, that nothing riſeth up in the heart ſooner than
ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>In that evil is ſaid to be preſent, to</hi> Paul, <hi>there is denoted the univerſal
and diffuſca preſene of it. Paul</hi> doth not ſay, it's preſent in one part, in one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
but to me, that is in every part ſuſceptible of ſinne. Therefore it is called
<hi>The Law in his members,</hi> becauſe it putteth forth its efficacy every where: <hi>ſinne
is preſent in the mind,</hi> by atheiſm, unbelief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> by obſtinacy and
obdurateneſs, in the <hi>affections</hi> by inordinacy and confuſion, yea <hi>ſinne is preſent</hi>
in the eye, in the tongue; So that the Apoſtle meaneth, this original ſinne is of
ſuch an univerſal extent, that it is preſent in every part in him; For you muſt not
think (as ſome Papiſts do) That original ſinne is only in the inferiour, ſenſitive
part of a man, but it is principally and chiefly in the intellectual and moſt noble
part, the mind and the underſtanding; and indeed becauſe it's ſo predominant,
therefore is converſion ſo difficult for the Miniſtry, bringing arguments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
out of Gods word. The <hi>ſinne that is preſent in the underſtanding</hi> putteth
a man upon atheiſtical cavils, and carnal diſputes, whereby he ſhuts himſelf up
voluntarily in his darkneſs, rather than he will receive light.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>In that evil is ſaid to be preſent with us, here is denoted the continual
aſſaulting and vigorous acting of it at all times.</hi> Though original ſinne be not an
actual ſinne, yet it is an active ſinne; Hence <hi>Paul</hi> attributeth ſuch actions to it,
as if it were ſome mighty, imperious and conquering tyrant, he ſaith, it doth
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>It warreth againſt him, it leadeth him into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;</hi>
Do not then think this ſinne hath a meer bare ſluggiſh preſence, is if it
lay aſleep in thee? No, it is daily aſſaulting thee, it's continually pulling thee
down; As the heart and pulſe are in continual motion, thus is original ſin within
thee; Therefore our <hi>imaginations</hi> are not only ſaid to be <hi>only evil</hi> (Gen. 6. 5.)
<hi>but alſo continually;</hi> Thy ſoul never acteth, but it acteth ſinfully and corruptly.
It is true, while men are in their natural eſtate, <hi>They are dead in ſinne,</hi> and ſo
they find not, feel not theſe ſtirrings, neither do they groan under them, but
there are innumerable <hi>Myriads</hi> of ſinfull motions in thee to ſinne, though thou
doeſt not apprehend them; As a man ſhut up in a dark dungeon full of Toads and
noiſom vermin, he ſeeth nothing, till light come into the place, and then he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
being afraid to ſtay there any longer; ſuch a loathſom dungeon is every
mans heart naturally: Oh the atheiſm, vanity, wickedneſs that is bound up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
but thou doſt not know or believe any ſuch thing, becauſe dead in ſin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57719:64"/>
Fourthly, <hi>There is implied the facility and eaſineſs in ſinning.</hi> The way to ſinne
is no narrow or ſtrait way; There needeth not much ſtriving to enter therein,
for it's ready at hand; May not all find, if they will ſearch, this readineſs of ſin
at all time? Why is thy heart ſo quickly moved and drawn out to any earthly or
ſinfull pleaſure, but it's a long while, ere thou canſt make any fire, or kindle a
flame in thy ſoul to that which is good? Thy ſoul is a dry Tree to the former, but
a green Tree to the later, as the Scripture ſpeaks concerning the righteouſneſs of
faith, <hi>It's night thee;</hi> Thou needeſt not ſay, Who ſhall go into the deep for it?
<hi>Rom. 10, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it is true of ſin in thee, thou needeſt no inſtruction, no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
thou needeſt not fetch devils from hell to commit ſinne, for that is alwayes
preſent with thee: Hence <hi>Eliphaz</hi> compareth it, <hi>Job</hi> 15. to drinking of water,
when a man is ſcorched with thirſt; If you ſee there are many, who by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſcience are ſo convinced, that they are difficulty brought to commit ſome
ſinnes, eſpecially groſs ones; It is no contradiction, for a man to be all over
polluted and prone to ſinne, notwithſtanding ſuch dictates of conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
in all men; This is plain, That ſin ſs ſo preſent, that without any difficulty
or pain, we are carried out to ſinne, ſo that the kingdom of hell doth not like the
kingdom of Heaven, need any violence to take it.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>When evil is ſaid to be preſent, there is denoted the ſubtile and daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation
of it into all that we do.</hi> It's in a man, like leaven, that ſends forth its
fourneſs into all the meal, it leaveth not the leaſt part unleavened: This ſinne is
like a <hi>Dalilah</hi> in <hi>Samſon</hi>'s heart, it is alwayes enticing and tempting of thee; and
therefore it's called by the name of luſt or concupiſcence; and <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. there
it's ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to intice, by ſetting baits for us: Hence in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the heart is expreſſed by this, <hi>That it is deceitfull above all things;</hi> who
can think, that the wiſe, holy God made us with ſuch hearts at firſt: No, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt tranſgreſſion came this deſolation upon us. Becauſe then evil is thus
preſent with us, hence every holy duty is contaminated; hence there is fleſh as
well as ſpirit in the beſt performances: This cloſe ſubtil inſinuating nature of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, is the cauſe why a godly man can never know the bottom of his heart;
This makes ſo many hypocrites and apoſtates; This is it that makes a man ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
about himſelf; for when he hath done all, that we would think there
were no danger, yet ſome embers or other may lie, as it were, under the aſhes,
and ſet all on flame.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>When it ſaith, Evil is preſent with us, that denoteth, the moleſting and
retarding nature of it, ſtopping us in all the good we would do.</hi> This is that eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for which <hi>Paul</hi> makes this ſad complaint, ſo that he cannot ſtep one ſtep, but
ſinne puls him back again; This is the milſtone about the neck; This is the clog
and burden upon every man: Oh Lord, I would even flie up into heaven, but
this burden doth preſs me down! When we would runne our ſpiritual race, this
makes us halt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction, to abhorre all ſuch Doctrines as teach a perfection, that
holdeth, <hi>We may attain to be without ſin in this life.</hi> Some <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
though ſo extreamly contrary, yet have underſtood that place, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 27. Not
having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing</hi> (to be fulfilled in this life, forgetting the
words before) <hi>that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church;</hi> ſo that till this
be done, it is not without ſpot; And near to theſe are ſuch, who though ſinne be
every way preſent in them, yet becauſe of their phariſaical and doubled minds (as
<hi>Paul</hi> once was) they do not diſcover or feel any ſuch thing. But let the tender en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
heart go into Gods preſence, and ſadly bewail himſelf, ſaying; O Lord,
How ill is it with me? What ſhall I think or ſay of my ſelf? How unſpeakable is my

                        <p>LEt us take notice, What is contained in this excellent and emphatical word.
And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>There is implied our utmoſt impotency and inability to ſhake off the
power of it.</hi> For although the Apoſtle exhorteth us to <hi>lay it aſide,</hi> yet that
muſt be underſtood as a duty <hi>alwayes in doing,</hi> that we are neverable to <hi>compleat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully
and perfectly;</hi> You ſee, though they are godly to whom he writeth, and
they are already in the race, yet it is their work daily to be unburdenning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
When therefore it's called, <hi>The ſinne ſo eaſily beſetting us,</hi> hereby is
taught us our inability and inſufficiency to withſtand it; Inſomuch that all thoſe
<hi>Doctrines,</hi> which teach <hi>Free-will,</hi> and a power to do what is good, are juſtly to
be abandoned, <hi>John</hi> 15. when ſeparated from Chriſt, <hi>we cannot do any thing,</hi>
and therefore are ſaid to be <hi>not aſleep,</hi> but even <hi>dead in ſinne;</hi> ſo that no Infant
new born is more unable to help it ſelf, than we are to promote the good of our
own ſouls. This therefore muſt be laid as a foundation, without this our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
doth not goe deep enough; We are to lie bemoaning our ſelves, as
that poor Cripple, which had no power to put himſelf into the water; And
indeed till we be ſenſible of this impotency, we cannot expect that Chriſt will
help us; When that Cripple ſaid, <hi>He had no man,</hi> than our Saviour relieved
him: Oh then, bewail the ſtrait and miſery thou art in If it were a temporal
calamity thou wert in, and ſuch as neither thou thy ſelf, or any man in the world
could help thee, How greatly would it afflict thee? But now though neither men
or Angels can deliver thee out of this ſpiritual evil, yet thou doeſt not lay it
to heart.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>As it densteth that our power to good is loſt by this original ſinne;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57719:67"/>
So alſo our will and deſire:</hi> For why ſhould it be ſaid <hi>to beſet us ſo eaſily?</hi> But
becauſe we have neither power or will againſt it; ſo that till the principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
be infuſed into us; ſinne hath defiled our will, as well as our power;
as we cannot, ſo neither we will not gain ſay the luſts thereof. We muſt
not then conceive of man, as indeed miſerably polluted, and ſuch as cannot
help himſelf, but is very willing, and heartily deſireth to be freed from this
bondage, but his will is as groſly polluted, as any thing, <hi>He willeth not the
things of God,</hi> he loveth not, yea he <hi>hateth</hi> every thing that is ſpiritual and
holy; Inſomuch that we may truly ſay, That the actual wickedneſſe in mens
lives, doth not onely ariſe from weakneſſe and impotency to what is holy, but
from an unwillingneſſe, and an averſneſſe to it. Though they be allured with the
glorious promiſes of Gods favour, and eternal glory; Though the terrors of God,
and the everlaſting flames of hell be ſet before them, yet they will not; Though
their conſciences be convicted, though the word of God be plain againſt
their luſts, ſo that they cannot tell what to ſay, yet they will not: So that
herein lieth the ſad and dreadfull efficacy of original ſinne, that it hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the will all over, ſo that whereas we will the luſts of the fleſh, the
pleaſures of ſinne, the comforts of the world, we have no will to what is
good: If then the will, which is the <hi>appetitus univerſalis,</hi> and like the <hi>primum
mobile,</hi> that doth carry all the inferiour orbs with it, be thus infected with ſinne,
no wonder if <hi>we be eaſily beſet</hi> by it: This is to bribe the Commander in Chief,
that ruleth all, and ſo it is no wonder, if all be at laſt betrayed into the hands of
ſinne and Satan.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly, When original ſinne is ſaid thus</hi> to beſet us, and compaſſe us
about, <hi>hereby is denoted,</hi> What an impediment and hinderance it is to us in
our way to Heaven, that were it not for this clog upon us, we ſhould with all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and alacrity runne the way of Gods Commandments. <hi>It is this that makes
the Chariot-wheels of the ſoul move ſo ſlowly; It is this that ſtops us in the way,
that makes us draw back.</hi>

                        <head type="sub">How many wayes Original Sinne is a Burden, and an Hinderance
unto us.</head>
                        <p>NOw becauſe this property is chiefly aimed at by the Apoſtle in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is a <hi>burden,</hi> an <hi>hinderance,</hi> a <hi>ſtop</hi> to us, while
we are in our race: Let us conſider, <hi>How many wayes original ſinne is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and hinderance,</hi> ſo that if this were removed, there would be no complaints
of the difficulty that we find to what is good, yea the more perfect and ſpiritual
any duty is, the more pleaſing and acceptable it would be to an heart eaſed of this
burden. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Original ſinne is a burden</hi> incurvando, <hi>By bowing down and preſſing
to the ſoul to theſe creatures here below;</hi> So that now by nature the creature with the
comforts thereof, is the center of a mans heart, is the ultimate object his
ſoul is placed upon. God indeed made man after his own image and then
his heart, his affections, they did all aſcend upwards to God, then he could
not ſatiate, or fully delight himſelf in any thing but God, but through this
original ſinne a man is habitually averſe to God, and converted to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
So that God is not in all his thoughts, yea <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. they are ſaid
<hi>to be without God in the world,</hi> Even as the body of a man, when deprived
of its ſenſe; falleth proſtrate preſently upon the ground; ſo when that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57719:67"/>
righteouſneſs was removed, which was the ſoul of the ſoul, preſently we
fall downwards to the creatures, knowing no better good, nor deſiring any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comforts, but what are in them. No marvel then if this make the godly go
ſtooping and bowing down, becauſe it depreſſeth and leaneth to the creature,
leaving God; That as you ſee the body is a burden to the ſoul, eſpecially if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed,
which made <hi>Plato</hi> ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the very grave and ſepulchre
of the ſoul: Thus original ſin is a ſpiritual burden to it, that there cannot be thoſe
aſcenſions and elevations of the mind to God, as ought to be.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It's an impediment in our race, <hi>Obnitendo, by a plain oppoſing and
contrary thwarting of any good that the Spirit of God either externally offers,
or internally operates.</hi> Thus this native ſinne doth with all violence oppoſe and
thwart whatſoever is ſpiritual; Therefore you ſee the Apoſtle expreſſing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
by <hi>military</hi> words, that it doth <hi>warre</hi> againſt him, and ſometimes <hi>lead
him into captivity;</hi> Thus even a <hi>Paul</hi> is like a poor captive or priſoner, carried up
and down whether he would not: Now this obnitency and reluctancy of original
ſinne is ſeen two wayes againſt what is good:</p>
                        <p>1. There is a good publiſhed and tendered by the preaching of the Goſpel.
God doth by that proffer unto us everlaſting and eternal life; but this original
ſinne ſtirreth up a man to reject it, and to refuſe it; it's no ſutable or acceptable
offer to our natures, no more than pearls or ſweet flowers are to the beaſtly
Swine. Indeed when a people have lived long under the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
yet do reject it, and oppoſe it, loving darkneſs rather than light, theſe have
a double blindneſs and hardneſs upon them; The natural one by original ſinne,
and the habitual contracted one, which they are juſtly delivered up into by God
for the contempt of the light they do enjoy; but I ſpeak here only of the natural
blindneſs, and natural hardneſs upon our hearts: So that upon the very firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
and tenders of grace, the firſt Sermon that ever we hear, the firſt time that
the Goſpel doth ſound in our ears, we have a contrariety to it; and why is it that
a man ſhould thus naturally be an enemy to his own peace? Is it not becauſe of
this imbred ſin working in us?</p>
                        <p>2. If the Spirit of God go further, and doth not outwardly teach onely, but
inwardly and ſpiritually alſo, changing even the whole man, making it a new
creature, yet becauſe this corruption is not quite rooted out, it doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
gain ſay, and withſtand that Law of the mind within us: Whence
then is it that ſuch rebellion and oppoſition is within thee to every good
thing? Is it not becauſe original ſinne hath put thee into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is an impediment <hi>alliciendo</hi> and <hi>ineſcando, It doth enſnare and
allure the heart, ſo that while the ſoul ſhould purſue the race, that throweth
in the way ſome alluring objects or others, and thereby it is ſtopt in its courſe;</hi>
As the Heathens ſpeak of golden Apples caſt in the way to hinder one that was
ſwiftly running in the race: He that runneth in a race, muſt not ſtep out of the
way to gather every flower that groweth by the way-ſide; nor is he to ſtand
ſtill and refreſh his eyes with pleaſant objects: Thus neither ought we in
our way to Heaven; but this original corruption bewitches and enticeth the
heart with many deceitfull and alluring luſts: So that by this means we are
for the moſt part in golden, ſweet, dreams, promiſing this and that comfort
to our ſelves, till at laſt with <hi>Dives</hi> we awaken in hell, and ſee our ſelves
bereaved of all happineſs. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth fully confirm this ſecret
bewitching way of original ſinne within us, which he calleth <hi>luſt,</hi> Jam. 1. 14.
So that, marvel not to ſee thy ſelf drowned in all the pleaſures of ſinne, to
be ſucking down the comforts of earthly things with all delight, for this
luſt within thee, this bewitching <hi>Dalilah</hi> in thy breaſt, puts thee into a
ſweet ſleep, and ſo heavenly things have no reliſh, no taſte to thy appetite,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57719:68"/>
but the things of the world are ſweeter than the honey-comb: Oh why is it that
ſinne which is indeed full of ſtings and bitterneſs ſhould be ſo ſweet! Why ſhould
it be ſuch a pleaſing thing to go in the wayes that lead to hell and damnation?
that when thou art ſinning, it is as thou wouldſt have it? Is not all this, becauſe
ſin hath inſnared and inticed thee?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Sinne is a burden to the ſoul in our race, <hi>debilitando, By weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and debilitating the principles of grace within us:</hi> So that although we
are regenerated and ſanctified, yet becauſe original ſinne doth intimately
adhere even to the very habits of grace within us, ſo that they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and pure: Hence it is that their actings are more remiſſe and languid;
we cannot love God perfectly, we cannot have pure and ſinneleſſe actions,
becauſe we have not pure and ſinneleſſe principles: So that whereas ſome have
thought, that there is not ſuch a ſpiritual conflict in a godly man, as we ſpeak
of, becauſe that would make the will, to will and nill at the ſame time two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
things; they do not rightly underſtand this Aſſertion, for it's not from
contrariety of volitions, but becauſe the will being not perfectly healed, willeth
good things remiſly and faintly, not with that perfection, or freedom and alacrity
as it ought to do.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> Every day to bewail this depraved eſtate of thine
more and more; We take thee (as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was in another caſe) and

heard all the worſt, nor have we diſcovered all the worſt that is in us,
yea, we are never able to goe to the bottome of it. This original ſinne
is an unſearchable Myſtery; It is a long while ere we come to know any
thing of it, and longer ere we come to know the breadth and length of it.
Know this ſufficiently, and then be in love with thy ſelf, or truſt in thy good
heart, and thy own righteouſneſs, if thou canſt.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are part of an Apologetical Anſwer, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
made againſt the Phariſees, who were guilty of blaſpheming
the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they did maliciouſly oppoſe the known
truth, and what was done by the Spirit of God, attributing it to
the power of the devil. And in this Apology the fervency and
zeal of our Saviour, doth appear in the compellation he giveth
them, <hi>Generation of vipers:</hi> Here you ſee, <hi>That it is not alwayes railing and
indiſcreet zeal, to call wicked men by ſuch names that their ſinnes do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the next place, he giveth the reaſon of this their blaſphemy, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if they ſpeak ill, who have ill and naughty hearts, which he expreſſeth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically:</p>
                        <p>1. By an interrogation, <hi>How can ye?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. By the impoſſibility, <hi>How can ye?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. From the matter mentioned: he doth not ſay, <hi>How can ye being evil de
good things,</hi> but <hi>ſpeak;</hi> We might think wicked men might eaſily forbear evil
words, though not evil actions, but their heart is firſt ſet on fire with hell, and
then the tongue. The Phyſician diſcovers how the heart is by the tongue, and
ſo doth Religion alſo. Now that good words cannot proceed from a bad heart,
<hi>viz.</hi> naturally (for on purpoſe, and artificially many evil-minded men, may
ſpeak religiouſly, and men may have butter words, whoſe hearts are like ſwords)
our Saviour proveth from the common and even proverbial rule; A good man
hath a good heart, and a good treaſure, and ſo of this ſweet fountain cannot
come bitter ſtreams. But a bad man hath an <hi>evil treaſure in his heart,</hi> and ſo
from theſe thorns men <hi>cannot gather grapes, nor from theſe thiſtles figs;</hi> we
ſee here then a <hi>good man</hi> and a <hi>bad,</hi> diverſified by that which is wholly hidden and
ſecret, not known to any, but God, till he diſcover it by words or actions. Now
this <hi>evil treaſure</hi> in every mans heart is two-fold,</p>
                        <p>1. That which is <hi>Natural,</hi> that which he cometh into the world with, thus
every man hath an inexhauſted <hi>treaſure</hi> of wickedneſs, which he ſpends upon all
his life time, and yet never cometh to the bottom of it; And in this ſenſe our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57719:69"/>
Divines do well prove, <hi>That no natural or unregenerate man is able to do any
thing, though never ſo little that is good, becauſe he is a bad Tree, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo of the ſeed of Serpents, there cannot come any honey, or ſweet thing
from him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. There is an <hi>acquired</hi> and <hi>increaſed treaſure of ſinne,</hi> which a man ſtoreth
up by daily cuſtom in ſinne, ſo that he becometh to have two treaſures of evil in
his ſoul, as if one were not enough, natural, and voluntary, innate, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
contracted: For you muſt know, That original ſinne, though it be a full
fountain of poiſon, ready of it ſelf to overflow, yet cuſtom in ſin doth ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
and inable it to be more vigorous and operative; we may put more wood
to this fire, and ſo make it more dreadfull: Even as theſe Phariſees, though they
were by nature, the Serpents ſeed, yet becauſe of their voluntary and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
malicious diſpoſition in them, ſuperadded to the former, our Saviour calleth
them, <hi>Generation of vipers.</hi> Now although the Phariſees had this two-fold evil
heart, <hi>naturally,</hi> and <hi>voluntarily,</hi> yet I ſhall of the former onely, and ſo
handle it not, as relating to the Phariſees, but as it is a general Truth, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of every one, till renewed by grace, that he hath an <hi>evil treaſure, an evil
heart within him;</hi> And from thence obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That original ſinne is the evil treaſure that is in a mans heart.</hi> Sometimes the
heart it ſelf is ſaid to be <hi>evil, to be deſperately wicked;</hi> but then it's not taken <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically,</hi>
as it's a corpulent ſubſtance in a man; but <hi>morally</hi> or <hi>theologically,</hi> as it is
the <hi>ſeat</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of all evil: For as the Sea hath all the Rivers in it, from
which they come, and to which they return again; ſo the heart is the fountain of
all evil, and all evil is ſeated in it, coming from the heart, and going back again
to it.</p>
                        <p>But let us open this <hi>treaſure,</hi> which is not like the opening of that <hi>Alablaſter
Box,</hi> which <hi>perfumed the whole houſe;</hi> but like the opening of a noiſom Sepulchre
or dunghil, from whence cometh only what is loathſome; Therefore it's not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>treaſure</hi> in <hi>a good ſenſe,</hi> as commonly the word is uſed; for we do not uſe to
treaſure up vile and loathſom things; but becauſe in a <hi>treaſure</hi> there is <hi>plenty and
fulneſs,</hi> therefore is this <hi>evil heart,</hi> this original pollution called a <hi>treaſure,</hi> and
that very properly, for theſe reſemblances.</p>

                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>A treaſure hath fulneſs and abundance.</hi> A poor man that hath only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
enough to diſcharge his daily expences, is not ſaid to have a treaſure, for
that denoteth abundance, more than enough: Thus is original ſinne deſervedly
called a <hi>treaſure,</hi> becauſe it's a fulneſs of wickedneſs: As in Chriſt <hi>the treaſures of
wiſdom are ſaid to be in him,</hi> Col. 2. 3. So in every man, there is a treaſure of
folly and wickedneſs; ſo that every man is rich enough to ſinne, let him be never
ſo poor, never ſo ſtraitned, not a morſel of meat to eat, not a farthing to
buy any thing with, yet he hath a rich heart, a full heart to ſinne, he is never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
of plenty and power to do that; which conſideration ſhould greatly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thee to think, in ſtead of that good treaſure, which God once put into my
heart, being throughly furniſhed with every grace; now there is a treaſure of
evil; now darkneſs is where all that light was; evil, and nothing but evil, where
all that good was; Though thou art a rich man, and a great man, glorying in
thy treaſures of wealth, yet the treaſures of evil in thy heart, may make thee fear
and tremble.</p>

                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57719:69"/>
Secondly, <hi>Here is denoted in this expreſſion, That all ſinne is potentially and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
in our hearts;</hi> For it's not ſaid to be an <hi>evil heart</hi> in ſome reſpect, and as
to ſome actings, but indefinitely and generally, <hi>an evil treaſure of the heart.</hi> Hence
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 14, 15. There are in man by nature crimſon actual ſins of the greateſt guilt,
viz. <hi>The poiſon of Aſps is under their tongues, their mouth is full of curſing, their
feet are ſwift to ſhed blood,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe ſins which ſome few of mankind only, and
thoſe the worſt of men, do ordinarily commit, yet they are attributed to every
man by nature; And why? becauſe there is the treaſure of theſe in his heart; you
cannot name the vileſt actions that are, though for the preſent like <hi>Hazael,</hi> thou
wouldſt defie ſuch things, ſaying, <hi>Am I a dog,</hi> a devil, <hi>that I ſhould do them?</hi>
yet did not God bind up this treaſure of evil in thee, as he doth the clouds, that
are his treaſures of rain, thou wouldſt quickly be overwhelmed with them; what
trembling ſhould this make in a mans heart, when he ſhall conſider, there is not
the vileſt and moſt prophane atheiſtical man breathing, but thy heart would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thee out to do the like, did not God ſay to this ſea of corruption within thee,
<hi>Hitherto thou ſhalt go and no further?</hi> It is becauſe of this, that <hi>David</hi> and other
eminent godly men, have fallen into ſuch groſs and loathſom ſins, that you would
have thought they had not been in the leaſt danger of, that they were as farre
from, as the Eaſt from the Weſt, yet how quickly could theſe materials for ſinne
in their hearts ripen, and break out into a flame? How quickly did even the green
Tree burn? What then <hi>would the dry Tree do?</hi> Look then upon thy ſelf, as the
vileſt ſinner in the world, in reſpect of thy principles, and propencity to all ſin;
Say, it is not becauſe I have a better nature, I have leſs original ſin in me, but becauſe
God is pleaſed to put a reſtraint upon me! Certainly, if this will not make us
like <hi>Job, abhorre our ſelves,</hi> as it were, upon the dunghill, what will?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>In that original ſinne is compared to a treaſure, there is denoted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſted
nature of it, though we ſinne never ſo much, yet the ſtock of ſin
is not quite ſpent.</hi> As God, becauſe he hath a <hi>treaſure of mercy,</hi> and therefore ſaid
to be <hi>rich in grace;</hi> though he ſheweth never ſo much mercy, and vouchſafeth
never ſo much grace, yet his treaſure is not impoveriſhed thereby, he is as fully
able to beſtow freſh grace, and new mercy to thee, as if this were the firſt time
that ever he began to be mercifull: Thus, though with great diſproportion, it is
with a man that hath this evil treaſure in his heart; Though he ſinne all the day
long, though from this abundance his mind thinketh, his tongue ſpeaketh, his
hand acteth that which is evil, yet ſtill his corruption is not abated, yea it is the
more ſtrenghned and increaſed: As it is with poiſonous creatures, though they
vent never ſo much poiſon, yet they cannot caſt out the root and cauſe of it as
long as they live: So though a natural man be all the day long ſending forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſinne and folly, yet his heart is as full as ever, this fountain is not dried
up; Therefore although it may fall out, that many bodily ſinnes cannot be any
longer committed, becauſe the body groweth old and infirm, yet this original ſin
is never weakned, while a man is unregenerated, but in a natural man, though an
hundred years old, yet it is as vigorous and active, as in youthfull ſins. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of a liberal Emperour, who was much in free munificence, that he would
ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Draw from me, as from the River Nilus,</hi> meaning, that he
would never be weary, that he was like a fountain, of which all travellers might
drink, yet he be as full as ever: Thus it is with this treaſure of original ſinne, all
the ſins that have come from it to this day, have not at all diminiſhed the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
it's as full and as overflowing as ever, yea as ſudden ſhowrs make the rivers
fuller, cauſing a flood; Thus do all actual and cuſtomary ſins, they make this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
corruption like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s fornace ſeven times hotter than it was
before.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>In that it is called a treaſure, we thereby ſee the delight and pleaſure
that we naturally take in what is ſinfull.</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Where a mans treaſure
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57719:70"/>
is, there his heart is alſo;</hi> how much more when this treaſure is his heart, when
his heart and treaſure is all one? Therefore this expreſſion doth denote the futa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pleaſing nature of ſinne to us; it ſheweth, that what water is to the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical
man, as <hi>Job</hi> 15. ſo is ſinne to a man by nature: Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. they
are called, <hi>The pleaſures of ſinne;</hi> Who would think ſo? you would rather think
we might as well ſay, The pleaſures of hell, and the pleaſures of damnation, that
a man would be as willing to be damned, as to ſinne; But thus ſweet and pleaſing
is ſinne to every man by nature, becauſe his heart is upon it, it is a treaſure to
him; That as the godly account Gods will <hi>ſweeter than the honey-comb,</hi> ſo do they
the will and luſts of ſinne; Do ye not pity ſuch, who are ſo diſtempered in their
palate, that they cannot forbear eating thoſe things, which will be their death at
laſt? How much more miſerable is man, to whom nothing is ſo pleaſant, ſo much
ſought after, as that which will prove his eternal damnation? And certainly, if
ſinne be not ſuch a delight to thee naturally, how cometh it about that no threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
no fear of hell, all the curſes in the Law denounced againſt thee cannot
make thee forbear? If you regard ſinne in its own nature, ſo the Scripture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it moſt irkſom and loathſom, comparing it to gall, to a bitter root, to mire,
to vomit; And who can deſire to ſwallow down theſe things? But becauſe ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne hath infected all, hath made us like ſo many beaſts, therefore what is
in it ſelf abominable, to our corrupt natures is become exceeding pleaſant.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe it's a treaſure, therefore it is that every day there cometh from
us ſome new corruption or other, ſome new ſinne or other to be matter of condemnation
to us.</hi> That when we might think, if once we had got our hearts to ſuch a frame,
if once we could ſubdue ſuch a corruption, then, we hope we ſhould be at ſome
eaſe; but no ſooner have we obtained ſuch deſires, but this treaſure of evil pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out new matter of ſorrow, corruptions riſe freſh again, when we began to
hope all were dead; So that the ſoul begins to be even hopeleſs, crying out, O
Lord, how long? When ſhall this bloudy flux be ſtopped? When ſhall it once be
that I may be quiet and free from this moleſting enemy within? But it is with thy
heart as with the ſea, when one wave is over, preſently there cometh another,
and again another, and it cannot be otherwiſe as long as this treaſure is in us, as
<hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. A Tree though the boughes of it be cut, yet the root will
ſpring again, and be as big as ever, if ſuffered to grow: Thus original ſin, though
it may be mortified and crucified in ſome meaſure, though there may be much
ſtopping and abating the ſtrength of it by grace, yet becauſe the root is there
ſtill, it will quickly ſprout again: Hence are the godly put upon thoſe duties of
crucifying and mortifying the fleſh, becauſe they will have this work to do, as
long as they live; there is a treaſure, and ſo out of this, as the good Scribe <hi>cut
of his good treaſure,</hi> Mat. 13. 52. <hi>doth bring out new and old,</hi> thus doth he old
luſts and new.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction. Have we all by nature an evil treaſure in our hearts, then
ſee, why it is that thou art alwayes ſinning, that thou art never weary, that all
the world cannot change thee, or make thee of another mind? Is it not this evil
treaſure within? As it is a treaſure of ſinne, ſo it is of wrath and puniſhment,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. ſome are ſaid, <hi>To treaſure up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath;</hi>
and this is thy caſe, and never do thou flatter thy ſelf, becauſe thou doſt not feel
and perceive any ſuch evil upon thee, for therein art thou the more miſerable;
Treaſures uſe to be hidden and ſecret, therefore in the Scripture called <hi>hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi>
and thus is this treaſure of evil in thy heart, it is hidden from thee, thou
doſt not know it, till God open thy eyes, till he give a tender heart.</p>

Only we muſt neceſſarily take notice of this Title given to it here,

the <hi>Illyrican</hi> abſurdity, That original ſinne is not an accident, but a ſubſtance;

<hi>Fleſh,</hi> we owe nothing at all to that, ſinne will not juſtifie us, ſinne will not
ſave us: Neither hath the Devil ſhewed that love to us, which Chriſt hath
done.</p>
                        <p>By this then we ſee, That though Juſtification and Goſpel-mercies be not
for any works or merits of ours, yet Believers are to ſtudy and abound in
holineſs, as <hi>that which Chriſt aimed at by the work of Redemption, as well as
our Juſtification.</hi> Now for this reluctancy againſt, and mortification of ſinne,

So <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. it's called <hi>The body of ſinne;</hi> and certainly it may as well be

                        <p>BUt let us conſider, Why it hath ſuch a name given to it. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>It is to ſhew, That original ſinne doth not lie latent in our breaſts, but
putteth it ſelf forth viſibly in all the operations of the body:</hi> That as the Godhead is
ſaid to <hi>dwell in Chriſt boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ly,</hi> and <hi>the Word was made fleſh,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
which is immaterial and inviſible, did through the body become as it were
viſible. Thus we may ſay, Original ſinne dwelleth in us bodily, and that it is
made our fleſh, becauſe in and through all bodily actions, it doth manifeſt it ſelf
both to our ſelves and others: It is then the body of ſinne, becauſe it makes it
ſelf outward viſible, and doth as it were incarnate ſinne, hence it is called the
<hi>outward man:</hi> Indeed it is diſputed, whether 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. where the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>Though our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed daily;</hi> By
outward man there is meant the body only, or original ſinne in the bodily deeds
thereof; Moſt do interpret it of the body only, yet <hi>Paraeus</hi> underſtands it of
original ſinne with the body, That as the body and original corruptions with the
effects thereof are conſtantly dying, being mortified by the Spirit of God, ſo
the inward man, which is the work of grace, is daily more confirmed; Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this be, yet it is plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 22. That the work of grace within us, being
called the <hi>inward man,</hi> that by oppoſition, original corruption muſt be the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man,</hi> and therefore called, <hi>The Law in our members.</hi> It is thought by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimbergius,</hi>
that the Apoſtle taketh this diſtinction of an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward
man</hi> from <hi>Plato,</hi> out of whom he quoteth a place, with ſome <hi>vicinity</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi>'s
expreſſion. This is certain, That original ſinne may well be called, <hi>a body, and
the Law in our members,</hi> becauſe by theſe it doth ſo palpably put forth its ſelf:
Inſomuch that we may wonder any will not believe there is original ſinne, for it is
<hi>obvious to the ſenſe,</hi> they may behold the effects of it, that as you may know a man
hath a ſoul, becauſe he ſpeaketh and laugheth, though you cannot ſee the ſoul:
Thus though you cannot ſee original ſinne, yet becauſe as ſoon as ever the child
can ſpeak or do any thing, you ſee vanity and ſinne put forth it ſelf, therefore
you may conclude there is original ſinne: Thou then, that wilt not be convinced
of it by Scripture, by reaſons and ſeveral Authorities, we ſend thee to <hi>experience;</hi>
You cannot go from houſe to houſe, from Town to Town, from company to
company, but you may ſee the effects and actings of original ſinne: If you ſay,
It's mens actual ſins and cuſtom therein, that makes them ſo vile; It is true; But
ſtill we ask, Whence came the cuſtom? Whence came they to have thoſe actings?
Certainly, thoſe ſtreams could not have been polluted, if the fountain had not
been; and if original ſinne did not infect our natures, why ſhould not men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
as well act that which is good, and obtain a cuſtom in that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable?
Therefore experience, thy eyes, thy ears, may convince thee of this
bodily ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle calleth it a <hi>Body, to anſwer thoſe other expreſſions that he
uſeth about it, for he often calleth upon us to mortifie, to kill, to crucifie this original
ſinne:</hi> Now to <hi>mortifie</hi> and <hi>crucifie</hi> are properly relating to a <hi>Body,</hi> we do not
ſay properly accidents, or qualities are crucified. To make therefore the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
harmonious, he calleth it a <hi>Body;</hi> Howſoever therefore it is with our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
body, that no man <hi>ever yet hated his own fleſh,</hi> we are to nouriſh and cheriſh
that, and it would be murder to mortifie that body, yet this <hi>Body of ſinne</hi> is to
be <hi>kept under,</hi> we are not to ſpare it, but by the Spirit of God to be conſtantly
crucifying of it; neither let that diſcourage thee, becauſe (as you heard) this
will be painfull and grievous to fleſh and blood; for you muſt conclude upon this,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57719:72"/>
That the way to <hi>Heaven</hi> is <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>ſtraight,</hi> there muſt be <hi>conſtant violence</hi>
and <hi>oppoſition</hi> to all natural inclinations: Every godly man may well be called a
Martyr, for though he may feel no pain in the killing of his natural body, yet he
muſt and will feel much exerciſe in killing the body of ſinne, but better endure
ſome grief here, than eternal torments hereafter. Our Saviour ſpeaks to this
twice, as it's mentioned by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew, Chap. 5. 30 &amp; 18. 3. It is
better</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to go halt and blind into life, than with two hands and eyes to be
caſt into everlaſting fire:</hi> Think then, whether will be more burdenſom to leave
the pleaſures of ſinne here, or hereafter to be tormented to all eternity.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Original ſinne may be called a <hi>Body, To ſhew the reality of it, that
it is not a meer fancy or humane figment, as ſome call it, or a</hi> non ens (as the late
Writer D. <hi>J. T.</hi> Anſw. to a letter.) We know the Scripture, and ſo our uſe of
ſpeech oppoſeth a body to a ſhadow; The Legal Rites are called a ſhadow, and
Chriſt the body; Thus original ſinne, it is not the ſhadow, or the notion of a
ſinne, it liveth and moveth as well as actual, it provoketh God, it curſeth and
damneth as well as actual ſins; So that we are not to flight it, or to be fearleſs of
it, but rather to tremble under it, as the fountain of all our evil and calamity.
The word <hi>Body</hi> is ſometimes taken for that which is <hi>ſubſtantial and real,</hi> in which
ſenſe ſome have excuſed <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, that attributed a body to God and
Angels, as if they intended nothing but a real ſubſtance, as the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iome of the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> was, <hi>Omne quod eſt, eſt corpus;</hi> Hence they made Virtues and the Arts,
<hi>Bodies:</hi> But whatſoever their intentions might be, the expreſſion is dangerous,
for God is a Spirit; but there is no danger to call original ſinne a <hi>Body,</hi> thereby
to expreſs the full and real nature of it, and thus farre <hi>Illyricus</hi> his intention was
good, though his opinion was abſurd, to amplifie thoſe terms the Scripture giveth
to original ſinne in oppoſition to Popery, wherein they ſpeak ſo coldly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
of it, only that he ſhould therefore make it to be more than an accident,
even the ſubſtance of a man in a theological conſideration; hence he did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Philoſophy and Divinity; So that properly the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Poet cannot
be excuſed, when he ſaith,
<q>
                              <l>Ipſe Deo eoram ſine Chriſto culpa ſcelumque,</l>
                              <l>Ipſe ego peccatum ſum, proprieque vocer.</l>
                           </q>
In a figurative expreſſion it may paſs, but he intended <hi>Flaccianiſm;</hi> hence <hi>Cont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi>
ſpeaks of <hi>Illyricus</hi> by ſcorn, <hi>Cujus vel ſubſtantia eſt peccatum.</hi> Yet thus much
we muſt take notice of, That the Scripture doth not in vain uſe ſuch ſubſtantive
names about our natural defilement, for hereby it doth aggravate it, and would
have us alſo know the greatneſs and vileneſs of it; For how few are there, till ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and enlightned by the Spirit of God, that do bewail this as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?
They can complain of the pains, the aches, the troubles of their natural
body, but do not at all regard this body of ſin, whereas to a ſpiritual tender heart,
this body of ſinne is farre more grievous than any bodily diſeaſes, or death it ſelf,
yea death is therefore welcome to them, becauſe that alone will free from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of ſinne, ſo that they ſhall never be moleſted with it more.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Original ſinne is called the <hi>Body of ſinne, Becauſe it is a maſs of ſin,
a lump of all evil:</hi> It is not <hi>one</hi> ſinne, but <hi>all</hi> ſinne <hi>ſeminally:</hi> And this ſeemeth to
be the moſt formal and expreſs reaſon, why the Apoſtle giveth it this name, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it a <hi>Body,</hi> and attributing members to it; for as a body is not one member,
or one part, but the whole compounded of all; Thus is original ſinne, it is not
the defilement, or pollution in one part of the ſoul, but it diffuſeth it ſelf through
all. It is a body of ſinne, and herein it doth exceed all actual tranſgreſſions, and
for this reaſon, we ought the more to grieve and mourn under it; The body is
heavier than one part, why are actual ſins a load upon thee, but this which is the
cauſe of all, and comprehends all, thou art never affected with? O pray more
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57719:72"/>
for the Spirit of conviction by the Word! Look oftner into the pure glaſs of the
Law! Compare thy univerſal deformity with that exact purity! It is for want of
this the phariſaical and the natural man is ſo ſelf-confident, truſteth ſo much in his
own heart, doth ſo eaſily perſwade himſelf of Gods love, whereas if we come
to a Chriſtian like <hi>Paul,</hi> complaining of this <hi>Law of ſinne within him,</hi> finding it
<hi>captivating</hi> and <hi>haling</hi> of him whither he would not, then we have much a do to
comfort ſuch an one, all our work is to make him have any hope in Chriſt, he
thinketh none are ſo bad as he, that the very devils have not worſe in them, than
he feeleth in himſelf; and all this is, becauſe original ſinne is ſuch a loathſom dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill
in his breſt, that as thoſe who have putrified arms, or other parts of their
body, they cannot endure themſelves, they would flie from themſelves: Thus it
is with them, becauſe of this original pollution.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Original ſinne may be called a <hi>Body, Becauſe it inclineth onely to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
earthly and bodily things, not at all ſavouring the things of God and his Spirit.</hi>
Hence it is called ſo often the <hi>fleſh,</hi> becauſe it only carrieth a man to fleſhly things,
being contrary to God, and full of enmity to his will, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And doth not
experience confirm this? Take any man, till renewed by grace, and all the bent
and impulſe of his ſoul, are to ſuch things alone, that are earthy and ſenſual, <hi>Jam.</hi>
3. 17. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth there excellently deſcribe the nature of all natural
wiſdom, <hi>It is earthy, ſenſual and deviliſh;</hi> Every one by nature is both beaſtly
and devilliſh; This body of ſinne preſſeth him down to the earth and hell: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that you may as ſoon ſee a worm flying in the air like a bird, as a man abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in this natural pollution, having his converſation in heaven; So that being
made thus bodily and carnal, all the ſpiritual things of God are both above our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
and contrary to our affections. Now this very particular, if there were
no more, is as deep as the Sea, and containeth unſpeakable matter of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> That by this natural pollution, we are deſtitute of Gods Spirit; Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things are no more apprehended by us, than melody by the deaf ear: Do ye
not ſee wiſe men, learned men, yea great Scholars, when you come to diſcourſe
with them about ſpiritual things, they are very fools, and are as blind as moles
that live wholly in the earth? But of this more in the effects of original ſin.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, In the Scripture, <hi>Body is uſed ſometimes for the ſtrength and power of a
thing;</hi> And thus original ſinne is the body, as that which giveth life and motion
to all actual ſins.</p>
                        <p>Let the Uſe be greatly to humble thee under this notion Gods word gives ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, This ſinfull <hi>body;</hi> It troubleth thee thou haſt a mortal body, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
body, but above all this <hi>body of ſinne</hi> ſhould be a burden to thee; What
ſhall God give all theſe names to it, to make thee afraid, and to groan under it,
yet ſhall thy heart continue ſtill like the rock and adamant?</p>

                        <p>2. That he made him in time.</p>

                        <p>6. The impoſition of the name <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Eve,</hi> as well as to <hi>Adam;</hi> And this
he calleth, <hi>The Book of the generations of Adam,</hi> viz. His ſucceſſion, with all
his acts of his Life, and alſo his Death, otherwiſe <hi>Adam</hi> had no generation, but
was created by God.</p>
                        <p>The Hebrew word, though ſometimes it ſignifieth a <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> yet in the
general it is no more than a <hi>Catalogue</hi> or <hi>Rehearſal,</hi> as it is here, and ſo is to be
interpreted in ſome other places, the neglect whereof hath in part made an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of diſpute, Whether any Canonical Books be loſt or no, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 14.
whereas the word there is not to be taken for an <hi>Hiſtorical Volume,</hi> but the <hi>Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration</hi>
or <hi>Rehearſal</hi> of the ways of the Lord?</p>
                        <p>In the next place, he proceedeth to <hi>Seth,</hi> not but that <hi>Adam</hi> had other ſons,
only he mentioneth him, as the future head of humane poſterity upon the drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the world: Now concerning him, we have his name, he was called <hi>Seth.</hi>
There were Heretiques called <hi>Sethiani,</hi> who attributed unto him more than a man,
but the holy Ghoſt doth antidote againſt that opinion, by informing of us, that
he was begotten in a ſinfull, mortal eſtate.</p>
                        <p>2. Of whom he was begotten, and that is of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. How, or in what manner? and that is, <hi>After Adams Image, in his own
likeneſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Adam</hi> was created after the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>likeneſs</hi> of God, that is, in a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat reſemblance; for Image and likeneſs do not differ, though the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57719:73"/>
Schoolmen attempt to difference them, but it is an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> putting two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantives
together for aggravation ſake, and it is as much here, as an Image ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
like.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Adam</hi> was made in reſpect of his ſoul qualified with holineſs like God;
but in the Text <hi>Seth</hi> is ſaid to be begotten of <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Image, not in
Gods, that is, <hi>in a corrupt, miſerable and mortal eſtate:</hi> For whereas <hi>Adam</hi>
was by Nature a man; by Condition, the Lord and Chief, in whom humane
Poſterity was to be reckoned of; As alſo in reſpect of corruption, now polluted
having loſt Gods Image. <hi>Seth</hi> was <hi>after</hi> Adam<hi>'s own likeneſſe,</hi> in all theſe three
particulars: That he was a <hi>man like him,</hi> none can doubt; That he was like
<hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Headſhip</hi> to his Poſterity, is plain, becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> was
dead, and <hi>Cain</hi> with his Poſterity was to be deſtroyed in the floud. Not that
this is the whole <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>likeneſſe</hi> here ſpoken of; That as <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt
Head of mankind, ſo <hi>Seth</hi> was to be of thoſe, who ſhould be preſerved in the
flood, as ſome would have it; For ſuch a reſemblance would have been more
eminently in <hi>Noah,</hi> who in the Ark ſeemed to be the common Parent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therefore in the third place, This</hi> Image <hi>or</hi> likeneſſe, <hi>to</hi> Adam <hi>is mentioned</hi>
eppoſitely <hi>to that</hi> Image of God, <hi>which</hi> Adam <hi>was created in; And if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
Why is it not as Well ſaid of <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Cain,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> begat them after his
own Image as well as <hi>Seth?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Anſwer is plain, <hi>Moſes</hi> in this Hiſtorical Capitulation, doth not
mention all in a Family, but ſuch who were onely by a direct Line to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to their Poſterity, and to be an Head to that. Now not <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Cain,</hi>
but <hi>Seth</hi> was appointed by God in this place; And that we might know in
what manner all Generations are to deſcend from him, the Scripture doth here
inform us, That we muſt not think, that <hi>Seth</hi> had from <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>Image of
God,</hi> or would propagate it to others; but now he and we are as <hi>Adam</hi> after
his fall, ſinfull and mortal: For although the Church hath generally thought
of <hi>Adam,</hi> that he did repent and was ſaved; for we doe not reade after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of any groſſe ſinne he committed, and God made the glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of a Saviour to him, yet he did not beget <hi>Seth,</hi> as he was regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but <hi>as a man;</hi> and ſo being fallen from that Covenant, he was firſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in, his perſonal grace afterwards could not be conveyed to his Poſterity, as
his ſinne, while a common Parent was. We ſee then, though <hi>Adam</hi> was godly,
and <hi>Seth</hi> was likewiſe holy, yet for all that he was born without the Image of God,
and in a polluted eſtate.</p>
                        <p>Beſides therefore in this place is a ſeaſonable mentioning of the <hi>likeneſſe</hi>
and <hi>Image Adam</hi> begat <hi>Seth</hi> in, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> being here to capitulate
their ſeveral Generations, which doth imply their mortality, doth oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely
give the cauſe of it: So that <hi>Snecanin (Method. Diſtri. Cauſe. Sol.

Whether by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Image be not meant his repaired Image with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
one, being now aſſumed unto Gods favour, ſeemeth directly to oppoſe
the Text, which calleth it <hi>Adam</hi>'s own Image, not Gods.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I ſhall beginne with the</hi> Privative <hi>part,</hi> That original ſinne is the privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that original Righteouſneſſe, and glorious Image of God, which was at
firſt put into us: <hi>And this the holy Ghoſt meaneth, when he ſaith,</hi> Adam begat
Seth after his own likeneſſe and Image. <hi>From whence obſerve,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That we are by nature without the Image of God we were created in,</hi> and
this is a great part of our original ſinne. This truth of the loſſe of Gods
Image in us, is of very great concernment, and therefore to be improved
both <hi>Doctrinally</hi> and <hi>Practically.</hi> It is the greateſt loſſe that ever beſell man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and oh our carnal and dull hearts, which can bewail the loſſe of health,
of wealth, of any outward comfort, but this which is the greateſt loſſe of all,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Image of God, which we ſhould bewail all our life time, that we are
no wayes ſenſible of!</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not at large in this place treat, <hi>De Imagine Dei,</hi> of <hi>the Image of God
in man,</hi> I ſhall ſay onely ſo much as will make us the better diſcover the Nature
of original ſinne. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, We are to know, That howſoever there be hot and fervent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
about this Image of God, what it is, wherein it doth conſiſt, (and
according as they take it more largely or ſtrictly, ſo they conclude the Image
of God is loſt, or not loſt) yet we may by Scripture-light make it to conſiſt
in theſe things.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, <hi>In the ſoul, as it is endowed with reaſon and underſtanding:</hi> For
herein man did tranſcend all other viſible creatures, that God
made him with a rational ſoul, inveſting him with reaſon and free-will,
and in this reſpect the <hi>Image of God is not totally loſt;</hi> For
though by it we have loſt all our power and underſtanding in holy
things, yet we have not loſt our ſouls, and the natural faculties thereof; we are
not made bruit beaſts, we are men ſtill; Hence it is that ſtill the reaſon holds,
Why a man ſhould not kill another, <hi>Gen. 9. 6. For in the image of God made he
man;</hi> If there were not yet the Image of God in ſome reſpect, the reaſon would
not be ſo forcible; For what weight would it carry to ſay, Thou ſhalt not kill a
man, becauſe once he had the Image of God, but now he hath loſt it? God
ſpeaketh of what he will require of every man that hath ſlain another, and that
becauſe in the Image of God he made him: Thus <hi>Jame.</hi> 3. 9. aggravateth the ſinne
of curſing any man, becauſe man is made after the ſimilitude of God; To this
we may appropriate that of the Poet, confirmed (<hi>Act.</hi> 17.) by the Apoſtle
himſelf, <hi>We are his off ſpring:</hi> We will grant then, That the Image of God, ſo
farre as it conſiſts in the ſoul, and the natural faculties, is not loſt, though in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the actings thereof even about natural things, they are made infirm and
weak.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>The Image of God did conſiſt in that holineſſe and righteouſneſſ, which
God did adorn the ſoul with:</hi> And this indeed is the moſt noble and principal part
of Gods Image, to be made like God in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Col. 3. 10. Epheſ.</hi> 4, 24. we read the Image of God is ſaid to be <hi>in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and true holineſſe:</hi> Inſomuch that many learned Divines do make this the
onely Image of God, though not ſo probably; This indeed is the principal and
chief, the other is but remote and ſecundary, for the later abideth even in the
Devils and the damned in hell; They have reaſon and underſtanding, yet they
cannot do the leaſt good action, no not for a moment, although they have ſo
much light in them. This holineſſe and righteouſneſſe then in the whole man,
was the chiefeſt reſemblance of God, he being holy as God was holy, not by <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
but <hi>ſimilitude.</hi> But alas, who is able to apprehend aright of this? Who can
now tell, being plunged into all evil and ſinne, what it is to be altogether holy,
what it is to be without any blemiſh or ſpot? Yet in ſuch a glorious and admirable
manner we were created.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly, The Image of God did not only comprehend this holineſſe actually dwelling
in us, but a power and ſtrength alſo to perſevere in this holineſſe; for if God had been
never ſo bountifull in one, yet if he had denied the other, he would have made us happy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57719:75"/>
that thereby we might become more miſerable.</hi> But this is not to be thought of that
God, who ſhewed ſo much love and bounty in our firſt Creation; <hi>Adam</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had <hi>the Law of God written in his heart, having ſtrength and ability from
within to withſtand all temptations, and to perform any holy auty; ſo that we cannot
inſtance in any holy action, which he had not power to perform</hi> Indeed to believe
in Chriſt as a Saviour, to repent of ſinne, he could not actually do them, becauſe
they do neceſſarily imply the ſubject ſinfull, and in a miſerable eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but eminently and tranſcendently theſe things were in his power; yea, this
power of his did extend to keep all the Commandments of God, and that without
any imperfection; Inſomuch that being under the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> he might
have obtained juſtification by them, though <hi>not meritoriouſty;</hi> This glory did God
at firſt put upon us, who now have nothing but a curſed ſlavery unto ſinne, and
an utter impotency to any thing that is holy: As for reſiſting any temptation,
he had ſtrength and ability enough to gainſay it, though it had been in many
degrees more violent, than that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> him: It is true, he was overcome
by a temptation, and in that which might have eaſily been repulſed, as we would
judge; but this was to ſhew, That although he was created holy, yet he was
<hi>alſo mutable;</hi> Though he had power to perſevere, yet <hi>he had not that grace which
did make him actually to perſevere,</hi> as the confirmed Angels have: So that what
Hiſtorians ſay of the <hi>Marſi</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> in <hi>Africa,</hi> That they had
ſuch a temper of body, that no Serpents could hurt them, or poiſon them; Such
an admitable temperament was <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul in, that the Serpent would not have
deceived them had not they given conſent; For, if while we are in this corrupted
eſtate, yet the Devil <hi>cannot force us to ſinne,</hi> be cannot make us ſinne, <hi>whether
we will or no,</hi> but it is luſt within us, that betrayeth all to him: No wonder then,
if in that ſtate of integrity, there was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> to ſinne, either
from within or without.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Image of God in the holineſſe of it, was not only in the mind and
the will, with a clear knowledge of God, and love of him, but it did extend alſo to
the affections, ſo that they were made with a regular ſubordination to the rule of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
within a man.</hi> Theſe wild horſes (for our poſſions are no better) were
then all tamed, and as much ſubject to mans will, as the winds and tempells were
to Chriſts: Anger, grief, love and deſire, theſe did not riſe or continue in our
ſoul any longer, or otherwiſe, but as they were conducted by the light of God
ſhining in the mind: This muſt neceſſarily be comprehended in that expreſſion,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. when God is ſaid to make man <hi>right,</hi> rectitude is an univerſal harmony
and congruity of all the parts of the ſoul unto the rule. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did once wonder
at that diſobedience which now man finds in himſelf, <hi>Superat animu corperi</hi> &amp;c.
(<hi>Confeſ. lib. 8. cap.</hi> 9.) The ſoul commands the body, and preſently it obeyeth,
but (ſaith he) <hi>Imperat ſibi ipſi,</hi> it commands it ſelf, and then there is rebellion,
but it was not thus from the beginning: Therefore the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi>
they do blaſpheme in ſome ſenſe God our holy Maker, whale they affirm,
<hi>That the repugnancy and rebellion of the ſenſitive appetite to the reaſon, ariſeth
from the very internal conſtitution of a man;</hi> And therefore the <hi>Papiſts</hi> they
make original righteouſneſs to be the bridle only to curb this appetite, or an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
to prevent this infection. And as for the <hi>Socinian,</hi> he denieth, that <hi>Adam</hi>
had any ſuch righteouſneſs at all, and therefore they ſay he ſinned, <hi>Becauſe his
ſenſitive appetite did prevail againſt the rational:</hi> Thus they make man, <hi>even
while he was in honour,</hi> and before his fall, <hi>to be like the beaſt that periſheth,
and to have no underſtanding</hi> comparatively even in that place of Paradiſe;
But this errour is ſo dangerous, that we are not to give place to it, no
not for a moment. In that holy eſtate the ſoul commanded the body,
and all the affections; They did goe, when he bade them goe, and ſtood
ſtill, when they were commanded: Oh but now, in what a warre, in
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57719:75"/>
what a confuſion and diſtraction are we plunged? now we cannot be <hi>angry,</hi> but
we ſinne; now we cannot <hi>grieve,</hi> or <hi>love,</hi> but we ſinne; Thou that denieſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, let the exorbitancy of thy paſſions, the inordinacy of thy affections
convince thee: Is thy heart in thy own power? Canſt thou have every thing ſtirre
and move in thy ſoul, how, and when thou pleaſeſt? Canſt thou ſay in reſpect of
thy heart, and all the ſtirrings of thy ſoul, as the <hi>Centurion</hi> did of his ſervants
that were at his command? How is experience a miſtreſs of us fools in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?
Wherein doth our weakneſs, our ſinfulneſs more appear than in our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and affections? As <hi>Alexander</hi> when his flatterers exalted him as a God, he
derided at it, when he ſaw blood come from his body. Thus when men cry up
free-will, power to do what is good, deny original ſinne, and make us in our
birth free from all evil, With what indignation mayeſt thou reject it, when thou
ſeeſt the Chaos and confuſion that is in thy ſoul, when thou findeſt not any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
moving in thee, but it overfloweth it's banks preſently? Whereas original
righteouſneſs gave <hi>Adam</hi> as much power over thoſe, as he had over all the beaſts
of the field; but as the ground hath now thorns and thiſtles in ſtead of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
herbs and plants it would have produced of its own ſelf; Thus alſo man now
hath all his heart and affections grown wild and luxuriant, ſo that <hi>Solomons</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
in other things in here made true, <hi>Servants ride on horſ-back, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
go on foot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, This Image of God was partly <hi>in reſpect of the glory, honour and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
God created him in. Adam</hi> was made after the Image of God, not only
in holineſs, but alſo in happineſs; he was not ſubject to any fears or tears, nothing
from within, or from without could cauſe pain and grief to him; Hence death, by
which is meant all kind of evil and miſery, was threatned unto him, as a reward
of his diſobedience; but <hi>Adam</hi> did not beget <hi>Seth</hi> after this Image, we are now
made duſt, and in a neceſſity of dying, which is the effect of our original ſin.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Image of God</hi> doth conſiſt by way of <hi>conſequence in dominion and
ſuperiority.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> indeed, becauſe when it's ſaid, <hi>God made man after his
own Image,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. it's added, <hi>And let him have dominion over the beaſts of
the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> &amp;c. make it the only thing wherein it doth conſiſt; But we are to believe
the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ 4. Col.</hi> 3. expounding this Image of God more than they,
who applieth it to <hi>righteouſneſs and true holineſs;</hi> yet it cannot be denied, but
from this Image of God, did flow that Dominion and Sovereignty, which the
woman alſo was created in; for though ſhe was made in ſubjection to her husband,
and ſo is called, <hi>The Image of her husband,</hi> as the husband is the Image of God,
yet in reſpect of the creatures, ſo ſhe had power over them, and they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to <hi>Eve</hi> as well as to <hi>Adam.</hi> Thus you ſee what this Image of God in a brief
manner is, the next work is to amplifie our loſſe of it.</p>

                        <p>is taken away, both meritoriouſly and efficiently, meritoriouſly our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie
deſerved, that God of a Father and a friend, ſhould become a Judge and
an Adverſary to us; it deſerved that we ſhould be children of wrath by nauture,
who were children of love by Creation; What tongue of men and Angels can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the dreadfulneſs of this condition, <hi>viz.</hi> of coming into the world under
Gods wrath and vengeance? God is not to us, what he was in the ſtate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
not that any change is in God, but in us. Again, This friendſhip and love
of God is expelled efficiently, for fallen man hath no ſuitableneſs and fitneſs, no
proportion or ability to have communion with God. Darkneſs cannot delight in
light, neither bitterneſs in ſweetneſs: The ſwine cannot love pearl and precious
flowers; man corrupt cannot love or delight in the enjoyment of God; ſo that
the guilt of ſinne did preſently make <hi>Adam</hi> afraid of God, ſo as to runne from
him.</p>

                        <p>4. <hi>THis privation of Gods Image is more than like the ſpoiling of a man of his
cloaths, or like the taking of a bridle from the horſes mouth, or removing
the bonds and chains a man might be in, Which when taken off, he can walk well
enough.</hi> For the Popiſh party, though they grant, <hi>Man fallen hath much hurt
by</hi> Adam, yet they make the <hi>privation of original righteouſneſſe,</hi> to be no more
than <hi>the ſpoiling of a man of his garments; ſo that as a man without his cloaths, is
a man ſtill, though naked, and expoſed to many difficulties.</hi> Thus, they ſay, man
ſtill hath his naturals, though he hath loſt his ſupernaturals; <hi>Original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
was like an antidote, or a bridle againſt the inferiour parts of the ſoul</hi> (they ſay)
<hi>ſo that what man is deprived of, is only what was ſupernatural and meerly ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to humane nature.</hi> By theſe ſubtilties of theirs, a mans loſſe is made to be far
leſſe than indeed it is: Hence they do ſo often apply that Parable of <hi>the man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Jericho that was wounded, and left half dead,</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in him, as if we were but dangerouſly wounded, and not throughly dead:
But the ſcope of that Parable is wholly to a different purpoſe; Original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
is not to be conceived, as a <hi>ſupernatural excellency</hi> beſtowed upon man
after his Creation, but as a <hi>concreated perfection in all the parts of his ſoul:</hi> So that
the loſing of this, is not like the loſing of ſome accidental glory and ornaments,
but even thoſe concreated perfections in the ſoul are alſo loſt. The miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this breedeth a dangerous errour, as if by original ſinne we onely had loſt
theſe ſuperadded ornaments, but did retain our pure naturals ſtill, as they call it,
which are indeed altogether impute, <hi>Eccl. 7. God made man right;</hi> Even as all
other creatures were exceeding good: Now God had made man the more noble
creature, worſe than other creatures, if he had not created him with ſuch perfect
and ſuitable qualifications, as would inable him to obtain true bleſſedneſs, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
creature elſe had an implanted ability in it, to accompliſh his end, and why then
ſhould God do leſſe bountifully with man, one of the chiefeſt inſtances of his
glorious workmanſhip? But of this I muſt neceſſarily ſpeak more, becauſe of the
<hi>Socinian,</hi> who cals this Doctrine of original righteouſneſs, <hi>Faetida fabula,</hi> an old

over his actions, his obedience had not been ſo eminent, nor his diſobedience
ſo culpable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But this flower is withered, this Crown is fallen to the ground; Man
hath now no free will, no power to do any thing that is holy; He hath power to eat
and drink, he hath power to do civil &amp; moral actions, he hath power to do actions
externally religious, to come to the Congregation, to hear; but for thoſe things that
are internally holy, to love God, to believe on him, to repent of ſin; This the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
doth in many places deny to him, making him to be <hi>dead in ſinne,</hi> and untill
born again by the Spirit, unable to do any holy duty. This <hi>Raymundus (Theol.
Natur. de lapſu hominis</hi>) doth well urge, That the ſoul as to ſpiritual actions, and
in reference to God, is wholly dead; ſo that as a dead man is not able to produce
any vital actions, ſo neither can any natural man ſpiritual actions; and becauſe
man being dead is not ſenſible of this loſſe, therefore doth the ſame man compare
him to a mad man, that knoweth not how it is with him; yea he much purſueth
that ſimilitude of <hi>wine degenerated into vinegar,</hi> ſaying, That as vinegar retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57719:77"/>
nothing of the ſweetneſſe or goodneſſe it had when it was wine: Thus neither
doth man retain any thing of that light in his mind, or love in his heart, which
once he had: <hi>Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not become of good wine bad, which though bad,
retaineth ſome taſte, and hath a little reliſh of the nature of wine; but he is as when
Wine is degenerated into vinegar, which hath all clean contrary to what is had when
once wine.</hi> This compariſon he the rather urgeth, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>man doth
not, or cannot diſcern in himſelf the difference between his created condition, and his
fallen, therefore he muſt ſee how it is with him in ſimilitude by other things.</hi> We may
adde to this ſimilitude another of <hi>the body of man</hi> while living, and an inſtrument
of the ſoul, <hi>with it ſelf when dead,</hi> and ſeparated from it, that body then though
formerly never ſo beautifull and comely, never ſo lively and active, now is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and hath the clean contrary qualities; Such a thing is man now fallen, if
compared with his Creation.</p>

                        <p>A Second inſtance of a particular in this Image of God, which we have loſt,
is <hi>Faith and dependance upon God as a Father.</hi> As God made <hi>Adam</hi> his ſon

Gods protection and preſervation, and thereby was not ſubject to any fears,
grief, or troubleſom dejections of mind about his ſoul or body; This was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

his Image, that thou haſt naturally fears and doubts within thy ſelf? Thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of God and art troubled, as <hi>Adam</hi> when he heard Gods voice, ran and hid

he loved God with all his ſoul and might, and that above all creatures, yea

                        <p>FOurthly, Another particular which is loſt is, <hi>That joy and delight which</hi> Adam

delight and rejoyce in him.</hi> Though God made the creatures for <hi>Adam</hi>'s

Ocean; <hi>Adam</hi> did then perfectly ſay, which <hi>David</hi> did with ſome imperfection,
<hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And whom in earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> God
was all things unto him. But where is this divine delight? Doth any natural man
find any ſweetneſs in holy things? Is not all our joy, a carnal, a worldly, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Image</hi> hath been treated of, both in the general and the particulars.
Now that ſtill we may the more throughly poſſeſs our ſouls with
this unſpeakable loſs, it is neceſſary to ſay ſomething of <hi>Gods Image,</hi>
which man at firſt was created in: For although I ſaid, that I
would not enter into a large Tractate of it, yet ſomething muſt be
neceſſarily ſpoken to it; for if there be no ſuch thing as original righteouſneſſe,
then there is no ſuch thing as original ſinne; if there be no ſuch thing as light,
there cannot be any ſuch thing as darkneſs. <hi>The Privation doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe
an habit;</hi> Hence the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as they wholly deny this <hi>original ſin</hi> we are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, ſo do they alſo reject this <hi>original righteouſneſs;</hi> calling it (as was ſaid)
<hi>Faetida fabula,</hi> an <hi>old ſtinking Fable, an Idea feigned in mens brains,</hi> of which
there is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, not the leaſt Title in the Scripture (<hi>Vide Pertium Harmon.</hi>) It
behoveth us therefore the more diligently to ſearch into this truth; For if <hi>Adam</hi>
never had ſuch glory and holineſs put upon him, then we his poſterity could not
loſe it.</p>
                        <p>To inform our ſelves then herein, Let us conſider,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That what</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſtate of integrity was, we cannot any wayes know, but
by the Scripture.</hi> We have now no experience of it, nor can any Philoſophy or
humane reaſon, give us any direction therein Now there are <hi>two Rocks</hi> upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57719:78"/>
which the Adverſaries of this Truth do ſplit themſelves; The one is, <hi>Judging of
original righteouſneſs,</hi> or of man in his Creation, <hi>according to the principles of
moral Philoſophy;</hi> As if we were not to read <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> concerning this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
of <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for humane Philoſophers, as they
were wholly ignorant of original ſinne, ſuppoſing the ſoul to come into the world
as an <hi>abraſa fabula,</hi> a meer blank, ready to receive good or evil, yet inclining ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to good, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, ſo they were wholly ignorant either of mans cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
or if that were acknowledged, of any imitation or change made upon man
by his Apoſtaſie. Now this principle in effect the <hi>Socinian</hi> imbibeth: For (he
ſaith) <hi>There is no righteouſneſs to be conceived in</hi> Adam, <hi>but what was actual,
that there was no habitual infuſed into him, but that he was created in a neutral and
indifferent eſtate, neither good or bad, but to be made either of theſe, as his free-will
ſhould put it ſelf forth into action.</hi> Thus you ſee how truly <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old ſaid,
<hi>Philoſophers were the Patriarchs of Heretiques;</hi> for both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Secintans</hi>
judge of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt eſtate, by principles of moral Philoſophy.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Rock upon which the erroneous party in this great Truth, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
themſelves at, is, <hi>The judging of man in his firſt Creation, according to that
which we feel in our ſelves now,</hi> as if we ſhould judge what wine is by the <hi>vinegar</hi>
it's degenerated into, as if we ſhould determine of a living body, according to
what we ſee in a dead carkaſs; And truly we may ſay, that from hence ariſeth all
<hi>Pelagianiſm, Popery</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm:</hi> We paſſe a ſentence upon the ſtate we
were created in, by what we now feel in our ſelves, as if God had not, or could
not make us otherwiſe: As for inſtance, becauſe we now in our ſelves find the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
appetitive part rebel in it's motions againſt the rational, therefore they
conclude, That this was at firſt in <hi>Adams</hi> Creation; That this repugnancy is
planted in our very conſtitution: Yea, a <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> is not afraid to ſay, <hi>It was
in Chriſt himſelf, becauſe a man, (and why not then in the glorified Saints to all
eternity, ſeeing they ſhall after the Reſurrection conſiſt of ſoul and body alſo?</hi>) In
this Poſition both <hi>Socinian, Remonſtrant</hi> and <hi>Papiſt</hi> do poſitively agree, <hi>viz.
That the repugnancy and rebellion, which is between the rational and ſenſitive part
doth ariſe from the very conſtitution of man. It ariſeth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine) not
from God, but</hi> è conditione materiae, <hi>from the condition of that matter, of which
God made him; but doth not this ariſe becauſe we ſee ſuch a repugnancy is now in
every man, becauſe there is none that can live now upon the earth without this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion?
therefore we conclude it was not alwayes ſo.</hi> If then we would ſail by theſe
Rocks, if we would be guided into this Divine Truth, let us go out of our ſelves,
and out of all the traditions, which Ethical Philoſophy hath delivered unto us,
for that ſpeaks only of what is acquired, not of any thing infuſed or concreated
with our natures, but rather think this Image of God is ſo glorious a thing, that
we know not how to ſpeak of it, or to think of it, we never had the actual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,
or working of it. It is not with us, as with men, who hold a rich and
plentifull eſtate, but are now fallen into extream poverty, ſuch can tell you by
experience, what a plentifull life they once lived. <hi>Job</hi> could tell us what honour
once he had, and the abundance he enjoyed, even when he ſate ſcraping himſelf
upon the dunghill, he could experimentally compare his former eſtate, and that
together, but ſo cannot we. Indeed thoſe common <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or dictates of nature,
whereby our conſciences have ſome light to diſcern between good and evil, may
ſerve for ſome kind of conviction, that once God did create us in a more knowing
and holy eſtate, but what it was, and fully to conceive of it, that we cannot do.
Hence</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>It's a very neceſſary thing in all men, to be often meditating
upon theſe two ſtates and conditions of man, his created ſtate, and his fallen eſtate,
his primitive condition, and his preſent condition.</hi> To compare the light men, with
his darkneſſe now, his holineſſe then with his impurity now, his immortality then
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57719:78"/>
with his mortality now, his Communion with God then, and his eſtrangement,
or contrariety now, for hereby his heart will be the more deeply humbled under
his preſent miſerable condition; Thoſe that make them both alike, or aſſign a
very little difference, they neither duly conſider what a glorious thing Gods Image
was, we were created in, nor how deep and univerſal our pollution is: Oh how
diſhonourable and dblaſphemous is it, to think we come out of Gods hands as we
are now, that at the firſt we had inclinations to ſinne, that there was a rebellion
in us to what is good! What is this but to ſay, God made us at firſt the children
of his wrath? Oh pray that the ſcales may fall from thy eyes, that thou
beeſt not delivered up to this dangerous errour, which is the broad way to
perdition.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, To underſtand the nature of that <hi>Image of God,</hi> man was
created in, you muſt take heed of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Poſition, who ſay, <hi>God made man
meerly an innocent, even as a young child, that he had not in his creation any holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
infuſed into him, but he was in a neutral and indifferent diſpoſition, to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
good or wicked, as his free-will did determine.</hi> But this is to diminiſh the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of God who made man in ſuch a diſtinguiſhing character to all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
except Angels, for Angels and men they only were created after the Image
of God; That <hi>Adam</hi> was not created in ſuch a negative frame of ſoul, appeareth,
in that the Image of God is expreſly ſaid by <hi>Paul</hi> to conſiſt in <hi>righteouſneſſe and
true holineſſe;</hi> Now righteouſneſſe is more than a not being evil, it denoteth an
inherent poſitive perfection in the ſoul; Hence <hi>Eccl</hi> 7. 30 God is there ſaid, <hi>To
make man righteous;</hi> The word <hi>Jaſhar</hi> is generally uſed to ſignifie as much as <hi>holy,
clean</hi> and <hi>pure.</hi> It is not therefore for us to contradict ſo plain Texts of Scripture;
Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 8. 5. doth admire the goodneſſe of God, and his
works to man, eſpecially in this, <hi>That he hath made him but a little lower than
Angels:</hi> Oh then admire that glorious excellency God did at firſt put us into!
We were at firſt made but a little lower than thoſe glorious Angels of God;
Therefore <hi>Chryſoſtem</hi> called <hi>Adam an earthly Angel;</hi> Now compare thy preſent
eſtate with this of <hi>Adams;</hi> Art thou like an Angel? Have Angels ſuch blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of mind, ſuch averſneſſe to what is good, ſuch rebellious and unmortified
thoughts in them, as thou haſt? Nay, Art thou not rather a Devil for pride,
for malice, for oppoſition to what is good? Was it thus with us from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning?
They therefore do moſt unthankfully rob God of all that glory and
honour which is due to him that will affirm, That God made him in ſuch an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
neutral ſtate, neither righteous or unrighteous: Surely then God could
not have looked upon all the things that were made with that approbation, <hi>They
were exceeding god;</hi> For though other creatures might be good in their kind
with a natural goodneſſe, yet <hi>Adam</hi> was in his kind with a moral goodneſſe:
Neither will the <hi>Socinian</hi> evaſion help, <hi>That by good there is meant convenient,
beautifull and proper for its end:</hi> For let no more be granted but that, it's
enough, <hi>If</hi> Adam <hi>was not created with holineſſe in his ſoul, he was not made
good in their ſenſe, that is not ſutable and ſit for his end;</hi> For being created
to know and love God, and thereby to have a comfortable enjoyment of him,
How could he do this without wiſdom in his mind, and holineſſe in his will? And
certainly we may not think, that God gave every creature a goodneſſe in its
kind, to obtain its particular end, and not adorn man, the nobleſt of viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for his peculiar end.</p>
                        <p>The Scripture then is clear, That man was at firſt made ſuch an holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
creature; Let us conſider what Reaſons are objected againſt it by the <hi>Socinian</hi>
party. And</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt, (ſay they</hi>) Adam could not be holy till he had done ſome actual holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<note place="margin">Obj</note>
how could he be denominated righteous (<hi>ſay they</hi>) till he had acted ſomething
that was righteous?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57719:79"/>
But this argueth great ignorance,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as if there were no righteouſneſſe, but
what is acquired, as if there were no infuſed habits of holineſſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate
a man ſo, before he doth that which is holy; Were not the Angels
made holy in their Creation before they acted what was holineſſe? Is not Chriſt
himſelf <hi>Luke</hi> 1. called the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the holy thing,</hi> before he did actually that
which was holy; yea the contrary is true, therefore did <hi>Adam</hi> that which was
actually holy, becauſe he was habitually holy: As the Tree is firſt good, and
then the fruit good: <hi>Adam</hi> then before his fall had both original and actual holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but the latter was an effect of the former, and therefore he did one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                           <hi>It is objected by them,</hi> That if <hi>Adam</hi> was made in the Image of
God like him, holy as he is holy, then <hi>Adam</hi> could not ſinne, he would be impeceable,
even as God is.</p>
                        <p>But this is a weak cavil,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For though man be made holy, as God is, yet that
is not by <hi>equality,</hi> but <hi>proportion</hi> onely; Were not the Angels made holy, and
yet for all that they ſinned? He then that is eſſentially and infinitely holy cannot
ſinne; yea a creature when confirmed in holineſſe by God cannot ſinne, as the
elect Angels and glorified Saints; but <hi>Adam</hi> though he was made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet was in a mutable and changeable eſtate, and therefore he might
ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Queſt. <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> Why did not this original Righteouſneſſe ſo farre
defend him, that he did not withſtand the Devil more ſtrongly, he ſeemed to have
little or no grace, that was ſo eaſily enſnared by Satan, and that in ſuch a little
matter when he enjoyed ſo much outward felicity?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> But to this we may anſwer, That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> they did not at the
very firſt yeeld themſelves up to the Devil, but they did repell the Devils tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
awbile; neither was it the inordinate deſire of the forbidden fruit that
was his firſt ſinne, but <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>unbelief;</hi> not believing the threatnings of God,
and affecting to be like God, and ſuch ſinnes do quickly and eaſily penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the beſt and nobleſt ſubjects, as you ſee in the Angels themſelves, thoſe
ſublime and admirable ſpiritual ſubſtances, yet how quickly did ſuch kind
of ſinnes enter into them, and defile them all over; So that we are to look
to thoſe ſpiritual ſecret ſinnes, which did induce <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the forbidden
fruit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                           <hi>It's objected by them, and the ſame Argument alſo is improved by</hi>
Bellarmine, That man conſiſting of a ſoul, a ſpiritual ſubſtance, and of a body,
which is a ſenſible corporeal ſubſtance, when theſe two are united in one perſon, it's
impoſſible, but the ſpiritual part ſhould incline one way, and the ſenſitive another;
The rational part that deſireth a ſpiritual good, and the ſenſitive part that which is
ſenſible, and theſe are contrary.</p>
                        <p>But the anſwer is,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that though <hi>theſe inclinations are divers, yet they are not contrary,
but where ſin hath made an Ataxy.</hi> As God at firſt ordained the will, which is <hi>appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
rationalis,</hi> to follow the underſtanding, ſo he did alſo our affections to follow
both of them; ſo that there was an eſſential ſubordination of the affectionate part
to the rational; even as we ſee the members of the body do readily move at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the ſoul, or as in perfect mixt bodies, though there be contrary qualities,
yet by the temperament of that body, their contrariety is removed; and certainly,
the Angels ſinned, who yet had not any ſenſitive appetite to rebell againſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
therefore it was not from this neceſſarily, that <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne. Thus
in Chriſt there was no repugnancy between grace and nature; for when he ſaid,
<hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſſe away;</hi> This was not an abſolute deſire
of his humane nature, but a conditional one, and ſtill with ſubmiſſion; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he addeth, <hi>Nevertheleſſe thy will be done;</hi> and the Saints in Heaven,
when they ſhall have re-aſſumed their bodies, will not find any contrariety
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57719:79"/>
between the rational and ſenſitive appetite. And thus you ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> was
created in this holy eſtate.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>This holineſs and righteouſneſs in a well explained ſenſe, was not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
but natural.</hi> The <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> they make this diſpute about original
righteouſneſſe, <hi>inepta &amp; abſurda,</hi> abſurd and fooliſh; Therefore they deny any
infuſed or concreated habits alſo, and ſay, The rectitude of the faculties was
enough; But the Orthodox ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> could not be created without ſuch habits
or principles of holineſſe within him, becauſe he was created for the enjoyment
of God, and therefore they call it <hi>natural,</hi> not as flowing from the principles of
nature, but as a <hi>moral condition</hi> neceſſary to qualifie him for his end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was given to whole mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> and would have been naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated;
and whereas the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ask, <hi>To what purpoſe or uſe is ſuch origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
righteouſneſſe?</hi> For if it did not neceſſarily and immutably determine <hi>Adams</hi>
will to good, than this original righteouſneſſe, did need another, and ſo <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
or if it did then, How came it about that <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne? To this ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it is anſwered, That this original righteouſneſſe was not to determine the will
of <hi>Adam</hi> neceſſarily, but to incline and ſortifie <hi>Adams</hi> will the more ſtrongly,
and eaſily to do what was good; So that although it did not abſolutely take
away <hi>Adams</hi> mutability and liberty, yet it did heighten and raiſe up the faculties
of his ſoul to what was good, yet this was not a ſuperadded grace to <hi>Adam,</hi> as
actual confirmation in holines would have been, but a natural and due qualification
preparing him for communion with God; So that the diſcourſe about man in his
pure naturals without this original righteouſneſſe, is an houſe that hath not
ſo much as a ſandy foundation, it being without any foundation at all, God
having put his Image into man, as <hi>Phydias</hi> did his into <hi>Minerva</hi>'s ſhield,
that none could take that out, but he muſt alſo deſtroy that ſhield: Thus
the Devil could not prevail with <hi>Adam</hi> to ſinne, but by the loſſe of Gods
Image.</p>

                        <p>The laſt particular was, <hi>The naturality and ſupernaturality of
it in divers reſpects:</hi> And this is the more to be obſerved, becauſe
while the Orthodox oppoſe the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who affirm, Nothing
but a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſimple innocency in Adam,</hi> without any <hi>infuſed
or concreated habits of holineſſe, or any thing ſupernatural in him;</hi> You would
think they joyn with the Papiſts, who dogmatize, <hi>That all the holineſſe</hi> Adam
<hi>had was ſupernatural.</hi> Again, while the ſame Orthodox oppoſe Papiſts, becauſe
of this opinion, one would think they joyned with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who ſay, <hi>Adam
had nothing in him, but what was natural,</hi> whereas the truth conſiſts between
theſe; and therefore original righteouſneſſe was ſupernatural to <hi>Adam;</hi> if you
reſpect the principle from whence it did flow, it was immediately from God, not
from principles of nature, and this oppoſeth the <hi>Socinian;</hi> yet if you do conſider
<hi>Adam</hi> the ſubject of this righteouſneſſe, and the end for which he was created,
ſo it was a perfection <hi>due</hi> to him, and in that reſpect called <hi>natural,</hi> otherwiſe
had not God inveſted mans nature with this and concreated this perfection with
him, the nobleſt of viſible creatures had been dealt worſt with.</p>

                     <div n="2" type="section">
                        <head>SECT. II.</head>
                        <p>YEt in the ſecond place, <hi>Though this Image of God was natural to</hi> Adam, <hi>yet
we muſt not ſay, that he had nothing ſupernatural, that there was nothing by
way of ſuperadded grace to him.</hi> Even as in <hi>Adam,</hi> although we deny, that he
was created in pure naturals, yet we ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> in ſome reſpect may be ſaid
in Paradiſe to live an animal life, as well as he was created immortal; <hi>Adam was
made free from death,</hi> he had not any proxim or immediate cauſe of death, yet
he was not made immortal, as the glorified Saints in Heaven ſhall be, for their
bodies are made then ſpiritual, not animal, as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Adam</hi>'s body was in this ſenſe animal, that it did need meat and drink, as alſo
it was for generation, to procreate and propagate a poſterity, which argued the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57719:80"/>
animality of <hi>Adams</hi> body, but not the mortality of it, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we mean ſuch an immortality as our bodies ſhall have in Heaven. Thus though
<hi>Adam</hi> was created immortal upon ſuppoſition of his obedience, yet that doth
not exclude wholly an animal life, or natural, as the Apoſtle expreſly ſaith,
1 <hi>Cor. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 46. That was not firſt which is ſpiritual, but that which is natural;</hi>
Thus it is alſo in reſpect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſpirituals and his ſoul, although all that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which was neceſſary to guide him to happineſs was natural, yet there were
other things that might be of meer grace, and ſuperadded favour to him; And
under this we may comprehend <hi>the grace of God,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> needed, though
qualified with original righteouſneſs to do that which is holy; as alſo the reward
which God would give to <hi>Adams</hi> obedience, for to be the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> in reſpect
of a gracious enjoyment of God, and to have received that life promiſed to him,
if he did obey (though here be great Diſputes about it, what it would have
been) yet it would not have been of merit, though of works, but of <hi>grace,</hi> for
works and that grace in that ſtate were <hi>conſiſtent,</hi> though Evangelical grace and
works do immediately <hi>oppoſe</hi> one another; <hi>Adam</hi> then was not without ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
ſavors.</p>

                        <p>IN the third place, that which will much tend to the magnifying of this Image
of God, is to conſider the <hi>Integrity and univerſality of it;</hi> ſo that he was made
holy and righteous all over, with light and wiſdom in his mind, with all kind of
holineſs in his will and affections; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> had both the perfection of parts,
and alſo of degree of grace within him: One ſingle habit was not ſufficient to
give perfection to all the active principles in a man, yea there were ſeveral habits
in every faculty of the ſoul; So that original righteouſneſs is an aggregation or
collection of many habits. That Text <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 7. when <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>made
right,</hi> inferreth ſo much; for he is not right, <hi>rectu,</hi> that doth want any eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
or neceſſary part, and the very expreſſion of the Image of God denoteth as
much; an Image conſiſting not in one, or ſome few parts, but in the harmonious
compoſition of all; How admirable was it then to have thoſe commands of God,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> and <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoul, with
all thy heart and ſtrength,</hi> fulfilled perfectly and without any difficulty? If we do
compare our ſinfull and carnal hearts with this glorious temper, that are carried
out to luſt inordinately all the day long, and love every thing before and above
God, What ſhame and confuſion may it bring to us? But in that ſtate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
there was no part of holineſs, or degree of holineſs wanting. It is true,
if we ſpeak of the Image of God <hi>repaired</hi> in us: We find a godly man doing
that now which <hi>Adam</hi> could not do, as to <hi>repent,</hi> and to <hi>believe</hi> in a juſtifying
manner in Chriſt; for the actings of theſe graces were <hi>incompatible</hi> with that
ſtate, and <hi>ſuppoſe an imperfection in the Subject,</hi> and therefore even now cannot
be ſo well called parts of the Image of God in a ſanctified man; and indeed
there is ſome difference between that <hi>Imago Creationis,</hi> and <hi>Imago Recreationis,</hi>
as <hi>Bannez</hi> expreſſeth it, or <hi>Imago conſtituta,</hi> and <hi>Imago reſtituta,</hi> the Image of
God in our Creation, and the Image of God in our Recreation or Renovation,
when we are made new creatures by the Spirit of God.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had not juſtifying faith in his glorious eſtate, it hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
that diſpute, <hi>Vpon what terms, or with what juſtice God can require of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man to believe in Chriſt, ſeeing he never gave the power to do this in Adam?</hi>
Therefore the <hi>Arminians</hi> plead from hence a neceſſity of a new univerſal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of grace, and this hath been an hot diſpute: The Orthodox, though they
eaſily grant, That <hi>Adam</hi> could not actually believe with juſtifying Faith, yet
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57719:81"/>
they ſay) this was potentially and habitually in him, he had a power and habit
for many things, the acts and exerciſes whereof were yet inconſiſtent with that
preſent eſtate of felicity he was created in; and certainly we may gather good
and ſound poſitions for this truth, out of ſome of the choiſeſt Schoolmen; They
have laid down good Rules, by which we may ſee, that the firmament was
not more filled with innumerable ſtarres, than <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul with all choiſe
graces.</p>

                        <head>SECT. IV.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>Thoſe graces</hi> (the Schoolmen call them <hi>virtues) which do not import
any imperfection, theſe were in</hi> Adam <hi>both habitually and actually, as to love
God, to be thankefull to God, to delight in God;</hi> For theſe graces will alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
even in Heaven it ſelf, and therefore were no wayes repugnant, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
required to <hi>Adam</hi> in that ſtate of felicity.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe graces which denote ſome kind of imperfection, which yet were
not repugnant to that ſtate he was created in, were alſo in</hi> Adam, <hi>both according to
the habit, and alſo the act, ſuch are faith and hope.</hi> By faith we do not mean, the
particular act of relying on Chriſt, as a Mediatour, but the general aſſenting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every thing as true, which God ſpake or promiſed unto him, and according to
this faith; ſo alſo <hi>Adam</hi> had hope depending upon God, and expecting ſuch
things as God had promiſed. Now theſe graces of faith and hope, even in the
general nature of them, have ſome imperfection, if compared with viſion and
fruition; Faith is oppoſed to viſion, and hope to fruition, as the Apoſtle plainly
argueth, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. Rom.</hi> 8. 24. But this imperfection did not repugn that ſtate
<hi>Adam</hi> was created in; For although we ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> was made right and perfect,
yet that is not to be underſtood abſolutely, as if he were as perfect as God, nor
comparatively in this ſenſe neither, as if he could not be made more perfect, or
as if he had ſuch perfection, as the glorified Saints in Heaven ſhall have, but he
was thus farre perfect, that he wanted nothing for that ſtate and condition God
made him in.</p>
                        <p>A third Rule is, <hi>Thoſe graces which import an imperfection repugnant to the ſtate</hi>
Adam <hi>was in; They were in him habitually, but not actually;</hi> They inſtance in
the virtues of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>repentance;</hi> Beſides others, we may alſo adde, the grace
of <hi>juſtifying Faith; So that although the Arminians judge ſuch a poſition as this
abſurd, yet almoſt the common current of Schoolmen go this way;</hi> And if the grace
of <hi>mercy,</hi> of <hi>liberality,</hi> of <hi>fortitude</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> were in <hi>Adam</hi> habitually, why
not of <hi>juſtifying Faith?</hi> Neither is it any Argument at all, to ſay, <hi>That theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
are given for their acts, but the acts are inconſiſtent with that ſtate he was made
in,</hi> for theſe habits were beſtowed by way of perfection and ornament to mans
nature in the general, and the want of the habits of them would have been an
imperfection: Even as <hi>Adam</hi>'s knowledge did extend to the medicinal virtue in
herbs and plants, which yet could not in that ſtate of integrity be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
So that thoſe habits, though not reducible into acts, yet were not in vain,
becauſe they were for the perfection of humane nature. When therefore <hi>Adam</hi>
after his fall did repent and believe in Chriſt, the ſeed of the woman promiſed;
He did not put forth thoſe acts from the habits of faith and repentance he was
created in, as ſome have ſaid; but the whole Image of God being loſt, every gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
habit or act, was then ſupernatural to him, which before was natural
Yet <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Diſputations concerning the Creation of man, ſaith,
<q>That even the habits of repentance and mercy were in the ſtate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
reducible into ſome acts, though not into all; as if I ſhould ſin, I
would abhorre it, and bewail it; if there were any miſerable, I would
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57719:81"/>
relieve him, which (ſaith he) are not meer conditional acts in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
but preſuppoſe a purpoſe in the will. Again (ſaith he) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
from thoſe habits had a complacency in his mind, and an approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch acts, when they could be performed by him in a ſutable ſtate;</q>
But I preſſe not theſe things.</p>
                        <p>Now although the habit of juſtifying Faith and Repentance were in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
yet we cannot ſay, They were in the Angels, or in Chriſt, becauſe
theſe were in a condition that did repugne the very habit of ſuch acts, as
well as the acts themſelves. Thus by theſe Rules we ſee, there is no kinde
of grace imaginable, but <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul was adorned with it one way or
other: Oh then take up bitter lamentation, and like <hi>Rachel</hi> refuſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
becauſe our loſs is unſpeakably greater than hers! There remaineth not
one grace of thoſe glorious ones mentioned, now in us: and in ſtead of a power
to any thing that was good, we have an utter impotency thereunto, and a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
unto evil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But you may ask,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object.</note> How can original ſix be ſaid to conſiſt in this privation

                        <p>To this the Anſwer is,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> That we are not to conceive of God taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this righteouſneſſe from us, as if one man ſhould ſpoil another of his
garments; but man by ſinning did exclude and ſhut it out from his ſoul;
and having thus provoked God, then God doth not continue and vouchſafe
that grace to him, which <hi>Adam</hi> had thus repelled; ſo that God is not as an
efficient, infuſing wickedneſſe into <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart, but he denieth that holineſſe
to him, which by ſinne was repelled; as if a man ſhould ſhut out the light from
him, and keep himſelf in the dark: But I have ſpoken more fully already to
this Objection.</p>

Original Righteouſneſſe is truly and properly a ſinne in
us. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the ſoul is a Subject fit and prepared for
to receive this Righteouſneſſe.</hi> This rectitude you heard, was
a moral perfection neceſſarily required in man: The ſoul of a
man cannot be in a neutral condition, it muſt either have holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or ſinne in it; As the air doth neceſſarily receive either light or darkneſs;
The body is either ſick or well; if then the ſoul be ſuch a fit and capable ſubject
of holineſs; when it is deprived of it, it wants that which is ſutable and connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to it: Inſomuch that for the ſoul to be without this holineſs, it's againſt the
nature of it; Why ſhould ſuch a ſpot and a blemiſh be in ſo glorious a creature?
How came ſpots in this Sunne? As Idolaters are condemned, becauſe <hi>they turned
the glory of God into the Image of a beaſt that eateth hay:</hi> No leſſe is done
by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apoſtaſie upon us all, for we who were made Gods Image, are
now become like beaſt without underſtanding, and yet this conſideration will not
debaſe and humble us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>This Privation is a ſinne, Becauſe it is againſt the Law of God
which requireth habitual holineſſe in us.</hi> It requireth the continuance in that
ſtate, which God created us in. This Definition of original ſinne, that it is
a Privation of that rectitude which ought to be in us, was firſt aſſigned by
<hi>Anſelme,</hi> and <hi>Occham</hi> thought it inſufficient, unleſſe there was added <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Deſcription, a Privation ariſing from the ſinne of another, <q>Becauſe (ſaith
he) <hi>Adam</hi> upon his ſinne loſt this Righteouſneſſe, which ought to be in
him, yet we cannot ſay, he had original ſinne, becauſe it did not ariſe from
a ſinne of another, but from his own tranſgreſſion.</q> This is a needleſſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
for it was original ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> yea and in <hi>Eve,</hi> though they did not
derive it from one another, becauſe they did actively communicate this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all their Poſterity. This Privation then of all glorious holineſſe being
againſt the Law of God, as we have formerly ſhewed, therefore it makes a man
truly ſinfull.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It is a ſinne, <hi>Becauſe</hi> Adam <hi>our Head and common Truſtes
once had this Righteouſneſſe;</hi> So that it is a Righteouſneſſe, which we were
once actually poſſeſſed of in our Head; God did not only ſay, <hi>Let us make man
after our Image,</hi> but he did put it into execution, he did make him after
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57719:82"/>
his image; So that it's a righteouſneſſe that we once had, which now we have
loſt.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It is a ſinne, <hi>Becauſe by</hi> Adam <hi>our Head we were deprived of it.</hi>
The Apoſtle ſaith poſitively, <hi>Rom. 5 That by one, ſinne came upon all, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as all have ſinned,</hi> viz. <hi>in him, and by him:</hi> Hence it is, That <hi>his</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

about it, that relateth to the privative part in original
corruption; for we have abbreviated that vaſt and large
Subject of original righteouſneſſe into a little compaſſe, briefly
informing concerning the Nature of it. For howſoever <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
(as <hi>Pererius</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> ſay) thought that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for any to determine, wherein the Image of God doth conſiſt; yet
<hi>Paul</hi> doth ſufficiently explain <hi>Moſes</hi> in this particular; So that we need not run
to thoſe forced expoſitions of ſome, who will have man in reſpect of his bodily
conſtitution to bear the Image of God. Therefore (ſome ſay) <q>God did aſſume
an humane ſhape, and in that did make man, whereby man in a bodily manner
was made after his Image. Others, That it was ſo ſaid, <hi>Let us make man after
our own Image,</hi> in reference to the Incarnation of Chriſt, who was in time to
be made man:</q> For we have already heard, that it was righteouſneſſe and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the ſoul, which made man to be after Gods Image; So that the Image of
God was not in the body, but as <hi>in ſigne,</hi> a ſign and demonſtration of that Image
in the ſoul. It is true, Chriſt is the Image of God, but as he is the ſecond Perſon
in the Trinity in reſpect of the Father, but that is adequately and eſſentially ſo,
we are not the image of God but in great imperfection, becauſe we do not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
participate of it. Chriſt in reſpect of the Divine Nature is the Image of God,
but never ſaid in Scripture to be made after it, for that would be an imperfection;
yet if we ſpeak of the humane nature of Chriſt, we may ſay, that it is created
after Gods Image, becauſe God filled it with holineſſe. Hence ſome (<hi>Durat. de

ſome of the Ancients have made it very dangerous to ſay, <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him
all mankind loſt the Image of God, yet that hath its truth no further, than if
we limit the Image of God to the eſſentials of mans ſoul, as endowed with intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and immortality; for it we take it in reſpect of gracious qualifications,
ſo it cannot be denied, but that <hi>Adam</hi> was not more naked bodily in his Creation,
than after his fall, his ſoul was made naked of all righteouſneſs, only <hi>Adam</hi> did
bluſh and was aſhamed after his ſinne at his nakedneſs, running from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
afraid; whereas at our ſoul-poverty and nakedneſs, we have no ſad and
grievous thoughts, thinking with our ſelves, How ſhall we come in our ſpiritual
nakedneſs unto the moſt great and holy God? That therefore we may be the more

                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>The loſſe of this righteouſneſs doth deprive us of the end for which God made
us:</hi> So that whereas before ſinne God looked on <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſaw he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good, after his fall he ſeeth him to be exceeding evil, and full of ſinne:
Let us inſtance in ſome choice ends for which God made man in his own Image thus
with righteouſneſs and holineſs. As</p>
                        <p>1. Therefore was he made thus holy, <hi>To have communion with, and enjoyment
of ſo holy a God.</hi> When God had made all the creatures, yet he ſaith, <hi>There was
not a meet help</hi> and comfort <hi>for him, one in his own Image and likeneſs;</hi> therefore
he makes a <hi>woman</hi> of the <hi>ſame nature with him;</hi> yet ſtill among all creatures, though
we adde Angels to them, there was not an adequate and ſufficient object to fill
his heart with delight, therefore God was his utmoſt end: So that although he
had Paradiſe, a place of delight to live in; Though his ſtate was not capable of
any miſery or fear from the creature, yet that which was <hi>Adam</hi>'s happineſs was
to enjoy God in theſe: Now who can bewail our loſs in this reſpect? We are now
propenſe to the contrary end of our Creation; we wholly deſcend downwards,
who were made to aſcend upwards; <hi>Adam</hi> found the favour of God in all the
creatures: It was not this or that comfort, but God in and by them that did
draw out his heart: But oh the miſery and captivity we are in to ſelf-love, to the
love of the creature! Neither are we able by nature to lift up the heart above
them to God in them, no more than the worm can flie like an Eagle towards
Heaven: Oh groan under this, and ſay, My heart was not once ſuch a lump of
earth, ſuch an heavy ſtone, as now I find it: There was not then any ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
heard; Lord, I can love Paradiſe, I can love my wife, but I cannot love
thee, but the clean contrary! I love them, becauſe I love thee, and I could not
love them, but becauſe I love thee! This Captivity and bondage our ſouls are in
to the creature, ſhould make us mourn more grievouſly than ever the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
did under the <hi>Egyptians</hi> oppreſſion: What a ſhame is it to have a body that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upward to Heaven, and a ſoul that looketh downward to earth? How doth
the conſtitution of thy body agree with the condition of thy ſoul? Thy face is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<q>Os homini ſublime dedit, Coelumque tueri.</q>
But thy ſoul, that is preſſed down in all its propenſions and affections to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57719:83"/>
and how contrary then are we to the end of our Creation, which is the
enjoying of God? <hi>Adam</hi> had that which <hi>Alexander</hi> ſo ambitiouſly deſired, <hi>viz.</hi>
the dominion over the whole world, and yet he had as great dominion alſo over
his own heart, ſo that God was all in all to him. If <hi>David,</hi> though of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> but regenerated, could ſay, <hi>Whom have I in haven
but thee, and there is none in earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> How much more could
<hi>Adam</hi> in that glorious ſtate of integrity?</p>
                        <p>2. Another end in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Creation after the <hi>Image of God, was to be is
the glory and praiſe of Gods Name:</hi> For as the Angels, who alſo were made after
Gods Image, their conſtant work was to praiſe and glorifie God: Thus <hi>Adam</hi>
being made like another Angel, was made full of holineſs, that upon the Earth, he
might, as the Angels do in Heaven, <hi>ſing holy, holy, holy unto the Lord:</hi> As ſome great
Kings of the Earth, when they have built ſome great City or Town, they cauſe
their Image or Picture to be ſet up in ſome eminent place, for the monument of
themſelves, who were ſuch great Benefactors: Thus God, when he had made
this great and glorious world, he puts man into it as his Image, that thereby his
praiſe and goodneſs ſhould be conſtantly declared; but ſince <hi>Adam</hi> his fall, all
mankind is now a reproach and diſhonour to God; Their thoughts, their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
their lives, are ſo many diſhonourable and reproachfull paſſages againſt
him; God doth not look upon us now as his workmanſhip, but as the devils; he
feeth not his Image, but the Devils in us: <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>that when God ſaw how
all men had corrupted themſelves, it repented him that be made man, and it grieved
him at his heart,</hi> Gen. 6. 6. What a wonderfull expreſſion is this? God cannot
repent or grieve at any thing properly, but the Scripture ſpeaketh thus after the
manner of men, to ſhew how exceedingly diſpleaſing and offenſive mans fall was,
that it had been better he had never been created, than prove ſuch an Apoſtate.
It is true, God knew how to work a greater good out of ſinne, than ſinne could
be an evil, but this no thank to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin and diſobedience; The good wrought
thereby cometh wholly from the gracious power of God; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne
of it ſelf, did diſanull the end of his Creation, and brought all things into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Take every man by nature, what a beaſt and devil is he, what an enemy to
God, what an adverſary to every thing of God; ſo that whereas he was made to
glorifie and honour God, all his whole work and life is now to diſhonour him,
and reproach his holy Name: Herein then lieth the miſery of this loſſe of the
Image of God, that we are fallen from our end, we are of our ſelves ſalt that
hath loſt its favourineſſe, we are fit for nothing but eternal torments.</p>

                        <p>IN the ſecond place. <hi>This loſſe is to be aggravated, becauſe of the Nature of it,
which is the deordination and diſſolution of all that Harmony and Subordination
which was in mans nature.</hi> That admirable and compoſed order which was in the
whole man, is now wholly broken; ſo that the mind and will is againſt God, and
the affections and paſſions againſt them. A three-fold Subordination there was
in man.</p>
                        <p>The firſt, <hi>of the intellectual and rational part unto God,</hi> The mind clearly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, and the will readily ſubmitting unto him.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond was, <hi>A regular Subordination of all the paſſions and affections unto
the mind,</hi> ſo that there did not from the ſenſible part ariſe any thing that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57719:84"/>
and contrary to the rational: Hence it was that the Scripture taketh
notice of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their privitive Condition, that though naked, yet
they were not aſhamed; There being a full purity and ſimplicity in their natures,
whereby nothing could ariſe to diſturb all thoſe ſuperiour operations. <hi>At ſin</hi>
expreſſeth it well; <q>Even (ſaith he) as Paradiſe the place wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was
created, had neither heat or cold, but an excellent temperament excluding the
hurtfull exceſs of either; ſo alſo the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> was without any exceſſive
paſſion, or inordinate motion, but all things did ſweetly and amicably concur
in obedience to the mind.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third and laſt Subordination was <hi>of the body, both to the rationall and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
principles;</hi> There was a preparedneſſe in the body of <hi>Adam,</hi> as there was in
Chriſt, whereby he did readily do the Will of God, and ſound the body not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
or weighing of it down. Now let us conſider this three-fold cord,
which did bind <hi>Adam</hi>'s whole man unto that which is good, which was eaſily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and then, as when the flood-gates are open, the ſtreams of water violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruſh forth, hurrying all away: Thus it is with mankind; This order being
diſſolved, the whole heart of man is as unruly as the Sea; and whereas that hath
its natural bounds, <hi>Hitherto it ſhall go, and no further;</hi> The heart of man is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and hath no ſtops of it ſelf, only the infinite God of Heaven he ruleth and
ordereth it as he pleaſeth. Conſider the firſt breach, and mourn under that: Is
it nothing to have the mind of man, which hath as many thoughts almoſt as there
are ſands upon the Sea ſhore, and yet not to have one of theſe riſe in the ſoul
with ſubordination to God? What a ſad bondage is this, that our thoughts are no
more under our command, than the flying birds in the air? Do not either ſinfull
thoughts, or if good, come in ſo unſeaſonably upon thee, that they carry away
thy ſoul priſoner? Oh this loſſe of the obedience of the mind to Gods Law, in
all the thoughts thereof, ought to be no mean matter of debaſement! Not to
find one good thought of all thoſe <hi>Iliades, Chiliades</hi> and <hi>Myriades</hi> of thoughts
which thou haſt, but to have rebellion in them againſt God: What ſad impreſſion
ſhould it make on thee? In the will alſo thoſe motion and incompleat velleities,
yea acts of conſent in the will, which ariſe in the ſoul, as ſo many ſwarms of flies
in the air, Are not theſe alſo ſo many armies of luſts againſt God, whereas in the
ſtate of integrity, there would not have riſen the leaſt diſtemper?</p>
                        <p>The ſecond breach, Is not that alſo as terrible and powerfull? For are not all
our affections and paſſions like ſo many dogs to <hi>Action,</hi> like ſo many Locuſts and
Caterpillers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> like ſo many flies and hornets, till by grace they are cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
What man is there, in whom if God ſhould let any one paſſion or affection
have dominion over him, that it would not immediately deſtroy him? So that the
power of original corruption is more manifeſted in the affections and paſſions,
than any ſubject elſe.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The diſorder which is in the body, in reſpect of its inſtrumental ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
unto God can never be enough lamented; Do not pains and diſeaſes in
the body much indiſpoſe in holy things? Do not dulneſſe, drouſineſſe and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
hinder a man, ſo that when he would religiouſly ſerve the Lord, this body
will not let him? Now all this evil and miſery is come upon us, becauſe we have
loſt the Image of God; As God in nature doth not ſuffer any <hi>vocuum</hi> or <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans,</hi>
ſo neither did he in reſpect of the frame of the ſoul at the firſt; There was
nothing defective, and nothing exceſſive.</p>

                        <p>1. <hi>It is a ſpiritual loſſe, principally and chiefly;</hi> The loſs of Gods favour, of all

that if you ſhould compare all the temporal loſſes that ever have been in the
world, with this firſt and ſpiritual one, it would be but as the mole-hill to an high
mountain: If then our eyes were opened, if we were able rightly to judge or loſſes,
for this we ſhould mourn more than for any evil that ever befell us or others;

this meſſage that we bring thee, But who will believe this report?</p>
                        <p>2. As it is a ſpiritual loſs, ſo it is an <hi>univerſal loſs.</hi> The whole world is in a
loſt ſtate, by loſing this Image of God; Every creature hath loſt in this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
loſſe; The earth hath loſt its fruitfulneſs, yea the whole Creation groaneth,
and is in bondage, ſubject to vanity, becauſe of this. Thus all the creatures they
loſe by it, yea every thing in man loſeth; The mind its light, the will its holineſs,
the affections their order, and the body its ſoundneſs and immortality; If all the
creatures were turned into tongues, they would proclaim the loſs of their primitive
glory, and beauty, becauſe of this ſinne.</p>
                        <p>3. It's not only univerſal, <hi>But it's the cauſe of all the temporal loſſes that we
have:</hi> For death (in which is comprehended all kind of evil) came in upon the
loſs of this Image; So that if we are ſenſible of any temporal loſs, How much
more of this ſpiritual one, which is the cauſe and root of all? Therefore is the
body pained, therefore it dieth, becauſe this Image of God is loſt, therefore do
we looſe parents and children, therefore is the whole world a valley of tears,
becauſe of this loſſe; If then any private loſſe be ſo bitter unto thee, how much
more ought this to be, which putteth a ſting into all?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>This loſs is incurable as to any humane or angelicall power.</hi> The image
of God is ſo loſt, as that by our own power we are never able to recover it
again: Inſomuch that when God doth repair it in us, it's a new Creation, and a
ſpiritual Reſurrection; we could not further it in the leaſt degree.</p>
                        <p>Let the Uſe then be, deeply to humble us, to break our hearts far this, and

                        </p>
                        <p>To the diſcovery of this Truth, we ſhall find this Text pitcht upon will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſubſervient; and herein we are to take notice, That it is part of that famous
Colloquy and Conference <hi>Chriſt</hi> had with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſeveral things in the general are briefly obſerable: As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Mercy that is to the Church in having this Diſcourſe upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
For by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his carnal cavillings, we ſee the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;
our Saviour is the more powerfull in his aſſeverations, <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c. that hereby every one may ſee, that though
he be great, rich, wiſe, learned, ingenious, yet <hi>he muſt be born again</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, We may take notice of our Saviours wiſdom, that pitcheth upon
this Subject rather than another to treat upon; for herein <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did groſly
erre, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had learning enough, knew the Law of God and the Scriptures,
but was wholly ignorant of Regeneration.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, We therefore ſee, That the work of Regeneration is a myſtery, even
to wiſe and learned men; Twice or thrice, ſaith that great Doctor, <hi>How can
this be?</hi> What poor and childiſh Objections doth he make againſt it, and all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this is a thing ſpiritually diſcerned?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The great cauſe why <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did not know what Regeneration was,
or ſee the neceſſary of it, was, <hi>Becauſe of his blindneſſe about original ſinne:</hi> Had
he believed how carnal and ſinfull every one was born, he would preſently have
bewailed his condition, and ſaid, O Lord, it is true, I am all over polluted, I
find nothing of thy Spirit in me, I am all over fleſh, and do therefore need thy
Spirit to regenerate and quicken me! But this was the root of his deſtruction,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57719:85"/>
from hence did ariſe that groſs miſcarriage about a <hi>new-birth,</hi> becauſe was ſo
ſenſleſs and unacquainted with the pollution he was born in.</p>
                        <p>So that the Text is an Argument to prove the Doctrine of Regeneration, and
the neceſſity of it, which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did ſo carnally cavil againſt: For although
our Saviour did ſo vehemently aſſert the truth of it in theſe expreſſions, twice
geminated, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay into thee,</hi> &amp;c. Yet becauſe <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſtill ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>How can this be?</hi> therefore our Saviour diſcovereth to him the root and
fundamental cauſe of the neceſſity of this birth, and that not of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> only,
but of every man; Therefore he ſpeaks generally, <hi>Vnleſſe a man be borne
again,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>The fundamental cauſe therefore of the neceſſity of Regeneration is from that
univerſal Propoſition laid down in the Text, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is
fleſh,</hi> which is alſo illuſtrated by the contrary, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit
is ſpirit;</hi> The ſtrength of the Argument lieth in this, Every thing reſembleth that
it is produced of; from a <hi>Serpent,</hi> there cometh a <hi>Serpent;</hi> from a <hi>Toad,</hi> a
<hi>Toad;</hi> ſo from a <hi>Dove,</hi> a <hi>Dove;</hi> a <hi>Sheep,</hi> a <hi>Lamb;</hi> There being therefore two
contrary effective principles in us, <hi>The fleſh and the Spirit;</hi> The <hi>fleſh,</hi> that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
what is fleſh, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> what is ſpirit.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Propoſition, we have the emphatical expreſſion of this defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>In the Vniverſality of the Subject of Predication, That which is born of the
fleſh is fleſh;</hi> There's none exempted, great men, noble men; Even Kings and
Emperors they are fleſh of fleſh.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>There is the Vniverſality of the Subject of Inheſion; All is fleſh,</hi> that
comes of fleſh; ſo that not only the body, but the ſoul alſo is fleſh in this ſenſe;
for by fleſh here, as in other places, is meant, <hi>The whole man conſiſting of ſoul
and body, as he is unclean and impure,</hi> and this appeareth by the oppoſition, which
is the Spirit of God, and the effects thereof.</p>
                        <p>Another emphatical expreſſion is, <hi>In uſing the abſtract for the concrete, is fleſh,</hi>
that is fleſhly, is ſpirit, that is, ſpiritual. We ſee then here a Propoſition affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
concerning all mankind born in a natural way, which no humane Philoſophy
could ever inform us in, yea to which it is wholly contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That we all by
nature both in ſoul and body are nothing but fleſh; for <hi>fleſh</hi> is here put for <hi>the
vicious and ſinfull quality that is in us,</hi> and ſo the mind, the intellictual and choiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
parts of the ſoul are thus condemned, as well as the more groſs and ſenſitive,
as in time is to be ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>This is a clear Text to prove our univerſal contagion by ſinne, yet upon what
weak and poor grounds would the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> oppoſe it; They therefore by
fleſh underſtand, <hi>Man ſimply as man, fleſh and blood, begotten in a fleſhly and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
manner, not as ſinfull and corrupted; as if our Saviours Argument had been,
as what is born of man is man, ſo what is born of the Spirit is ſpiritual:</hi> But this is
very unſound: For what Argument would this be to prove Regeneration? Muſt
a man be new born meerly becauſe he is a man? Certainly had <hi>Adam</hi> continued
in the ſtate of integrity, there would have been procreation of children, yet then
there would not have been a neceſſity of Regeneration: Our Saviour therefore
is giving a reaſon, why there muſt be a new birth, and that is from the ſinfull
pollution every one is born in: And whereas the reaſon they give, why by fleſh
cannot be meant, wholly ſinfull, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>then in the oppoſition, by
Spirit, would be meant wholly ſpirituall,</hi> whereas the Orthodox do acknowledge
a conflict with the Spirit, and the fleſh abiding in every regenerate man: But to
this the Anſwer is, That the abſtract is put for the concrete, ſpirit for ſpiritual,
ſo that the Subject in the Propoſition <hi>[Born of the Spirit]</hi> Spirit is the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God; and the Predicate <hi>[is made ſpirit]</hi> Spirit is to be underſtood of that
ſpiritual and heavenly nature wrought in us by him; And although he who is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57719:86"/>
made thus ſpiritual, is not purely and abſolutely ſo, yet the Spirit will in time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
and wholly conquer the fleſh, in which ſenſe <hi>Gal. 5. They that are Chriſts
are ſaid to have crucified the fleſh with the luſts thereof;</hi> Although there be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
and remainders of it ſtill in the moſt holy.</p>
                        <p>The Text then being thus vindicated, the Obſervation is,</p>
                        <p>That all men born in a natural way, are not only without the Image of God, but
thereby alſo are poſitively polluted, and made all over fleſh and ſinfull.</p>

is called by that name.</head>
                        <p>TO diſcover this, in the firſt place, It is good to take notice of the uſe of the
word <hi>[Fleſh]</hi> in Scripture; for the miſ-underſtanding or miſ-applying of
it, hath brought in a world of miſchief. The Papiſts by <hi>Fleſh</hi> (I mean ſome of
them) underſtanding only the <hi>bruitiſh and ſenſitive part,</hi> as if ſinne were onely
reſident there, and the <hi>rational part</hi> were free and pure; but this is a very great
errour; For beſides the general uſe of the word <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the Scripture, there is
<hi>two</hi> more pertinent to our purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>1. Fleſh <hi>is ſometimes taken for that which is weak and frail,</hi> Iſa. 31. Their horſes
are fleſh and not ſpirit. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. He remembred they were but fleſh. <hi>And</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. It is often taken for <hi>ſinfulneſs and corruption;</hi> Thus <hi>Gal. 5. The works of the
fleſh are oppoſite to the works of the Spirit;</hi> and men who are in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.
<hi>cannot pleaſe God.</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>Who having begun in the Spirit, will ye end in the fleſh?</hi>
To be in the fleſh and in the Spirit are made two oppoſite beings by the Apoſtle;
Inſomuch that we may make it a ſure Rule, <hi>That whereſoever fleſh is oppoſed to the
Spirit of God, or its ſpiritual operations, that then fleſh is uſed for that which is
evil and ſinfull;</hi> and thus it is in the Text. The true notion therefore of the
word <hi>Fleſh</hi> being retained, Let us conſider, <hi>Why original ſinne is thus called
Fleſh.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It is called ſo, <hi>Becauſe of its oppoſition to what is ſpiritual.</hi> Whatſoever
the Spirit of God revealeth to be believed, or commands to be obeyed, it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradicted by man, while abiding in the fleſh. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 8.
The wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity againſt God;</hi> You ſee here is not only a meer <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
of what is ſpiritual, but a <hi>poſitive enmity</hi> and frowardneſs againſt God,
and therefore we do not ſpeak enough to deſcribe the fulneſs of our natural evil,
when we ſay, that we came naked into the world without the Image of God, and
his Spirit; for original ſinne hath a contrariety in it againſt God, it puts a man
upon hatred of whatſoever is holy, therefore the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>Rom. 8. 5. It
is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be:</hi> Oh then that God would
make our hearts more of fleſh in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> tender, and
melting under conſiderations of how much fleſh is in both mind and heart in the
Apoſtles ſenſe! Would thy ſelf-righteouſneſs, thy ſelf-love, thy ſelf-fulneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
any longer, if thou didſt thus judge and believe concerning thy ſelf? Oh
what a noiſom carkaſs, what a loathſom monſter wouldſt thou be in thy own
eyes, if thou didſt conſider the poſitive frowardneſs and oppoſition which is in
thee to what is holy! And therefore even in the regenerate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. The <hi>Fleſh
is ſaid to luſt againſt the ſpirit;</hi> Search then into thy heart, and ſay, From whence
doth ariſe theſe gainſayings and oppoſitions which are in me, to what is holy:
Why ſhould not heavenly and ſpiritual things be as welcome, pleaſing and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to me, as ſinfull and wordly objects? Is not all this, becauſe thou art <hi>Fleſh?</hi>
                           <pb n="139" facs="tcp:57719:86"/>
Certainly, there is a thouſand times more reaſon for thee to imbrace ſpiritual
objects than earthly; They have more real, excellent and enduring good in them,
then all the pleaſures of ſinne if put together, but it is becauſe thou art <hi>fleſh,</hi>
that thy heart is naturally ſo full of enmity againſt whatſoever is ſpiritual; And
although this natural enmity be encreaſed in thee by voluntary wickedneſs, yet
that which cleaveth to thee, as ſoon as thou haſt a being is enough to make thee
refuſe the word of God, the Miniſtry inviting of thee, and to ſlight every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thou heareſt, or every affliction God layeth upon thee for thy ſinne, mourn
then under this enmity, this Law of ſinne that rebelleth againſt the Spirit of
God: This may ſenſibly and evidently teach thee, that thy natural corruption is
more than a meer want of the Image of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In that original corruption is called <hi>fleſh,</hi> is manifeſted, <hi>That even
the whole intellectual and ſublimer parts of a man are become ſinfull.</hi> We ſee our
Saviour ſaith, <hi>That which is born of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> nothing is excepted; ſo that
whereas ſome would have it the rational part; The mind and underſtanding not to
be comprehended under this fleſh; we ſay the contrary according to Scripture,
That in the ſoul and faculties thereof there is originally ſinne chiefly ſeated There
is the ſpring and fountain from whence iſſue all the ſtreams of ſinne into the lower
parts of the ſoul: Thus when the Apoſtle reckons up the works of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi>
5. 19, 20. There are <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> numbered with the reſt, which muſt
needs be <hi>ſins of the mind,</hi> How often doth the Scripture ſpeak of darkneſs, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
folly and blindneſs in the minds of all men by nature? <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. There
it's called a <hi>fleſhly mind;</hi> and certainly if the mind muſt be renewed, as the Scripture
ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Col. 3. Eph.</hi> 4. 23. it neceſſarily followeth, that it is fleſhly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Behold then, what a fountain of evil and miſery ſprings out from us in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
which may overwhelm us? For though the inferior parts of the ſoul had been
throughly infected with this Leproſie, yet if the ſuperiour and chief parts had not
been contaminated, there would have been hopes, that thoſe Sun-beams would have
diſpelled ſuch miſty clouds; but ſeeing that the eye is become dark, How great is
our darkneſs, and ſalt it ſelf having loſt its ſeaſoning, all muſt become loathſom and
unprofitable? Not only thy eyes, thy ears, not only thy affections and paſſions
of love, fear, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the lower region of thy ſoul; but thy <hi>will,</hi> thy
<hi>mind,</hi> thy <hi>conſcience,</hi> theſe alſo are become fleſh, and are wholly corrupted, ſo that
in thee by nature, <hi>there remaineth no good thing at all.</hi>

                        <head type="sub">How carnal the Soul is in its actings about Spiritual Objects.</head>
                        <p>3. IN that it is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> there is diſcovered that a man in all the workings of
his ſoul in religious things, is carnal and meerly carried out wholly by the
principle and inſtigation of fleſh within him, the Image of God was ſo glorious and
efficacious in <hi>Adam,</hi> that all his bodily and natural actions were thereby made ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
his fleſh was ſpirit (as I may ſo ſay) the body and bodily affections did
not move inordinately againſt Gods will, but having a divine and holy ſtamp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they were thereby made divine and ſpiritual: But ſince this original
corruption, the clean contrary is now to be ſeen in us; for even the ſpiritual
workings of the ſoul are thereby made carnal and fleſhly, <hi>Adam</hi>'s body was made
ſpiritual, and now our ſouls are made carnal: Oh the ſaid debaſing and vilifying
of us that is by this means! If an Angel ſhould become a worm, it is not ſo much
diſhonour as for righteous <hi>Adam</hi> to become an apoſtate ſinner.</p>

                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57719:87"/>
Let us take notice how our ſouls do put themſelves forth about ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and you ſhall find they are wholly carnal and fleſhly in ſuch approaches;
inſomuch that in their higheſt devotions, and religious duties they are onely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and fleſhly all the while. As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>In the myſteries of Religion, which are revealed unto in by a ſupernatural
light;</hi> The mind of man, becauſe it cannot comprehend of them in a carnal, or
bodily manner, much more if not by natural reaſon (though that be corrupt) <hi>is
ready to deſpiſe and reject all;</hi> What was the reaſon, that Chriſt crucified is ſuch a
fooliſh Doctrine to be believed by the learned <hi>Grecian,</hi> but becauſe it was not
agreeable to natural reaſon? When <hi>Peter</hi> made that Confeſſion concerning
Chriſt, <hi>That he was the Sonne of the living God;</hi> Chriſt tels him, <hi>Fleſh and blood
had not revealed that to him,</hi> Mat. 16. 17. And doth not this fleſhly mind ſtill
effectually move in Atheiſts and Heretiques? Is not this the bane of <hi>Socinan</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that they will make reaſon a judge of divine Myſteries, whereas that it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lt
is corrupt, and is it ſelf to be judged by the word of God? So that the power
of original ſinne, as it is fleſh, manifeſts it ſelf about all the ſupernatual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Truths revealed in the Goſpel. We that are Pigmies think to meaſure
theſe Pyramides, we think to receive the whole Ocean in our little ſhell: Hence
it is that <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 5, 6. will have all our <hi>imaginations, every high thought
brought into captivity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee, That whatſoever a man doth in reference to God, he is wholly
carnal and fleſhly in it, he is not carried out with a ſutable principle of the Spirit,
to that which is ſpiritual, and this may be diſcovered in many branches; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very uſefull and profitable; for hereby they ſhall ſee, that the onely things
which they relie upon, as religious worſhip of God, and the evidences of their
ſalvation, are ſo farre from being a true ſtay to them, that like thorns they will
pierce their hands: If a mans ſpirituals be carnals, How great are his carnals?
If his Religion, if his devotion, if the matters of his God, be thus altogether
flaſhly, What will his ſins and corruptions appear to be? We have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced
in one particular, <hi>viz. The Doctrine to be believed,</hi> and declared, how
carnal a man is in that. We proceed further to illuſtrate this neceſſary Truth, and
therefore.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Every natural man in his religious worſhip, is wholly carnal, as well
as in his Doctrine to be believed.</hi> For if we conſult the Scripture, and obſerve
what was the cauſe of all that <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual abomination,</hi> for which God
did ſo ſeverely puniſh the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was it not from a carnal fleſhly mind
within? Therefore you heard, <hi>Gal. 5. Idolatry is made a work of the fleſh,</hi> when
they <hi>changed the glory of God into the ſimilitude of an Ox, that eateth bay;</hi> Was
not this to pleaſe the <hi>eye?</hi> And ſo their goodly <hi>Altars,</hi> their goodly <hi>Images,</hi> which
the Prophet mentioneth, Were not all theſe, becauſe of their ſutableneſs to a
<hi>carnal mind?</hi> We need not inſtance in <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> who are wholly in
darkneſs, without any ſupernatural light; But if we take notice of the Chriſtian
Church in all the ſucceſſive Ages thereof, How potent and predominant have
carnal principles been in all their Devotions? <hi>And is not Popery to this day a full
demonſtration of this Truth?</hi> So that that notable expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.
4. 23, 24. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and truth; Yea, that the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him,</hi> hath ſeldom
had its due obſervation. Whereas then <hi>Campian</hi> would prove, All Monuments,
all Churches, all Windows and Pictures therein, to be a demonſtration of their
Religion. This proveth indeed the ſuperſtition and carnality of it, not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality
and truth of it; and oh the diſhonour done to God by this means! This
fleſhly wiſdom in Gods worſhip, hath been one chief cauſe of moſt of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which have fallen upon it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. The Apoſtle attributeth the <hi>worſhiping
of Angels</hi> to a fleſhly wiſdom in men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57719:87"/>
Thirdly, <hi>A man is naturaly carnal in religious Ordinances. Becauſe he is apt to
put truſt in them, to think he merits at Gods hands, or maketh ſatisfaction for his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>iſpaſſes.</hi> This is not to be ſpiritual, but carnal; We have <hi>low, carnal appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of God.</hi> when we think that by our righteouſneſſe, though it were ten
thouſand times more perfect than it is, that we are able to profit God therewith.
Thus thoſe falſe Teachers with their followers, they are ſaid to <hi>make a fair ſhew
in the fleſh,</hi> Gal 6. 12. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. to have <hi>confidence in the fleſh; To worſhip
God in the Spirit, and to have no confidence in the fleſh,</hi> are two oppoſite things;
Now by fleſh there is meant <hi>circumciſion,</hi> and all other Church-priviledges,
which <hi>Paul</hi> did eminently enjoy, and while a Phariſee, he wholly reſted in them,
but when once the ſonne of God was revealed to him, then he renounced <hi>all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi>
in theſe things, judging himſelf to be only carnal in them; But now little
was <hi>Paul,</hi> while a Phariſee, and ſo exactly diligent in the diſcharge of them,
perſwaded that all he did was rejected by God, that he abhorred all, that he was
only carnal in thoſe things? It is therefore of great conſquence to be ſpiritual in
the particular, for this is <hi>a ſecret ſweet poiſon,</hi> that is apt to undo us; Therefore
the Particular, the formal the devout man, who is ignorant of Regeneration,
while he abhorreth all bodily fleſh-ſinnes, he may be highly guilty of <hi>ſoul fleſh
ſinnes:</hi> So that there is little cauſe for a Phariſee to boaſt, ſaying, He was not a
prophane groſſe ſinner like a Publican, he did not wallow in bodily ſinnes of the
fleſh, for he was dangerouſly diſeaſed with ſoul ſinnes; The fleſh there made
him abominable in the eyes of God, for that which they did ſo highly exalt, it
was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> before God; What an heavy and ſad deceit will this prove, when
thou ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> find that wherein thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, and applaudeſt thy ſelf in, will
be thy condemnation, as Chriſt told the Phariſees, <hi>Moſes in whom ye truſt, he
will condemn you?</hi> Oh that this Truth might be like a ſword piercing into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of your heart! How wilt thou be overwhelmed, when that which thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
will ſave thee, that will damn thee? There is a carnal Religion, there is a
fleſhly devotion, in which men putting their confidence, may thereby be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
as well as by groſſe prophaneneſſe: Certainly this confidence in what
religious duties we perform (as ſome at the laſt day will plead, <hi>Have not we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied,
and wrought miracles in thy Name?</hi>) doth inſenſibly and incurably
damn the greateſt part of formal Chriſtians, and it is very hard to make them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern
or judge themſelves carnal in this, <hi>To truſt in the arm of fleſh,</hi> they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
quickly to be a ſinne, but to truſt, and reſt in the holy duties
they have performed, out of this ſinne no ſonnes of <hi>Boanerges</hi> can awaken
them.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, A man is naturally carnal in all his religious performances, <hi>Becauſe
when he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>h them, it is not out of any love to God, to exalt and honour him,
but out of love to himſelf, thinking thereby to avei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> ſome judgement or other.</hi>
It is true, we deny not but it's lawfull to ſerve God, to be humbled for ſinne with
reſpect to our own good, that we may eſcape temporal evil, but yet we are not
to do it <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> for this, we are not to <hi>uti Deo,</hi> and <hi>frui Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
to enjoy the creatures for themſelves, as the utmoſt end, and make uſe of
God only for our outward help, as <hi>John</hi> 6. 26. our Saviour told the multitude
that followed him, <hi>That they did ſeek him only becauſe they did eat of the loaves
and were ſiled:</hi> This is a fundamental principle of <hi>fleſh</hi> in every man by nature
not to love himſelf ſubordinately to God, but God ſubordinately to himſelf,
which is a ſinne of a very high nature, and immediately oppoſing the great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of God; They worſhip God upon no other reaſon, then what ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
did ſacrifice to the Devils, <hi>Tantùm ne noceant,</hi> That they might do them
no hurt: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> not then out of any love to God, or deſire to magnifie him, but
wholly for their own ends; and hence it is, that they alter, and change the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and wayes of God, as they pleaſe, and as it ſerveth for any political intereſt,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57719:88"/>
as you ſee in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and other wicked Kings, Whence is all this? but becauſe
they make themſelves, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, Et Deus non erit Dens niſi homini
placuerit;</hi>
How could men thus break the ſtatutes and ordinances of God? but
becauſe they make their own advantages, the ſupreme Law, as if God were for
them, and they not for him: Hence it is alſo that the Scripture complaineth ſo
much of men, <hi>Walking in their own Imaginations;</hi> And <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 King. 12. 33.
is branded for this, that he ſet up ſuch a worſhip and Miniſtry, that he had
deviſed of his own heart; This then is a ſure demonſtration of our <hi>fleſhly</hi> minds,
that in our worſhip and duties, we regard not divine Inſtitutions and Gods
Rule, but attend only to what is ſubſervient to our purpoſe: Now the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all this is, becauſe we do not look upon God as ſupreme, to whom all
our ſenſes ſhould bow, but referre him and his glory to our ſelves. The Apoſtle
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. ſpeaketh of <hi>knowing Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi> and ſo there is alſo a
knowing of God after the fleſh, which is, when we doe not things pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſincerely out of reſpect to his Name, but for our own profit
and benefit: Take heed then of this fleſhly frame in thy approaches to
God.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The fleſhly mind of a man is ſeen in his ſpiritual tranſactions between
God and himſelf, <hi>In that he doth wholly conceive and imagine ſuch a God, and
Chriſt, not as the Scripture repreſents, but as he would have, and doth moſt
ſuit with his carnal diſpoſition.</hi> This is greatly to be obſerved, for becauſe of
this, though they hear never ſo much of God and Chriſt, yet becauſe they think
them to be ſuch, as they would have a God of their own making, a Chriſt of
their own making, therefore they never truly repent, or turn unto God; for
concerning God, they conceive him as altogether mercifull; They never think he
is a juſt and holy God; They attend not to the ſury and vengeance which the
Scripture ſaith is in him againſt obſtinate and impenitent ſinners, but apprehend
him to be one that loveth them, and will ſave them, though they go on in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
wayes againſt him; The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth notably ſpeak to this purpoſe,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. where having ſpoken of ſuch hypocrites, that will come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God, though they retain their old luſts, and live in all impurity, he addeth,
<hi>Thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf;</hi> They thought God was
not provoked with ſuch abominations, they thought God would not be angry
with them, as if he were like themſelves: And doth not this ſtill continue true in
moſt prophane men? Why is it that they do not tremble under the name and
thoughts of God? Why is it that they roar not out with fear, leſt God ſhould damn
them? Is it not becauſe they make a God like themſelves? They love themſelves, and
acquit themſelves, they eaſily think well of themſelvs, and therefore they think God
will do ſo alſo, and thus they do likewiſe with Chriſt; They repreſent him to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and a Saviour only; They conſider not <hi>that he died to conquer the Devil, to
make us a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</hi> They attend not to the <hi>purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

as well as from the guilt and damnation by it, which being ſo, they can truſt
in Chriſt, and put their whole hope in Chriſt, although they live in all diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at the ſame time, and therefore whereas we might wonder, how prophane
men can live as they do? Where are their thoughts of God and Chriſt? Why
are they not ſtricken with aſtoniſhment, when they hear of them? Alas, you may
ceaſe to wonder, for the <hi>Scripture God,</hi> the <hi>Scripture-Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
they do not think of,</hi> but a God and a Chriſt, which is <hi>a meer Idol in their own
hearts ſet up by themſelves.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>The fleſhly mind of a man is ſeen in running into extreams, and ſo never
ſubmitting themſelves to Gods word, which is alwayes the ſame:</hi> So that whereas
in ſome the fleſhly mind of man runneth out into ſuperſtitious and exceſſive
wayes of devotion, which God never required ſo in others again it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57719:88"/>
acteth the clean contrary way pretending to Enthuſiaſts, Revelations, and ſtrange
raptures and impulſes of ſoul, and herein they think they are the only ſpiritual
men, and that all others are in the fleſh, but ſtrong deluſions under the pretence
of Revelations, Apparitions and viſions have been no new thing in the Church
of God; neither are we to ſtagger in our ſaith, becauſe of theſe things; for <hi>the
fleſh excited by the Devil, may vent it ſelf in theſe extaſies and raptures, as well as
in ſuperſtitions;</hi> yea which is further to be obſerved, a man may be altogether
<hi>fleſhly,</hi> while he pretends to an high ſpiritual way of ſubduing and keeping down
the fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. Thoſe who were <hi>puft up</hi> in their <hi>fleſhly minds</hi> about Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,
yet are ſaid to have a <hi>ſhew of humility in not ſparing the body,</hi> and this
we may ſay to thoſe deluded Papiſts, who macerate and excruciate the fleſh of the
body, it would be better, if they did caſt out at the ſame time, their fleſhly
mind.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, A natural man in his moſt religious deportment, is only fleſhly,
<hi>Becauſe whatſoever he doth in theſe things, he is furthered only by natural ſtrength:</hi>
For being without the grace of God, either in his underſtanding, or his will, hence
it is that he can riſe no higher, than natural <hi>reaſon,</hi> natural <hi>conſcience,</hi> and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>will,</hi> doth enable him unto; and theſe being altogether polluted by ſinne, in
ſtead of furthering, they are an hindrance and oppoſition to him: If therefore
you ask, <hi>From what principles, and by what ſtrength doth a natural man draw nigh
to God?</hi> The anſwer is only by that power which he hath of himſelf; The grace
of God which alone can elevate the ſoul to God, that he is wholly deſtitute of:
And although it muſt be granted that there are ſome common principles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
in all about God, and moral good things, yet theſe are never improved
any otherwiſe, but from carnal principles, and to carnal ends. And thus much
may ſuffice for this branch, <hi>viz.</hi> The carnality of a man, by original ſinne in his
moſt religious offices and duties.</p>
                        <p>In the laſt general place, Man may juſtly be ſaid to be all over ſinfull and fleſh
only, <hi>Becauſe all his care, his thoughts are only for his body and ſenſible things, in
the mean while neglecting God, and his immortal ſoul.</hi> I ſhall conclude with this,
becauſe all elſe comprehended in this name, will come in at ſome other ſeaſonable
time. By nature we are <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> we <hi>walk after it, we make proviſion for it;</hi> ſo
that we willingly loſe God and our ſouls, to ſave and preſerve that; Who is
there that will believe our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>What will it profit a man to winne the
whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Mat. 16. 26. What complaints and accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may the ſoul make againſt us, when the body hath ſaid, Feed me, Cloath me,
you have done it? But when the ſoul hath famiſhed, and been periſhing, you
have not heard the cries of it: Oh men only fleſh and utterly devoid of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

in the word <hi>[Fleſh]</hi> attributed to every one that is in a
natural way born of mankind. We now proceed to that Truth,
for which it was deſignedly pitcht upon, <hi>viz. That Original ſin
is not only a Privation of Gods Image, but doth cannote alſo a Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
inclination, and an impetuous propenſity to every thing that is
evil.</hi> For this Queſtion is agitated between ſome Papiſts, and the Proteſtants;
They aſſerting, <q>That the whole nature of original ſinne lieth in the privation
of Gods Image:</q> But the Orthodox, they ſay, <q>That although original ſinne is
privative, yet it is not meerly privative, but doth include in it, as the <hi>materiale,</hi>
that habitual crookedneſs and perverſnes, which is in all the faculties of the ſoul;</q>
And thus the Proteſtants do almoſt in effect ſay the ſame with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who
calleth original corruption a <hi>corrupt habit,</hi> not a meer privation, for privations
are of two ſorts, either <hi>ſimple,</hi> that imply onely a privation, as blindneſſe and
death, or <hi>compounded</hi> and <hi>mixed,</hi> which beſides the meer privation, do denote
ſome <hi>materiale</hi> or <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> with it. Thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> compareth original ſinne
to a ſickneſs or diſeaſe, which doth not only ſignifie a privation of health, but
alſo the humours exceſſively overflowing, and thereby diſſolving the due tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
of the body: Such a privation is original ſinne, a mixt, or compounded
privation, that beſides the abſence of what righteouſneſs is due, denoteth alſo a
propenſity and violent inclination unto that which is evil. It is true indeed, if we
come punctually to examine, how the will is diſobedient, and how the affections
are ſo diſorderly, we cannot reſolve into any thing, but this privation, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
is therefore darkneſs and erroneous, becauſe without its primitive
light; The will is crooked and perverſe, becauſe without its primitive rectitude:
So that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith well, <hi>He that cals it the privation of Gods Image, ſaith the
whole nature of it, yet when we ſpeak of the privative part of it only, we do not ſo
fully and ſignificantly expreſſe the dreadfull pollution of it:</hi> Even as concerning vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
habits in morality, intemperance, injuſtice, it is not enough to ſay, they
are the privation of thoſe virtues, which are immediately contrary to them, but
they do denote alſo ſuch an inclination in a man, that thereby he is carried out to
thoſe vicious of ſuch habits conſtantly, and with delight.</p>

                        <p>THe Reaſon, why our Divines make original ſinne to have its <hi>Poſitive</hi> as
well as <hi>Privative part,</hi> is to obviate that errour of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
original righteouſneſs to be only by way of a bridle in <hi>Adam</hi> to curb
and ſubjugate the inferiour part to the ſuperiour of the ſoul, when <hi>Adam</hi> loſt this,
they conceive mankind, hath not any further pollution upon it, but that meer
loſſe; Inſomuch that they ſay, <q>Man is now as if God had created him in his
pure naturals without any ſupernaturals.</q> The <hi>Socinians</hi> likewiſe, they deny any
ſuch pollution, and make us to be born in the ſame condition <hi>Adam</hi> was created

                        <p>NOw that we are to judge of it thus, will appear from Scripture, upon theſe
grounds:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The names that the Scripture attributeth to it, compell us to think of it, as
more than a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>er bare ſimple privation,</hi> for in the Text it is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> in other
places <hi>Luſt,</hi> the <hi>Old man,</hi> the <hi>Body of ſinne,</hi> which emphatical expreſſions are
for this end to make us conceive of the deep and moſt real pollution it bringeth
upon us: Inſomuch that we are not to extenuate and diminiſh the nature of it,
but as the ſcope of the Scripture is to aggravate it under the moſt <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> and
powerfull names that are, ſo we alſo are accordingly to judge of it. It is true,
<hi>Illyricus</hi> out of a vehement oppoſition to <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Synergiſts,</hi> did wring the
Scripture till bloud came out of it in ſtead of milk; for he would underſtand
theſe places mentioned about original ſinne almoſt literally, as if ſinne were our
very ſubſtance and eſſence, whereas if he had gone no further, then to ſay,
that the Scripture by theſe names doth intend not onely the meer privation
of good by this original pollution, but alſo a poſitive proneneſe, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
activity unto all evil, than he had hit the mark. The Scripture Names then
are only conſiderable,
for the holy Ghoſt doth not uſe them in vain, but thereby
would ſtartle and amaze us, that we may conſider that we are without, and what
evil doth abide in us.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>This is proved from Scripture-affirmation, about the ſtate of all
men.</hi> It doth not onely deſcribe man <hi>privatively,</hi> that he is <hi>without God,
without Chriſt,</hi> but alſo <hi>peſitively,</hi> that he is <hi>an enemy to God,</hi> and <hi>cannot be
ſubject to him,</hi> Rom. 3, 10, 11. to the 18. <hi>verſe.</hi> The holy Apoſtle applying
ſeveral paſſages out of the old Scripture to all men by nature, inſtanceth
both in <hi>privatives</hi> and <hi>poſitives</hi> alſo; <hi>Privatives, There is none that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth,
there is none that ſeeketh God, there is none that doth good, there is
no fear of God before their eyes:</hi> But is this all? No, he addeth, <hi>Their throat
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57719:90"/>
is an open Sepulchre, the poiſon of Aſpes is under their lips, their feet are ſwift
to ſhed bloud,</hi> &amp;c. Here you ſee, the nature of every man is abominable, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and ready to commit the fouleſt ſinnes, if he be not ſtopt; yea the
Scripture is <hi>more oftener</hi> expreſſing this <hi>Poſitive</hi> part of original ſinne then
the <hi>Privative,</hi> Geneſ. 5. Geneſ. 8. 21. <hi>The imagination of a mans heart is
ſaid to be onely evil, and that from his youth. Eliphaz</hi> alſo in <hi>Job</hi> 15. ſaith,
<hi>How abominable is man who, drinketh down iniquity like water?</hi> Thus you
ſee the Scripture repreſents us in a farre more loathſome vile and poiſonous
nature than we are apt to believe concerning our ſelves. When <hi>Auſtine</hi>
maintained this Doctrine, <hi>Pelagius</hi> would ſay, This was to accuſe mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(<hi>Lib. 1. de Naturâ &amp; Gratiâ.</hi>) But this is indeed the onely way to
ſet up the grace of Chriſt our Phyſician, for the <hi>whole need not a Phyſicias,</hi>
                           <q>Neither (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) are we ſo to exalt God a Creator, as to make a
Saviour wholly ſuperfluous.</q> It is true therefore, which the ſame Author
ſaith, <q>That when we have to do with ſuch who deny the neceſſity of grace
by Chriſt, making free will of it ſelf, ſufficient to what is holy, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they deny any ſuch thing as original ſinne, we are not ſo much
(ſaith he) to deal in Diſputations with them, as prayers for them, that
their eyes might be opened to know themſelves, and that the ſtony
heart may be taken from them, for if once they had the ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, they would quickly confeſſe both original ſinne, and Chriſts
grace.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Original ſinne is poſitive, Becauſe the Scripture attributes poſitive
and efficatious actions to it, which meer and bare privations are not capable of.</hi>
The ſeventh Chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaketh fully to this, what expreſſions,
and that in alluſion to military affairs, doth the Apoſtle uſe concerning this ſinne
<hi>inhabiting in him?</hi> For <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. he complaineth of this <hi>Law of ſinne,</hi> that it
doth <hi>warre againſt him, and bring him into captivity,</hi> which phraſes denote,
That this original ſinne is not a ſluggiſh, idle privation, but withall it connoteth
an impetuous repugnancy to any thing that is holy; This alſo the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. where the <hi>fleſh is ſaid to luſt againſt the Spirit,</hi> ſhall we think
then, that the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of this activity and working of ſinne in
us, that we ſhould apprehend no more than the abſence of Gods Image
within us. Let us then aggravate the hainnouſneſſe of it, as we ſee the Scripture
doth, and deeply humble our ſelves under it: Shall it be a ſmall thing to have
ſuch an impetuous active principle in us againſt what is holy? That which
we ſhould imbrace and cloſe with as the moſt excellent, that we flie from,
and are moſt averſe to, as if it were the greateſt evil, and would be to our utter
undoing.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>If vicious habits that are acquired by cuſtomary practice of evil.
are not meer and ſimple privations, but do alſo include in them a propenſity
to evil, then it followeth, that original ſinne likewiſe is not a meer privation;</hi>
For we are to conceive of original ſinne, as an innate and imbred habit,
as the other are acquired: Now it's plain, That all vicious moral habits,
they are not a meer negation, or abſence of ſuch virtues, but do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
and diſpoſe the ſubject to vicious actions, eaſily and with delight;
So that we muſt needs attribute as much <hi>Poſtiveneſſe,</hi> if not more to <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne,</hi> then to <hi>vicious acquired habits;</hi> And the truth is, This is a
cloſer Leproſie infecting of us, then ſuch habits, for this we have as ſoon
as we are born, this is twiſted within our bowels; this can never be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhaken off, whereas accuſtomed ſinnes, they are perfectly overcome by
the work of Regeneration. For this is the difference between acquired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of ſinne, and original corruption: In Regeneration, ſeeing the Image
of God is put into us, which is the ſubſtance of all holy habits, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57719:90"/>
habits are preſently excluded, and the ſinnes the godly afterwords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
are not from their former habits of ſinne, but from the reliques of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
corruption, whatſoever the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſay to the contrary; But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
doth not totally exclude original ſinne, onely diminiſheth the
ſtrength of it: So that this original corruption will abide in ſome meaſure
in us, even while we carry this mortal body about with us: And if the
Prophet made it ſuch an impoſſible thing for men habituated in ſinne to be
converted, as when he ſaith, <hi>If a Leopard can change his skinne, then
may you learne to doe well, who are accuſtomed to doe evil,</hi> Jerem. 13. 23.
What then ſhall he ſaid of us who are borne in evil? Cuſtomary ſinnes
are but the Leopards skinne, original ſinne is like the Leopards na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>This poſitive inclination doth neceſſarily follow from the privation
of this Image of God; if the due ſummetry and excellent Harmony which was
at firſt in the ſoul be taken away, then all the faculties and powers of the
ſoul muſt neceſſarily move ſinfully and inordinately.</hi> The ſoul of a man is
alwayes working one way or other, if then it hath loſt original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it cannot but be hurried on to what is evil; as if you take away the
pillar on which a ſtone liethh, preſently that will fall to the ground; If you
ſpoil the ſtrings of muſical inſtruments, immediately they make a jarre and
ingratefull noiſe upon every moving of them: The ſoul of a man is a ſubject
immediately <hi>ſuſceptible of righteouſneſſe or corruption,</hi> and if it loſe its righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
then by natural neceſſity corruption cometh in the room of it,
and ſo when the underſtanding acts, it acteth ſinfully, when the will mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
it moveth ſinfully; So that we may well ſay with <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the
<hi>Pelagian,</hi> demanding, How this corruption could come into us, for God
was good, and nature good, <hi>Quid quaeris latentem rimum, cum habes aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
jannam?</hi> Not a cranny, but a gate or door is open for this corruption to
ſeize upon us.</p>

                        <p>BEfore we come to anſwer the Objections, Let us affect our hearts with
it, and labour to be humbled under the conſideration of this poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and efficacy of it.</p>
                        <p>For firſt, Hereby we ſee, that if it be not reſtrained and ſtopped by
God, we know not where we ſhould ſtay in any ſinne; What <hi>Cain</hi>'s,
what <hi>Judas</hi>'s would we not prove? Who can ſay, Hitherto I will goe
in ſinne, and no further, for there is a fountain within thee, that would
quickly overflow all? This active root of bitterneſſe, this four leaven
within thee, would quickly make thy life, like <hi>Job</hi>'s body, full of ulcers
and noiſome ſores: If thou art not plunged in the ſame mire and filth,
as others are, doe not ſay, Thou haſt leſſe of this corruption than they;
Thou art borne more innocent than they, onely God ſtops thee, as he did
<hi>Balaam</hi> from doing ſuch wickedneſſe, as thy heart is forward enough
unto; No Serpent is fuller of poyſon, no Toad of venome, than thou art
of ſinne, which thou wouldſt be conſtantly committing, were not ſome ſtop
put in the way.</p>

                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57719:91"/>
Secondly, In that ſinne is thus poſitive and inclining thee, thou art the
more to admire the grace of God, if that work a contrary inclination and
propenſity in thee; If thou art brought with <hi>Paul, To delight in the Law
of God in the inward man;</hi> If thy heart <hi>pants after God, as the Hart after
the waters,</hi> which once delighted in ſinne, which once longed after nothing,
but the ſatisfying of the fleſh: Oh admire this gracious, miraculous work
of God upon thy ſoul, who hath made thee to differ thus from thy ſelfe!
The time was once, when thou rejoycedſt in thoſe ſinnes, that are now
matter of ſhame and trembling to thee. The time was when thy heart was
affected with no other good than that of the creature; Thou didſt know
no other, deſire no other but that, but now God hath made iron to
ſwimme, he hath made the Blackmoor white: Oh bleſſe God for the
leaſt deſires and affections, which thou haſt at any time for that which
is good, for this cometh not from thee; it is put into thee by the grace of
God.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Conſider that this poſitiveneſſe of ſinne in thee, doth not onely
manifeſt it ſelf in an impetuous inclination to all evil, but alſo a violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of whatſoever is good: The Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) calleth it, <hi>Enmity
againſt God;</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he complaineth of it, as <hi>warring and fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law of his minde;</hi> And certainly this is a very great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not onely to be without what is good, but to be a deſperate enemy,
and a violent oppoſer of it, both in others, as alſo to that which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God by the Word would worke in our own hearts, not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the remedy, but full of enmity againſt it; Doth not this make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
unſpeakably wretched? Certainly, this is the higheſt aggravation in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, that we are not onely unable to what is good, but we are with anger
and rage carried out againſt it, as if good were the onely evil, and ſweetneſſe
the onely bitterneſſe.</p>

yet <hi>We do not make it to be like ſome infecting corporeal quality
in the body, that hereby ſhould vitiate the ſoul, and as it were
poiſon that. Lombard</hi> and ſome others, eſpecially <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis
(Diſtinct.</hi> 30.) They ſeem to deliver their opinion ſo, as rejecting <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm</hi>'s
definition of original ſinne, making it to be want of that original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
which ought to be in us, and do declare it to be a <hi>morbida qualitas,</hi>
ſome kinde of peſtilential and infecting quality abiding in the body, and thereby
affecting the ſoul; As when the body is in ſome phrenetical and mad diſtempers,
the ſoul is thereby diſturbed in all its operations; ſo that theſe make the want of
original righteouſneſs <hi>to be the effect of original ſinne,</hi> not the nature of it, ſaying
upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, Man becoming thus defiled, God refuſed to continue this
righteouſneſs to him any longer. But if theſe Schoolmen be further queſtioned,
<hi>How ſuch a diſeaſed peſtilential quality ſhould be in the body?</hi> Some ſay, it
was from the forbidden fruit that that had ſuch a noxious effect with it; but that
is rejected, becauſe that was made of God, and all was exceeding good: <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therefore following as he thinketh <hi>Auſtin,</hi> maketh this venemous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in a mans body to have its original, from the hiſſing and breath, as it were of
the Serpent; he conceiveth, that by their diſcourſe with the Serpent, there came
from it ſuch an infectious air, as might contaminate the whole body, and he
ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, who from the very hiſſing and air from Serpents
have been poiſoned.</p>
                        <p>But the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> they do not hold it any poſitive quality in this ſenſe; for
this is to make the <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>chiefeſt ſubject of original ſinne,</hi> and ſo to
convey it to the ſoul, whereas indeed the <hi>ſoul</hi> is primarily and principally the
ſeat of original ſinne; We therefore reject this, as coming too near <hi>Manicheiſm,</hi>
as if there were ſome evil and infectious qualities in the very nature and ſubſtance
of a man.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It muſt be remembred, what hath been ſaid before, <hi>That when we
come to give a particular reaſon why the underſtanding or will are propenſe to any
evil;</hi> We can aſſign only <hi>a privative cauſe,</hi> viz. Becauſe it wants that rectitude
which would regulate it; as if a ſhip (it's <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s compariſon) were without
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57719:92"/>
Pilot and Governour of tacklings let looſe into the whole Ocean, it would be
violently hurried up and down till it be deſtroyed. Thus man without this Image
of God would be toſſed up and down by every luſt, never reſting till he had hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himſelf into hell; yet though we cannot give any more than a <hi>privative cauſe,
there is alſo a poſitive propenſity to all evil connoted:</hi> As in a wicked action of
murder or drunkenneſs, if you go to give a reaſon, why ſuch actions are ſinnes;
we muſt ſay from the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> that is in them, that want of order which the Law
requireth; There is a privation of that rectitude the Law commands, yet thoſe
ſinnes do imply alſo the <hi>material</hi> and <hi>ſubſtrate</hi> acts, as well as the <hi>obliquity:</hi> In
every ſinne of commiſſion, there is that which is <hi>poſitive</hi> as well as <hi>privative;</hi>
Though the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of the ſinne be a <hi>privation;</hi> and thus it is in original
ſinne, the whole nature of it comprehends both <hi>a want of Gods Image, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
inclination to all impiety.</hi> Though the <hi>privative</hi> be the cauſe of the <hi>poſitive</hi>
Indeed <hi>Rolloc (De vocatione cap. 25. de peccat. orig.</hi>) maketh a three-fold mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and a three-fold form in original ſinne: The three-fold matter he aſſigneth
to be a defection from God, a want of original righteouſneſs, and a poſitive
quality, which ſucceedeth in the room of holineſſe: To which three-fold matter
he attributeth a three fold form or <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, in which the nature of ſinne conſiſts.
Now theſe material parts of original ſinne, are ſo many entities, being good in
themſelves, and coming from God the Author of nature, but how Apoſtaſie and
want of original righteouſneſs can be poſitive entities, and good of themſelves,
I cannot underſtand, or how <hi>carentia juſtitiae originalis,</hi> ſhould have the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>
                           <hi>THeſe two things thus premiſed, the plain and obvious Objection is,</hi> That if
original ſinne be poſitive, then it's good, and ſo of God, becauſe <hi>omne ens eſt
bonum,</hi> every being is good, and then as <hi>Auſtin, Omne bonum eſt vel Deus, vel
à Deo,</hi> all good is either God himſelf, or of God Would it not then be blaſphemy to
make God the Authour of it, and if it have a poſitive being, then certainly it muſt
come from God the Author of all being?</p>
                        <p>But to this ſeveral Anſwers may be returned:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That though original ſinne ſhould be granted to be poſitive, yet for
all that God would not be made the <hi>Author</hi> of ſinne, <hi>Becauſe as it's ſinne, it
doth ariſe from man.</hi> There are ſome great Schoolmen, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> and others,
that hold ſinnes of commiſſion have a poſitive real being, as ſinnes; They deny
that the nature of ſuch ſinnes lieth formally in a <hi>privation.</hi> but in a <hi>poſitive rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
contrariety</hi> to the Law of God; and when urged with this Argument, <hi>That
then ſuch ſinnes have their being immediately from God, as all other created
beings have:</hi> They will anſwer, That God is indeed the <hi>efficient</hi> of every being,
but not of every <hi>modus,</hi> or <hi>relative reſpect</hi> of that being: As for example, when
a man <hi>eateth</hi> and <hi>drinketh,</hi> this eating and drinking they are <hi>from God,</hi> but then
take them under this <hi>relative</hi> reſpect, as they are <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> actions of
<hi>man,</hi> ſo they cannot be attributed to God, for then we might ſay, God doth eat
and drink, yea in thoſe gracious acts when we do believe and repent, God is the
efficient cauſe of them, yet as they do formally and vitally flow from us, ſo they are
not to be attributed to God, for God doth not repent or believe. Thus it may be
ſaid, That though God be efficiently the cauſe of all poſitive being, yet as ſome
being hath a relative reſpect to the ſecond cauſe working, ſo it cannot be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God, neither is this any imperfection, but a perfection in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>Deus non poteſt ſupplers vicem materialis, aut formalis cauſae:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57719:92"/>
ſaith <hi>Curiel</hi> a poſitive Doctor for the poſitive nature of ſinnes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
(<hi>Lectur. 6. in Thom. pag.</hi> 300.) <q>That it may be granted, the will
is <hi>prima moralis cauſa peccati,</hi> as we may ſay a man is the firſt cauſe of ſight,
<hi>per modum videntis,</hi> becauſe he is not ſubordinate to any other cauſe, which
doth produce this ſight, <hi>viz.</hi> formally, a ſight; and (ſaith he) the like is
in all other vital actions.</q> But I need not run into this thorny thicket to hide my
ſelf from the force of this Objection.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There are ſome learned Proteſtants, that do diſtinguiſh of <hi>ens,</hi> or
<hi>being;</hi> That <hi>ens</hi> is either <hi>created,</hi> as the works of the ſix dayes, or <hi>generated,</hi> as
mankind, and the <hi>animate creatures,</hi> or made as <hi>artificial things,</hi> or prepared,
as Heaven and Hell, or introduced, as ſinne; for it's ſaid of ſinne, that it's
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; So that upon this diſtinction they will
ſay, That God is the cauſe of all made, and <hi>created beings,</hi> but not of <hi>introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
beings,</hi> ſuch as ſinne is, becauſe that came in by Satans temptation, and mans
diſobedience. But this diſtinction hath ſcarce ſo much as a ſandy foundation; for
though it be an introduced being, yet becauſe a being, it is a creature, and ſo
muſt come from God the chief being, according to that of the Evangeliſt,
<hi>John 1. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing
made that was made:</hi> For that which is <hi>ens</hi> only by participation, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to that which is <hi>ens per essentiam.</hi> Therefore</p>
                        <p>In the third place, We muſt ſpeak of original ſinne, as we do of vicious habits,
and of actual ſinnes; <hi>The material and ſubſtrate of them, being a good of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is of God, but the vitioſity and obliquity that is of man,</hi> when a man mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his tongue to curſe and ſwear, or his hand to murder another: As they are
actions they are of God, <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being;</hi>
but as evil adhereth to them, ſo they are of man: Thus it is in original ſinne,
when we ſay, there is a poſitive inclination in mans heart to all evil; The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, That the underſtanding and will, as they are <hi>faculties,</hi> and as they do <hi>act,</hi>
thus farre they are of God, but as they cannot but act ſinfully, and offend in
every motion, ſo it's of <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, to underſtand then, to think,
to will, to love, theſe are of God, but to love what is evil and contrary to Gods
Word, or to love exceſſively and immoderately that which we are to do in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
only, this is of our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A ſecond Objection is,</hi> That if original ſinne be like a vicious habit in a
man, then it cannot be tranſmitted unto poſterity, for habits (<hi>they ſay</hi>) are
perſonal things: No father doth communicate to his childe any habits, either
virtuous or vicious.</p>
                        <p>But to this it's anſwered, That original ſinne is not an acquired habit of ſinne,
but an innate and imbred one in us; So that as if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, original
righteouſneſſe, which was like a concreated habit in man, would have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to all his poſterity, thus it is no wonder, if original ſinne, which doth
ſo tenaciouſly and inwardly adhere to all natures be tranſmitted to every one born
in a natural way.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The laſt Objection is,</hi> That there is no neceſſity of ſuppoſing ſuch an habitual
vitioſity in a man; It's enough (<hi>ſay they</hi>) that a man be deprived of the
Image of God, and when that is loſt, of it's own ſelf man's nature is prone
to evil; It needs no habitual inclination to weigh him down; as if a wild beaſt be
tied in cords and chains, loſe him, unty him, and of himſelf he will runne into wild
and untamed actions.</p>
                        <p>But to anſwer this:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Papiſts, they cannot conſequentially to their principles ſay
thus; For they hold, <q>That if this Image of God be removed, he doth
continue in his pure naturals, there is no ſinne inhering in him, upon the
meer loſſe of that; For they confeſſe, That although by acting from his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57719:93"/>
pure naturals he could not deſerve Heaven, or love God as a ſupernatural end,
yet in an inferiour way, as the ultimate natural end, ſo he might love God, and
that above all other things.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, That is granted, This poſitive inclination to all evil, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
neceſſarily from the removal of this Image of God from us; If the
Sunne be removed, then neceſſarily darkneſſe doth cover the face of the
ſoul; If the <hi>loco</hi>-motive faculty be interrupted, then there is nothing but
halting and lameneſſe: Diſturb the harmony, and good temperament of the
humours, and then immediately diſeaſes and pains do ſurprize the whole
man; It cannot therefore be avoided, that when this diſorder is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſoul, but that our luſts break out as at a flood-gate, and we are in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
deluge all over covered with the waters of ſin; but then here is a poſitive
as well as a privative.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, It is not for us to be curious in giving a reaſon of ſuch poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
corruption in a man by nature; it is enough that Gods word is ſo clear
and full in the diſcovery of it, that he muſt needs wilfully ſhut his eyes,
that will not be convinced by the light of Gods word herein: And this
may ſuffice to diſpel that darkneſſe, which ſome would have covered this
Truth with, and as for what knowledge about this poſitiveneſſe of original
corruption is further neceſſary; We ſhall then take notice of it, when we ſpeak
of original ſinne, as it is called luſt or concupiſcence.</p>

                        <p>LEt therefore the Uſe from the former Doctrine delivered, be, To affectus, and
wound us at the very heart, that we are thus all over covered with ſin, that
we have not an underſtanding, but to ſin, a will but to ſin, an heart but to ſin; May
not this be like a two edged ſword within thee? What will fire thee out of all
thy ſelf-confidence, thy ſelf-righteouſneſſe, if this doe not? What delight,
what comfort canſt thou take by beholding thy ſelf, by looking on thy ſelf
thus corrupted and depraved? And the rather let this conſideration go to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
bottom of thy ſoul. Becauſe</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Thy propenſity and inclination is to that onely which God onely
hateth, which God onely loatheth, and hath decreed to puniſh with his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
wrath to all eternity. Conſider that ſinne is the greateſt evil; All the
temporal evils in the world are but the effect of it, that is the cauſe. Now
can it ever humble thee enough to think, that the whole bent, and conſtant
tendency of thy ſoul is unto that which is the moſt abominable in the eyes
of God? Thou canſt not do that which is more deſtructive to thy own ſoul, and
more diſhonouring unto God, then by committing ſinne, and yet thou canſt do
nothing elſe, thou delighteſt in nothing elſe; Thy heart will not let thee do any
thing elſe: Look over thy whole life, take notice how many years thou haſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and yet if not regenerated and delivered in ſome meaſure from the power
of original corruption, thou haſt done nothing but ſinned; Every thought hath
been a ſinne, every motion a ſinne within thee, and yet ſinne is the greateſt evil,
and that alone which God hateth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, If yet thy heart be hard, and nothing will enter, take a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
naile, or wedge to drive into thee, and that is, being thus all over
carried out to ſinne, not the leaſt good able to riſe in thy heart, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the very plain Image of the Devil is drawn over thee: Hence it is,
that wicked men are ſaid <hi>to be of their Father the Devil;</hi> and he is ſaid <hi>to
rule in the hearts of the children of diſobedience,</hi> Epheſ. 2. What a wofull
change is this, to be turned from a Sonne of God, to become a Devil?
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57719:93"/>
While <hi>Adam</hi> retained the Image of God, God abode with him, and in
him, there was a near union with God, but upon his Apoſtaſie, the Devil
taketh poſſeſſion of all, and ſo now man is in a near union with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
Every mans ſoul is now the Devils Caſtle, his proper habitation;
The Spirit of God is chaced away, and now thy heart is made an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for theſe Satyrs; Thy ſoul is become like an howling wilderneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
lodge all beaſtly luſts whatſoever; Thou that wouldſt account it horrible
injury to be called beaſt and Devil, yet thy original ſinne maketh thee
no leſſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This further may break thy heart, if it be not yet broken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that hereby thou art utterly impotent and unable to help thy ſelf
out of this loſt condition; For how can a dead man help himſelfe to live
again? How can thy crooked heart be ever made ſtraight, unleſſe a
greater power than that ſubdue it; If thou didſt judge thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an hopeleſſe one, as to all humane conſiderations, then thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
tremble, and have no reſt in thy ſelfe, till God had delivered thee out
of it?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Let this alſo further work to thy Humiliation, that being thus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
inclined to all evil, not onely proper and ſutable temptations draw
out thy ſinnes, but even all holy and godly remedies appointed by God,
they do increaſe this corruption the more, And is not that man miſerable,
whoſe very remedies make him more miſerable? Doth not the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
ſadly of that Law of ſinne in him, even in this reſpect, that by this
means, the Law wrought in him all evil? The more holy and ſpiritual the Law
was, the more carnal and ſinfull was he thereby occaſioned to be: Oh then!

<hi>God forbid,</hi> and in the next place giveth a reaſon, why the Law cannot be
the cauſe of ſinne, becauſe that doth diſcover and detect ſinne, that judgeth and
damneth it, therefore it cannot be the cauſe of ſinne; and that the Law is the
manifeſter and reprover of ſinne, he inſtanceth in himſelf, and his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                        <p>Now ere we can underſtand this Text, we muſt anſwer ſome Queſtions.
And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It's demanded, What is meant by the <hi>Law</hi> here? Some ſay, the Law of
<hi>Nature,</hi> which is not ſo probable; Others, the <hi>written Law of Moſes,</hi> and this
is moſt probable by the whole context. But yet ſome, though they underſtand it
of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they do not mean any <hi>particular</hi> command, but the
Law in the <hi>general,</hi> ſaying, the Apoſtle uſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> for all one; As if
the meaning were, The Law in general did not only forbid ſinfull actions, but
alſo inward luſt, and motions of the ſoul thereunto, as our Saviour fully expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Others they underſtand this Law of a <hi>particular</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz.</hi> the tenth; and therefore <hi>Beza</hi> obſerveth the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, by
this, or by that Commandment in particular; And this ſeemeth moſt probable,
becauſe they are the very words of the tenth Commandment.</p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, If the Apoſtle alledge that command, Why doth he inſtance
onely in the ſinne forbidden, not mentioning the objects that are ſpecified in the
command, <hi>Thy neighbours Oxe or his Aſſe,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                        <p>The Anſwer is, that is not material, for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of luſts in the
heart, what latent and unknown ſins they were without the light of the Law, it
was enough to name the ſinne it ſelf, ſeeing the objects about which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
are of all ſorts, and can hardly be numbred.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, It's doubted how the Apoſtle could ſay, that he <hi>did not know
luſt to be ſinne, but by the Law of Moſes,</hi> ſeeing that by the very Law of nature,
even Heathens have condemned inward luſts, and unjuſt thoughts and plots,
though but in the ſoul, and never put into practice. <hi>Aquinas</hi> makes the meaning
of it, as if <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe was, <hi>He did not know luſt to be ſinne,</hi> as it was an offence
to God, and a diſhonour to him, becauſe the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of theſe luſts in a more divine and dreadfull way, then the Law of nature
doth. <hi>Grotius</hi> maketh the ſenſe thus, <q>
                              <hi>Paul</hi> did not know <hi>luſt,</hi> but by Gods
Law, becauſe the Laws of men puniſh nothing but ſinfull actions, never at all
medling with the thoughts and purpoſes of the heart.</q> 
                           <hi>Beza</hi> expounds the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
comparatively, <hi>I had not known luſt to be ſinne,</hi> viz. <hi>ſo evidently, ſo
fully,</hi> ſo unqueſtionably, as I did when I underſtood the Law. But the general
Interpretation is, <hi>That the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of his thoughts and knowledge,
while he was a Phariſee,</hi> and it's plain by our Saviours correcting of pharisaical
gloſſes about the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. That they thought the Law did onely require
<hi>external obedience,</hi> and whatſoever thoughts or ſinfull luſts men had, ſo that they
did not break out into the practice of them, they were not guilty of ſinne, <hi>He
did not then know luſt to be ſinne,</hi> following the traditional expoſition of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
till he came to underſtand the Law aright.</p>
                        <p>Another Queſtion of greater conſequence is, What is meant by <hi>luſt? Thou
ſhalt not covet,</hi> for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, though in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. there be the ſame
Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> yet <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 21. There is another Hebrew expreſſion,
which is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which becauſe in <hi>Hithpael,</hi> and ſo of a reciprocal ſignification,
they tranſlate <hi>fecit ſe concupiſcere,</hi> to ſtirre up a mans ſelf to deſire, and thereby
ſay, ſuch luſts are only forbidden that a man nouriſheth, and yeelds himſelf up
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57719:95"/>
unto, but that rule is not a general one, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 3. Some limit this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
too much, as it did only command contentation of ſpirit, and that
we ſhould not ſinfully deſire, that which others have. But the Apoſtle doth
plainly extend it further than ſo. The Papiſts they likewiſe limit it too much,
making only thoſe luſts andmotions of ſinne, which we conſent to to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
denying that thoſe motions to evil, which ariſe antecedently to our reaſon
and will, to be truly ſinnes; hence is their Rule concerning them, <hi>Non ſenſus,</hi>
but <hi>conſenſus</hi> is that which doth damn, which in a good ſenſe, we alſo will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be true. But we are not to limit Scripture, where it hath not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
it ſelf, and therefore we conclude, That the command doth forbid a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<hi>concupiſcence</hi> or <hi>luſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, That <hi>luſt</hi> which is <hi>actually conſented to,</hi> though not breaking forth
into act, and if this were all, the Law of God would hereby be exlted above
all humane Laws, which reach no further than external actions, And how many
are ignorant of, at leaſt not affected, with the ſpiriruality of this Law in this
particular? Would they dare to entertain ſuch heart-ſinnes as they doe, could
they make their ſouls cages of uncleane, unjuſt and ungodly thoughts, as
they do?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Law goeth higher, and doth not only forbid thoſe luſts in thy
heart, which thou yeeldeſt conſent unto; but all thoſe <hi>ſuggeſtions and ſuddain
ſurreptitious motions, which do ſuddenly ariſe in thy ſoul, though thou doeſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to them,</hi> yea though thou doeſt reſiſt them, hate them, and pray againſt
them, for of ſuch luſts <hi>Paul</hi> doth eſpecially ſpeak in this Chapter, and the
Law of nature did never condemn theſe for ſinnes in any Heathens, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Apoſtle doth chiefly complain of theſe, and that as ſinnes properly ſo
called, for to be mortified and crucified, as being contrary to the holy Law of
God.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, By <hi>luſt</hi> is meant <hi>original ſinne,</hi> as being the <hi>fountain,</hi> the root of all
theſe luſts, that hot furnace, from which thoſe ſparks of ſinfull motions do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
ariſe, and that by luſt is meant at leaſt ſecondarily, and by contequent
original corruption is plain, becauſe this luſt is the ſame with <hi>the Law of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the Law of ſinne,</hi> and <hi>the ſinne dwelling in him.</hi> It is true, he ſaith, this
ſinne he complaineth of, <hi>wrought in him all manner of concupiſcence or luſt.</hi> But
then we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>luſt habitual,</hi> and <hi>luſt actual;</hi> Luſt habitual is
original ſinne, and that is the cauſe of luſts actual; And if you ſay, Why doth
the Apoſtle call original ſinne <hi>luſt,</hi> as if it were an actual ſinne? The reaſon is
(as is further to be inſiſted on) becauſe it is a <hi>fountain alwayes running over;</hi> Its
not a <hi>ſluggiſh</hi> dull habit, but is continually venting it ſelf forth into all poiſonous
and ſinfull acts. So that by luſt forbidden in the Text is meant.</p>
                        <p>1. Luſts conſented to, though not accompliſhed in act.</p>
                        <p>2. Luſts ariſing in the ſoul, but rejected and ſtriven againſt.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Original ſinne, as the root of all; In which ſenſe the Apoſtle <hi>James
Chap.</hi> 1. 14. calleth it likewiſe <hi>luſt.</hi> Some learned men there are, that do not
like it ſhould be ſaid original ſinne is forbidden by the Law of God, (as <hi>Molineus,
Rivet. in Expoſ. Dec. Martinius in Expoſit. Decal</hi>) although they grant the
Law doth damn it and judge it. But ſurely their meaning is no more, as <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
doth expreſly afterwards affirm, than that original ſin is not primarily and
directly forbidden, but ſecondarily and by conſequent; As alſo that it is thus
forbidden, that we ſhould not obey but reſiſt it, as <hi>Rivet.</hi> But whereas they
reaſon, That a prohibition is not of thoſe things that already are preſent in us,
but of what is future or may be, that is no wayes ſolid, becauſe paſt ſins and
preſent actual ſins, are truly forbidden by the Law, although the ſinne paſt
cannot but be paſt, and the ſinne preſent cannot but be preſent, becauſe <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
eſt, quando eſt, neceſſe eſt eſſe.</hi> Other learned men, though they grant
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57719:95"/>
original ſinne is truly and properly forbidden by the Law of God, yet they ſay, It
is not in this Commandment, partly becauſe it's forbidden in every Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for where any branch of ſin is forbidden, there the root alſo is forbidden,
and where pure ſtreams of holineſs are required, there alſo a pure fountain of
holineſs; Original righteouſneſs is commanded, and that partly becauſe this
tenth Commandment doth belong to the ſecond Table onely, whereas original
ſinne is not onely the cauſe of evil luſts towards man, but alſo towards God.
Now in this we ſhall not much diſagree; For it muſt be granted, That ſeeing an
holy heart is required in every particular command, it followeth, That an evil
ſinfull heart is forbidden in every command; and for the later we grant alſo,
That original ſinne is not forbidden in this laſt Commandment in the univerſal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and utmoſt extent of it, but ſo farre as it doth break out in ſinfull luſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
man.</p>

is <hi>enticed</hi> to do that which is wicked, he cannot accuſe God or the Devil, but this
<hi>luſt within him:</hi> But of that famous and excellent Text, we are in time to

                        <p>IN the firſt place conſider, <hi>That concupiſcence or luſt may be taken two wayes,</hi>
as was formerly hinted, <hi>habitually</hi> and <hi>radically,</hi> or <hi>actually,</hi> the <hi>mother</hi> and
the <hi>daughter,</hi> the <hi>root</hi> and the <hi>fruit.</hi> Now original ſinne is <hi>luſt,</hi> not <hi>actually,</hi> but
<hi>radically;</hi> It is that from which all actual luſts and deſires have their immediate
riſe; and in this ſenſe it is commonly called the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>luſts</hi> are the ſinfull iſſue
of it. Thus <hi>Gal. 5. 16. You ſhall not fulfill</hi>

to declare the emphatical ſinfulneſs of it, and then there are aſcribed ſeveral
luſts likewiſe to it, <hi>Rom. 6. 12. Sinne muſt not reign in us, that we ſhould obey the

                        <p>2. There is in the Scripture mention of a <hi>good concupiſcence,</hi> or <hi>coveting,</hi> and that is,
when a godly man doth earneſtly deſire to do or ſuffer the wil of God: Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 3
17. righteous men are ſaid <hi>to deſire to ſee thoſe things; which were to be ſeen in Chriſts
dayes:</hi> So <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 15. Chriſt is there ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>But then laſtly, There are <hi>evil covetings and deſires, ſinfull luſtings;</hi> In which

concupiſcence, a good concupiſcence, and a ſinfull wicked one; And this again is

                        <p>THe third particular neceſſary for the underſtanding of this Doctrine, <hi>viz.
That original ſinne is luſt or concupiſcence in a man,</hi> is, <hi>To take notice of a
three fold appetite, Natural, Animal</hi> and <hi>Rational:</hi> Even inanimate bodies, the
ſtone and the fire have a kind of an appetite, to deſcend, the one downward, the
other upward. In a man there is a natural appetite of eating or drinking.</p>
                        <p>2. There is the <hi>animal</hi> or <hi>ſenſitive appetite,</hi> whereby the ſenſitive faculties do
deſire their ſutable objects.</p>

                           <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57719:96"/>
Laſtly, There is the <hi>Rational Appetite,</hi> whereby a man is carried out to deſire
thoſe good things that are judged to be ſo by reaſon: Now if we take theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
ſubſtantially, as it were, or <hi>phyſically,</hi> ſo they are good, and the actions
that flow from them are good; but then take them <hi>Ethically</hi> and <hi>Morally</hi> with
that <hi>Ataxy</hi> and <hi>Inordinacy</hi> that doth cleave to them, as they are in man, and ſo
they do become <hi>polluted,</hi> and <hi>defiled:</hi> Inſomuch that a man doth ſinne till rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in all theſe things; his eating and drinking became ſinne, and all other
his <hi>actions,</hi> becauſe the <hi>principles</hi> from which they flow are all <hi>vitiated;</hi> So that
whatſoever principle we have of any action, it being <hi>deſtitute</hi> of that <hi>original
rectitude,</hi> which adhered to it; therefore it is that it moveth to every object
ſinfully; So that this conſideration may take off that calumny which the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of original ſinne would faſten upon the Orthodox herein, as if we made man
to be nothing but <hi>opus Diaboli,</hi> the work of the Devil, as if he were not the

they are good and of God. The underſtanding, the will, the affections, theſe
are in themſelves good, but man having ſinned away original righteouſneſſe,
which would have habitually <hi>diſpoſed</hi> them to their due <hi>objects,</hi> in a due

                        <p>4. VVHen we ſay, <hi>That original ſinne is habitual luſt, we muſt not take luſt
ſtrictly, but moſt largely, as it comprehends any part of the ſoul in its
motions to their reſpective objects.</hi> Our Engliſh word <hi>luſt</hi> is by cuſtom almoſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to unclean deſires, as if thoſe corporal burnings were onely luſt: Even as
the Latine word <hi>libido,</hi> though originally ſignifying <hi>quicquid libet,</hi> any thing that
pleaſed a man is for the moſt part alſo reſtrained to fleſhly luſting, but we told
you that the word luſt <gap reason="foreign">

ſenſe, in a <hi>bad</hi> ſenſe, and a <hi>neutral</hi> indifferent one. Therefore in the <hi>affections</hi>
there is this luſt, in the <hi>will</hi> there is this luſt, yea in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>fancy,</hi>
which are apprehenſive faculties only, there is this luſt: For although <hi>Aquinas</hi>
ſaith, <q>That we cannot properly in the underſtanding ſay, there is <hi>motus ad
objectum,</hi> becauſe a paſſive faculty, yet in a large ſenſe, <hi>all faculties</hi> of the
ſoul have their <hi>inclination and motion to their objects,</hi> and ſo this original luſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
it ſelf through them all,</q> and therefore they alſo limit this concupiſcence
too much, which confiae it only to the ſenſitive part, the inferiour region of the
ſoul; For the more acute Papiſts do ingeniouſly confeſſe, That <hi>Hereſies, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi>
are ſins of the mind, and yet flow from this concupiſcence, ſo that this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
luſt is diffuſed and extended, as farre as the ſoul hath any power or motion:
Oh but how few are there that do regard luſt any further than bodily or ſenſible?
The ſpiritual, the intellectual luſtings of the ſoul are not apprehended as an heavy
load or burden: So that original ſinne hath its upper-ſprings, and its nether-ſprings,
the corporal chanel, and the ſpiritual, in which its filth runneth down;
In the groſs prophane man, there is original ſinne acting <hi>carnally</hi> and bodily; in
the heretique, in the proud Scholar, there is original ſinne acting <hi>mentally</hi> and
<hi>intellectually:</hi> So that as man doth conſiſt of two parts, one viſible, and the other
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57719:97"/>
inviſible, ſo alſo doth original ſinne, as it were, conſiſt of two ingredients, the
<hi>bodily</hi> part, and the <hi>ſoul</hi> part, and from the ſoul doth this poiſon fall to all the
inferiour parts; Therefore do not only complain of ſinne and luſt in thy material
and ſenſitive part, but look upon the ſtrength and chief power of it, as in thy
immaterial and ſoul part, for in all theſe, this original luſt, this Law of ſinne doth
conſtantly dwel. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> they call this <hi>Fomes peccati,</hi> becauſe it doth <hi>fovere;</hi>
it's like the cinders and aſhes that keep alive the fire of ſin within a man, and the

                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, There was his <hi>Natura inſtituta,</hi> his inſtituted nature at firſt, and that
was right and holy; There was concupiſcence and deſiring of the ſeveral powers
of his ſoul, but in a good and orderly way; It was not then as now, the <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ora</hi>
did not <hi>turpiter ſervire inferioribus,</hi> or the <hi>inferiora contumaciter,</hi> rebel againſt
the ſuperiour parts, as is to be ſhewed in the next place; In <hi>Adam</hi> there was no
concupiſcence in this ſenſe; The inferiour parts, though they did deſire a ſenſible
object, yet it was wholly in ſubordination, and under the command of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour.
It's true indeed <hi>Eve</hi> did look upon the forbidden fruit, and ſaw it was
good and pleaſant, whereupon ſhe was tempted to eat of it, but this did not
ariſe from any original luſt in her, but from the mutability of her will, being not
confirmed in what was good: Even as we ſee the Angels before their Apoſtaſie,
had ſinfull deſires in their will, through pride and affectation to be higher than
they were, yet this did not ariſe from original luſt in them. Although therefore
both <hi>Socinians</hi> and ſome Papiſts, do acknowledge man made with ſuch a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of the ſenſitive appetite to the rational; yea, the former making it to be
in Chriſt himſelf, yet this is highly to diſhonour God in the Creation of man:
Oh happy and bleſſed eſtate, when there was ſuch an univerſal harmony and due
proportion in all the powers of the ſoul, but <hi>miſerum eſt illud verbum ſniſſe,</hi> may
all mankind cry out in this particular.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is <hi>Natura infecta</hi> and <hi>deſtituta,</hi> infected Nature, ſtript and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuded
of all former holineſs and excellency, and here concupiſcence is not onely
in us, but it doth reign and predominate over the whole man; The harmony is
totally diſſolved, and now the choice and ſublime parts of the foul, are made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
to the affectionate part, as loathſom and abominable, as when the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
to lie with a beaſt. Now the mind and underſtanding is wholly ſet on work
to diſpute and argue for the carnal part: Now the motions of the ſoule
beginne in the carnal part, and end in the intellectual, whereas in the ſtate
of integrity, the beginning and riſe would firſt have been in the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and ſo have deſcended to the ſenſitive part. The motions thereof ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
all deliberation in the mind, and a rectified choice in the will; Thus the feet
they guide the head, and in this little world of man, the earth moveth, and the
Heavens they ſtand ſtill, as ſome fancied in the great world; now luſt is by way
of a Law ruling and commanding all things: This is the unſpeakable miſery and
bondage we are now plunged into.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is <hi>Natura reſtituta,</hi> repaired nature by grace, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57719:97"/>

                              </gap>as;</hi> hence it is becauſe of the actings and workings of original ſinne
ſtill in the godly, they are in a continual conflict, they cannot do any thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
they feel a clogge preſſing them down, when they are elevating
themſelves, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom 7. doth abundantly manifeſt, <hi>The good he would do
he cannot do.</hi> Original ſinne is like that Tree in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 4. 23. Though
there was a watcher from Heaven coming down to cut it down, yet the ſtumps
and root of the Tree were left with a band of iron and braſs, to denote the firm
and immovable abiding of it: Thus though the grace of God be ſtill mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
and ſubduing the luſts of the fleſh, yet the ſtumps ſeem to be bound
with braſſe and iron to us, we are never able in this life wholly to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, If you conſider the <hi>perfected and glorified eſtate of the godly in Heaven,</hi>
then there will be a full and utter extirpation of this original ſin. The glorified
bodies in Heaven, though naked, ſhall not be ſubject to ſhame and confuſion, as
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were after their fall; And among other reaſons, therefore doth
the Lord ſuffer theſe reliques of corruption to abide in the moſt holy, that ſo
we may the more ardently and zealouſly long after that kingdom of glory, when
we ſhall be delivered from this ſinfull ſoul and mortal body; Then this command
<hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> will be perfectly accompliſhed, whereas in this life it is a
perpetual hand writing againſt us; The Papiſts indeed do confeſs our luſts to be
againſt this command, but not <hi>ut praecipienti,</hi> but <hi>ut indicanti,</hi> as if God did not
ſo much command us what we ſhould do, as by Doctrine inform what is good
and excellent in it ſelf. Thus rather than they will be found guilty by this Law,
they will make it no Law, and turn it from a precept into a meer doctrinal infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
But ſeeing one end of the Law is to convince us, and aggravate our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
to make us ſee our deſperate, diſeaſed eſtate, that thereby we may flie
to Chriſt, as the malefactor to the City of refuge; let it be farre from us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate
or to leſſen our ſinfulneſs: The Phariſees of old, and all their ſucceſſors
in endeavouring to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs by the Law, have ſplit themſelves on
this rock, as if the Law had not holineſs enough to command them, but they
were able to do more than that required: But whence doth this Blind preſumption
ariſe? Even from the ignorance of the power of original ſiane in us.</p>

ſin is habitual luſt. Let us in the next place conſider, why we call it ſo. And
Firſt, It may well be called concupiſcence or luſt, <hi>Becauſe the appetitive and
active powers of the ſoul are chief in a man, and they being corrupted and polluted,
it's no wonder if the whole man be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>urried headlong to hell.</hi> The Schoolmen make
it a Queſtion, Why original ſinne ſhould not be called <hi>ignorantia,</hi> as well as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcentia?</hi>
But firſt, We may call it ignorance alſo; It's ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the apprehenſive powers of the ſoul, but luſt and concupiſcence in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive;
eſpecially the will being horribly corrupted, which is ſaid to be the
<hi>appetitus univerſalis,</hi> and is to all other inferiour parts of the ſoul, as the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
mobile,</hi> to the other orbs, which carrieth all about with its motion; It's no
wonder that it be called luſt, as infecting and perverting the will, which is the
whole of a man; for if a man know evil, yet if he do not will it, it is no ſinne;
God himſelf knoweth all the ſinne that is committed in the world, and there is
difference between <hi>Cogitatio mali,</hi> the thought about evil, and <hi>cogitatio mala,</hi>
an evil thought; but the will cannot be carried out to evil, but preſently it is an
evil will. The underſtanding by knowing evil is not polluted, but the will is by
willing of it, becauſe the underſtanding receiveth the object intentionally into it
ſelf, and ſo is abſtracted from its exiſtency; but the will that goeth to the object
in it ſelf, and as it doth really exiſt, but this occaſionally onely. Original ſinne
may well be called luſt, becauſe the acting and working parts of the ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the will is the ſupreme and chief, being polluted by it, the vigour and efficacy
of it is moſt diſcovered by them, and this is that which makes grace ſo admirable
and wonderfull, that it can bind the ſtrong ones of the ſoul, yea that it can turn
ſinfull luſtings into glorious, heavenly and holy luſtings; Thus it is marvellous in
the eyes of the godly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Original ſinne may well be called <hi>Luſt, Becauſe it's general to every
ſinne;</hi> Every actual ſinne is a luſt in ſome ſenſe: So that although <hi>Aquinas</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Text ſaith,) That original ſinne is, <hi>Commune malum non communitate ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris
aut ſpeciei, sed cauſalitatis,</hi> not by a community of <hi>genus,</hi> but of cauſe,
yet in ſome ſenſe we may ſay, that concupiſcence hath a generical community,
becauſe as a <hi>genus</hi> it is included in every ſinne: So that if we do take notice of any
ſinne, this is in the general nature of it, that there is a ſinfull deſire or appetite;
What is covetouſneſs but an inordinate deſire of wealth? What is ambition but
an inordinate deſire of honour, and ſo of every ſinne? But to be ſure, it is a
common ſinne by way of cauſality. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> informeth us, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.
14. That <hi>every man, when he ſinneth is tempted aſide by that luſt which is in him:</hi>
So that all the ſinfull thoughts, words and actions, which all the men of the
world, ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall till the end of the world ſhall commit, and be guilty of,
do ariſe from this fountain, yet how little do we affect our hearts with the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and dreadfulneſs of it?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It may well be called <hi>Luſt, Becauſe it is alwayes an acting vigorous
principle within us.</hi> Whatſoever we are doing, eating, drinking, working, this
luſt is moving in us; yea in ſleep, in frantick mad men, in children and infants in
ſome ſenſe (as is to be ſhewed) This luſt is putting forth it ſelf; we may as well
keep the wind within our fiſts, as make this original luſt lie ſtill; So that by this
we may evidently ſee, the greateſt part of our evil lieth Inwardly and ſecretly in
the ſoul; our actual and outward impieties, they are but the leaſt part of that

ſaith, <q>That even to his time the Church had not peremptorily defined what it

                           <hi>ORiginal ſinne is an horrid depravation and defilement of the whole man,
cauſed by the Devils temptation, and our firſt Parents obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and from them deſcending by propagation to all his Poſterity, being ſtript
of Gods glorious Image, whereby they are prone to all evil, and ſo are under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the Devil, and obnoxious to eternal wrath.</hi> It is not my purpoſe in
making this draught of it, to attend unto the exact rules of Logick, but ſo to
compoſe it, that every thing conſiderable to give the true knowledge of it, may
be comprized therein. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, We ſay, It's a <hi>depravation</hi> and <hi>defilement,</hi> which implieth the ſinfulneſs
of it, that it is truly and properly a ſinne; And therefore ſinne is truly and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally
divided into <hi>original</hi> and <hi>actual;</hi> ſo that they who make it onely to be
guilt without any inward contagion, they do wholly erre from the Scripture,
they ſay not enough. It is true, <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne in the guilt of it is imputed unto us,
which made <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of old ſay, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> alledgeth him againſt the <hi>

Morinus ſum in Adamo, ejectus ſum in Paradiſo in Adamo</hi> &amp;c. I am dead in <hi>Adam,</hi>
I am caſt out of Paradiſe in <hi>Adam:</hi> But we are not diſputing of original <hi>imputed</hi>
ſinne, but original <hi>inhering;</hi> Therefore original inherent ſinne is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a defilement upon us againſt the Law of God, and this ſinfull eſtate of all
by nature, ſhould be farre more terrible unto us, then our miſerable and mortal
eſtate. Again, When we call it a <hi>defilement,</hi> we oppoſe their opinion, who make
it only <hi>morbus,</hi> and not truly a ſinne; As alſo thoſe who ſay, It is the ſubſtance
of a man, for if ſo, then Chriſt could not have taken our nature without ſinne,
neither could there be glorified bodies in Heaven without ſinne, for all theſe have
the humane nature of a man. Further we ſay, It's an <hi>horrid depravation:</hi> This
Epithete is neceſſary to be added to awaken phariſaical and ſelf-righteous perſons,
it being ſo dreadfull an evil, that we are never able to go to the depth of it:
Never therefore think of ſpeak of original ſinne, but let thy heart tremble, and
let horrour and amazement take hold of thee, becauſe of it; and this is put
in the Deſcription to obviate thoſe opinions that make it the leaſt of all
ſinnes. Some complain, <q>That we are too ſevere and tragical in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of it;</q> but enough hath been already ſpoken out of Scripture, to ſhew,
that neither heart can conceive, or tongue expreſs the foulneſs of it. This is the
general part of the Deſcription.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, You have the <hi>Subject</hi> of it, and becauſe the <hi>Subject</hi> thereof is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
of <hi>Inheſion,</hi> and of <hi>Predication.</hi> In this part, we have the <hi>Subject</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is, and that is <hi>totus homo,</hi> and <hi>totum hominis,</hi> the <hi>whole man,</hi> and the <hi>whole
of man,</hi> there being no part free from this contagion; ſo that it's repletively
and diffuſively in all the parts of ſoul and body, though eminently and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
in the mind and will, and the whole heart. It's true, ſinne is not properly
ſeated in the body, the eyes or hand, or in the ſenſitive part, yet participatively
and ſubordinately, as they are inſtruments to the ſoul in its actings, ſo they are
ſaid to be ſinfull: Thus there are luſtfull eyes, curſing tongues, unclean bodies;
There are ſinfull imaginations and fancies, becauſe theſe are the organs by which
the ſoul putteth forth its wickedneſs: So that the body is like a broken, ſpoiled
inſtrument of muſick, and the ſoul, like an unskilfull Artificer playing on it,
which cauſeth horrid and harſh ſounds for pleaſant melody. But as God is every
where, yet in Heaven after a more glorious and ſignal manifeſtation of himſelf:
So on the contrary, though original ſinne be a Leproſie infecting the whole man,
yet it's moſt principally in the intellectual and immaterial parts of the ſoul. It's
horrible <hi>darkneſſe</hi> in the mind, <hi>averſneſſe</hi> in the <hi>will to all that is good,</hi> and <hi>contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
in the heart to whatſoever is holy; And this part doth directly oppoſe all
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57719:99"/>
thoſe who grant indeed original ſinne, but yet grant it wholly in the inferiour
and ſenſitive part, as if our reaſon and mind were like the Heavens of a quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
frame in reſpect of any unholy contagion, whereas indeed becauſe theſe
eyes of the ſoul are dark, therefore is the whole body dark: Becauſe the Sunne,
and Moon, and Starres, as it were, of this little world of man, are turned into
bloud, therefore every part elſe is alſo become blood, defiled and loathſom; and
this is the reaſon, why ſo few do either believe, or know this natural corruption,
becauſe it benummeth us, yea it taketh away all ſpiritual life, ſo that we cannot
diſcern of it. The declaration of the cauſe of it, followeth in this deſcription,
where we have the external efficient cauſe, and the internal; The external was
the <hi>Devil;</hi> after his all and apoſtaſie, he endeavoured, being a murderer from
the beginning, to deſtroy man alſo, and accordingly he did prevail, and thus by
the Devil ſinne came into the world; yet he is the external cauſe onely, he could
not force or compel our firſt parents to ſinne, he did onely perſwade and entice
them; Therefore the internal cauſe was the freedom of their will, God created
them in, whereby they might either imbrace good, or chuſe evil, which mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
was the cauſe of their apoſtaſie. It is true, the diſpute is very curious, How
<hi>Adam</hi> being created perfect could yeeld to ſinne? Whether did the defect ariſe
in his will or underſtanding firſt? But ſeeing it's clear by Scripture, that he did
ſinne, and we feel the wofull effect of it: Let us not buſie our heads in metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
curioſities, although I ſee the ſoundeſt Authors make the beginning of his
ſinne to be in <hi>inadvertency,</hi> for his ſoul being finite, while he earneſtly intended
to one thing, he did not attend to another, and ſo ſinne was inchoatively firſt in
his underſtanding, not by errour or ignorance, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s underſtanding was
free from that, but by not attendency to all conſiderations and arguments, as he
ought to do. Although it muſt be confeſt, that the root and foundation of his
ſin, was the <hi>vertibility</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> for as he might not ſin, ſo alſo he might ſin, he had
then a <hi>poſſe peccare</hi> in him, and ſo a <hi>defectibility</hi> from the Rule. Thus although effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cauſes uſe not to be put into exact definitions, neither hath ſin ſo properly effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
as deficient cauſes, yet in large deſcriptions, it is very uſefull to name them,
for hereby God is wholly cleared, although he created man, and fore-knew he
would fall, yea permitted him to fall, yet he was no cauſe of his fall; neither did
God make <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might ſinne, as ſome would calumniate the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Doctrine with ſuch conſequences: Even as <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s adverſaries ſaid, he did
<hi>Sub nomine gratiae aſſerere fatum,</hi> becauſe we do not make God an idle Spectator,
as it were, of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, or make it wholly uncertain and caſual, as it were, to
God, but acknowledge his permiſſion and ordination of <hi>Adam</hi>'s evil to a better
good than his evil, could be evil, therefore it is that ſome do ſo paratragediate.
Take we heed then, that in the acknowledging of this Doctrine, we have no fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or fooliſh though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

poſterity, was of and through himſelf.</p>
                        <p>The next thing conſiderable in the Deſcription, is the <hi>propagating and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating</hi>
of it to all his poſterity that naturally deſcend from our firſt Parents.
This alſo is very material to open the nature of this ſinne, that it's by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne was not perſonal, as ours are, but common to the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. putteth it upon one ſinne, or offence, and
that by one man. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> were vehement oppoſers of this, and therefore
called the Orthodox <hi>Traduciani,</hi> becauſe they hold the traduction of this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne, <hi>Adam</hi> being a common perſon, and he as our Head being in Covenant
with God, when he became a Covenant-breaker, then we all forfeited all in and
by him; So that it's the <hi>Covenant</hi> of God that is the foundation of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
original ſinne, as farre as ſinne can be communicated to all mankind, yet
<hi>natural generation</hi> is the <hi>medium,</hi> or way of conveying it; But of this more in
it's time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="166" facs="tcp:57719:100"/>
It followeth in the Deſcription, <hi>That this original ſinne, as it is by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo to all and every one of mankind, who were in his loins, for Chriſt was not
properly in</hi> Adam<hi>'s loins, and ſo his ſinne could not be imputed to Chriſt becauſe</hi>
Adam <hi>was not in Covenant for him, otherwiſe not the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>or any
other is exempted from this univerſal pollution.</hi> So that here we have the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum
praedicationis,</hi> as formerly <hi>inhaeſonis,</hi> that ſubject of whom this ſinne may
be predicated, and that is <hi>every Infant new born,</hi> as ſoon as he hath a being, ſo
ſoon doth he become thus all over ſtained and abominable; and this ſhould make
Parents have ſad and ſerious thoughts about their children, there is that corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
planted in their ſouls, which no inſtruction, no diſcipline can eradicate,
nay the grace of God ſanctifying doth not wholly expel in this life; Although
the grace of God in ſome <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> and <hi>Timothies</hi> appear in them from the
youth, yet theſe were by nature dead in ſinne, and children of wrath, onely
Gods grace was very wonderfully conveyed unto them in their youth or infancy.
Do not therefore think, that becauſe thou haſt a more ingenuous, civil and moral
nature, that therefore original ſinne is not in thee, yea many times the actings,
and workings of it are more mortiferous and peſtilential than in groſſe ſinners.
But let us proceed to the parts, as it were <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>intrinſecally conſtituent</hi> of
this depravation, and that is ſaid to be <hi>the loſſe of Gods glorious Image,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a <hi>proneneſs to all evil;</hi> we need not ſay more to explicate theſe particulars: As
in hell there is a <hi>privative</hi> part, the loſſe of the enjoying of God, and then a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi>
puniſhment through the torments of hell fire. Thus in original ſinne we
are without the Image of God. There is not that light or holineſs he created us
in, and withall an impetuous inclination to whatſoever is evil; So that now all the
powers of the ſoul they move inordinately, and with great precipitancy, as
<hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith of old men, becauſe of their feebleneſs, <hi>Dum ambulare volunt, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
they do not walk but runne; Thus our affections, our will, they do not
ſo much go, as tumble headlong to their objects. Hence <hi>Tanrellus (Tryumphus
Philoſ. pag.</hi> 18.) maketh original ſinne to be nothing but <hi>impotentia naturam
cohibendi,</hi> that we cannot ſtop nature in the impetuous motions thereof to ſinne,
no more than we can the violent torrents and ſtreams of water in exceſſive floods.
In theſe two things then lieth the whole venom and poiſon of this natural filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
we are <hi>without all good, and under the dominion of all evil,</hi> and this is to ſpeak
all the miſery that poſſibly a man can be capable of.</p>
                        <p>In the laſt part we adde in the deſcription a two-fold effect of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
defilement, which although they are to be treated of in a more large
manner, with all the particular effects of this ſinne, or ſome of them at leaſt,
yet in the general ſomething is to be ſaid, that we may affect our ſouls with
them. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby we are made obnoxious to the curſe and wrath of God:</hi> Even before any
actual ſin is ever committed, for this Infants dying immediately upon their birth,
may juſtly be damned to all eternity; This is that which carnal reaſon ſtrometh
at; This is that which the nature of man will hardly yeeld to; Therefore the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of many have been, That there is nothing damnable in Infants; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome would not admit them into the Kingdom of Heaven, yet freed them
from the place of the damned, but we muſt ſubmit our humane reaſon, and our
humane affections to the Scripture, if ſo be that Gods word ſaith, <hi>We are by
nature children of wrath; If Jeſus Chriſt be a Saviour to Infants as well as to
men;</hi> if he came to redeem them as well as actual ſinners, then of themſelves
their condition was damnable, <hi>for Chriſt came to ſeek that which was loſt, and
the whole need not the Phyſitian, but the ſick:</hi> Oh then let us all humble our ſelves
under this ſentence of condemnation paſſed upon us. God might ſay of every
Infant, <hi>In the day thou art born, thou ſhalt be damned,</hi> and it is the meer gracious
favour of God, that deferreth the execution of this ſentence, for till a man be in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57719:100"/>
Chriſt, he is not freed from this curſe, only God in much patience doth put off
the execution.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond effect is, <hi>To be under the power and dominion of the Devil,
Eph.</hi> 2. The <hi>Devil</hi> is ſaid to <hi>rule in the hearts of men,</hi> and is therefore called, <hi>The
Prince of this world</hi> regeneration is not only ſubduing of corruption in us, not
only repairing the glorious Image of God which we have loſt, but alſo a diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing
of the devil, who had a throne in every mans ſoul. By nature therefore
becauſe thus polluted, we are vaſſals and bondſlaves to Satan, we are of him, we
do his works; The bodily poſſeſſed by Satan were not more miſerably agitated
by him, then our ſouls are ſpiritually by him; what he tempts us to, we obey;
what he ſuggeſts to us, we entertain: Inſomuch that every man by nature may
ſay, he no longer liveth, but ſinne in him, and the Devil in him; Hereby thy
heart may be called hell, yea and Legion, becauſe many Devils do rule in thee:
Oh that God would make this Truth like a two-edged ſword in our hearts, that
we may not reſt day or night, till God hath delivered us from this wretched eſtate!
Pray for it, groan for it, all the day long.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, As for that <hi>original ſinne</hi> called <hi>originans,</hi> viz. <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
made ours by Gods will and appointment, through <hi>imputation,</hi> that is,
<hi>wholly</hi> known by revelation, ſo that no Heathens by the higheſt improvement and

giving him a command of tryal in obedience, or diſobedience, whereof
all his poſterity ſhould be involved, this they had not the leaſt him of, and the
reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the truth of ſuch things lieth not in nature, neither have ſecond

it is implanted and ingraffed into man to ſinne. <hi>Tully (lib. 3. Tuſc.</hi>)
doth ſpeak ſo fully to this purpoſe, as if he had read what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of man
by nature, <hi>Simul ac editi ſumus in lucem &amp; ſuſcepti in omni continuè pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
verſamur,</hi> &amp;c. as ſoon as ever we are born, we are preſently exerciſed in
all manner of evil, <hi>Vt poenè in lacte nutricis errorem ſuxiſſe videamur,</hi> as if
we ſucked down errour with the nurſes milk; Here you ſee he ſpeaketh ſomething
like to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Gen. 6. That the imagination of the thoughts of our
hearts are only evil and that continually;</hi> Although at the ſame time he ſeemeth to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
this propenſity to evil to wicked manner, and depraved opinions, for there
he ſaith, <q>Nature hath given us of honeſty <hi>parvulos igniculos,</hi> and that there are
<hi>ingeniis noſtris ſemina innata virtutum.</hi>
                           </q> But although ſome of their wiſeſt men
have confeſſed ſuch a miſery and infirmity upon us, yet it may be doubted, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they looked upon this, as truly and properly ſinne, deſerving puniſhment
either from God or man; They rather thought all ſinne muſt be voluntary:
Hence <hi>Seneca, Erras ſi exiſtimas nobiſcum naſci vitia ſupervenerunt ingeſta ſunt.</hi>
Indeed in their ſad complaints concerning mans birth, and all miſery accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, they did <hi>rem ſcire,</hi> but <hi>cauſam neſcire,</hi> they evidently
ſaw we were miſerable, but they knew not the cauſe of it, whereas original ſin,
according to Scripture light, though not perſonally voluntary, yet is truly a
ſinne, and maketh a man in a damnable eſtate; Therefore the word <hi>original,</hi>
when we divide ſinne into <hi>original</hi> and <hi>actual,</hi> is not <hi>terminus reſtrictivus,</hi> or
<hi>diminuens,</hi> as when we did divide <hi>ens</hi> into <hi>ens reale,</hi> and <hi>rationis,</hi> but <hi>terminus
ſpecificans,</hi> as when <hi>animal</hi> is divided into <hi>rationale</hi> and <hi>irrationale,</hi> both properly
partaking of the general nature of ſinne; So that whatſoever apprehenſions
they had, and complaints they made about man, yet they did not believe he was
born in ſinne, though experience told them, he was in miſery. The <hi>Perſians</hi>
(as <hi>Pleſſeus</hi> in the above-mentioned place ſaith) had every year a ſolemn Feaſt,
wherein they did kill all the Serpents and wild beaſts they could get, and this
Feaſt they called <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perduction of the ſoul to that ſtate in which it was, before it deſcended into the
body, which he interpreteth of the ſtate of perfection from which we fell in the
old <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that even in this errour there was ſome truth, which made <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
ſay, <hi>Omnia adverſus veritatem de ipsà veritate conſtructa eſſe operantibus aemulationem
iſtam ſpiritibus erroris.</hi> Thus you ſee how the wiſeſt of the Heathens
have been divided in this point, Some making the ſoul of a man to come without
vice or virtue, as a blank fit to receive either. Others acknowledging a <hi>diſeaſe,</hi>
and an infirmity upon the ſoul, yet ignorant of the cauſe of it, neither acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it to be a ſinne, and ſo deſerving puniſhment.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, Although the Heathens did not ſee this ſinne, nor could
truly bewail it, yet ſo farre many of them were convinced, that if they had any
ſinfull deſires or luſting in the ſoul, or any wicked thoughts in their hearts to
which they gave conſent, that theſe were ſinnes, and wholly to be abſtained
from, though they did not break forth into act. <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Comment
upon the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commandment, ſheweth out of ſeveral Heatheniſh Writers,
<hi>That all ſecret luſtings of the ſoul with conſent thereunto were were wholly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;</hi>
Yea, as one of them is there ſaid to expreſſe it, they are not ſo much as to
covet a <hi>needle,</hi> the leaſt thing. And as for <hi>Seneca,</hi> he hath high aſſertions about
the governing of our thoughts, and ordering the inward affections of our ſouls
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57719:102"/>
ſo, as that the gods, as well as men may approve us. <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, That an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man would do no evil, or unjuſt thing, though he could have <hi>Gyges</hi> his ring,
which they feigned made a man inviſible; And this is the rather to be obſerved,
becauſe herein <hi>they ſurpaſſed the Phariſees,</hi> who though brought up under the
Law, and had conſtantly the word of God to guide them, yet they did not think
any covetings or luſtings in the heart to be a tranſgreſſion of the Law, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by our Saviours information, and expoſition he gave them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And
<hi>Joſephus</hi> is ſaid to deride <hi>Polybius</hi> the great Hiſtorian for making the gods to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
a King, meerly becauſe he had a purpoſe and an intent to commit ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormious
iniquity: Yea, <hi>This principle of the Heathens may make many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
aſhamed, and be greatly confounded, who live, as if their thoughts were
free, and their hearts were their own,</hi> ſo that they might ſuffer any poiſonous
evil, and malicious actings of ſoul to be within them, and to put to check or
controll upon them: As they matter not <hi>original ſinne,</hi> ſo neither the immediate
<hi>effects</hi> and working thereof. Though their hearts be a den of theeviſh luſts, and
their ſouls like <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſheet, wherein were a company of innumerable unclean
creeping luſts, yet ſo as their lives are unblameable, they wholly juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but you are to know, that the ſtrength of ſinne lieth in your hearts.
The leaſt part of your evil is that which is viſible in your lives.</p>

                        <p>THirdly, <hi>We ſee that original ſinne is ſo hardly diſcernable, that though
men do enjoy the light of Gods Word, yea and read it over and over again,
yet for all that they are not convinced of this native pollution.</hi> We ſee in all
the Heretiques that have been in all ages, who have denied this original ſinne,
they were ſummoned to anſwer the Word of God, Scripture upon Scripture
was brought to convince them, but a veil was upon their eyes, they would wreſt
and pervert the meaning of it, rather than retract their errour, ſo that Scripture-light
objectively ſhining therein, is not enough <hi>Paul</hi> is a clear inſtance in this,
he was moſt exact and ſtrict about the Law, yet wholly ignorant of this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental

Hence</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place, <hi>To have a full and clear underſtanding of this native de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement,

enough, unleſſe the Spirit of God be efficacious to remove all errour, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
as alſo to prepare and fit the ſoul to receive it; Hence it's made the
work of Gods Spirit to lead into all truth, if into all, then into this, while the
eyes remain blind, the Sunne with all its luſtre can do no good. It is true, Gods
Word is compared to a <hi>light,</hi> and to a <hi>lamp,</hi> but that is only objective without us,
there muſt be ſomething ſubjectively within us, that ſhall make a ſutableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the object and the faculty. To be made then Orthodox, and to have a

it that when one heareth and readeth thoſe Texts, <hi>We are by nature the children
of wrath; Who can bring a clean thing out of unclean?</hi> He adoreth the fulneſs of
theſe Texts, he is convinced of ſuch heart-pollution, and bleſſeth God for the
knowledge of this truth: But another he cavilleth at the Texts, he derideth and
ſcorneth at ſuch a truth, Is not this becauſe the Spirit of God leadeth one into the
truth, and leaveth the other to his pride and blindneſs of mind.</p>

this may be part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, when he ſaith, <hi>He did not know luſt
to be ſinne,</hi> that is, not ſo clearly, ſo fully, ſo experimentally, as now he
did ſince the grace of God had both enlightned and ſanctified him; How
many have with great orthodoxy maintained this Truth againſt <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
and all the enemies of Gods grace ſhrouding themſelves under the praiſe of
nature, but it is rare to ſee thoſe that do not onely theoretically believe it,
but practically walk with broken and contrite hearts under it. Examine then
thy ſelf, Doeſt thou believe this is Gods Truth, that thou cameſt into the
world all over polluted? Doeſt thou think that thou as well as any other,
though never ſo civil and unblameable in reſpect of actual ſinnes, art by
nature a child of the Devil, prepared fuel for the eternal flames of Hell?
And doeſt thou not onely believe this to be thy particular caſe, but withall
thou art ſo affected with an holy fear and trembling, thou haſt no quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

more than others, and ſo in ſome places. But there was never any generation,
wherein impiety did not cover the earth, as the waters do the Sea: Inſomuch
that if we ſhould with zeal undertake to reprove them according to their deſert,

<hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Othuſius</hi> complaineth, <q>That ſince Chriſt's time, there

have overcome Chriſt, becauſe of the wickedneſs abounding, and that among
thoſe who profeſs themſelves the ſalt and light of the world.</q> Now how were
it poſſible, that the whole world ſhould thus lie in wickedneſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19 as
the Apoſtle affirmeth, but that all mankind by nature is like ſo many Serpents
and Toads, of which there is none without poiſon? If this wickedneſs did abound
only in ſome places, we might blame the Clymate, the Countrey, or their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but it is in all places under the <hi>Equator,</hi> as well as the <hi>Tropick;</hi> in all

whereas you might ſay, The world is in its old age now, and the continual habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
cuſtomary wayes of wickedneſs have made us drink the dregs of impiety,
yet the Scripture telleth us, That not long after the Creation of the world, when
we might judge greater innocency and freedom from ſinne to have been every
where, yet then <hi>all fleſh had corrupted their wayes,</hi> Gen. 6. 12. which provoked
God to bring that wonderfull and extraordinary judgement of drowning it with
water, as if it were become like a noiſom dunghill that was to be cleanſed. And
leſt you ſhould think this was only becauſe of their actual impieties, we ſee God
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57719:103"/>
himſelf, charging it upon this, becauſe <hi>the imaginations of a mans heart were only
evil, and that from his youth up:</hi> So that there is no man who conſiders the
wayes and manners of all the inhabitants of the world, but muſt conclude, had
there not been poiſonous fountains within, there had never been ſuch poiſoned
ſtreams. The <hi>warres,</hi> the <hi>rapines,</hi> the <hi>uncleanneſſes,</hi> and all the <hi>horrid tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions</hi>
that have filled the earth, as the vermine did <hi>Aegypt,</hi> do plainly declare,
That all men have hearts full of evil; And leſt you might think this deluge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
is only in the <hi>Heatheniſh, Paganiſh</hi> and <hi>bruitiſh</hi> part of the world. The

the light of the Word, <hi>That there was none righteous, that there was none that

do the actual impieries that fill all Cities, Towns and Villages diſcover, that all are

                        <p>SEcondly, This original ſinne may be proved by reaſon, yea and experience
thus, <hi>If you conſider all the miſeries, troubles and vexations man is ſubject
unto, and at laſt death it ſelf;</hi> and that not only men grown up, who have actual
ſinnes, but even new born Infants, will not this plainly inform us, That all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hath ſinned, and is caſt out of the favour of God: How can it enter into
any mans heart to think, that God the wiſe Creator, ſo full of goodneſs to man,
that he made him <hi>little lower than Angels,</hi> ſhould yet make him more miſerable
than all creatures? It was <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> his complaint, when he lay a dying,
<q>That man had ſuch a ſhort time of life prefixed him, who yet could have been
ſerviceable, and by long age and experience found out many obſervable uſefull
things, when Crows and Harts, and other creatures of no conſideration have
a long life vouchſafed to them:</q> Yea, all the Heathens, even the moſt learned
of them, complained much concerning this Theme of mans miſery, being never
able to ſatisfie themſelves in the cauſe of it; But now by the Scripture we ſee it's
no wonder, the race of mankind is thus adjudged to all miſery, ſeeing it's all
guilty of ſinne before God; ſo that if there had been no actual ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ſonnes of men, yet the ground would have been curſed to bring forth
bryers and thorns, man would have been miſerable and mortal: So that this doth
not onely teach us, there is ſuch a ſin, but that it was ſo hainous and abominable

according to his nature rightly conſidered, and withall doth miſerably fall ſhort of that

ſpeak thus, but to ſhew that beaſts do in their kind ſurpaſs man in his kind? Every
wicked man is called a <hi>fool,</hi> and a <hi>ſimple one,</hi> becauſe when he ſinneth, he goeth
againſt the dictates of true reaſon, and this is the condition of all men till regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by grace, they do not conſider what God made them for, or why they have
immortal and rational ſoules. Take the <hi>Drunkard,</hi> is not he worſe then a beaſt?
doth the beaſt drink any more then will ſuffice nature? inſomuch that we may
truly ſay all by nature are become ſpiritual monſters, for as a monſter in nature
is, when nature is deficient or redundant in her operations, and ſo worketh not
regularly: Thus alſo when a man doth not keep the rules of reaſon, and live as
one who hath a rational ſoul, he becomes like a monſter, and ſo ought to abhor
himſelf: Oh then loath thy ſelf and ſay, every creature liveth like its kind! The
horſe doth as an horſe ſhould do, the ox as the ox ſhould do, but I miſerable and
wretched ſinner do nothing that a man ſhould do! Again, The beaſts, and ſo all
creatures, although they are ſubject to vanity, and groan under a curſe, becauſe of
mans ſin, yet they do not fall ſhort of the end, they were intended for. God he made
man to ſerve him, and all the creaturs to ſerve man, and thus they do ſtill, though
a great part of this dominion man bath by his ſin juſtly deprived himſelf of, yet the
Sun giveth light to him; The earth brings forth her fruit for him, ſome living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are daily ſlain for his food and cloathing; what ſhoals of fiſh, and flocks of
birds do at ſome ſeaſons of the year preſent themſelves, as if they ſhould ſay, here
we appear to ſerve you; and this is the utmoſt perfection they were made for. But
come to man, he was made to ſerve the Lord, therefore did God furniſh him with all
theſe mercies, that he might the more willingly and diligently obey him, but inſtead
of God, he ſerveth Gods enemies, he ſerves <hi>ſin in the Inſts thereof,</hi> he ſerveth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57719:104"/>
in his deſires: Thus of all the creatures God made next to the devils, man is in
the moſt bitter and undone eſtate: So that this muſt needs ſtop thy mouth againſt
all cavils, if there be no original ſin, Why is man worſt in his kind than any other
creature in their kind? Yea, ſee the moſt ſavage beaſts agree well enough with one
another, one Wolf with another, one Tyger with another, yet one man is a Wolf

though he marry, though he buy and ſell, and uſe this world, yet he ought not in the

                        <p>THe work remaining is, to give further reaſons (the Scripture being firſt
laid as a foundation) to demonſtrate this truth, <hi>That we are by nature
originally defiled;</hi> For though man be unwilling to be found thus a ſinner, and
the entertaining of this truth ſeemeth to ſtrike down all the hopes and comforts
that a naturall man hath. Believe this, and all men, (as in reſpect of defect)
<hi>are ſo many damned men,</hi> ſo that fleſh and blood muſt needs deny, cavill, diſtinguiſh,
and turn it ſelf into a thouſand ſhapes ere it will acknowledge it, yet look we
into our ſelves diligently, and compare our ſelves with the glaſs of Gods Word,
we cannot but ſay, That all we have heard by the Miniſters, all that Sermons
and Books tell us, come not up to what we feel in our ſelves; So that as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
when he ſaid, <hi>This corruption ſhall put on incorruption,</hi> he did <hi>cutem tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi>
did lay his hand upon his body, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> thought, ſo do thou ſtrike
upon thy thigh, and ſmite upon thy breaſt, and ſay, within this body, lieth a
ſoul covered all over with ſinne, and damnable guilt. To aſſure us more herein,
theſe further diſcoveries may be added.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſpirituall death in ſinne, which we are all plunged into, whereby we
do become altogether ſenſeleſs and ſtupid, as to any ſpirituall concernement.</hi> The
death threatned upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s trangreſſion was <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> as well as corporall,
and therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. We are ſaid to <hi>be dead in ſinnes</hi> till Chriſt quicken us by
his power; Now this is a full diſcovery that we have loſt Gods Image, and all
ſpiritual life, otherwiſe why ſhould not ſpirituall life be as quick, active, and
moving towards ſpirituall objects, as our naturall and corporall life is to corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things, Why is it, that when any do threaten corporall death and outward
miſery we are afraid, and will give all we have for this corporall life? But when
the Devil tempts, and the world tempts, ſo that we are in danger of looſing
eternal life, we have no trembling or horror taking hold upon us. <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
made a law, that whoſoever would not worſhip his Image, ſhould be
caſt into a fiery furnace, and unleſs the three Worthies, none refuſed; ſo great
a matter is the fear of a naturall death. But hath not God threatned <hi>hell</hi> which
is ten thouſand times more dreadfull then that fiery fornace, to every one that
goeth on wickedly? yet none trembleth becauſe of this; Is not this plain then,
that thou art <hi>a dead man in ſinne?</hi> Further, concerning our corporall life, how
ſollicitous are we about the preſerving of it? what carking and caring for meat
and raiment? what labour for the back and the belly? Is not the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in the world for theſe two things, and all this is that our frail periſhing
life may yet be continued? But do men naturally manifeſt any ſuch thoughts and
diligence about the meanes of a ſpirituall life? The preaching of the Word, the
Ordinances, theſe God hath appointed to be ſpirituall food, by theſe our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
life is maintained; theſe are the oyl, to keep that lamp burning: But do
not all men by nature loath theſe? are they not a burden to them? do they ever
pant and thirſt or hunger after theſe things, as men do for meat or drink? now,
why is all this, but becauſe we have no ſpirituall life in us? So that if you do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the inſenſibleneſs and ſtupidity of every naturall man, as to things of an
heavenly aſpect, you need no more to perſwade you, that Gods Image is loſt,
and we are dead in ſinne. When the body needeth food needeth raiment, all is
ſupplyed, but ſo thy ſoul needeth Chriſt, needeth grace, and there is not the leaſt
thought to have a ſupply: yea we are not only dead in ſinne, but have been a
long while thus dead, and if ſhe ſaid of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11. 39. <hi>Lord by this time
he ſtinketh, for he hath been dead four dayes.</hi> How much more may we ſay this
in a ſpirituall ſenſe of thee, who (it may be) haſt been dead fourty or fifty years.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This may be further inlarged by a conſectary from the former;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57719:105"/>
will not this abundantly declare we are all over ſinfull, <hi>Becauſe heavenly things
are not ſuch objects of delight and pleaſure to us, as carnall and worldly things are.</hi>
This is a palpable demonſtration of our wretched pollution, That we cannot feel
any ſweetneſs, any pleaſure, or joy in thoſe things which immediately concern
God: <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of integrity, was like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ladder, the foot whereof
was on the earth, but the top reached to heaven: Thus though <hi>Adam</hi>'s inferior
part the body, was exerciſed in theſe earthly things, yet his ſoul the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
part, that was fixed in heaven; But now all our ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eableneſs and communion
with heavenly objects is wholly periſhed; we have hearts inlarged with joy,
we are raviſhed with delights about wordly things, and when brought to any
thing that is heavenly, there we are weary, and neither fleſh or ſpirit is willing to
ſuch things; yet nature might reach us, that man of all creatures only hath
hands, and thoſe not to embrace the earth, but he hath feet to walk and trample
upon it. We read of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with other godly ones, when recovered
in part from the power of this originall corruption, what longings and breakings
of ſoul they had after God, and his Ordinances. Theſe things were accounted
for <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> above the <hi>hony;</hi> and for <hi>preſciouſneſs</hi> above <hi>gold;</hi> now why ſhould
not every man be able to ſay ſo as well as they? but becauſe our taſts are wholly
diſtempered, and we are carnall not ſpirituall. Certainly ſpirituall objects have
in themſelves infinite more matter of joy and delight, then any earthly thing can
have; who can think there is more ſweetneſs in a drop, then in the ocean?
more light in the ſtarre, then in the ſun? The creature is leſs then theſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of God: May not than even blind men ſee, that we are all over-plunged
into ſinne? elſe, why ſhould not God and heavenly objects, which do ſo farre
ſurpaſs in matter of true delight be more ſweet and welcome to us, then all the
creatures of the world though put together? <hi>Pſal. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Many ſay, who will ſhew
us any good?</hi> The naturall man finds no delight but in theſe earthly things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely
to God. There is a <hi>She<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ll</hi> in his ſoul, that is alwaies craving and asking,
never ſatisfied; now, why can they not with <hi>David</hi> as well put forth the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
petition, <hi>Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us?</hi> But becauſe the
carnall man finds no more pleaſure in ſpirituall things, then the ſwine doth in
pearles or pleaſant flowres: A man that is ſpirituall having drunk of this water,
deſireth no other; As the Philoſophers ſay, The matter of the heavens is ſo fully
actuated by the heavenly formes, that it deſireth no other, whereas the matter
of theſe ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>unary things is never ſatisfied but though under one forme, yet it
ſtill deſireth another. Thus the ſoul poſſeſſed of God and Chriſt, hath ſo much
delight and pleaſure that it hath enough, it deſireth no change, but the naturall
man is carried out from one thing to another, from one object to another, firſt
delighting in this, and then in that, it being impoſſible that <hi>Zacheus</hi> his ſhoe
ſhould ſit <hi>Goliah</hi>'s foot: Thus you ſee that though a man be reſtleſs in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
yet he can take pleaſure in earthly things, whereas he finds no ſweetneſs,
no delight in heavenly things, that are infinitely more precious; So this may
demonſtrate the loſs of Gods Image, and our ſervice to originall ſinne in the
luſts thereof.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, That we are thus originally corrupted, appeareth, <hi>in that utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
and inability to do any ſpirituall good: we are not able ſo much as to think
a thought,</hi> or ſend forth an hearty groan, as to our eternall welfare; whereas
at firſt God made <hi>Adam</hi> right, and thereby endowed him with power to do any
thing that was holy, called therefore the Image of God; ſo happy and bleſſed
was his condition, that he could with delight and joy fullfill the Law of God,
feeling no difficulty, nor impediment, but now being dead in ſinne, we are no
more able then dead men to move, or walk in holy things. The Scripture is
wonderfully clear in this, though <hi>Papiſts, Arminians</hi> and others have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to raiſe a miſt, and obſcure the ſun beames, <hi>Joh. 15. Without me ye can
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57719:106"/>
do nothing.</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>The fleſh is eumity againſt God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. <hi>The naturall man
perceiveth not the things of God, neither can he,</hi> where both the act of doing
good, and the power alſo is denied to every man by nature: If therefore every
man by nature be dead in ſinne like a ſtone, as in reſpect of any holy impreſſion
from God, if he have blind eies, deaf eares, a fooliſh heart, as to any heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing, doth not this plainly tell us, that we are all over polluted? It's good
for our humiliation to conſider how the Scripture deſcribeth a naturall man, as
wanting all his ſenſes, he hath no eies to ſee, no eares to hear, no heart to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
but is wholly dead, and all this is to ſhew what a wonderfull impotency
is in man to help himſelf ſpiritually; Now this declareth the neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
this doctrine of originall corruption clean and ſound; for if we be ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
here, <hi>then alſo we ſhall hold the truth of God againſt foe will and the power of
nature in divine things;</hi> for theſe two particulars are like <hi>Caſtor and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi>
they alwaies appear together; and what is the deſign or <hi>Secinians, Papiſts,
and Arminians,</hi> either in whole or in part, to deny or extenuate originall ſinne?
but thereby to make a way to advance their magnificent <hi>Diana.</hi> their <hi>free will</hi> to
holy things, for they evidently ſee, if originall ſinne be ſuch an univerſall, deep
and inward pollution of the whole ſoul, even the will as well as other parts,
then their doctrine of the <hi>power of nature</hi> is pulled up by the very root; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more fully aſſure your ſouls of this truth, by how much <hi>the whole body
of Divinity depends upon this foundation.</hi> Indeed the Scripture is ſo clear in deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
man as to ſupernaturalls, and giving all to the grace of God, that we may
wonder how this pride ſhould ſettle it ſelf in mans heart, and that he doth not
tremble to ſpeak or write any thing, whereby the grace of God may be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and man exalted; he that cannot make a white hair black, he that cannot
adde one cubit to his ſtature, will yet think to make a polluted ſoul holy, and
adde many cubits of grace to his ſpirituall ſtature.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Our original corruption will yet further appear, <hi>If you take
notice of that univerſall ignorance and dullneſſe that is upon a mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
knowing no ſaving thing about God or Chriſt, if it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed:</hi>
Inſomuch that the neceſſity of Scripture-light, of revealed-light to
conduct us to heaven, doth without contradiction, prove that by nature; we
are (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) <hi>Epheſ. 4, darkeneſs,</hi> even darkneſs it ſelf; Look over the
generation of mankind, that are the wiſeſt and moſt learned, where the light of
Gods word hath not ſhore upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. The Apoſtle there informeth
us, that the doctrine of the Goſpel was <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to them, that <hi>profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be wiſe they became fooliſh in their imaginations,</hi> what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Pleto</hi>
could ever by naturall reaſon underſtand any thing of Chriſt? If then we lay this
for a ſure foundation, (though ſome would abſurdly queſtion it) That without
the knowledge of Chriſt and faith in him, none can be ſaved; And that none by
nature can come to this knowledge, then it followeth undeniably, that damnable
ignorance doth cover the face of our ſouls, as darkneſs did the deep at firſt,
That there is a very <hi>Chaos</hi> in our ſouls: Oh then that we had knowledge to
know our ignorance! Oh that the dark dungeon we are ſhut up in might not be
ſo pleaſing to us! In that the Goſpel is called a <hi>myſtery;</hi> In that <hi>fleſh and blood
doth not reveal the things of Chriſt to us,</hi> this ſheweth our wretched eſtate in ſin;
<hi>Adam</hi> had knowledge about the meanes rending to everlaſting happineſs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
God would have made him imperfect; but now we are ignorant of Chriſt
the way: All that live in the Church, had it not been for revealed light, would
have groped in darkneſs, as we ſee all <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> do: If therefore
you would ſee, what our natures are of themſelves, conſider the <hi>Sanages,</hi> the
<hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Pagans</hi> of the world, who as to any right knowledge of God have
little more then bruit beaſts; we cannot ſo well ſee what mans nature is of it ſelf,
who live in the Church, becauſe there is the light of the Goſpel, and many times
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57719:106"/>
godly education, and Chriſtian inſtitution of us while young doth reſtrain ſinne,
otherwiſe if there were not this <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>watering</hi> of us, we ſhould not know
any more about Chriſt, then the moſt rude <hi>Barbarian</hi> that is; Take off then
thoſe ornaments, thoſe ſupernaturall additaments that God hath put upon us,
who live under the Goſpel, and then our nakedneſs and deformity will plainly
appear.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>The wofull captivity and bondage we are in to Satan by nature, doth
alſo manifeſt our originall defilement;</hi> For were we not caſt off by God, did not
ſinne make us like hell, why could ſo many legious of Devils dwell in us?
<hi>Eph 2, The prince of darkneſs, the god of this world,</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to rule in the hearts
of the diſobedient,</hi> and ſuch we are <hi>all</hi> by nature; yea, we are, till regenerated in
the <hi>ſnares</hi> of the Devil, and <hi>taken captive at his will.</hi> Therefore when Chriſt
ſent his Diſciples to preach, he ſaid, <hi>He ſaw Satan fall like lightning from heaven:</hi>
Thus the Devil hath his throne in all mens hearts, till Chriſt who is ſtronger caſt
him out. It is trne, by wicked and ungodly cuſtomes in ſinne, The Devil taketh
further poſſeſſion, as we ſee in <hi>Ananias,</hi> and in <hi>Judas,</hi> The Devil is ſaid <hi>to enter
into him after the eating of the ſop,</hi> not but that he was before in him, only he had
more power and ſtrength over him; Thus he doth poſſeſs the ſouls of all that
are born till regenerated, and by frequent actings of ſinne, he ſetleth his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
more firmely.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, This may fully diſcover our originall pollution, <hi>In that even in reſpect
of naturall things, we are much weakened and debilitated; our underſtandings are
not able to find out even naturall truths;</hi> Inſomuch that there was a famous ſect
of the <hi>Academicks,</hi> who held, That <hi>nihil ſcitur,</hi> we know <hi>nothing</hi> at all. Even
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who is prophanely made to be by ſome, the ſame in naturalls, which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> was in ſupernaturall; yea <hi>Scaliger</hi> calls him, <hi>Vltimus Muſarum conatus,</hi>
as if nature her ſelf could not ſend forth a greater Artiſt, yet his known ſaying (That
our underſtandings in reſpect of the <hi>celeſtiall bodies eſpecially,</hi> are but <hi>noctuae ad
ſolem,</hi> owles to the Sunne,) makes it appear, that we are ignorant of more
things, then we know: yea, and which is greatly to be bewailed, The more
learning and parts men have had, they have been more miſchiefed by them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that meer Ideots, and naturall fooles, have been leſs wicked then they:
ſo that humane abilities, when poliſhed by arts, have been like wine to a feavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
man, like a ſword in a mad mans hand: neither did God ever chooſe many
of the wiſe men of the world, <hi>Auſtin</hi> being filled with humane eloquence, this was
a great prejudice to him in imbracing Chriſtianity; he contemned the ſimplicity
of the Scripture, <hi>dedignabar eſſe parvulus,</hi> as he confeſſed: And <hi>Scotus,</hi> who
for his acute underſtanding, was called, <hi>Doctor ſubtilis,</hi> yet the great Hiſtorian
<hi>Jovius,</hi> giveth this cenſure of him, That he was <hi>ad ludibrium Theologiae natus,</hi>
born to make Religion a ſcorn and a reproach, becauſe he could diſpute every
point, probably on all ſides, And memorable is that of profound <hi>Bradwardine,</hi>
who before he was cordially affected with the grace of God, confeſſeth, That
when he heard <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles read, he did diſpiſe them, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> had not
<hi>metaphiſicum ingenium,</hi> a metaphyſicall head. Thus you ſee that even thoſe
poor abilities that with much labour are attained, make us the worſe for them.</p>

to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who either doubted of, or denied the Reſurrection, but
did not wholly abandon the Chriſtian Faith, this reaſon would be very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
So that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> either doubt or infidelity in this Point, hath
made this Doctrine the more unqueſtionably true, ſo that doubts and hereſies
have been over-ruled by God, to make Truth more orient, like the file to
ruſty iron, and like the ſhaking of the Tree, which maketh the root faſter and
deeper.</p>
                        <p>But whereas the Doubt may be, Wherein lieth the ſtrength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Chriſt is riſen, therefore his members, or all that are his ſhall riſe
(For you muſt know the Apoſtle's Arguments doe principally prove the
bleſſed and happy Reſurrection of the Juſt, the Wicked they ſhall riſe, but
by the power of Chriſt, as a Judge, not as members united to him their
Head.) At the twentieth verſe he giveth us a two-fold reaſon of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt is the firſt-fruits;</hi> now the firſt fruits ſanctified the whole
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57719:107"/>
crop of Corn, and although they were taken before the reſt, yet this did
aſſure, that all would be taken in its time: Thus Chriſt being the firſt
fruits did ſanctifie all his people, and his Reſurrection was an aſſured pledge
of theirs.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Reaſon (which is pertinent to my matter in hand) is from
the Collation between <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt; As <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>common root</hi>
and <hi>principle</hi> of death to all that come from him, ſo is Chriſt the <hi>common
Head</hi> of Salvation and Life to all who are of him. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
maketh ſuch a Compariſon between <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, as <hi>two common
Principles and Heads,</hi> but to another purpoſe, there it is in reſpect of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
death, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Sinne by one, and Righteouſneſſe by the other; but
here it is principally in reſpect of temporal Death, and Reſurrection by
Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Apoſtle having thus cleared this Truth, he then enters into a ſecond
Debate,</hi> (viz.) <hi>In what bodies we ſhall riſe? and determining, That it</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a corruptible body, but it ſhall be raiſed an incorruptible one; <hi>It</hi> dieth a
natural body, but it ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual.</p>
                        <p>Laſt this Diſtinction of a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual body</hi> ſhould ſeem uncouth,
and very abſurd, he aſſerteth and confirmeth it by Scripture; And here
again in the ſecond place, he taketh up a Collation between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>
and the ſecond; and therein we have them compared,</p>
                        <p>1. In regard of their <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. In reſpect of their <hi>Originals.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>3. In reſpect of their <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Properties.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>This illuſtration the Apoſtle is large in, becauſe the ſtrength of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lieth in this,</hi> Such as the Principles are, ſuch are the Effects; Such as
the Root is, ſuch are the Branches: Now all men have from <hi>Adam</hi> earthly mortal
bodies which will die: Therefore all that are Chriſts ſhall have from him heavenly
and ſpiritual bodies.</p>
                        <p>Let us diligently open the particulars, wherein we have this Collation between
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> made, for from hence we ſhall have a fair occaſion to examine,
<hi>How from</hi> Adam <hi>we come thus to have his Image upon us?</hi> which is the great
difficulty in the Doctrine of original ſinne.</p>

                        <head>SECT. II.</head>
                        <p>THe firſt particular therefore wherein they are compared, is, <hi>The ſtate and
condition Adam and Chriſt was made in; Adam</hi>'s eſtate is proved from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>ver. 5. As it is written, The firſt man Adam was made a living ſoul;</hi> we
have this related, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. where God is ſaid, <hi>To breath into mans noſtrils the
breath of life, and man became a living ſoul. Adam</hi>'s body being made out of
the duſt, and formed thencefrom, was yet without life and motion, therefore
God did with him farre otherwiſe than with bruit beaſts, for <hi>He breathed into
him the breath of life.</hi> This is ſpoken after the manner of men in a figurative
way, we are not to think God took on him the form of a man, and ſo breathed
life into <hi>Adam;</hi> Neither may we ſay, This was a particle, or part of the divine
Eſſence, which God communicated to man; But the meaning is, God inſpired
into him his ſoul, which gave life, and ſenſe, and motion to the body, by which
he becoming a living ſoul, that is, a living creature; This is <hi>Adam</hi>'s condition.
But as for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is here called the <hi>laſt Adam, Adam</hi> becauſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Perſon, and <hi>laſt,</hi> becauſe there is no more to ſucceed him; This <hi>laſt
Adam</hi> is ſaid, <hi>To be made a quickening Spirit,</hi> not but that Chriſt was man,
yea and had ſuch an humane Nature, as <hi>Adam</hi> had like to him in all things,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57719:108"/>
                           <hi>[Sinne onely excepted]</hi> But this is ſpoken of Chriſt principally after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
For Chriſt while he lived on earth had an animal body, he needed
food and reſt, but after his Reſurrection, then he had a ſpiritual body; ſo that
it is in reference to this, that Chriſt is called a <hi>Spirit,</hi> but with this Epithete,
<hi>A quickning Spirit,</hi> that is, which giveth life to others; He hath not only life
in himſelf, but he giveth it alſo to others, and therefore no wonder if he raiſe
thoſe that belong to him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But ſeeing Chriſt is thus a</hi> quickening Spirit, <hi>it may be ſaid,</hi> Why then have
the people of God their natural bodies ſtill? <hi>If they be in the ſecond</hi> Adam, Why
are they not as he is?</p>
                        <p>To this the Apoſtle anſwereth, <hi>verſe 46. That which is natural is firſt,
and afterwards that which is ſpiritual.</hi> It is the will and appointment of
God, that the imperfect things ſhould be firſt, and afterwards that which is
more perfect.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, The Compariſon is made between the two <hi>Adams</hi> in
reſpect of their <hi>Originals,</hi> The <hi>firſt was of the earth, earthly,</hi> his body was
made of the duſt of the earth: (The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had ſome confuſed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this, and therefore defined man to be, <hi>Animal terrenum è limo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
Hence in their Feaſts, they offered unto their gods an herb that grew
in their lakes, to ſignifie what man was.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi> This place hath an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of ſome difficulty, for from this Text did ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
an old Hereſie, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <q>That Chriſt had not his body of the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi>) indeavour to prove, That Chriſt had his body from Heaven, elſe
(ſay they) what oppoſition could there be made to <hi>Adam</hi>'s body?</q> Chriſts
body was in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but not of her, as they affirm, But this is groſly
to miſtake; For the Apoſtle doth not intend to make a compariſon in the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,</hi>
of which both bodies were compounded, but the <hi>Originals</hi> from whence
they are; The one is from <hi>Earth,</hi> the other from <hi>Heaven,</hi> being the Lord of
Heaven and Earth. Some indeed have ſaid, <q>That Chriſt is therefore ſaid to be
from <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe though it was <hi>materially</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Conception</hi> was in an <hi>extraordinary manner</hi> by the holy Ghoſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it might be ſaid to be from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                           </q> This may have ſome truth, yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was in an extraordinary manner, and that in reſpect of his body formed by
God, called therefore <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> yet he cannot be ſaid to be from Heaven,
So that the moſt ſolid Interpretation is to underſtand it of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt,
and ſo he is <hi>wholly of Heaven,</hi> being <hi>the true and eternal God;</hi> in which reſpect,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 13. he is ſaid to be <hi>The Sonne of man, which is in Heaven.</hi> John 6 38,
41. he is ſaid, <hi>To come from Heaven;</hi> So that although his body was of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yet as <hi>God,</hi> in which reſpect he hath his perſonality, ſo he is from
Heaven</p>
                        <p>The third and laſt Collation is in reſpect of their qualities and properties. The
<hi>firſt man is of the earth earthy,</hi> in a three fold reſpect:</p>
                        <p>1. Becauſe his affections are only to earthly things.</p>
                        <p>2. Becauſe the place where he is to be is the earth.</p>
                        <p>3. Becauſe of his mortality, he is to return to duſt again.</p>
                        <p>But the 'ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is heavenly in a three-fold contrary reſpect:</p>
                        <p>1. He is heavenly in regard of his <hi>life</hi> and converſation.</p>
                        <p>2. In regard of the <hi>place</hi> where now he is ſitting in Heaven at the right hand of
God, and thus all Chriſts members ſhall be heavenly, for they likewiſe ſhall be in
Heaven for ever with the Lord.</p>
                        <p>3. Heavenly, Becauſe of his <hi>immortality,</hi> for he ſhall never die more.</p>

                        <p>THus we have the Apoſtles elegant oppoſition between the firſt and ſecond
<hi>Adam,</hi> and my Text is a Concluſion from the former Diſcourſe. Some
have read the words <hi>preceptively,</hi> as if the ſenſe were, <hi>As we have born the
Image of the firſt</hi> Adam, <hi>ſo let us bear the Image of the heavenly;</hi> But the moſt
ſolid Interpreters read it <hi>affirmatively,</hi> as in the Text we render it; and this
ſeemeth to be more conſonant, becauſe the Apoſtle is ſtill in the Didactical and
Doctrinal point about our Reſurrection; The particle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is for <hi>the,</hi> and <hi>ſo,</hi> better
tranſlated illatively, <hi>Therefore.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Text then affirmeth two things:</p>
                        <p>1. That all bear the Image of <hi>Adam</hi> who came from him.</p>
                        <p>2. Thoſe who are of Chriſt ſhall bear his Image.</p>
                        <p>Having therefore treated of original ſin, the <hi>Quod ſit</hi> and the <hi>Quid ſit,</hi> we come
to that which is deſervedly thought the moſt difficult and hard to conceive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
in this point, <hi>Which is the manner of propagating it,</hi> and this ſhal be ſoberly and
modeſtly diſcuſſed out of theſe words. For from the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Auſtin</hi> takes an
occaſion to diſpute (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> relateth) about the <hi>ſouls traduction</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi>
as well as the body. Although to ſpeak the truth, that which is principally and
apparently affirmed by the Apoſtle here, is, <hi>That we have mortal bodies propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us from Adam,</hi> which is eaſier to conceive of, then to have alſo ſinfull ſouls
from him, yet becauſe the Text ſpeaketh of <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Image</hi> in us, and that doth
neceſſarilly <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> a ſinfull ſoul, as well as a mortal body. We ſhall therefore
declare the truth as of them conjoyned together. Obſerve</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That all who come of</hi> Adam <hi>do thereby bear his Image: Our natural deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from him, maketh us to be wholly like him; when he was corrupted.</hi> That
as thoſe who are of Chriſt are renewed after his Image in righteouſneſs and true
holineſs, ſo all of <hi>Adam</hi> are corrupted in ſin and ungodlineſs.</p>

                        <p>WHat this Image is, you have heard already at large, our main work is to
examine, <hi>How we come to be made partakers of it?</hi> Yet it is good ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
to ſay ſomething of this Image of <hi>Adams</hi> we all bear about with us.
And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Man who was not only made after the Image of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. but is
ſaid abſolutely to be the Image of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. by his apoſtaſie became
not only like the beaſts that periſh, but alſo like the Devils that are damned. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that now this glorious Image of God being defaced: If you ask, Whoſe
Image and Superſcription he beareth? We anſwer of corrupted ſinfull and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>Adam,</hi> an Image we are to be aſhamed of, and to mourn under all the dayes
of our life; Who can look upon man, but may behold ſinne and miſery, folly and
mortality? Now this Image of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> comprehended the things of the
ſoul and the body. In the body we have pains, diſeaſes, and a neceſſity, of death
at laſt; In the ſoul there is horrible blackneſs and confuſion upon it, that as devils
are repreſented in the moſt horrid and black manner that can be, ſuch things are
our ſouls now become. Although therefore the Text ſpeaketh of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Image
in the bodily part, that we are thereby corruptible and mortal, and ſo need a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
to make us happy, yet I ſhall chiefly ſpeak of this Image in the ſoul,
as it is infected and polluted with ſinne from him. This is the Image we bear, but
there is exceeding great comfort to the godly, that they being in Chriſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam,</hi> they ſhall be made perfectly conformable to him, they ſhall bear
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57719:109"/>
that heavenly Image, and at laſt ſhall have no cauſe to complain, that their ſouls
are bowed down with ſinfull, earthly and heavy affections, weighing us down to
the ground; were it not for hope of this at our Reſurrection, the Doctrine
about <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, and our hurt thereby would utterly diſcourage us; but there
is a ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> as well as a firſt, if he had been the firſt and laſt too, that no
<hi>Adam</hi> would have anſwered him in the way of righteouſneſs and life, as he was
in the way of ſinne and death; nothing but horrour and damnation could have
taken hold of us; Let us be more deeply affected with the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo ſhall
we come more highly to prize and eſteem the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Adam<hi>'s Image as it is ſinfull in the general, is not only born by us, but
there ſeemeth to be a ſtamp and impreſſion upon us of thoſe very ſins he committed.</hi> As
thoſe women who have inordinate deſire after ſome things, do ſometimes leave
marks and impreſſions thereof upon the body: Thus it is ſpiritually. Thoſe very
ſins which <hi>Adam</hi> particularly committed in eating the forbidden fruit, all men ſeem
moſt univerſally to incline unto. As</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>A curioſity and affectation of knowing that which is not to be known.</hi> An inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
deſire was in <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of the Tree of knowledge, becauſe the Devil
told her, <hi>It would make her wiſe,</hi> therefore ſhe muſt eat of it; And is not this a
very natural ſinne in all, a curioſity in knowledge? Do not all deſire to eat of the
Tree of knowledge, but few of the Tree of life, eſpecially Scholars, and ſuch
who are buſied in learning? What an incurable itch is there to be wiſe above Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and to know ſuch things God hath hidden? And this is a good Item to us
to content our ſelves with ſobriety, in queſtioning, How <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne can be
ours? How the ſoul can come to be polluted? To deſire to know this, is like the
eating of the forbidden fruit: While thou art thus curious, remember <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſinne, that thou art acting it, while thou enquireſt, how we are guilty of it?</p>
                        <p>A ſecond thing remarkable in the firſt ſinne was <hi>Their mincing about the word
of God,</hi> yea <hi>plainly lying,</hi> that God had ſaid, they ſhould not touch it, which,
though ſome ſay, is put for eating; Others, that <hi>Eve</hi> did ſay ſo for caution ſake;
Whence <hi>Ambroſe</hi> hath a good ſaying, <hi>Nihil quod bonum videtur,</hi> &amp;c. we muſt adde
nothing to Gods precept, though it ſeem very good, and make much for godlineſs;
yet others make <hi>Eve</hi> plainly to <hi>lie,</hi> and ſo to accuſe God, as if he envied them
further knowledge; Now this ſinne of <hi>lying,</hi> how natural is it? We ſee it in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
before they can move their feet to go, their tongues can ſtir to lie, as if
they had been taught, they are ſo ſubtil in it.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Adam</hi> did excuſe and cover his ſinne as much as may be, putting it off from
himſelf to others, and herein alſo we have a natural reſemblance of him, for how
prone are we to clear our ſelves, to lay the fault any where, rather than on our
ſelves? Thus we bear <hi>Adam</hi>'s Image.</p>

ſoul is created, then ſeeing God cannot but make every thing holy, he cannot make
a ſinfull ſoul, how then can it be infected with ſinne? Again, if the ſoul be created,
then it was not virtually in Adam, then it could not be ſaid to ſinne in him, becauſe
it was never in him, for why did not Chriſt ſinne in him, but becauſe he was not
ſeminally in him, and if the ſoul was never radically in Adam, how can it be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
is it juſt with God to puniſh that with Adams ſinne which never ſinned in
Adam? If it be ſaid, that the ſoul when united to the body, doth from that receive
infection, as if pure liquour were powred into a ſtinking veſſel, This will not ſolve
but increaſe the doubt, for a veſſel indeed may pollute liquour. becauſe they are both
bodies and ſo act by a corporall contact, but the ſoul is a ſpirit, and its a rule (ſay
they) received by all, that a body cannot act upon a ſpirit, Beſides, ſinne is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the ſoul, and muſt from that be conveyed to the body: The body, whie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                              <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi>'s opinion</note> There are and have been ſome in the Church following <hi>Origen,</hi> who
alſo followed <hi>Plato,</hi> deriving many opinions from him, who did thus think to
make this truth eaſy, <hi>By holding that the ſouls were created long before the bodies,
and that upon their evill, and ſinne committed, they were adjudged to be put into
bodies,</hi> and ſo from hence it is, that they ſay, <hi>man is ſo propenſe to all evill;</hi>
Therefore they will not ſay, That the ſouls of men are either by <hi>traduction,</hi> or
<hi>immediate creation</hi> and <hi>infuſion</hi> into the body, but that they were created long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57719:110"/>
the body, and while preexiſtent before it, they deſerved to be put into this
dark priſon of the body, There was one <hi>Vincentius Victor,</hi> according to his name,
bold and audacious, who diſliked <hi>Auſtin</hi> for his cunctation and deliberation in
the point of the traduction of the ſoul, which occaſioned <hi>Auſtin</hi> to write four
Books <hi>De origine animae,</hi> Now this <hi>Vincentius</hi> he affirmed, <hi>That the ſoul was
created before the body, and did deſerve to be made part of that man, who is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
yea that it did deſerve to be made peccatrix a ſinner.</hi> Some have alſo thought,
that this was a general received opinion amongſt the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and they proove
it from that queſtion propoſed to Chriſt,<note place="margin">The Jews.</note> concerning the man born blind, yea
they were Chriſts Diſciples that did make that queſtion; ſo that it ſeemeth they
were ſtill infected with that vulgar error, for Joh. 92, <hi>They ſay, Maſter, who
did ſinne, this man, or his parents, that he ſhould be born blind?</hi> They ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſinnes of the mans parents, or his own ſinnes made him to be born blind,
<hi>now he could not have any ſinnes before he was born, unleſs his ſoul did preexiſt before
his body, and it ſeemeth the Phariſees concluded, that they were his own ſinnes,
for they ſay</hi> ver. 34. <hi>Thou waſt altogether born in ſinnes.</hi> They did not (happily)
mean <hi>original ſinne,</hi> for they ſay <hi>ſinnes,</hi> which muſt be <hi>actual ſinnes,</hi> either his
own, or his parents.</p>
                        <p>But this opinion is ſo wicked and abſurd, that to name it is enough to refel it;
and for this monſtrous figment might <hi>Origen</hi> be called <hi>Centaurus,</hi> as well as for
others. Only two things are to be ſaid to it.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, If ſouls for ſinnes acted were adjudged to their bodies, how is it that
the Scripture giveth that command of, Increaſe and multiply? how is it that
children, and life are made bleſſings? certainly to be kept in a priſon, or adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto is a curſe not a bleſſing, But</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This opinion doth not at all heal the wound, that the mentioned
Objection giveth; for the doubt is <hi>how our ſouls are infected, becauſe of Adam,
if they were not cauſally in him?</hi> And this ſpeaketh to another matter, that they
ſinned before they were incarnated, and therefore have ſuch a troubleſome and
noiſome lodging.</p>
                        <p>Again this contradicts the Apoſtle, and doth indeed take away the <hi>ſubject</hi> of

                           <note place="margin">Some Papiſts.</note> That the ſoul of a man cometh into the world pure and holy without any
inherent filth of ſinne, and that till there be actual ſinnes, there is nothing in man
but what is of God, <hi>and for this they bring all the Arguments, which the</hi> Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, That they may not be <hi>anathematized</hi> as <hi>pelagianizing.</hi>
They ſay, <hi>Adams actual diſobedience is made our ſinne by imputation,</hi> ſo that they
deny any original ſinne inherent in us, only all the original ſinne we have is
<hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſinne of diſobedience, which is made ours, <hi>hence they deny that every
one hath his proper original ſinne, as if there were as many original ſinnes as perſons
born; but they ſay, Adams actual diſobedience, being made ours, is the one origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne of all mankind.</hi> Thus as one ſun ſerveth to inlighten all the ſtarres, and
as ſome Philoſophers ſay, that there is one <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
to all men, ſo they make one original ſinne to be common to all, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57719:111"/>
this only <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity is guilty of. <hi>This opinion they preſs, as hereby making
every thing eaſie and clear;</hi> Then there needeth no diſputation about the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the ſoul, or how it can be infected, if this, be true (ſay they) then here
is no occaſion for theſe intricate diſputes about the propagation of original ſinne,
To which the moſt learned are never able to give a ſatisfactory Anſwer? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this opinion of imputation doth no waies remove the doubt about the
Creation of the ſoul, for if the ſoul be by Creation, how cometh <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne
to be imputed to man born of <hi>Adam,</hi> if his ſoul was never cauſally in <hi>Adam?</hi>
ſo that the difficulty doth ſtill continue as great notwithſtanding this opinion.
But as this opinion hath ſome truth in it, ſo alſo much more error, and therefore
though it be ſweet in the mouth, yet it proveth wormewood in the belly:
The truth is this, That <hi>Adams</hi> actual ſinne is made ours by imputation; this
muſt be conſtantly affirmed, becauſe denied by thoſe, who alſo deny the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Chriſts righteouſneſs, as if thereby we were juſtified; we grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>Adams</hi> one ſinne is made all mankinds: Hence the Apoſtle doth ſtill
ſpeak of <hi>one man</hi> (though there be many immediate parents) by whom we are
not only made ſinners, but <hi>in whom alſo we did ſinne;</hi> and this doth ariſe wholly
from Gods ordination and appointment of it: for although <hi>Scoto,</hi> and others,
do call the Covenant in this reſpect, <hi>fabula,</hi> a meer fable, yet <hi>Suarez</hi> doth

they could not have been guilty of it, had not that Covenant involved them:
ſo that if the patrones of this imputation had not ſtayed here, but acknowledged
alſo an inherent pollution, they would not have been ſo juſtly cenſured. But we
have already proved by Scripture, reaſon, and experience, that mankind is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in an inherent pollution of their own, as well as guilty of imputed ſinne:
and indeed, how could man be obnoxious to eternal wrath, if there were not
damnable matter within, as well as without? can they go to hell with ſouls pure
and holy?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But if this imputation be granted, then the</hi> pelagians <hi>Objection ſeemeth to be

That as Adams ſinne could hurt thoſe that have not actually ſinned, ſo

the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> That Chriſts righteouſneſs did not profit any but believers, and
therefore Infants they were ſaved <hi>alienâ ſide by the faith of their Parents,</hi> Even
as we are condemned <hi>alieno peccato</hi> by the ſinne of another, although it be ſo <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
as that it is alſo <hi>proprium;</hi> but this is not ſatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to the <hi>Antinomian</hi> we anſwer, That although we are all ſaid to ſinne
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and his diſobedience is imputed to all, yet the <hi>condition, or the medium</hi>
by which we come to partake of this imputation, is <hi>naturall generation;</hi> and
therefore till we have an actual being, we cannot be ſaid to ſinne in him: poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
indeed we may, but natural generation (ſuppoſing Gods Covenant as
the reaſon of the conveighance of it in this way, Even as in the ſtate of integrity,
the Covenant would have been the cauſe of transmitting original righteouſneſs
to <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, though natural generation would have been the way of
communicating of it) is that only which maketh us actually to participate of his
guilt, Therefore it is a feeble thing in a late writer, (<hi>Eire</hi>) to oppoſe the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
generation or diſcent from Adam, to the Covenant, for both are requiſite,
the latter as the cauſe, the former as the medium. And thus it is in regard of
Chriſts righteouſneſs, that is the cauſe of our juſtification, in Chriſt we are made
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57719:111"/>
righteous, as in <hi>Adam</hi> ſinners, yet the <hi>medium</hi> to apply this and to make it ours,
is <hi>faith,</hi> ſo that none are juſtified till they do believe, as none are condemned
for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne till they have an actual being, faith is the ſame in a ſupernatural
way to partake of Chriſt, as natural propagation and diſcent from <hi>Adam</hi> is to
be made a ſinner in him, Although we may ſay truly that Chriſt doth profit the
<hi>non</hi>-believers, who belong to grace, for by him they are brought to believe,
they are brought out of the bondage of ſinne, only Juſtification and ſuch Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-priveledges
are actually beſtowed upon none till they do beleive, we have
not time to proceed in the diſcovery of other waies and opinions of the learned
to anſwer this doubt, only thus much we have heard, that may make us therefore
to bewail original ſinne, that we are in ſuch a dark ignorance, that we do but
<hi>grope</hi> about the propagation, had <hi>Adam</hi> continued in integrity, he would not
have only communicated righteouſneſs to his poſterity, but they would alſo have

the opinion of the traduction of the ſoul from the parents doth no way at all
either advantage, or incommodate the Doctrine of original ſinne; but that
the difficulty will ſtill be as great:</q> ſo alſo <hi>Arminius (Theſ. pri. de primo peccato.</hi>)
maketh the diſpute about the <hi>original of the ſoul,</hi> in the matter of the <hi>propagation

Objection. This opinion then, <hi>That the ſoul cometh originally from the parents;

if they do hold the generation of it from the parents; But I muſt tell you,
that thoſe, who affirm the ſoul to be from the parents, as well as the body,
differ amongſt themſelves, for ſome ſay, it is by <hi>eduction</hi> out of the matter, that
it is generated, as the body: Others, they ſay, by <hi>traduction,</hi> that the ſoul is
not corporally begotten, but the parents ſoul doth multiply the infants ſoul;
even (ſay they) as you ſee one candle doth inlighten another.</p>

ſome Texts of Scripture, to which, though they give excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet (I ſuppoſe the Truth ſtands immoveable, neither do
you think this work needleſs, for it's worth the while, if there
were no other uſe, but to informe you againſt a dangerous ſect, that are called
<hi>Mortaliſts,</hi> who hold <hi>the ſoul is nothing but the temperament of the body, and
that it is mortal,</hi> to which abominable opinion the <hi>Socinians</hi> alſo do ſtrongly
incline.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Text to prove the Creation of the ſoul, ſhall be from <hi>Eccl. 12. 7.
Then ſhall duſt returne to the earth as it was, and the ſpirit ſhall returne to God who
gave it.</hi> This ſeemeth to be very clear, for he ſpeaketh of every man that dieth,
he conſiders the two eſſential parts of man, his body, which he calleth duſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was made of duſt, and then his ſoul, which he cals a ſpirit, becauſe of its
ſimple and incorporeal nature, again, which ſtrengthens the Argument, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
theſe two in their contrary or divers originals, <hi>The body returneth to the
earth, the Spirit unto God that gave it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though we would think this might ſatisfie, yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, and thoſe that
are <hi>Traducians,</hi> they ſay, <q>
                              <hi>God indeed giveth the ſoul by propagation, as well as
by Creation; God giveth two wayes, by Creation, or by Propagation,</hi> as ſaith
<hi>Auſtin.</hi> God is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 38. to give every ſeveral grain its body, yet
it is by ſeminal propagation, and God is often in the Scripture ſaid, to give us
our <hi>eyes,</hi> and our <hi>ears,</hi> and our <hi>bodies,</hi> yet they are by natural generation;
or if this will not ſerve, then they ſay, This is true onely of <hi>Adam,</hi> not his
poſterity, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s body was only made of the duſt, not ours; and God
did breath a ſoul into him at firſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But every one may ſee theſe are weak exceptions, as for the later, it's plain,
he doth not ſpeak of <hi>Adam,</hi> but every man that dieth; For having adviſed the
young man to improve his youth for God, he tels him, old-age is coming, and
then death, then ſhall he return, How can this be applied to <hi>Adam,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the earth many hundreds of years before that was ſpoken? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is ſaid, That only <hi>Adam</hi>'s body was made of duſt. The anſwer is eaſie, That
though our bodies be of fleſh and bone immediately, yet the remote principle is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57719:113"/>
duſt, and therefore <hi>Abraham,</hi> though his body was not made as <hi>Adams,</hi> yet he
ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                           <hi>was but duſt and aſhes.</hi> Thus this Text ſtands firm for the immediate
Creation of the ſoul. Though (let me by the way give you rightly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that later clauſe) <hi>The ſpirit returneth to him that gave it;</hi> The meaning is
not, as if the ſoul of every man was ſaved, but that it goeth into the hands of
God, as a Judge to diſpoſe of it, according to what hath been done in the fleſh;
As for the next exception, that will be anſwered in the following Argument; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the general this may be ſaid, That if God gave the ſoul onely mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by propagation, then the body might be ſaid to return to him, as well as
the ſoul.</p>

                        <p>WE will proceed to a ſecond, and that is from <hi>Zech. 12. 1. The Lord
which ſtretcheth forth the Heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth,
and formeth the ſpirit of man within him.</hi> Here we ſee the Lords power deſcribed
by a three-fold effect, the <hi>making</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>laying</hi> of the <hi>earths foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi>
and <hi>making</hi> the ſpirit of man; Now it is plain, that the two former were
by Gods immediate Creation, therefore the later muſt be: So that the Context
doth evidently ſhew, <hi>That Gods making of the ſoul of a man within him, is no leſſe
wonderfull then the making Heaven and earth.</hi> This Text was alſo of old agitated
by <hi>Auſtin</hi> in this controverſie, and to anſwer it, he runneth to his old refuge of
forming a thing immediately, and by natural propagation: <hi>God is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>from having a ſpecial hand in giving being to the ſoul,</hi> yet it
doth not follow, that therefore it muſt be by creation out of nothing. To this
purpoſe they bring that of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 10. 10, 11. where <hi>Job</hi> attributeth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and forming of his body to God, <hi>Haſt thou not poured me out like milk,</hi> &amp;c?
<hi>Thou haſt cloathed me with skin and fleſh.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 13, 14, 15. where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
acknowledgeth the wonderfull wiſdom and power of God, in <hi>making his
body, Then haſt curiouſly wrought me;</hi> As the curious needle-woman doth ſome
choice piece; now we cannot from hence prove, that therefore the body is of
God by immediate Creation.</p>
                        <p>But this cannot weaken the Text, for we told you, That the Argument is not
meerly from that expreſſing of forming the ſpirit of man within him, but from
the upper two Attributes. Beſides the Scripture tels us plainly of what materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
the body is formed of, whereas they who hold the propagation of the ſoul,
are extreamly ſtreightned and difficultated to ſay, what the ſoul is made of; They
ſay, it is not <hi>ex animâ,</hi> but <hi>ab animâ.</hi> not of the ſoul, but from the ſoul of the
Parent, but then are divided amongſt themſelves when they go to explicate, how
the ſoul hath its being if not from Creation. Some ſay, it hath its being by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<hi>ſeminal manner,</hi> but then it muſt be a body, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> would conſtantly
deny, for he diſſents from <hi>Tertullian</hi> in that, though both held the natural Tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the ſoul, <hi>Auſtin</hi> I mean only <hi>ſuppoſitively,</hi> but <hi>Tertullian poſitively,</hi> yet he
profeſſeth his diſſent from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who made it a body. This therefore being
thought abſurd, others they tell us of an incorporeal and immaterial ſeed from the
ſoul of the Parents, which cauſeth the ſoul of the child. To this purpoſe <hi>Tertullian</hi>
in his book <hi>de animâ,</hi> diſtinguiſheth of <hi>ſemen animale,</hi> which cometh from the ſoul,
and <hi>ſemen corporeum,</hi> which cometh from the body. But this may eaſily be judged as
abſurd as the former: If therefore the Scripture, when it ſpeaketh of <hi>the forming of
mans ſpirit within him,</hi> had diſcovered the materials of which it is formed, as well as
when it ſpeaketh of the forming of the body, there would have been ſome pretence
for the Argument. But calling it a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and as you ſee in the Text, comparing the
forming of it with the making of the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> this makes the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57719:113"/>
of the ſoul more than probable. <hi>Tarnavius</hi> the <hi>Lutheran</hi> would likewiſe
avoid this place (<hi>Comment. in loc.</hi>) by ſaying the Hebrew word <hi>Jahac</hi> doth
moſt commonly ſignifie, not an immediate creation out of nothing, for ſo the
Hebrew word <hi>Barah</hi> doth for the moſt, but a <hi>mediate</hi> out of ſome prejacent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yet indiſpoſed; but this Rule being not univerſal, it hath no ſtrength in it.
Beſides, the Hebrew word is in the <hi>Preſent tenſe,</hi> who <hi>formeth,</hi> ſo that it cannot
relate to the making of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul at firſt. Indeed the fore-named <hi>Tarnavius</hi>
doth from the participle <hi>Benani</hi> draw an Argument againſt us, ſaying, It doth
not alwayes ſignifie <hi>actum ſecundum,</hi> but <hi>habitum</hi> and <hi>potentiam,</hi> and ſo maketh
the ſenſe to be God, who hath this power immediately to create the ſoul, if he
will; but all will confeſs this to be forced; That is more conſiderable, when he
ſaith, As God in ſtretching out the Heavens, and laying the foundation of the
earth, is not thereby declared to create new Heavens, and a new earth every
day; ſo neither is it neceſſary that he ſhould create ſouls daily, but conſerve the
order appointed, as he doth, about the Heavens. The Anſwer is eaſie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do the words relate to the Creation at firſt with the conſervation of them,
becauſe new Heavens and new earths are not every day made; but both they and
we do acknowledge new ſouls are every day produced, as often as a man is born,
and God at firſt making <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul by breathing into it, the ſame order is ſtill
to be conſerved.</p>
                        <p>This Text thus cleared, we may adde as proofs alſo of the like kind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 5.
Though <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought by ſpirit there, might be meant the ſanctifying Spirit of
God; But that hath no probability. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 15. the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>God hath
faſhioned the hearts of men alike, or wholly throughout;</hi> By which is meant the ſoul
of a man in all its thoughts and workings, becauſe the ſoul puts forth its vital
actions in the heart. That alſo is remarkable, which yet I find not mentioned by
any in this Controverſie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 16. where <hi>Zedekiah</hi> maketh an oath to <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
that he will not kill him, after this manner, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, who
made us this ſoul,</hi> not this <hi>body,</hi> but <hi>this ſoul,</hi> (he putteth that into the oath,) inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
what an heavy ſinne it would be to kill a man that is innocent, ſeeing he
hath his ſoul from God. I ſhall mention but one Text more, and that is in the
New Teſtament, which ſeemeth clearly to demonſtrate the creation of the ſoul,
<hi>Heb. 12 9. We have had fathers of our fleſh that corrected us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall we
not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits?</hi> I think this Text may
put us out of all doubt, God is oppoſed as a Father to our natural parents; God
is called a Father of Spirits, natural parents father of our fleſh: Now if our ſouls
did come from our parents, they might be called fathers of our ſpirits, as well as
of our fleſh: The Apoſtles Argument would have no force, if the Creation of
the ſoul by God alone, and the generation of the fleſh only by natural parents be
not aſſerted: Thus <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 20. as alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 27. 16. God is there ſtyled,
<hi>The God of the ſpirit of all fleſh,</hi> in a peculiar manner. It may be wondered, that
though <hi>Auſtin</hi> buſied himſelf ſo much in finding out of this Truth, diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the Scripture, yet he never mentioned this place. Certainly, this
Text might have removed his doubt, and made him wholly poſitive in affirming
the creation of the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>That which I find later Writers reply to it, is, That God is called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Spirits in reſpect of Regeneration, becauſe he ſanctifieth and maketh
holy.</p>
                        <p>But the oppoſition to our fathers of the fleſh, evidently confuteth this; and
withall they can never ſhew, that God is called a Father of Spirits, or a God of
Spirits, but in reſpect of Creation, not Regeneration. It is true, the word ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
may ſometimes be uſed for a man as regenerate, as fleſh is for a man wholly
corrupt; but they can never ſhew that the word ſpirits in the plural number is
taken for men regenerate.</p>

of their bodies they differ from beaſts, yet in their ſouls they do greatly agree.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt Reaſon, which may appear in the defence of the <hi>Souls immediate
Creation from God,</hi> is, <hi>From the hiſtorical Narration, which</hi> Moſes <hi>makes
of the beginning and original of</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſoul:</hi> For as God when he was to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
man, did it in a more tranſcendent and glorious way, then when he made
beaſts, or the other creatures; For then he ſaid, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> and, <hi>Let the
waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures, that have life,</hi> Gen. 1. 20. And
ſo, <hi>Let the earth bring forth the living creatures, the beaſts after their kind;</hi> But
when he comes to make man, then the expreſſion is altered, <hi>Let us make man in
our Image;</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. where we have the manner of the execution of this
counſel, it is ſaid, <hi>He formed the body of Adam out of the duſt of the earth,
and breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life;</hi> No ſuch thing was done to
other creatures: So that you ſee <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul was from God immediately, though
his body was from the earth; This breathing of life into <hi>Adam,</hi> was infuſing of
the rational ſoul. Some Ancients thought, that it was the <hi>beſtowing of the holy
Ghoſt</hi> upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and that he had his rational ſoul before; They compare it
with <hi>Chriſts breathing on his Diſciples, whereby was communicated the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57719:114"/>
holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now it is plain, they had their rational ſouls before.</p>
                        <p>This is vain, becauſe by the breathing of this life, it's ſaid, <hi>Adam became a
living ſoul,</hi> ſo that he was but a dead lump of earth (as it were) before; And
indeed this Text is ſo clear, that I know none of the Adverſaries to the ſouls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Creation do deny it: Now then, <hi>If the ſoul of</hi> Adam <hi>was by creation,
Is it not probable that all other ſouls were in the like manner?</hi> What a great diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
would there be between <hi>Adam</hi> and us, if his ſoul was by creation, and
ours by generation? Some have queſtioned, Whether it would not make a <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
difference</hi> between <hi>Adam</hi> and us? But that is not to be affirmed; For Chriſt
as man was of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> with other men, though his Conception and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
were miraculous: But the Argument from the Creation of <hi>Adam's</hi> ſoul,
to the Creation of ours, though it be not cogent, yet it maketh it <hi>more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi>
becauſe God at firſt did appoint that order, which afterwards was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
So he appointed the animate creatures, to multiply in their way, making
their bodies and forms to be educed out of the power of the matter, (as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
expreſſe it, though very obſcurely,) but he did not do ſo with <hi>Adam's</hi> ſoul;
Can we think that our ſouls are leſſe glorious and precious before God (I mean
as meet creatures) then <hi>Adam's</hi> was? It is true, There was a <hi>neceſſity that</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam<hi>'s
body</hi> ſhould be otherwiſe made then ours, becauſe he was the firſt Parent,
and ſo he could not be bygeneration; Thus the other living creatures they had their
bodies at firſt out of the earth, or out of the water, not by generation, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
Thus for the body there was a neceſſity, but then for the <hi>ſoul there was
none at all;</hi> Why might not <hi>Adam's</hi> ſoul have been with his body out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
matter, as well as it was with other living creatures? But becauſe the ſoul
of man is of an higher nature coming from God alone: This Argument will appear
in further ſtrength, if you conſider that <hi>Eve,</hi> though ſhe was made in ſuch an
extraordinary manner out of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet <hi>ſhe had not her ſoul from him,</hi> but <hi>her
body only;</hi> For when he awakened, ſee what he ſaith, <hi>This is bone of my bone, and
fleſh of my fleſh;</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>This is ſoul of my ſoul,</hi> and yet as <hi>Auſtin</hi> in
this matter, though doubting, doth well argue, <q>That if <hi>Eve</hi> had had her ſoul
from <hi>Adam, Quid charius potuit dicere</hi> (ſaith he) This would have been a
more indeared and affectionate expreſſion, to have called her ſoul of his ſoul,
then fleſh of his fleſh.</q> It is true, ſome ſay, it is a <hi>ſynecdochical ſpeech,</hi> 
                           <q>By
fleſh (they ſay) is meant whole <hi>Eve,</hi> her whole perſon ſoul and body;</q> but
that is eaſier ſaid than proved; No doubt if it had been ſo, <hi>Adam</hi> would have
expreſſed it, as being a manifeſtation of greater unity, then what was in the body
only: If you ſay, <hi>But why is it not ſaid then, that God created</hi> Eve<hi>'s ſoul,
as well as</hi> Adam<hi>'s? If God had ſo immediately breathed a ſoul into her, would
not the Scripture have mentioned it?</hi> No, that is not neceſſary, it's enough,
that we read what God did to <hi>Adam</hi> about his ſoul; and the Scripture ſaith,
<hi>Geneſ. 1. 27. God created man in his Image male and female created he them.</hi>
Thus you ſee they were both, as in reſpect of Gods Image made alike: So <hi>Chap.
5. 2. Male and female created he them, and called their name</hi> Adam; And thus
much for the firſt Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond is more cogent, and that is taken from the ſoul of Chriſt,</hi> If Chriſt
had his ſoul by creation, then we had ours alſo; The conſequence is clear, becauſe
Chriſt is ſaid to be like us in all things, ſinne onely excepted; Hence it is, that he
alſo would have aſſumed our humane Nature in an ordinary way of generation, but
that it could not be without ſinne; If then Chriſt became like us in all things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

doth alwaies <hi>except</hi> Chriſts ſoul, and indeed there is this Argument which may
nforce us to it, taken from the compariſon that the Apoſtle maketh between
<hi>Levi</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> affirming <hi>Levi</hi> did pay tythes in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s loynes, but not
Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9. Now if Chriſt was every way in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s loynes, as <hi>Levi</hi>
was, then muſt Chriſt have paid tythes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as <hi>Levi,</hi> and ſo the
Apoſtles Argument would be without any force.</p>
                        <p>But it may be (and indeed it is urged by <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others,) <q>This will prove
<hi>Levi</hi>'s ſoul to have been in <hi>Abraham,</hi> elſe <hi>Levi</hi> could not have been ſaid to have
paid tythes in him, but as becauſe Chriſts ſoul was not in <hi>Abraham</hi> originally,
therefore he did not pay tith, ſo neither might <hi>Levi</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this therefore the ſolid Anſwer is, That the reaſon why Chriſt did not
pay tythes in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the Apoſtles ſence, was not becauſe his ſoul was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God, for ſo alſo was <hi>Levi</hi>'s, but becauſe Chriſt was of <hi>Abraham</hi>
only, <hi>Quoad corpulentam ſubſtantiam,</hi> not <hi>ſeminatam rationem,</hi> his fleſhly
ſubſtance was from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but not by natural propagation; he was from
<hi>Abraham</hi> only <hi>materialiter</hi> not <hi>effectivè,</hi> whereas <hi>Levi</hi> was both waies, and
hence he cometh ſhort of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>If ſo be that the ſoul of the parents did beget or multiply the ſouls of
children, then this would hold alſo in Angels;</hi> for the multiplication of another
muſt needs be acknowledged a perfection, where the ſubject is capable of it;
Certainly, generation of another is not in it ſelf an imperfection. for then in the
bleſſed Trinity, the Sonne could not be begotten of the Father, but generation
as in creatures denoteth imperfection. If then ſouls may come from ſouls, why
not Angels from Angels? but this is acknowleged by all, That no Angel can
produce another, but that there are as many and no more or leſs then was at firſt
Creation. As for that example of the ſoul producing another, as we ſee one
candle light another, that is nothing to this purpoſe; for therefore doth the
candle inlighten another, becauſe there is prepared and fitted matter to receive
this light; ſo that its from prejacent materials the light is produced; but how
can this be applied to the ſoul which is wholly ſpiritual, what preexiſtent matter
that can be made of?</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>If ſo be the ſoul be not by immediate Creation, then it muſt be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
corporal, and mortal:</hi> for although this conſequence is denied, yet the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of natural reaſon will commend this. Its traduced (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) and
is a body, yet is immortal: It is by propagation (ſay the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines)
and yet is not a body but a ſpirit, and immortal: But above all, thoſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Mortaliſts,</hi> they make it to be only the <hi>cruſis</hi> of the body, of which opinion
<hi>Galen</hi> alſo is ſaid to be, and ſo they make it mortal: We ſee then, that its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to have a ſound judgement about the original of the ſoul, for the <hi>Mortaliſts</hi>
have fallen into that deep pit of hereſy, becauſe they erred in this firſt. It is with
men, as they ſay of Fiſhes, they begin to putrify in the head firſt, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
men fall into looſe opinions, and then into looſe practiſes: But this rule
muſt be acknowledged, <hi>That whatſoever depends upon matter in being, doth alſo
depend upon it in exiſtency:</hi> It's <hi>Aquinas</hi> his rule, (as you heard,) <hi>Quicquid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendet
à materiâ in fieri, depend quoad eſſe et exiſtere;</hi> That is the reaſon, why
the ſouls of all beaſts are mortal, becauſe they depend upon the matter in being,
They cannot be produced but dependently on that, and therefore their ſouls
cannot ſubſiſt without their bodies; As it is plain, the ſouls of men do after death,
till the reſurrection; So that this Doctrine is injurious, and derogatory to
our ſpiritual and immortal ſouls.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57719:115"/>
to himſelf, and anſwers; it's neither of thoſe waies but from God. Not from
the <hi>Father</hi> alone, becauſe <hi>David</hi> doth bewail his mothers co operation hereunto,
<hi>Pſal 51, Iniquity did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Not the <hi>Mother</hi> alone, becauſe
the <hi>Father</hi> is made the chief cauſe of conveighing this original ſinne by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi>
he layeth it upon <hi>Adam,</hi> more then <hi>Eve,</hi> though <hi>Eve</hi> is not excluded;
Not from both together, for then the ſoul muſt be <hi>partible</hi> and <hi>diviſible,</hi> part

hereafter. The other is,</hi> Becauſe original ſinne cannot elſe be maintained;

                        <p>
                           <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Doth God create the ſoul? then he muſt know all the thoughts, all
the inward workings and motions of thy ſoul; As he that maketh a Clock, or
a Watch, knoweth all the motions of it; Therefore take heed of ſoul-ſinnes,
of ſpirit-ſinnes: What, though men know not your unclean thoughts, your
proud thoughts, your malicious thoughts, yet God who made thy ſoul doth;
and therefore this ſhould make us attend to Gods eie upon us.</p>

                           <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Did God make and create the ſoul? then he alſo can regenerate
it, and make it new again, he made it as a Creator, and he only in the way
of regeneration can make it again. This may comfort the godly that mourn
and pray, Oh they would have more heavenly holy ſouls: They would not
have ſuch vain thoughts, ſuch ſinnefull motions: Remember, God made thy
heart and he can ſpiritualize it.</p>
                        <p>3. Doth God create the ſouls? then here we ſee that it's our duty to
give our ſouls to him in the firſt place, <hi>John 4. God is a Spirit, and will be
worſhipped in ſpirit;</hi> This hath been alwaies a complaint, men have
drawed nigh to God bodily, but their hearts have been farre from him; God

and Scripture.</p>
                        <p>But before we eſſay that, we are to informe you of one ſort of learned
Authors, who, becauſe of the difficulty attending this Point, Whether we
hold the <hi>Traduction</hi> or <hi>Creation</hi> of the ſoul, have thought it the moſt wife
and ſober way to acknowledge the <hi>Propagation of original Sinne;</hi> But as for
the manner <hi>How,</hi> there to have a modeſt ſuſpenſe of our judgement, to
profeſſe a learned ignorance herein to believe <hi>That it is,</hi> though <hi>How it is
ſo,</hi> we know not. And <hi>Tertullian,</hi> concerning the original of the ſoul (<hi>Lib.
de Animâ</hi>) hath this known ſaying, <hi>Praeſtat per Deum neſcire, quae ipſe non
revelaverit, quàm per hominem ſcire, quae ipſe praesumpserit.</hi> In this way of
ſuſpenſe <hi>Auſtin</hi> continued as long as he lived, thinking that this might be
one of thoſe Truths, we ſhall not know, till we come into the Academy
of Heaven; and to this modeſt ſilence, we have one place of Scripture,
which might much incline us, <hi>Eccleſ. 11. 5. As thou knoweſt not the way of
the Spirit, nor how the bones doe grow in the womb,</hi> &amp;c. This Text ſhould
teach us not to <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to venture too farre, but to obſerve the light
of the Scripture, as they did the <hi>Pillar</hi> and <hi>Cloud</hi> in the wilderneſſe to
ſtand ſtill, where that ſtands ſtill; And indeed the Diſputes about the
<hi>Modes</hi> of things, is very intricate. The known ſaying is <hi>Motum,</hi> ſometimes
<hi>Modum neſcimus,</hi> the manner of Gods working in converſion, The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament, what endleſſe controverſies hath
it begotten? And therefore it was the King of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s counſel to the
Divines, when the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> were upon pacification about
the Sacrament, that they ſhould not <hi>De modo ultra modum diſputare.</hi> Now
although this be good counſel, yet when heretical and erroneous opinions
have invaded the <hi>Modus,</hi> then it is our duty to maintain not onely the
truth of a thing, but the manner of it alſo; What is a greater myſtery
then the Sonne of God, having his being from the Father? He that will
touch this myſtery with meer natural reaſon, doth as if the Smith ſhould
handle his live-coals with his hands and not the Tongs, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
yet becauſe of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who ſay, <q>He is onely a made God in time,
and hath his Deity by donation;</q> We are forced not to be content one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to believe, that he is the Sonne of God, but alſo how, <hi>viz. By eternal
Generation;</hi> So in the great Controverſie with the <hi>Arminians</hi> about the
converſion of man. It is not enough to ſay, we are converted by grace,
but are neceſſitated alſo to expreſſe the manner <hi>How,</hi> not by a <hi>moral ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
or <hi>per modum ſapientiae</hi> onely, but by <hi>invincible efficacy</hi> and power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
Thus the manner of Chriſts preſence, in the Sacrament was neceſſarily
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57719:116"/>
to be determined againſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Thus it is in our point in hand,
we might well enough ſit down with this Truth, That original ſinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to every ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and enquire no further, as the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church did till <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, in a great meaſure; But when Heretiques
will deny the true Doctrine, becauſe the manner is difficult to expreſſe; or
when men will deny the Creation of the ſoul, then it's our duty in a ſober
manner to ſearch into the way, how we partake of it: Neither doth the
fore mentioned Text contradict this; For, though we know not how the
bones grow in the womb exactly and punctually, yet we know in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that they do by virtue of generation; So although we know not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
how the ſoul cometh to have its being in the body, yet in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that it is by Creation, we have had Scripture light fully to convince us
therein.</p>
                        <p>This then premiſed, Let us proceed to clear the Doctrine of the Propagation
of original ſinne, and that by ſeveral Propoſitions, which will be as ſo many ſteps
and degrees to the main Truth.</p>

                        <p>FIrſt, We lay this for a foundation, <hi>That God doth create the ſoul of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man a ſpiritual ſubſtance.</hi> This Propoſition muſt be the foundation-ſtone
to build upon. That God doth create the ſoul immediately, you have
heard ſeveral Texts atteſting thereunto. So that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was too diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
when moved, (it ſeemed) by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> doth wave all Texts of Scripture
for the creation of the ſoul, and ſo proceedeth to other Arguments. <hi>Perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
on 2 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Geneſ. verſ.</hi> 7. giveth a better cenſure of <hi>Auſtin:</hi> for
having produced ſome Texts for the Creation of the ſoul, he ſaith, <hi>Conatur</hi>
Auguſtinus, <hi>ſed fruſtra hos locos elidere.</hi> I ſhall adde one more fit for that
purpoſe alſo. The Text is 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 19. Wherefore let them that ſuffer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſouls unto God, as to
a faithfull Creator.</hi> Here the afflicted children of God are required, as
Chriſt did, to commend their ſouls to God, and the reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe he
is a faithfull Creator of them;</hi> So that Gods Creation of them is here
made an engagement to God to keep them, they being now ſanctified and
made holy.</p>
                        <p>Our ſouls then are <hi>created:</hi> In the next place, I ſay, they are created
<hi>Subſtances:</hi> This is to obviate thoſe that make the ſoul onely an <hi>accident,</hi>
or the <hi>craſis</hi> and temperament of the humours; <hi>Galen</hi> (as <hi>Cerda</hi> on <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull.
de animâ</hi> alledgeth him) in his ſecond Book of prediction by the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
hath this paſſage, <q>Hitherto I have doubted, what ſhould be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the ſoul, but by age and experience being made wiſer, I dare
be bold to affirm it is no other thing, then the <hi>temperament;</hi>
                           </q> He was
not made wiſer, but more abſurd and fooliſh in this thing. Yea, there is
one <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> much ſpoken of, that ſaid, <q>The ſoul was <hi>nothing,</hi> it was
but an <hi>opinion;</hi>
                           </q> And the <hi>Mortaliſts</hi> they directly joyn with <hi>Galen</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Who would think, that when we have the Scripture ſpeaking ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about the ſoul, that it is a ſpirit, that it removeth when the body is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that any ſhould be delivered up to ſuch licentious and abominable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?</p>

Again, I adde, God createth it a <hi>ſpiritual ſubſtance.</hi> This oppoſeth the
<hi>Sadduces,</hi> who denied any ſpirits. It is plaine by Scripture, that they are
ſubſtances and ſpiritual ones, becauſe they ſubſiſt without the body. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
though he doth ſo acutely perſtringe the Philoſophers about the
ſoul, yet ſome of them were more ſound then he, <q>Men (ſaith he) have
thought about the ſoul, either as <hi>Platonis honor, Zenonis vigor, Ariſtotelis
tenor, Epicuri ſtupor, Heracliti maeſtor, Empedoclis furor perſuaſerint.</hi>
                           </q> It is
true, ſome of theſe thought the ſouls to be bodies, and ſo doth <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
and happily he might have been excuſed by taking <hi>body</hi> largely, for that
which is not <hi>nihil,</hi> in which ſenſe he attributeth a body to God, but that
he ſaith the ſoul is not only a body, but effigiated and ſhaped alſo, yea that
the ſouls differ in ſex, which is very irrational; We may then conclude this with a
ſaying of <hi>Numertus, That if any ſouls are corporeal, it is of thoſe, who ſay, ſouls
are corporeal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A ſecond Propoſition is, <hi>That though God doth create immediately the ſouls
of all men ſpiritual ſubſtances, yet they are not compleat and perfect ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as Angles are, but the eſſential parts of men.</hi> Upon this Propoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
much weight of this Truth about the communicating of original ſinne,
for we are apt to think God createth our ſouls like Angels, perfect and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſubſiſtency of themſelves, whereas they are created as <hi>parts of a man,</hi>
neither do they come from God any otherwiſe, <hi>If God ſhould create a ſoul
to ſubſiſt of it ſelf, and not to be united to the body to conſtitute a man, that
ſoul would not be polluted.</hi> But becauſe every ſoul is created as an <hi>eſſential
part of man,</hi> and ſo hath its being: Hence it is, That it cometh into the
world <hi>part of</hi> Adam, <hi>and ſo obnoxious to that curſe,</hi> which he had deſerved;
whatſoever then in its firſt being is part of man, that is partaker of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
ſinne and curſe; But the ſoul <hi>in its firſt inſtant of being</hi> is part of
man, therefore no wonder if it became polluted and curſed. The example
of that miraculous Reſurrection of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others may ſomething clear
this, they were fully dead, their ſouls and bodies union diſſolved, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their ſouls were not made perfect and pure without ſinne, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
into Heaven, but by the power of God detained here on earth, that
the glory of Chriſt might be exalted, he doth unite this ſoul, though with
pollution to the body: Now Gods uniting of the ſinfull ſoul to the body,
did not make him the cauſe of any ſinne therein, <hi>Becauſe he united it as part
of that man,</hi> who yet was not wholly purged from ſinne. Now the reaſon
why the ſoul is created, not as a perfect ſubſtance in it ſelf, is, <hi>Becauſe it's
the forme of man,</hi> not an <hi>aſſiſting</hi> forme, and therefore is not in the body,
as when an Angel did aſſume bodies, or as a man in his houſe, or as a
Muſician uſeth an Inſtrument, but <hi>a form informing,</hi> whereby it is made an
intrinſecal eſſential part of a man: The truth of this will give much light to
our point in hand, the ſoul is created by God, <hi>The informing forme of a
man,</hi> and ſo hath no <hi>other conſideration,</hi> but as an <hi>eſſential part of him;</hi> and
therefore ſeeing the man is in <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe ſoul this is, that is thereby
expoſed to all the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> Hence it is that there is ſome difference
between the creation of Angles, and the Chaos at firſt, which were made
abſolutely of nothing, and of the ſoul; For the ſoul, though it be created
of nothing, yet becauſe a form hath an eſſential reſpect to its matter; for
which cauſe <hi>Contarenus</hi> (as <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſaith) affirmed, <q>The ſoul had a middle
way of being between Creation and Generation;</q> and therefore is that diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome learned men, that though the ſoul be not <hi>ex materiâ,</hi> yet it is <hi>in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriâ,</hi>
God did not create it, but in the body, though not of the body, and thus
farre it may be ſaid to be of man, as that he is the cauſe, though not of the being
of the ſoul, yet of the being of it n <hi>this body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57719:117"/>
The third Propoſition, The ſoul being thus created an eſſential part
of a man, and the form informing of him: Hence it is, <hi>That we muſt not
conceive the ſoul to be firſt created,</hi> as it were, <hi>of it ſelf ſubſiſting, and then
infuſed into the body,</hi> but when the materials are ſufficiently prepared then
as the Schoolmen expreſſe it well, <hi>Infundendo creatur,</hi> and <hi>creando infudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
it's infuſed by the creating of it, and created by infuſing; So that the
ſoul is made in the body organized, not without it; ſo the Scripture, <hi>Zech.
12. 1. Who formeth the ſpirit of man with him,</hi> and becauſe of the ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the body when thus diſpoſed; Hence it is that man may truly and
univocally be ſaid to beget a man, though his ſoul be created; for ſeeing
man who is the <hi>compoſitum,</hi> is the <hi>Terminus generationis;</hi> Hence it is that
man begets man, as well as a beaſt, though the ſoul of a beaſt be from the
matter, as we ſee in Chriſt, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is truly ſaid to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Chriſt, though ſhe was not the mother of his Divine Nature, nor
of his ſoul. Thus man doth properly beget another man, though the ſoul
be by Creation (as the matter alſo according to Philoſophy is ingenerable)
becauſe the ſoul is united to the body, <hi>prepared</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> for it by man;
from which union reſulteth the <hi>whole perſon</hi> or <hi>compoſitum,</hi> conſiſting of ſoul
and body: So that although man be not the cauſe of his childs ſouls being,
yet that it hath a being in this body, and thereby ſuch a perſon produced,
he is the cauſe of it, and by this, if well underſtood, you may ſee original
ſinne communicated to every one, though the ſoul be created, <hi>In that way
which the humane nature is communicated to every one:</hi> So that if we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know how a man is made a man from his parents, we may alſo know how
ſin is thereby alſo communicated.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Propoſition is, <hi>Although God doth daily create new ſouls, yet
his Decree and Purpoſe to do ſo was from all eternity;</hi> And therefore in this
reſpect we may ſay all men conſiſting of ſouls and bodies were preſent to
God in <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of Gods Decree, and alſo his Covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
ſo that although there be a new Creation, yet there is no new inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ordination on Gods part; Whereas therefore it's thought hard, that
becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo many thouſand years ago, the ſoul created now ſhould
partake of his ſinne. The Anſwer is, That in reſpect of Gods Decree and
Covenant we were all preſent to God in <hi>Adam;</hi> There is no man hath his
being <hi>De Novo,</hi> but unto God he was preſent from eternity; ſo that though
the things in time have a ſucceſſion of being, yet to God all are preſent in
eternity: Not that we can ſay they were actually ſinners, or actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,
but in reſpect of Gods purpoſe all were preſent, and this will help
much to facilitate this difficulty, we are as preſent to God in reſpect of his
Decree, and knowledge, as if we had been then actually in <hi>Adam,</hi> in which
ſenſe it's ſaid, <hi>Omnes fuerunt ille unus homo,</hi> and <hi>Act. 15. 18. Known to God
are all his works from the beginning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fifth Propoſition. <hi>Hence it is that the juſt and wiſe God is not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and change that courſe of nature, becauſe man hath ſinned.</hi> It is vain to
ſay, Why will God unite this ſoul to the body, when thereby both ſhall be
polluted? For though man hath by his ſinne deſerved that this ſhould be,
yet God is not therefore to ceaſe of the continuing and multiplying of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
God doth keep to the fixed courſe of nature, notwithſtanding mans
ſinne; And therefore we ſee that even to thoſe, who are begot in fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and whoredome, yet even to ſuch in that unlawfull act, God giveth ſouls,
becauſe he will not interrupt the courſe of nature.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth Propoſition. <hi>Adam by his firſt tranſgreſſion did deſerve that all
who ſhould be of him, ſhould be deprived of the Image of God, and the priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57719:118"/>
of that doth neceſſarily inferre the preſence of all ſinne in a ſubject ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible:</hi>
As take away light from the air, and it muſt be dark; ſo that this
Propoſition anſwereth the whole difficulty: <hi>Adam</hi> deſerved by his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that all his poſterity ſhould become dead in ſinne; and as he had thus
deſerved it, ſo God had ordained it, and appointed it; The ſoul then of
every one being made <hi>part of that man who is thus curſed in Adam,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
deprived of the Image of God, and ſo full of ſinne; So that although
God create the ſoul naturally good, yet becauſe <hi>part of man condemned by his
ſentence,</hi> he denieth it that original righteouſneſſe it once had; God doth not
infuſe any evil into the ſoul, nor is the Author of any ſinne therein, but as a juſt
Judge denieth that righteouſneſſe, which otherwiſe the ſoul might have had: So
that you muſt not look for an <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of original ſinne in the ſoul, but
a <hi>deficient,</hi> and <hi>a meritorious cauſe:</hi> So that the Summe is this, If you ask,
How cometh the ſoul defiled, if created of God? I anſwer, The <hi>Meritorious
cauſe</hi> is <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, by his tranſgreſſion he demerited this for all
that ſhould come of him. And if you ſay, Who putteth the ſinne in? I
anſwer, There is no <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> that putteth it in: It is enough that God
doth juſtly refuſe to give or continue his Image. And this being denied the
ſoul, becauſe a ſubject either of holineſſe or ſinne, when wanting one muſt
neceſſarily fall into the other: Thus it is with the ſouls being polluted, as
it is with night, there is no efficient cauſe of the night, only the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Sunne neceſſarily maketh it: So God doth nothing poſitively to
make the ſoul ſinfull, but according to his juſt appointment at firſt denieth
that righteouſneſſe, which <hi>Adam</hi> wilfully put away from himſelf and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity:
So that we may as eaſily conceive of every childs ſouls pollution by
ſinne, as of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> themſelves. God made them righteous, but upon
their tranſgreſſion they became unclean and ſinfull: How was this? God in
juſtice denied the continuance of this holineſſe to them any longer, ſo that
they became ſinfull, not becauſe God infuſed evil, but denied him that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
to them. This may fully ſatisfie the ſober and modeſt minded
man.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the laſt Propoſition is, <hi>That we cannot ſay, the ſoul being pure
in it ſelf cometh into the body, and ſo is inſected;</hi> As if ſome wine ſhould be
put in a poiſoned veſſel, for the ſoul and the body do mutually infect one
another, not <hi>phyſically</hi> by contact, but <hi>morally;</hi> For the ſoul being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of the Image of God in all its operations, is ſinfull, and ſo all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
actions are polluted: And then again, the body that having loſt the
properties it had before the fall, is a clod and a burden to the ſoul: Thus
they doe mutually help to damne one another, the ſoul polluteth the body,
and the body that again polluteth the ſoul; And thus thoſe two which at
firſt God put together in ſo near an union to make man happy, are now
ſo defiled, that both from ſoul and from body, the matter of his damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth ariſe. It is true, we may ſay inchoatively, Sinne it in the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enlivened by the ſoul, in which ſenſe <hi>David</hi> bewailed his being concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in ſinne, but explicitely and formally it cannot be, and therefore we
are not to conceive ſinne in the body before the ſoul be united, or in the
ſoul before the body be joyned to it, but as ſoon as they both became man,
then they are under the juſt curſe of God, and the ſoul being blind, and the
body ſame, they both fall into that eternal pit of damnation, if the grace of God
deliver not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I may in time ſhew how many wayes the ſoul defileth the body, and the
body againe infecteth the ſoul</hi> (viz.) <hi>in a moral ſenſe,</hi> and therefore let this
ſuffice for the preſent; Onely from what hath been ſaid, let us turn our
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57719:118"/>
Diſputation into Deploration, Let the head buſied to argue, be now as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
to weep; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> wiſhed his <hi>head was a fountain of tears for the ſlain of
his people,</hi> and that was but a temporal death, and that of one Nation only, How
much more may we deſir ſo for the ſpiritual death, and that of all in the world?
Say unto all Heretical Teachers, <hi>Get ye behind me Satans,</hi> you hinder and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me in my humiliation: Is not the Infant new born ſwadled and bound
up hand and feet, and ſo lieth crying? A ſad repreſentation, that ſo God
might bind every one, and ſend him crying to Hell: Thus original ſinne
opened Hell, kindled the fire of Hell, there was no Hell till this was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
Oh grievous neceſſity and unhappy condition we are all born in!
<hi>Antequam peccemus peccato conſtringimur, antequam delinquimus delicto tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi>
This, even this ſeriouſly conſidered, ſhould make us have no reſt, till
we be put into the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom we have Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                           <hi>Mary</hi> was by ſpecial priviledge exempted from original ſinne, <hi>Scotus</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be the firſt, that made it received as a kind of an Eccleſiaſtical opinion,
whereas formerly it was but thought doubtfull, or at moſt probable: It is not
worth the while to trouble you with this, and I may have occaſion ere the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
be diſpatched to ſay, what will be neceſſary to it: I ſhall therefore proceed
to that which is more <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>profitable,</hi> even to ſearch into the ſeat and
bowels of this original ſinne, that we may be fully informed, <hi>no part</hi> of the ſoul
is free from this peſtilence. To which truth the Text in hand will contribute great
aſſiſtance. And</p>
                        <p>For the Coherence of it briefly take notice that the Apoſtle at the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe
giveth a ſhort but dreadfull Deſcription of a <hi>Gentile</hi> converſation, or the life of
one without the knowledge of Chriſt; wherein you may obſerve a three-fold
ignorance or blindneſs upon all ſuch, ſo impoſſible is it that of themſelves they
ſhould ever come to ſee; There is a <hi>natural</hi> blindneſs, a <hi>voluntary</hi> contracted
blindneſs, and a <hi>Judicial</hi> one inflicted on them by God, for abuſe of natural
light. Theſe there are mentioned in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. And in this <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. we
have the formidable conſequence declared, That <hi>being paſt feeling,</hi> no remorſe of
conſcience in them, <hi>They give up themſelves to all wickedneſſe with greedineſſe:</hi>
Oh that this were only among <hi>Pagans!</hi> But how many have this natural, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and judicial blindneſs and obſtinacy upon them under the light of the Goſpel?
Yea, their eyes are more blinded, and hearts more hardned, where the means of
grace have been contemned, then in the places where the name of Chriſt hath
not been known. This black condition of Heathens being deſcribed, he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
thoſe of Chriſtians with it, and ſo we have darkneſs and light here ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
And this the Apoſtle declareth, <hi>verſ. 20. But ye have not ſo learned Chriſt;</hi>
Chriſt teacheth no ſuch wickedneſſe, yet becauſe many may have a bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and a vain empty profeſſion of Chriſt, and live ſuch <hi>Paganiſh</hi> lives, he
addeth a corrective to his ſpeech, which is worthy of all attention, <hi>If ſo be ye
have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> This is an excellent limitation,
men may know Chriſt, profeſſe Chriſt, and yet not do it, as <hi>the truth is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi>
that is not to obey the Doctrine of Chriſt, as he hath commanded; Chriſt
never required that thou ſhouldſt only make a profeſſion of faith in him, and then
for thy life, that that may be full of vice and corruption, know, if you do ſo,
you know not the truth as it is in Jeſus Chriſt. We have a like expreſſion, <hi>Coloſ.</hi>
1. 6. where the godly are ſaid, <hi>To know the grace of God in truth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There is the acknowledging of the truth after godlineſſe:</hi> Oh let ſuch hear, and let
their ears tingle, and their hearts tremble, who come to Church, profeſs Chriſt,
and yet <hi>runne in all exceſſe of riot!</hi> What doth any knowledge profit if it be not
of the truth as it is in Jeſus, if it be not an acknowledgment after godlineſſe,
thou denieſt the faith, and art indeed worſe then an Heathen? There is <hi>Theologia
rationalia</hi> and <hi>experimentalis,</hi> as <hi>Gerſon,</hi> or <hi>Theologia docens</hi> and <hi>utens.</hi> It is this
later, <hi>viz.</hi> an exerciſed experimental Divinity, that maketh a Divine properly:
Therefore <hi>Ameſius</hi> his definition of <hi>Theologia</hi> is good, that it is <hi>Doctrius Deo
vivendi,</hi> a Doctrine whereby we are taught to live unto God. Every wicked
Chriſtian is worſe then a Pagan; But who will believe this report? Now that
we may know what it is to know <hi>truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> he inſtanceth in a twoſold
effect or demonſtration thereof:</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, <hi>To put off the old man with the decitfull luſts thereof.</hi> This <hi>old man</hi>
you heard is original ſinne, this muſt be mortified with the immediate iſſues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
So that a true knowledge of Chriſt doth not only cleanſe the ſtrems, but
the fountain alſo, doth not onely change the converſation of a man, but the
heart, the affections, the whole man. It goeth to the root as well as the
branches.</p>
                        <p>And the ſecond effect is in the Text, <hi>To be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind;</hi>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:57719:121"/>
wherein we are to obſerve the <hi>Duty,</hi> and the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. The Duty is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <hi>To be renewed;</hi> We read it Imperatively, but in the Greek it is the Infinitive
mood, as alſo the Duty <hi>to put off,</hi> mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 22. is in the ſame mood, for theſe
Infinitives do relate to the <hi>Verb,</hi> being taught as <hi>the truth is in Chriſt, to be taught to
put off, to be taught to be renewed;</hi> If ſo be we conceive of thoſe to whom <hi>Paul</hi>
writeth, as converted already, then this duty of renovation, is to be underſtood
of further increaſed and degrees. To be more renewed every day, for it is uſual
with the Apoſtle to write to thoſe who are ſuppoſed to be in the ſtate of grace,
that they ſhould be more ſanctified and reconciled to God. To <hi>be renewed,</hi> is to
have the mind indowed with <hi>new Properties</hi> and <hi>Qualities;</hi> for ignorance, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for atheiſm and unbelief, faith; for ſinfull and vain thoughts, gracious
and holy ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that there are two extreame errours in the expounding
of this:</p>
                        <p>1. Of the <hi>Illyricans,</hi> who as they held <hi>ſinne to be the ſubſtance of a man,</hi> ſo this
renovation they muſt hold to be <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> not <hi>accidental.</hi> But it's abſurd to
ſay, a man muſt have a new ſoul eſſentially in regeneration.</p>
                        <p>The other extream is of <hi>Socinians,</hi> for they holding, <hi>There is no ſuch thing as
original ſinne,</hi> they muſt needs ſay, That this renovation is only in regard of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
ſinne,</hi> and <hi>external impiety</hi> in the life, not in reſpect of any inbred
and inherent pollution in the mind: But this alſo is againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing in the Text, is the <hi>Subject</hi> of this renovation, <hi>The ſpirit of
your mind.</hi> Concerning the difference between <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> many thoughts
have been, but either it is an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> and is no more then the mind which is a
ſpirit, or elſe ſpirit is taken for that which is the moſt ſublime, noble, and alſo
moſt active and vigorous in a man. Thus <hi>Job 20. 3. we have the ſpirit of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
And <hi>Iſa. 11. 2. The ſpirit of wiſdom, the ſpirit of counſel,</hi> and <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of knowledge;</hi> Yea, it is ſometime applied to the vigorous and high actings of
evil, as <hi>Hoſ. 4. 12. The ſpirit of whoredom;</hi> And the <hi>ſpirit of whoredoms,</hi> Hoſea
5. 4. So that when the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>Be renewed in your mind,</hi> but <hi>in
the ſpirit of your mind;</hi> This ſuppoſeth, <hi>That what is moſt choiſe, excellent and
noble, even in the rational part of a man, called for its dignity</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

is all over polluted by original ſinne, and ſo needeth a renovation: As for thoſe
who by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> would underſtand the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is moſt abſurd, For how

other parts.</p>
                        <p>The former Doctrine is only to my ſubject in hand; for now my work is to
ſhew you, Wherein this contagion doth diſcover it ſelf? And I ſhall begin with

ſomething in the general about the ſubject wherein this original ſinne is ſeated.</p>

                        <head>SECT. III.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, There hath been ſome, who have not ſo much ſeated it in the ſoul, as
made the very ſoul and ſubſtance of a man to be original ſinne; So that we
might properly and truly ſay, Man was ſinne it ſelf. The Author of this was
<hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> who in many things is to be praiſed for his diligence and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
but he was of a turbulent ſpirit, very reſtleſs; inſomuch that in his ſtudies
at firſt, he was ſo greatly tempted, that many times publick prayer was made for
him in the ſolemn Aſſemblies. (<hi>Vide</hi> Horned. <hi>Sum. Controv. de Lutheraniſmo.</hi>)
This man out of great earneſtneſs to oppoſe <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yea and the <hi>Lutheran Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelius,</hi>
who extenuated original ſinne, fell into another extream, making it to
be the very ſubſtance of man. It is true, Some have excuſed him, as thinking
his opinion was ſound, onely his words were obſcure and dangerous, for he doth
often diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Homo Phyſicus,</hi> and the <hi>Homo Theologicus,</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Theological man, as he is in ſuch a conſideration to be onely ſinfull. But
ſurely it is as eaſie to underſtand <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Atoms, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his numbers,
<hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Ideas, Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Entelechias,</hi> as <hi>Illirieus</hi> his <hi>Homo theologicus</hi> in the way
he layeth it down, denying all along, that original ſinne is an accident. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
made a great rent among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> whereof ſome were called <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiarii,</hi>
others <hi>Accidentarii,</hi> as <hi>Coceius</hi> the Papiſt relateth (<hi>Coccius Theſ. de
peccato.</hi>) but this is to be refuſed with great indignation: Original ſinne is moſt
intimately cleaving to us, inſeparably joyned to the nature of man, yet it is not
the nature of man, for then Chriſt could not have taken our nature without ſin.
Though therefore it be ſeated in the ſoul, and that moſt tenaciouſly, yet it is not
the eſſence of a man: But of this more in its time.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is alſo a great Diſpute among the Schoolmen, Whether original
ſinne be immediately and proximely ſeated in the eſſence of the ſoul, or in the
powers of it? Whether becauſe it is firſt in the eſſence of the ſoul, therefore the
underſtanding and will are corrupted? Or, Whether theſe powers are firſt pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
and infected by it? But this is founded upon a philoſophical Diſpute, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſoul and the faculties thereof are diſtinguiſhed: And therefore I ſhall not
trouble you with it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Some Papiſts have limited original ſinne onely to the affections, to
the inferiour and ſenſitive part of a man, as if ſinne were not in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and reaſon at all, but in the affections and fleſhly part onely; But the more
learned of the Papiſts gainſay this, and do acknowledge, that the mind as well as
other parts is polluted with this leproſie.</p>

perſons are ſaid to be <hi>darkneſſe</hi> in the very abſtract, and that both becauſe
of their original and acquired blindneſs of mind upon them; What could the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57719:122"/>
wiſeſt and moſt learned of the world do in reſpect of any knowledge of Chriſt,
if this were not revealed? for this cauſe it is called the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is conſtantly compared to <hi>light,</hi> and all the world is ſaid, <hi>To ſit in darkneſs</hi>
till this doth ariſe; ſo that our minds are by nature wholly ignorant about our
ſelves, about God and Chriſt, which made our Saviour ſay to <hi>Peter,</hi> upon
his confeſſion, <hi>That fleſh and blend had not revealed this to him:</hi> whereas then
in the ſtate of integrity our minds were as gloriouſly filled with all perfections,
and abilities, as the firmament with ſlarres, there was <hi>ſapience,</hi> in reſpect of
God, <hi>ſcience,</hi> in reſpect of all natural things to be known, and <hi>prudence,</hi> in
reſpect of all things to be done; now our eie is put out, and like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the
<hi>Philiſtims</hi> can do what they pleaſe with us, for this reſpect it is, that every
creature is better then man, they have a natural inſtinct, whereby they know
what is proper for them, <hi>Opera natura ſunt opera artis,</hi> or <hi>intelligeniae;</hi> They
have as much knowledge ſenſitive (I mean) as they were made with at firſt,
even the leaſt creatures and moſt deſpicable; yea God is, <hi>maximus in minimus,</hi>
moſt wonder full in the leaſt things, which made <hi>Auſtin</hi> preferre <hi>Fly</hi> before
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and that he did more admire, <hi>Opera Formicarum,</hi> then <hi>Onera Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi>
the wiſe workes of the Ant, before the heavy burdens of Camels: Thus
all creatures have a ſuteable knowledge for their end in their way, only man is
in horrible darkneſs, and is abſolutely ignorant about God or his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Therefore thoſe opinions of ſome, who attribute a poſſibility of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Heathens,</hi> by the natural knowledge they have, do in effect make
void Chriſt and the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Original ſinne doth not only deprive us of all knowledge of God
in a ſaving way, <hi>but alſo filleth us with error, and poſitive miſtakes,</hi> whereby we
have not only unbelief, but <hi>miſbelief,</hi> our condition were not ſo univerſally
miſerable, if ſo be our mindes were only in a not knowing, or meer privative
ignorance about God: but oh the groſs ſoul and abſurd perſwaſions men have
naturally about God! The Atheiſme naturally that is in us, either denying
or doubting about God; but eſpecially, the falſe and abſurd repreſentations
of God to us; It is from the error in mans mind, that <hi>Polytheiſme</hi> hath ſo
abounded, perſwading themſelves of many gods; yea, the idolatry that hath
filled the <hi>pagariſh</hi> world, and under ſubtile diſtractions hath invaded the
Church alſo, doth abundantly proclaim original ignorance and error in us
about divine things; yea, the wiſer men, as the Apoſtle obſerveth, <hi>Rom. 1.
They became the more fooliſh in their imaginations, turning the image of God into
the likeneſs of the vileſt creatures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But before we proceed, we muſt anſwer an Objection, that may be made
to the Doctrine delivered; for it will eaſily be ſaid, <hi>That the corruption hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mentioned in the underſtanding is actual ſinne rather then original; Ignorance,
Atheiſme, I dolatrical thoughts of God, theſe muſt neceſſarily be judged actual;
and if it be ſo, Why do we aſcribe this to original?</hi> And indeed this Objection
is commonly made by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> againſt the Poſitions and Confeſſions which
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have made about original ſinne; for when they diſcribe the
nature of it, they uſually inſtance in particulars, as <hi>horrible ignorance, Atheiſm,</hi>
and <hi>diſſidence in the mind,</hi> &amp;c. To this the <hi>Papiſts</hi> reply, ſaying, <hi>We confound
actual and original ſinne;</hi> yea, when we bring that famous place. <hi>Gen. 5. 6.
The imaginations of the thoughts of the heart, are onely evil, and that continually,</hi>
to prove original ſinne, they reply the ſame thing to that Text alſo.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to clear this, we are to know, that it is true, Atheiſme, ignorance;
theſe are <hi>actual</hi> ſinnes, as they are put in <hi>exerciſe,</hi> but yet when we aſcribe
them to original ſinne, we do not ſo much mean, <hi>the actual exerciſe</hi> of theſe
evils, as the <hi>Proneneſs and propenſity of the heart to them:</hi> So that our meaning
is, The heart of it ſelf is prone to all theſe actual wickedneſſes; Therefore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57719:123"/>
though we name theſe as actual, yet you muſt underſtand them, <hi>habitually and
ſeminally,</hi> there being an <hi>inclination</hi> to all that impiety.</p>
                        <p>Only the reaſon, why we deſcribe original ſinne thus, as if it were actual
pollution, it is, <hi>Becauſe that it is a principle alwaies acting, it never ceaſeth;</hi>
the ſparkes of this luſt are like thoſe of hell which never go out; as the heart
of a man naturally, never ceaſeth its motion, ſo neither doth the evil heart
of a man.</p>
                        <p>This difficulty being removed, let us proceed to diſcover further actings
of original ſinne in the mind, and ſpirit of man, And</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The ſecond in order is, <hi>That incapacity, which is in every mans underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
about holy things:</hi> Divine and ſupernatural things are no more received
by him, then a Beaſt doth apprehend the things of reaſon; We have this fully
affirmed, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. But the natural man receiveth not the things of God,
neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned;</hi> you ſee there is
no habitude or proportion between the underſtannding of a natural man,
and ſpiritual things, no more, then is between the bodily eie, and a ſpiritual:
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is one that doth, <hi>excolere animam,</hi> ſuch as labour to adorne and
perfect the ſoul, with the moſt intellectual and moral indowments that are:
a <hi>Tully,</hi> a <hi>Plato,</hi> an <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> theſe, if brought to Goſpel-truth, are not
ſo much as <hi>noctuae ad ſolem,</hi> Owles to the Sunne-beames; To this purpoſe
alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7, we have not only this truth aſſerted, but alſo aggravated,
where the <hi>carnal mind</hi> is ſaid, <hi>To be enmity againſt God, and it is not ſubject
to the Law of God, neither can it be.</hi> By which places of Scripture, it is evident,
That the mind of man, hath an utter incapacity, as to any divine things.
Indeed there is a <hi>paſſive capacity,</hi> as ſome expreſs it, and ſo the mind of man
is ſuſceptible of holy truth, and ſuch a capacity is not in a beaſt; as that is not
capable of ſinne, ſo neither of regeneration; But then there is an <hi>active
capacity,</hi> when the ſoul by ſome ability and power of its own, is able to move
to theſe ſupernatural objects; and thus the underſtanding of the <hi>moſt learned</hi>
in the world, cannot of it ſelf receive it, and therefore faith is ſaid, <hi>To be the
gift of God;</hi> ſo that we may juſtly abhorre the <hi>Arminians, Probitas animi,</hi>
and <hi>Pia doxilitas,</hi> which they make preparatory or main part to converſion:
Now there is a twofold receiving of divine Truths.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Speculatively, by a bare dogmatical aſſent;</hi> and even thus, none by
nature can receive the Truths of God; for the <hi>Phariſees</hi> though they heard
Chriſt <hi>preached,</hi> and ſaw the <hi>miracles</hi> he did, yet they did not believe with ſo
much as a <hi>dogmatical faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. There is a <hi>practical, and experimental receiving of holy Truths in the
power of them, which is here called, the knowing of Truths, as they are in Jeſus,</hi>
and this much leſs are we able to receive: To the former is required the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace of God; To this a more ſpecial one. Wonder not then, if you
ſee men, even the moſt learned, naturally ſo brutiſh, ſo ignorant about
divine things, That they have no more underſtanding, and apprehenſion
about heavenly things, Oh bewail original corruption, which maketh thee
ſo unteachable, ſo untractable! Why doth not every Scripture-truth, every
powerfull Sermon have its full and powerfull operation upon thee, but becauſe
it doth not me et with a preparedand fitted ſubject?</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>Original ſin polluteth the underſtanding, by making it to incline to curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and a prying into ſuch things, which God hath not revealed. Adam</hi>'s
actual ſinne, which is our original imputed one, was partly this, <hi>They deſired
to be as gods, to know good and evil,</hi> which <hi>hath left its</hi> impreſſion upon all:
Like the <hi>Bethſhemite,</hi> we deſire to be <hi>looking into the Ark.</hi> The Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6, as he would not have the <hi>Corinthians, think of men, above that
which is written,</hi> ſo much leſs of God contrary to that which is revealed:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57719:123"/>
This is a great evil upon the underſtandings of men by original ſinne that
now the mind is not contented with the rule God hath given it; They think
it a ſmall and contemptible matter to know no more then what may be
known by the Scripture, but they affect extraordinary things; This curioſity
is that which filled the Church once with ſo many <hi>Schoolemen and their Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as <hi>Aegypt</hi> was once with <hi>Caterpillars.</hi> It is true, <hi>School-divinity</hi> hath
its uſe, and ſo farre as they deal ſolidly, and improve natural reaſon in any
point, they are very admirable; but when once they fall into their uſeleſs,
unprofitable and ſublime Queſtions, where neither the Word of God, or
ſure reaſon can conduct them, then they vaniſh like ſmoak in the air: how
raſh are they in their Diſputes about <hi>Angels?</hi> With what nice conceits have
they obſcured the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity?</hi> Inſomuch that we may ſee much
of original ſinne in them, inclining and hurrying of them to a bold and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
determination of ſuch things, which God hath not manifeſted; ſo that
none of their <hi>ſeraphical, ſublime,</hi> or <hi>angelical Doctors,</hi> could begin their
Diſputations, as <hi>John</hi> his Epiſtle: <hi>That which we have ſeen, we have heard,
and our hands have handled;</hi> 1 Joh 1. 1. Though therefore the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> have
in ſomethings their great uſe, yet in their difficult niceties, which are but as ſo
many cob-webs, there they are as much to be ſlighted; as one king did a
man, who boaſted, he could ſtand at a diſtance and throw a grain of corn
through the eie of a needle. Again this original curioſity of the mind, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it ſelf in all thoſe <hi>Magick Arts and Witchcrafts</hi> which have abounded in
the world; as alſo in <hi>judiciary Aſtrology,</hi> and ſuch deceitful impoſtures,
men affecting, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, <hi>to be like God,</hi> to be able to declare the things
that are to come. <hi>Act. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> 19. They are called, <hi>curious arts.</hi> Furthermore
this curioſity of the mind is ſeen, in <hi>nauſeating</hi> and <hi>diſdaining known things,</hi>
and what are already diſcovered, and ambitiouſly thirſting to find out ſome
<hi>Veritas incognita,</hi> as others have done <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> To bring ſuch new
things to the world, that were never knowen, or heard before: It's from
this ſinful curioſity, that men forſake the good Truths of God, and runne
after <hi>hereſies, errors,</hi> and whatſoever hath <hi>novelliſme</hi> in it: ſo that he, who
would examine himſelf about his <hi>regeneration,</hi> muſt look to the renovation of
his mind in this particular, as well as any other.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Original ſinne diſcovereth it ſelf in our minds, by the vanity that</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/>
                           <hi>they are filled with,</hi> 1 Cor. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe,
that they are vain;</hi> If the thoughts of wiſe men (without the Scripture) be
vain, how much more of men, who have no more then natural ability?
And certainly this muſt needs be a very heavy cenſure upon man, that he who
hath the beſt parts, the greateſt underſtanding, yet till grace ſanctify, he is
but a vain man; His mind is a vain mind, his underſtanding is a vain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
many waies the vanity of it might be diſcovered, as thus, <hi>The
underſtanding of man is naturally more affected with pleaſing things, then with
ſolid and ſound Truths;</hi> it is more affected with words, language, jeſts, and
merry tales, then with that matter which tendeth to ſpiritual edification; Is
not this a great inſtance of the vanity upon our minds? to regard leaves more
then fruit, chaff more then good ſeed, pictures and ſhews more then ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
whence ariſeth that delight in embroydered language, in playes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
and in <hi>Romances,</hi> and ſuch <hi>bubles,</hi> and empty vapours, but from a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
upon mans mind? To be pleaſed with ſtories, and merry tales, more then
a powerfull and divine Sermon? Is not this, becauſe mans mind is vain?
Since mans fall, as the will, though a noble part of the ſoul, yet doth act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
and ſlaviſhly to the ſenſitive appetite; we will not what is good,
and the acceptable will of God, but what our ſinful affections ſuggeſt to us:
ſo the underſtanding, though the ſatred faculty, (as it were) of the ſoul, yet
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57719:124"/>
acts dependently on the fancie, and ſo what tickleth and pleaſeth that, the
mind alſo is moſt affected with. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did much confeſs and bewail this vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his mind, whereby he did diſdain the ſimplicity of the Scripture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to hear that eloquent <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> not out of love to matter, but to words;
This is a childiſh vanity, like Children that delight in a Book for the pictures
that are in it, not the matter contained therein. This vain mind hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
affected both Preacher and Hearer, what applauded Sermons have there
been, and yet nothing in them but deſcanting upon words, and affecting a
verbal pomp, being like the Nightingale <hi>Vox &amp; preterea nihil,</hi> like Puppets
ſtuft with bumbaſt, having no life at all within them? and all was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
prating that was not ſuch a wordy preaching. And, truely, this vanity
hath much infected the mind of hearers; men coming to the Word preached,
not as to hear the Oracles of God, with fear and trembling, but as to the
Schooles of oratory, looking to the powdring of their words, and the dreſſing
of the language, as much as to the ſetting and ordering of their own hair; Is
not this a great evil and vanity, thus to regard the healing of the finger, when
the heart is deadly ſick? If thy mind be renewed in this, it will alſo appear,
and for that vanity, there will be ſolid gravity.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, <hi>Original ſinne filleth the mind with exceeding great folly;</hi> So that no
man born a natural fool is more to be pitied, then every man who by nature
is a ſpiritual fool. Thoſe conceited wiſe ones of the world, who condemne
the godly for a company of fools, they are fools in the higheſt degree, as may
eaſily be evinced: If ſo be (<hi>Job</hi> 4. 18.) God is ſaid, <hi>To charge his Angels with
folly,</hi> (and that, as ſome expound,) even the good Angels themſelves, becauſe
that wiſedome they have comparatively to Gods, is but folly; how much
more is this true of man fallen, who hath loſt that wiſedome God once beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him? If you ask, Wherein doth a natural mans folly appear? Truly
in every thing he doth, <hi>Eccl. 10. 3, His wiſdom: faileth him, and he ſaith to
every one, he is a fool;</hi> Every oath, every lie, every drunken fit proclaimeth a
man to be but a fool; If he had the wiſedome of Gods Word he could never
do ſo; eſpecially the folly of man by nature is ſeen theſe waies.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>In making himſelf merry with ſinne.</hi> It is jollity and ſport to him, <hi>to be
fullfilling the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> and is not this folly, to be playing with the flames
of hell? as you ſee fools go laughing to the ſtocks, ſo do they to hell, <hi>Prov.
10. 23, It is a ſport to a fool to do miſchief;</hi> herein then thy fooliſh mind is
ſeen, that thou canſt laugh and ſport it ſo in the actings of ſinne, which are
the preparatoryes to thoſe everlaſting burnings in hell.</p>
                        <p>2. Thy folly by nature is ſeen, <hi>In preferring a creature before God;</hi> what
is this but the fools bable before the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> as the Proverb is? yet
this folly is bound up in every man, till grace make him wiſer; he loveth the
creature more then God, he had rather have a drop then the ocean, earth
then heaven, dirt then gold; Is not this greater folly then can be expreſſed?
yet till regenerated, ſuch a fool thou art, though thou art never ſo wiſe
in thy own conceit.</p>
                        <p>3. We are naturally fooliſh, <hi>In that we attend only to thoſe things that are
for the preſent, and never at all look to eternity;</hi> becoming herein like bruit
beaſts, that regard only what is before them. <hi>Moſes</hi> doth in the name of
God wiſh, <hi>Oh that my people were wiſe</hi> (Deut. 32. 29.) <hi>that they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
their latter end!</hi> It is wiſdome to look to the future; hence they ſay, <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
is, <hi>qusſi porro videns,</hi> he ſeeth a farre off; but take any natural man, doth
all the wiſdome he hath, ever make him to attend to eternity? what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of him at the day of judgement? now he is at eaſe, and in good liking,
but what ſhall he do, when that great day ſhall come? he is farre from <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem</hi>'s
temper, thinking he heard alwaies that terrible noiſe ſounding in his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57719:124"/>
eares, <hi>Ariſe and come to judgement;</hi> Oh thy folly then! who doſt in effect ſay,
Give me that which is ſweet here, though hereafter I be tormented to all
eternity.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Thy folly is abundantly diſcovered in this, that thou takeſt no paines to know
the beſt things, the chiefeſt things, the things that moſt concerne thee.</hi> Naturally
thou knoweſt nothing of God, or Chriſt, or the way to heaven, which yet is
the proper end for which God made thee; if folly did not reign in thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

ſo that the folly of man naturally is ſeen in this, that he ſavoureth not the things

not part with the leaſt thing to obtain it.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>The mind hath loſt its ſuperiority in reſpect of the other parts of the</hi>

                           <hi>ſoul, and its ſubordination to God; both which were the great perfections thereof;</hi>
For ſuperiority and preheminency, the mind is now debaſed, and this light
is put now, not under a buſhel, but a dunghill. God indowed man with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
that it might be like a Queen in the ſoul, directing and ordering
all actions to true happineſs, Though the <hi>will</hi> be chief in <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy;</hi> yet
the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is in <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>counſel;</hi> Inſomuch, That the <hi>will</hi> is called
<hi>caeca potentia,</hi> a blind power of the ſoul, being eſſentially ſubordinated to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the dictates of the underſtanding; and if the <hi>will</hi> be thus ſubordinate, that
is called a rational power <hi>participativè,</hi> though not <hi>formaliter:</hi> no wonder
then if the ſenſitive and affectionate part of a man, his love, his grief, his anger,
theſe were not to riſe or ſtirre, but as the underſtanding did give orders to
them; Thus was the underſtanding of a man placed in him, as the Sunne in
the Firmament, to give light to all the powers of the ſoul; but now by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
corruption it's dethroned, it's ejected out of its power, and is made a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to every luſt that reigneth in the will, and the affections; hence it cometh
about, That whatſoever a mans corrupt heart carryeth him unto, preſently
the <hi>mind</hi> of man, being like a bribed advocate, pleadeth for the lawfullneſs
and the neceſſity of it. It is true indeed, we have a rule in Divinity, <hi>Nem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

poteſt credere, quia vult,</hi> No man can believe a thing to be true, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he will, but yet the will and affections can ſo divert the underſtanding,
or put miſts and pretences before it, that now it's become like the Sunne in a
foggy miſty day, that cannot put forth its light: ſo that if you do ask, <hi>What
is the true original cauſe of all heretical opinions, and corrupt practiſes?</hi> you may
ſay, It's becauſe the mind doth not keep up its primitive power. As the reaſon
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57719:125"/>
given in the <hi>Judges,</hi> why ſo much Idolatry and other wickedneſſe was
committed, was, becauſe <hi>there was no King</hi> (no Governour) <hi>in Iſrael,
every one did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> Thus if you aske,
Whence is that confuſion in a mans opinion, in a mans practices? It's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the mind of a man is degraded, the will is carried out to what it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
every ſinfull affection and paſſion doth what it pleaſeth; So that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all our affections and actions ſhould have their firſt riſe from the guidance
of the minde; Now our luſts and affections doe firſt move, and then the
underſtanding is imployed to defend and excuſe the lawfulneſſe of them: Oh
then bewail this ſad deſolation come upon thee! Thy minde and judgement
are become ſlaves and vaſſals to every unlawfull way, to plead for that,
to defend that, to excuſe that: Thus (as the Scripture) when it ſpeaketh
of a civil deſolation, making a confuſion upon the Governours thereof,
ſaith, <hi>The heavens are turned into blackneſſe,</hi> or, <hi>The Sunne and Moon into
blood;</hi> ſo it is now upon the face of a mans ſoul; if reaſon and judgement
were ſtrong enough to doe their office, there would not be that inſolency
of the affections, and rebellion in our wils, which doth now wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
us.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond thing in this particular is, <hi>The ſubordination of it to God, and to
his Rule.</hi> The mind of a man did then wholly follow the Rule God had preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
it. To believe, to think, to judge, as the Rule was, but now it's become
heretical. It's prone to chooſe an opinion of its own, a Doctrine of its own;
Although the word <hi>Hereſie</hi> in it ſelf, ſignifie neither good or evil, and therefore
in <hi>Euſebius, Conſtantine</hi> applieth it to the Chriſtian Religion, calling it hereſie, as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> doth the Chriſtian Religion <hi>Secta,</hi> a Sect; yet in Eccleſiaſtical Writers,
if not conſtantly in the Scripture, it is uſed in an ill ſenſe, and ſignifieth an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or adhering to a way of our own deviſing, and not that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God. <hi>Tertullian</hi> cals <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne <hi>hereſin,</hi> becauſe committed of his
own choice againſt Gods will: Inſomuch that though there may be many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cauſes of hereſies, as ignorance, pride, diſcontent, covetouſneſs, and
ſuch carnal principles; yet the main is, that proneneſs in the mind to lift up it
ſelf againſt God and his Rule, having loſt its primitive ſubordination to God.
This want of ſubordination to God and the Scriptures, is notably ſeen in Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
who when they perceive Scripture againſt them, rather then ſubmit, they
will be guilty of Scripture-ſlaughter, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> called it, <hi>Marcion</hi> (ſaith he)
cometh not with <hi>Stilo ſed Machara,</hi> draweth his ſword, and detruncateth a
great part of Scripture: Others, though not ſo audacious, yet becauſe they
will not ſubmit, do not <hi>Materiam ad Scripturas,</hi> but <hi>Scripturas,</hi> and <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

good and right, when indeed we are abominable and loathing to God; Whence is
it that every mans ways are clean in his own eyes? Whence is it that every man is a

pollution is this, to deceive our ſelves about God, about ſin, about godlineſs,
our own ſouls? So that when we can have a pretence, or a colour to juſtifie our

<hi>Deceiving your own ſelves, putting a fallacy,</hi> or a <hi>falſe ſyllogiſme</hi> upon our

a man impoſeth upon himſelf; Doth not <hi>Preſumption</hi> argue <hi>à diviſis ad
conjuncta,</hi> from the means divided, yet to obtain the end? Yea, in every
prayer, in every religious duty the natural man taketh, <hi>Non cauſam pro cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ,</hi>
becauſe he performeth theſe duties, he thinketh he ſerveth God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is not an holy principle, or gracious motive putteth him upon them,
but formality, cuſtomarineſſe, or ſome other inferiour motive; Thus every
natural man deceiveth himſelf by falſe cauſes, he thinketh he repents, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
God, he hath a good heart, he ſhall be ſaved, when alas all this while
thou art deceived, and deceiving of thy ſelf; Mourne then under this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-pollution,
that thou art ſo deceived in all things about thy ſelf, about
the work of grace, about what is fleſh, and what is ſpirit, that thou art
deluded in all things, and takeſt counterfeit for that which is true and genuine.
Under this head we may comprehend all that craft and ſubtilty in men (as in the
<hi>Jeſuites</hi>) to maintain Idolatry or Hereſie; For the Devil as at firſt, ſo ſtill he
delights to uſe Serpents, becauſe they are more crafty then others; The
craft alſo in man naturally to do miſchief, (for which they are compared in
Scripture to <hi>Foxes,</hi>) doth declare, how original ſinne hath all over infected
the mind.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, The great pollution of original ſinne upon our minds is ſeen, <hi>In the</hi>

                           <hi>proneneſſe to vain, idle, ſinfull and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>oving thoughts, ſo that theſe do diſcover
an unclean fountain of the heart more then any thing.</hi> Whence do theſe ſparks
ariſe, but from that furnace of ſinne within thee? The Air is not fuller of Flies;
<hi>Aegypt</hi> was not fuller of Frogs, then every mans heart is naturally of idle, vain,
fooliſh and impertinent thoughts; <hi>Thoughts,</hi> they are the <hi>immediate product</hi> and
<hi>iſſue</hi> of original ſinne; The firſt born, they are ſtreams that come immediately
from the fountain: Now certainly, if a man had by nature an holy ſanctified
mind, he would alſo have holy and ſanctified thoughts. Think you that <hi>Adam</hi>
in integrity, or the good Angels are troubled with thoughts as we are? For all
the while a man is natural, he never had a good thought in him, he might have a
thought of good, but not a good thought; For as every <hi>Cogitatio mali,</hi> is not
<hi>Cogitatio malâ.</hi> We may think of evil to abhorre and deteſt, and this thought
of evil is good; So in a natural man, though he may have a thought about good,
yet it is not in a good manner, and therefore evil, though the object matter be
good; What then will proſtrate thee, and make thee lie grovelling upon the
ground, loathing thy ſelf, if this do not? Amongſt the millions and millions of
thoughts which thou haſt, there is not one, but it is either vain, proud, idle, or
impertinent; yea our thoughts are not in our own power, no more then the
birds that flie in the air, but they ariſe antecedently to our own will and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
And certainly, if vain thoughts be ſuch a burden to a regenerate man, if
they do captivate and inthrall him, which made one cry out, <hi>Libenter (Domine)
bonus eſſe vellem, ſed cogitationes meae non patiuntur,</hi> I would gladly be good, but
my thoughts will not ſuffer me; No wonder, if to the natural man, who is
under the power of original ſinne, that ſinfull thoughts hurry him away without
any reſiſtance.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, <hi>Original pollution doth greatly defile the mind of a man in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
                           <hi>and inſtability of it?</hi> Inſomuch that the judgement of every natural
man, deſtitute of true light and faith, which doth onely conſolidate the ſoul, is
like a reed ſhaken with every wind; he is mutable and various, ready every day,
or every year to have a new Faith, and a new Religion; This maketh the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
inform us, That one end of the Miniſtry, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14. is, <hi>That we be not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57719:126"/>
carried away with every wind of Doctrine;</hi> Such empty ſtraws and feathers are
we, that any new opinion doth preſently ſeduce us; and therefore the Scripture
doth preſs a <hi>ſound mind,</hi> and <hi>an heart eſtabliſhed with grace,</hi> which is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
preſervative againſt ſuch inſtability. <hi>Aquinas</hi> maketh this the reaſon of the
good Angels confirmation in grace, and that they cannot now ſinne, becauſe ſuch
is the perfection and immutability of their natures, that what their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doth once adhere unto, they cannot change. Indeed it is thus with God, that
his knowledge is unchangeable, but there is no reaſon to attribute this to Angels,
and therefore their confirmation in good, is not ſo much to be attributed to any
intrinſecal cauſe in themſelves, as to the grace of God eſtabliſhing them; But
how farre ſhort was man newly created of ſuch immutability? How much more
then man fallen? From this pollution it is, that we have ſo many apoſtates, that
there are <hi>Seekers,</hi> that there are ſo many <hi>Neutrals,</hi> that there are ſo many who
think any, in any Religion may be ſaved. It is true, there may be a juſt cauſe of
changing our minds in Religion, as when educated in <hi>Popery,</hi> or when we have
received any <hi>heretical opinions,</hi> but I ſpeak here of that inſtability which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in the mind of a man, that though he be in the truth, yet there is a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to deſert it, and to diſcover much lenity in the matters of Religion. The
<hi>Remonſtrants</hi> go too farre this way, commending this ſinfulneſſe under the name
of modeſty and humility, and therefore, though in Fundamentals they will grant
we may ſay, <hi>This our faith is, This we doe believe,</hi> yet in other points (which
though not fundamentals, yet the errors about them may greatly derogate from
the glory of Chriſt and his grace, as alſo much prejudice the conſolations of thoſe
who truly fear God, as their opinions do.) They commend thoſe expreſſions,
<hi>Ita nobis videtur,</hi> and <hi>Salvo meliorum judicio.</hi> It is our <hi>ſententia,</hi> not our <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi>
Now if this were ſaid only in ſome points, diſputed amongſt the Orthodox,
that are at a great diſtance from Fundamentals, it might be received; but
they extend this further, if not to the foundation-ſtones, yet to thoſe that
immediately joyn to them, and ſo do <gap reason="foreign">

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Tenthly, <hi>Original ſinne doth pollute the mind of a man with pride and vain-glory,
ſo that he is eaſily puffed up with his own conceits, and altogether ignorant of his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi>
The Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. ſaith of ſome, <hi>Vainly puffed up with a fleſhly
mind.</hi> This <hi>Tumor,</hi> this <hi>Tympany</hi> in the mind hath been the cauſe of moſt <hi>hereſies</hi>
in the Church. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> boaſted in their knowledge, and had their name
from it. The <hi>Eunomians</hi> did vainly and blaſphemouſly brag, <q>That they knew
God, as well as he knew himſelf.</q> And ſome in theſe later dayes have not been
afraid to compare themſelves above the Apoſtles for gifts and illuminations. So
that whereas every one ſhould with wiſe <hi>Augur,</hi> ſay humbly, <hi>I have not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of a man, I am more bruitiſh then any man:</hi> Or with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when
one admiring his learning uſed this expreſſion, <hi>Nihil te latet;</hi> he anſwered again,
<hi>Nihil triſtius legi,</hi> becauſe he knew the falſhood of it, becauſe of his ignorance
even in innumerable places of Scripture: They equalize themſelves to Angels,
yea to God himſelf. This pride, this ſelf-conceit is a worm bred in the roſe, and
the more parts men have, the more doth this diſeaſe increaſe. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>
relateth of a great Scholar, much admired for his learning, who in his Lectures
once in the Schools, proving the Divine Nature, and alſo Incarnation of Chriſt
with mighty applauſe, did moſt arrogantly ſay, <q>That Chriſt was beholding to
him for this Diſpute, that he owed, as it were his Divine Nature to his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if he had not been God, if he had not proved it;</q> upon which blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57719:126"/>
he was immediately ſtricken with ignorance, and ſuch ſottiſhneſſe, that
he was afterwards taught the Lords Prayer by a little childe. This pride
of minde is worſe then all other pride; And certainly that is a great effect
of original ſinne upon us, that we are apt to take ſuch contemplative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
about our own notions and apprehenſions, being therein guilty of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
fornication. This pride of minde is ſeen alſo in owning and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
even the truths of God, not as his, but as they are our own opinions,
out of which we may raiſe our owne glory, whereas truth is not mine, of
thine, or a third mans, but the Lords, <hi>Cave ne privatum dixeris ne à veritate
privemur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Original ſinne polluteth the mind in regard of the difference and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi>

in the ſtate of integrity, all had been of one mind, of one way: In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
alſo, when all imperfection ſhall be done away, they ſhall all think and ſpeak
the ſame things; but now there are diviſions and different ways in Religion, one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
that which another condemneth, which proclaimeth that man hath a <hi>Babel</hi>
upon his underſtanding. It is no wonder, that among <hi>Philoſophers</hi> there were ſuch
infinite Sects; for if you view that part of the world which owneth the Chriſtian
Religion, what varieties, what differences, what oppoſitions are there, and
that though we have the Scripture to guide us? This doth evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
That the mind of man is filled with deep pollution by original
ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Twelfthly, <hi>The horrible pollution of the mind is ſeen in its aptneſſe to receive all</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
                           <hi>the Devils impreſſions and deluſions, ſo that the moſt horrid and dreadfull blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that can be imagined, have yet been entertained and broached by ſome men.</hi>
Now the Devil could never poſſeſſe the mind of a man ſo, but becauſe of this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
corruption. Some there were called <hi>Caiani,</hi> that boaſted of <hi>Cain,</hi> and
commended <hi>Eſau,</hi> yea <hi>Judas,</hi> and that he did not ſinne in betraying Chriſt.
Some have called the holy Trinity, <hi>Triceps Cerberus.</hi> Some have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Chriſt, and the Spirit of God. Now how could theſe devilliſh deluſions be
ever believed, if the mind had been free from ſinne? The <hi>Enthuſiaſmes;</hi> The
Revelations that the <hi>Monaſterii Anabaptis,</hi> as alſo <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leiden</hi> pretended
to, upon which they acted reſolutely and violently, may abundantly teach
us, what monſtrous births the minde of a man will deliver, if left to it ſelf:
So that what is ſaid of the Devil <hi>incubus,</hi> bodily, is much more true of
the minde: What will not the underſtanding of a man believe, and be
reſolute for, when it hath once, (<hi>Pleniorem gratiam à Diabolo</hi>) obtained
more of the Devils grace, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks ironically of ſome Heretiques,
<hi>De praeſc.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirteenthly, <hi>In this is original pollution diſcovered, that the knowledge we</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
                           <hi>have, and the light we enjoy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether imbred or acquired, without Gods grace we
are the worſe for it;</hi> So that our underſtanding in us is but like a ſword in a mad
mans hand, by it we fight againſt God, and ſet with all enmity againſt divine
things. The more knowledge without grace, the greater oppoſition to Chriſt.
The learned men very often have been the Patriarchs of all hereſies; They
brought in a <hi>Stoieum, Platonicum, Dialecticum Chriſtianiſmum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>
ſpeaketh; They brought in a <hi>Platonical,</hi> an <hi>Ariſtotolical</hi> Chriſtianity: Inſomuch
that Religion hath ſuffered farre more from unſound learning then ignorance,

he retaineth much knowledge, called therefore <gap reason="foreign">

It's this that makes ſuch an obſtruction in converſion, which is wrought firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

there, no Miniſtry, no Preaching doth any good: Oh that thou didſt know thy

(as it were) to go to the bottom of the putrified ſore, that no unſound

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57719:128"/>
in furious fits to be like one acted with a divine ſpirit and rapture. Now
this famous brand he ſtigmatizeth the <hi>Cretians</hi> with, That <hi>they were alwayes
liars,</hi> &amp;c. And although <hi>Epemenides,</hi> being a <hi>Cretian,</hi> it might be retorted
that he lied in ſaying, The <hi>Cretians</hi> were lyars, yet the ſpeech is to be underſtood
not of every one, but of the general part, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This
witneſſe is true;</hi> From whence <hi>Aquinas</hi> gathereth, <q>That whereſoever there
is any truth, a Doctor in the Church may make his uſe of it, becauſe all truth
is of God.</q> The uſe here is not ſo much for confirmation, as conviction; if
you ask, Why muſt theſe <hi>Cretians</hi> be ſo ſharply rebuked for their Doctrine about
Jewiſh Ceremonies, ſeeing <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. The Apoſtle doth there preſcribe another
deportment to ſuch (<hi>viz.</hi>) of for bearance and condeſcenſion? The Anſwer is,
Thoſe that are there ſpoken of, were ſuch as did erre out of infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but theſe in <hi>Crete</hi> were ſuch as did obſtinately and pertinaciouſly defend
theſe falſe Doctrines, therefore they muſt be ſeverely dealt with, yet the end of
this cenſure is medicinal, <hi>That they may be ſound in the faith,</hi> all errour is a
ſickneſſe and a diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle having thus informed about <hi>Titus</hi> his duty, he proceedeth to
ſome Doctrinal Inſtruction about thoſe erroneous opinions, inſtancing in one,
which was greatly controverted in the Infancy of the Church, and that is about
the choice of <hi>meats</hi> and <hi>abſtinence</hi> from them. To obviate any corrupt Doctrine
herein, he layeth down this weighty Propoſition, <hi>To the pure all things are pure,</hi>
that is, to ſuch who are ſanctified by the Chriſtan ſaith, and are righly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in Chriſtian liberty, all things (<hi>viz.</hi>) of this kind (not adultery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
or ſuch ſinnes) are pure to them, they may lawfully uſe them: Every
creature as the Apoſtle elſwhere, being ſanctified by the Word of God and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
This Truth he amplifieth by the contrary Propoſition, <hi>To the defiled and
unbelieving, nothing is pure,</hi> this is more then if he had ſaid, All things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
for that might have been limited, as in the former to things of this kind,
but ſaying, that nothing is pure to them, is ſignified hereby, that all is pitch (as
it were) that the, touch; That like a Leper, even good things do not purifie
them, but they defile them: And then you have the cauſe and fountain of this,
<hi>Even their mind and conſcience is defiled;</hi> No wonder the ſtreams are polluted,
when the fountains are: By <hi>mind,</hi> is meant the <hi>ſpeculative part</hi> of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by <hi>conſcience,</hi> the <hi>practical part;</hi> and therefore having ſpoken of the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the former, we now proceed to the later.</p>
                        <p>This Text is deſervedly brought by Proteſtant Authors to prove, that all the
actions of unregenerate perſons, and much more of Infidels, are altogether ſinne,
that there is not one truly-good action to be found amongſt them, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the mind and coſcience is thus all over polluted. The Popiſh Interpreters,
becauſe they are for the <hi>Negative,</hi> yea ſome going ſo farre, as to plead for the
<hi>ſalvation of Infidels, though without the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> do limit the Text
too much, as if it were onely to be underſtood of thoſe whoſe minds were not
informed with true knowledge, nor their conſciences rightly guided in thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
about Judaical Ceremonies, as if to ſuch only all things were unclean; but
although theſe perſons gave the occaſion, yet the Apoſtle maketh an univerſal
Propoſition, and therefore he doth not onely ſay, the <hi>defiled,</hi> but <hi>unbehevers,</hi>
which comprehends all thoſe that have no true knowledge of Chriſt; and the
reaſon is univocally belonging to every one, for every mans mind and conſcience
without ſaith is polluted, and cannot pleaſe God.</p>
                        <p>The Fountain thus cleared, this ſtreame of Doctrine floweth from it,
(<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the conſciences of all men by nature are polluted and defiled; Even their

remaineth no hope (as it were) for them, when the foundations are thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.

                           </gap>, a <hi>weak conſcience,</hi> but that the godly may have.
The <hi>conſcience</hi> were are to treat upon is the <hi>defiled one,</hi> and that not ſo much as made
more impure and ſinfull by voluntary impieties, as what it is by nature in evey
one; And before we come to demonſtrate the pollution of it, it is good to take
notice of the nature of it. The New Teſtament uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> about
thirty times, and that for conſcience. In the Old Teſtament the Hebrew word
<hi>Madani</hi> is once rendred, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. by <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, but moſt commonly that
which in the New Teſtament is called <hi>conſcience</hi> in the old is called <hi>Leb,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi>
of a man: So <hi>Davia</hi>'s heart is ſaid to <hi>ſmite him, apponere ad cor,</hi> and <hi>redire,</hi> and
<hi>cor,</hi> are nothing, but the acts of conſcience, and thus ſometimes in the New
Teſtament, 1 <hi>John 3. 20. If our heart condemn us.</hi> It's obſerved that the firſt
ſignification of the word <hi>Leb,</hi> is a <hi>conſperſion,</hi> or <hi>meal ſprinkled with water:</hi>
Thus the heart of a man is a lump (as it were) watered and ſprinkled with
ſome common principles and apprehenſions about God, and what is good and
evil: As for the nature of conſcience it ſelf, it is not good to be too nice in Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical
Diſputes about it, remembring that of <hi>Bernard,</hi> There was <hi>Multum ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi>
but <hi>param conſcientiae</hi> in the world. It's diſputed, Whether conſcience be
a power or an habit, or an act onely? that it is not a power <hi>Aquinas</hi> proveth,
becauſe that can never be removed, or laid aſide, or changed, whereas conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may; Some ſay therefore it's an <hi>habit,</hi> others, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Ames,</hi>
anſwering M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Perkins</hi> his Objection, Why it cannot be an act, that it is an act?
But certainly, as <hi>ſcientia</hi> is ſometimes taken for that which is by way of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or habit in man, and ſometimes for that which is by way of act; So alſo it is
with conſcience, it taketh into its nature both that practical habit (called by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,
Intellectus,</hi> or the habit of firſt principles) and alſo the <hi>actual</hi> applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, for if conſcience were not habitual, as well as in act; There were
no conſcience in men when they are aſleep, which yet cannot be denied unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
perſons: So that as in Scripture, ſaith and love are taken ſometimes
for the habit of thoſe graces, ſometimes for the acts of them; ſo alſo conſcience
is taken both for the principle, and the act it ſelf; For to the acting of conſcience
there is required (as all obſerve) a practical <hi>Syllogiſme:</hi> Thus, <hi>Whoſoever is a
fornicator, a drunkard, a curſer, cannot inherit the kingdom of God: But I am
ſuch a ſinner: Therefore I cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> Or on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>To him that believeth, and is of a broken contrite heart, pardon of ſinne is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:
But I believe and am of a broken heart: Therefore to me pardon of ſinne is
promiſed.</hi> Thus conſcience is well called <hi>the practical underſtanding,</hi> for whereas
the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> hath for its <hi>object,</hi> that which is meerly true; this looketh upon it as
ordinable to action, as ſuch a truth is to be brought into particular application.
To every acting then of conſcience compleatly, there is required a <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi>
either <hi>interpretative</hi> or <hi>formal;</hi> And as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith well, <q>Conſcience in
the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition is <hi>Lex,</hi> in the Aſſumption it is <hi>Teſtis,</hi> in the Concluſion
it is <hi>Judex.</hi> In the firſt Propoſition, there it is by way of a <hi>Law,</hi> dictating
ſuch a thing to be true; In the <hi>Minor</hi> it is a <hi>Witneſſe,</hi> bearing witneſs either
againſt or for our ſelves; And laſtly, it is a <hi>Judge</hi> paſſing ſentence according to
the premiſſes;</q> And in that it is called conſcience it doth relate to another, a
knowledge with another, that is either our ſelves; ſo that conſcience in its act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
is conceived as a perſon, as it were, diſtinct from us, and ſo that witneſſeth
with our hearts, what we are, and what we have done; Hence if a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
lay a ſinne to his charge, though all the world free, him, yet he beareth
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57719:129"/>
guilt and terrour about with him, <hi>Quid proderit tibi non habere conſcium ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benti
conſcientiam,</hi> or elſe, which is more probable, it is called conſcience, or
<hi>knowledge with,</hi> in reſpect of God: So that in the actings of conſcience, there
is a ſenſe and apprehenſion of the knowledge of God, and his preſence; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſcience doth alwayes bear ſome aſpect to God, this God will ſee, this
God will puniſh, this God hath forbidden, and therefore let me betime take
heed how I do it; So that while conſcience hath any ſtirrings and vigorous act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
there is ſome hope in a man. Although it be thus generally received by all,
that conſcience belongs to the underſtanding, yet <hi>Durand</hi> makes it ſomething
probable (<hi>Lib. 2. Diſtinct. 39. Quaſt.</hi> 4.) <q>That if it be not the will, yet the
will is neceſſarily included in the workings of conſcience, ſo that conſcience
doth denote underſtanding and will alſo;</q> For that act of conſcience which is
called <hi>remordere,</hi> to bite and ſting a man, to make him grieve and be ſad upon the
committing of ſinne, muſt flow from the will.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Although man hath loſt the Image of God, and be thus all over
polluted, <hi>Yet he hath not leſt, neither his ſoul, or the faculties thereof with
ſome imbred principles both ſpeculative and practical, which can no more be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the ſoul, then the beams from the Sunne.</hi> Hence that habit of
practical principles, ſuch as, that there is a <hi>God,</hi> that he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,
that <hi>Parents</hi> are to be honoured, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>à conſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
becauſe theſe are kept and preſerved ſtill, or rather as <hi>Martinius</hi> in his
<hi>Lexicon</hi> out of <hi>Hierom,</hi> becauſe theſe do inſtigate and incline to keep us from
ſinne in our actions. The <hi>Scholmen</hi> commonly call it <hi>Synderiſis,</hi> and ſay, It is
as much as <hi>con-electio,</hi> but this is, becauſe of their ignorance of the Greek tongue.
Theſe <hi>Reliques</hi> of Gods Image are leſt in us ſtill, even as after ſome great fire of
a ſtately Pallace, there remain ſome ſparks long after; or in the demoliſhing of
glorious Towns, there will ſome <hi>rudera,</hi> ſome remnants appear of ſuch a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
It is true, This is queſtioned by ſome, <hi>Illyricus</hi> out of his vehement deſire
to aggravate ſinne, denieth there is any ſenſe or knowledge of a God left in a
man more then in a bruit, and endeavoureth to anſwer thoſe places of Scripture,
which are brought to prove thoſe common principles, or implanted knowledge
in a man by nature. The <hi>Socinians</hi> alſo, (though plowing with another heifer) do
deny any implanted knowledge by a God, but that it comes by ſame and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
On the other ſide <hi>Pelagians, Arminians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> fall into another
<hi>extream,</hi> for they hold ſuch principles about God, and what is good, <hi>that they
may be light enough to guide us to ſalvation.</hi> It is not my work now to examine
either of theſe, for the truth is between theſe two. There are ſome implanted
practical notions in us about God, and what is good, agaiſt thoſe that erre in
the <hi>defect,</hi> and yet they are no wayes able to conduct to eternal happineſs againſt
thoſe that erre in the <hi>exceſſe.</hi> To prove this will be to anticipate my ſelf in the
protract of this Diſcourſe about original ſinne; Therefore here only we take it
for granted, That there are ſuch principles, as alſo a conſcience to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
good and evil, which though it be greatly polluted, <hi>Yet this candle of the
Lord,</hi> (as it is called, <hi>Prov 20. 27. ſearching the inward things of a man</hi>) is not
quite extinct, Whether theſe common principles, are naturally propagated as
the body is, (as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſay, who hold the <hi>Traduction of ſouls from parents</hi>)
or, whether they are <hi>De Novo</hi> created in the creation of the ſoul, as the diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
party from that opinion muſt hold, is not here to be debated, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That the ſoul hath a <hi>natural teſtimony in it ſelf about God,</hi> and therefore in
ſudden calamities doth immediately cry out to him, which made <hi>Tortullian</hi> ſay, O
anima naturaliter Chriſtiana!</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Becauſe conſcience doth thus witnes with God, and as it were in Gods ſtead;</hi>
Hence it is, <hi>That is hath ſuch a command and power over a man, that we muſt not go
againſt conſcience:</hi> We may go againſt our wils, againſt our affection, but we muſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57719:129"/>
not go againſt our <hi>conſciences,</hi> no not when they are <hi>erroneous,</hi> and though
they dictate ſinne, as <hi>Rom. 14. ult. Whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne; and be
that doubteth, is condemned;</hi> conſcience is but an inferior Judge, God and the
Scripture are ſuperior to it; ſo that when conſcience preſcribeth any thing,
and we come to know it is againſt Gods Word, then we are to reject it, as the
inferior Magiſtrates command is made void, when the ſuperior doth counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but while the practical dictate of conſcience doth abide, and we know
not that God doth forbid it, then we muſt not go againſt it; and the reaſon is,
becauſe it witneſſeth to our apprehenſion with God; and therefore to go
againſt it, though it may not be <hi>materially</hi> a ſinne, becauſe in an error, and
in a deluſion, yet <hi>formally</hi> it is, becauſe we contemne God and his Authority over
us: The very Heathen could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, conſcience
is a God to every man. It is true, that Atheiſtical Writer, (<hi>lib de Cive.</hi>) As
he doth moſt prophanely determine, <hi>That it is a ſeditious opinion, to hold faith
and holineſs are ſupernaturally infuſed and inſpired; ſo alſo to hold, that to diſcern
between good and bad, juſt and unjuſt, is a duty belonging to the conſcience of
private men, in what they are to act.</hi> What is this, but to reach men Atheiſm

the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, as being incompatible with obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

ſo great power and authority, ſeeing by it, good is to be done, and ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
the pollution of it will be the more dreadfull, and lamentable: what
hope is there of mans power to convert himſelf to God, when the conſcience
is thus waſted by ſinne? If the watchman be blind, if the witneſs be dumb, if
the judge be corrupted, How can any ſaying reformation be upon us? If the

to be caſt away? this ſhipwrack of a good conſcience, which all made in

Therefore here was a voluntary contracted blindneſs upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

yet had there not been ſuch imbred error upon the conſcience, ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

Oh then groan under this blindneſs that is naturally upon thy conſcience! That

That which ſhould be the rule to thy actions is all over crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
Thus every mans conſcience is naturally in the dark, and maketh us

                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">II. With Senſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity.</note> Conſcience is naturally polluted, not only by the blindneſs,
but alſo by the <hi>ſenſeleſſneſs and ſtupidity that is upon it.</hi> This is the evil polluted
conſcience, lying in every mans breaſt faſt aſleep; ſo that though one ſinne
be committed after another, Though luſts as ſo many thieves come to ſteal
thy ſoul away, yet this dog doth not ſo much as give one bark: Doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
abundantly confirme this? ſee you not moſt men going on in all evil
and wickedneſs, ſo that you would think they dare neither eat or drink or ſleep,
leſt ſo many Devils ſhould come and carry them quick to hell? yet they have
a ſtupified conſcience, it never giveth them one blow, or a check for it:
how cometh this ſerpent in thy breaſt to be thus benummed, that it doth not
give one hiſs? The expreſſion you heard of an evil conſcience, was a feared
one, That is (as ſome expound it) <hi>a ſenſeleſs hardened one, like any part of the
body that by burning is made inſenſible:</hi> Others ſay, <hi>That as a putrified part of the
member of the body by inciſion is cut off; ſo</hi> (they ſay) <hi>it</hi>'s <hi>a conſcience cut off
from a man, that he hath none at all.</hi> Others they allude thus, <hi>As brands and
markes of infamy are made by hot irons upon the ſhoulders and faces of ſtagitious
perſons; Thus it</hi>'s <hi>a conſcience that is branded and noted by all, whereby he is made
infamous and a reproach, where he liveth.</hi> All theſe explications may well be
taken in, and although the Apoſtle ſpeaketh there of ſome enormous wicked
men, more vile then ordinary, yet as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 3. doth apply, <hi>to all men
by nature,</hi> what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had ſpoken of ſome notorious, and moſt ungodly
enemies of the Church: becauſe the ſeed and root of theſe is in all; ſo we may
appropriate this feared conſcience to every man naturally, whereby a man
commits groſs and foul ſinnes, and yet finds not one prick or ſtab at his heart
for it; What made <hi>David,</hi> when he had numbered the people to have his
heart ſmite him preſently, but becauſe his conſcience was ſanctified and made
tender by God, whereas thou canſt a thouſand times fall into the ſame groſs-ſinnes,
and thy conſcience giveth thee not one laſh for it? Is not this becauſe
thy conſcience is ſtupified? ſo that it hath made thee in all thy ſinnes, as <hi>Lot</hi>
                           <pb n="227" facs="tcp:57719:130"/>
was, when made drunk by his daughters, <hi>He knew not in the morning what he
had done.</hi> Thus with the ſame ſtupidity and ſottiſhneſs doſt thou act ſinne, it
cometh from thee, as excrements from a dying perſon, and thou haſt no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of them: as in ſleep the ſtomack doth digeſt that meat, which if
waking would ſo moleſt it, that there would be no eaſe, till exonerated:
Thus while conſcience is aſleep, thoſe things are committed, which if it were
tender, it would with fear and trembling fly from. O men bitterly to be lamented
and mourned over! Conſcience which is ſet as a ſchoolemaſter to direct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove
thee, is become a flatterer, or rather lieth ſtark dead within thee, that
the Devil, and ſinne, in all the luſts thereof, may hurry thee whether they
pleaſe, and conſcience doth not contradict; ſo that you may as well offer
light to the blind, ſpeech to the deaf, wiſedome to the bruit beaſt, as publiſh
the great truths and commands of God to them, while conſcience is thus ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
within them; Therefore in converſion the firſt work of grace is to make
this tender, and ſenſible, even of the leaſt ſinne.</p>

                           <hi>THirdly, Becauſe this pollution of the conſcience is expreſſed in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
(viz.) <hi>blindneſs and ſtupidity.</hi> Let us examine how this ſinfullneſs
is ſeen in the ſeveral offices and actings of conſcience, for which God hath placed it
in the ſoul, <hi>And</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <hi>One main work of conſcience is, to apply, what we read in the Scripture as
generally ſpoken, conſcience is to apply it in particular.</hi> When it readeth the
threatnings and curſings of the law to ſuch ſinnes as thou art guilty of, then
conſcience is to ſay, This belongeth to me, This curſe, This burden, is my
curſe it's my burden: Becauſe <hi>David</hi> did not let his conſcience do its duty in
application. <hi>David</hi> could condemne ſinne in general, <hi>His wrath is kindled</hi>
againſt ſuch ſinners as himſelf in the general, <hi>Nathan</hi> was forced to be in ſtead
of conſcience to him, ſaying, <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> Thus conſcience, if not
polluted, when it heareth any woe denounced againſt ſuch and ſuch ſinnes,
then that ſtands up, and ſaith, Thou art the man; hence God giveth the
commands by particular application, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery; Thou
ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> that conſcience may ſay, This Commandment belongs to me;
As natural bodies they act by a corporal contact, ſo the Scripture worketh
upon the ſoul by a ſpiritual contact, and that is the application of conſcience;
Inſomuch that if we do a thouſand times read over the Scriptures, if we hear
Sermons upon Sermons all our life, if conſcience doth not apply, all becomes
ineffectual. And this may anſwer that Queſtion,</p>
                        <p>How it cometh to paſs that a man can commit thoſe ſinnes, which he knoweth to
be ſinnes, which his conſcience tells him are ſinnes? Who are there ſo much ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and beſotted by ſinne, that do not in the general know, that the waies they live
in are wicked, that they provoke God, that they ought not to do ſo? How then is
it poſſible, that they ſhould cloſe with thoſe ſinnes that they know to be ſo, ſeeing
the will cannot will evil, as it is evil.</p>
                        <p>Now the Anſwer is, This ariſeth from the defect of conſcience, ſhe doth
not particularly make ſuch a powerfull application <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> as it ought
to do; There is therefore a general knowledge, an habitual knowledge of
ſuch things to be ſinnes; yea it may be a particular apprehenſion, that they
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57719:131"/>
are now ſinning and offending God; but this is onely a ſpeculative apprehenſion,
it's not a practical one produced by conſcience in thee: Oh therefore that
all our Auditors were delivered from this original pollution of conſcience, for
therefore we preach in vain, and you hear in vain, becauſe no application is
made to your own hearts! None brings the truth, the command, the threatning
to his own ſoul, ſaying, This is my portion, none ſo guilty as I am in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and thus (as ſhe ſaid to the Prophet) <hi>Thou haſt brought my ſinnes to
my mind;</hi> or as the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> concerning Chriſt, <hi>He had told her of
all that ſhe had done:</hi> Thus faith the applying conſcience, This Sermon brings
my ſinnes to my mind, This Sermon tels me of the wickedneſſe at ſuch a time
committed by me: It was the Prophets complaint of his hearers, <hi>None ſaid,
What have I done?</hi> They did not make a particular application; Therefore till
the grace of God quicken the conſcience, making thee to cry out, <hi>What ſhall I
do, I have ſinned?</hi> Gods Word hath found me out; It is me the Law condemneth;
It is me that the curſes belong to, as if I were mentioned and named, as if I had
heard a voice from Heaven, ſaying, Thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> Thou <hi>John,</hi> here is thy ſin,
here is thy doom; Till (I ſay) this be done, all thy knowledge in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
all the Texts of Scripture in thy memory, they have no influence
at all.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Herein is the corruption of the conſcience naturally ſeen, <hi>That
though it doth apply, yet it is in ſo weak and cold a manner, that it hath loſt
its activity and predominancy over the affections and the will of a man:</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that though conſcience do ſpeak, do rebuke, do apply, yet a man careth
not for it; The affections and the will are not kept in awe by it: Thus although
conſcience in many doth not ſo much as ſtirre, it is ſtark dead, yet in many it doth
ſometimes apply, bringing home the Word of God to the heart, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but confeſſe, if he doth thus and thus he ſinneth, but then conſcience is too
weak, affections and paſſions like <hi>Amnon</hi> to <hi>Tamar</hi> are too ſtrong, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
her, whether ſhe will or no: Is not this the dreadfull condition of many,
who frequent our Congregations, whoſe conſciences condemn them daily? Thou
art ſuch a ſinner, thy wayes are damnable, but they ſlight and deſpiſe theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of conſcience, as rude Scholars the authority of their Maſter; what
care they for the Monitor in their breaſt? Like <hi>Balaam</hi> they will preſs forward
to their wickedneſs, though conſcience ſtand like an Angel with a ſword in his
hand to ſtop in the way. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh excellently to this
purpoſe, <hi>They detain the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> they keep conſcience a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
gladly would that do its duty, but they impriſon and ſhackle it; now this
<hi>weakneſſe</hi> is come upon conſcience by original ſinne, otherwiſe <hi>Samſon</hi> like, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could bind that, but it would command the will and affections, yea the
whole man to obey it: Oh the pitifull eſtate then of ſuch men, who are ſinners
againſt conſcience, prophane againſt conſcience, whoſe luſts are ſtronger then
their conſcience! As it is with ſome poor priſoners, they go up and down with
their Keeper; Thus do theſe men, they go from place to place, from company
to company to commit their ſins, and conſcience as their keeper followeth them
up and down, only they deſpiſe and contemn the dictates of it, which will be wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the later end.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Though conſcience may apply, <hi>Yet as it doth it weakly and faintly,
ſo alſo ſeldom, and not conſtantly, nor daily.</hi> The Cock crew once or twice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Peter</hi> remembred himſelf; Conſcience may apply once or twice, yet the
noiſe of luſts drown the voice of it. Therefore unleſſe it ſpeak frequently, unleſs
it be applying often, as the Prophet did three times to the dead child, there will
not be any ſpiritual life procured: Thus you have the conſciences even of natural
men in ſome fits, under the expectations of ſome great and eminent judgements:
They finde the power of conſcience upon them, as <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi>
                           <pb n="229" facs="tcp:57719:131"/>
who trembled under <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching, but then this is a flaſh only; it's like
a ſudden clap of Thunder that terrifieth for the preſent, but when paſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
forgotten: Thus in fears of death, under ſome powerfull Sermon, thy
conſcience giveth a blow, a ſharp prick into thy heart, for the while thou art in
ſome agony, in ſome terror, but becauſe conſcience doth it not often, never giving
thee over, till it hath recovered thee, hence it is that thou returneſt to thy old ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
again.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, As conſcience naturally doth not its duty in applying, <hi>So neither
in witneſſing, in bearing teſtimony to our actions, which yet is one great end why
conſcience is put into a man.</hi> It is ordinarily ſaid, <hi>Conſcientia eſt mille teſtes;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is a thouſand witneſſes, and ſo indeed when it doth bear teſtimony to a
mans action, it's more then a thouſand, it's more then all the world; yea, it is
not only <hi>mille teſtes,</hi> but <hi>mille tortores,</hi> a thouſand tormentors, but (alas) it's
ſo defiled, that in many things, if not in all things, it faileth, and giveth (at leaſt)
no true witneſs at all; For if there were not this pollution upon it, With what a
loud voice would it cry to thee, ſaying, I know, and God knoweth, what are
the ſinnes that thou daily liveſt in? What little regard this witneſs hath, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That if men can accompliſh their impieties, and none behold them, if there
be no witneſſes to confirm it before men, they matter not at all, for the witneſs
that conſcience, and God can bear againſt them: Oh this vileneſs of thy heart,
that thou runneſt from the eyes of men, but not conſidereſt the eyes of God, and
of thy own conſcience that behold thee! Though indeed thy conſcience is for the
moſt part mute and ſpeechleſs, lets thee alone, do what thou wilt, it will not
witneſs againſt thee, but is bribed rather, and ſpeaks for thee, and flattereth thee.
Bewail then the ſinfulneſſe upon conſcience even in this very particular, that it
doth not bear witneſſe to thy evil actions, or when it doth, it is ſo coldly, and
languidly, that thou canſt hardly hear the voice of it, whereas, as the Prophet
(which is like an external conſcience in the Church) is, <hi>To lift up his voice like
a Trumpet, to inform of tranſgreſſions, and not to ſpare:</hi> Thus it ſhould be with
conſcience in thee; And as there is a <hi>woe</hi> to that people whoſe <hi>Paſtor</hi> is a <hi>dumb
dog,</hi> no leſſe is it to thoſe whoſe conſcience alſo is a dumb dog; So that though
the witneſſes and teſtimonies of conſcience againſt thy ſelf, and actions be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
and vexatious, thou canſt not eat, or drink, or ſleep for them, yet this
is more hopefull, and may be more preparatory to converſion, then when thy
conſcience will ſay nothing, or is corruptly bribed, ſaying to thee in all thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did to every one that came to him, <hi>That his cauſe was good;</hi>
but above all theſe cold and ſoft whiſperings of conſcience, as if that were afraid of
thee, more then thou of it, are notoriouſly diſcovered in the actings of ſecret
ſinne; For if thy iniquities be committed ſecretly, though thou liveſt in ſecret
uncleanneſs, in ſecret thieving and coſening in thy dealings, ſo that the world
doth not know it, thou thinkeſt all is well with thee: Now how could this be, if
conſcience did roundly bear witneſs to theſe ſecret ſinnes? This would as much
ſhame, affect and torment thee, as if all the world did know what thou haſt done
in private: Oh but this conſcience is muzzled! Or as was ſaid of <hi>Demoſthenei,</hi>
when he would not plead for a Clyent, but pretended a Quinſie in his throat, he
did <hi>Argentanginam pati;</hi> Thus thy conſcience hath ſwallowed a Camel into its
throat, and ſo ſpareth thee, and lets it alone: Otherwiſe if conſcience did his
office, thou who liveſt in ſecret ſins, wouldſt be more moleſted and diſquieted
by its continual teſtimonies againſt thee, then if all the Congregation had been
ſpectators of thy private wickedneſs; Therefore the pollution of the conſcience
by original ſinne, is fully proclaimed by all the hidden works of diſhoneſty, by
all the cloſe, ſecret ſinnes committed in the world; For were conſcience ready to
teſtifie, it would follow thee as cloſe as the ſhadow to the body, as <hi>Aſahel</hi> did
<hi>Joah:</hi> Oh then let ſuch clandeſtine ſinners be afraid! for though conſcience be
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57719:132"/>
now ſtupified, yet this will one day be the gnawing worme in thee that will
never die.</p>

God, that he hath left a conſcience in a man, for if that had not ſome actings,
there would be no humane ſocieties, the world would be like a Chaos as it was
at firſt, only conſcience is a bridle to men, and a curb to their impieties, but
when this is ſo corrupted, that it cannot do its office; though ſinnes be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

then thou art, but if clean and pure, then it will not favour thee; But as you
ſee it was with <hi>David,</hi> when he had numbred his people, preſently his heart ſmote
him, ſuch power it will alſo have over thee: This accuſation is called ſmiting,
becauſe of the ſtrong impreſſion it maketh upon the ſoul; Conſcience is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Book, and the Scripture may intend this as part, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 12. where at
the Day of Judgement it is ſaid, <hi>Books ſhall be opened, and the dead were to be
judged according to what is written in thoſe books;</hi> One of theſe books that muſt
be opened, and by which men ſhall be judged is conſcience, that is the debt-book,
the Dooms-day-book; There is no ſinne committed, but there it is ſet down
and regiſtred, and one day it will be found there, though now for the preſent
thou takeſt no notice of it: As conſcience is a book, ſo as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid (<hi>De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriori
domo) All books are to reform this book, all other books that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
yea the Bible it ſelf, they are to amend this book of conſcience.</hi> This book
thou art to read every day, yea conſcience is not only a book, but it's the Writer,
the Recorder alſo; Conſcience is the ſouls Secretary or Regiſter, and faithfully
ſets down every ſinne, <hi>Item,</hi> This day ſuch oaths, ſuch lies; <hi>Item,</hi> Such a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57719:132"/>
drunken fit; <hi>Item,</hi> Such omiſſion of duties; Thus conſcience ſhould do its work;
But oh how negligent and ſordid is conſcience herein! What foul acts may be
committed, and yet not the leaſt ſting or gripe of conſcience? We have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
inſtance of this in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren, when they had ſo cruelly and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
dealt with their brother, throwing him in a pit, and as to humane conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations'
fully deſtroyed him, yet faith the Text, <hi>They ſate down to eat and
drink;</hi> What preſently after ſuch an unnatural ſinne, to find no Scorpions in
their breſts, as it were, but to ſit down and eat? <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 37. 25. as if no evil had
been perpetrated; What an adamant or rock were theſe mens conſciences turned
into? And is not this the ſtate of many men, and that after the commiſſion of
ſuch ſins, which even nature may condemn for.</p>
                        <p>And as from the ſecond act, which is <hi>excuſing;</hi> here we have large matter to
treat upon, Who can comprehend the length, and depth, and breadth of the
evil of conſcience in this very thing? To excuſe, to clear, to juſtifie a mans ſelf:
Did not conſcience thus in the Jews of old? Did not conſcience thus in the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees?
Doth not conſcience thus in the breaſts of all civil and moral men? Whence
is it that they can ſay, <hi>God, I thank thee I am not as this Publican, I am no
drunkard or ſwearer,</hi> and therefore bid their ſouls, <hi>Take all reſt?</hi> Is not this
becauſe conſcience is turned into a Camelion, to be like every object that it ſtands
by? Thus it is with their conſcience excuſing all they do, flattering a man, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
His eſtate is good and ſecure, they are not ſuch ſinners as other men, whereas
if conſcience were well enlightned and informed out of Gods Word, in ſtead of
excuſing it would impartially accuſe and condemn.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Conſcience is polluted in a further acting which it hath, for when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
witneſſing and accuſing will not do, then it <hi>terrifieth,</hi> which you heard
was ſmiting. Conſcience fals from words to blows, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. It is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
expreſſed, <hi>They were pricked in heart,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, it was as if a dagger had
been ſtabb'd into them, and thus it did work upon <hi>Felix,</hi> inſomuch that it made
him tremble. Thus it did upon <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> Now conſcience naturally is
greatly polluted in this thing, for either it doth not at all give any blows, or if it
do, it is with ſlaviſh ſervile and tormenting thoughts, that it maketh the ſinner
runne from Chriſt, and doth indiſpoſe him for any mercy and comfort; But of
this more in it's time.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Conſcience hath a further and ultimate work or acting in a man,
and that is to <hi>judge</hi> It is a <hi>witneſſe,</hi> an <hi>accuſer</hi> and a <hi>Judge</hi> alſo. There is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
ſhould be erected in every mans heart, where conſcience is to ſit as Judge,
and this Court of conſcience is daily to be kept. This is no more then when <hi>Pſal,</hi>
4. we are commanded <hi>To commune with our own hearts, and be ſtill;</hi> when
we are commanded <hi>To ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> or 1 <hi>Cor. 11. To judge our
ſelves that we be not judged.</hi> This is the great duty which not onely Heathens
commended <hi>Noſce teipſum,</hi> and <hi>Tecum havita,</hi> and which another complaineth
of the neglect thereof, <hi>In ſe nemo tentat deſcendere,</hi> but it is very frequently
commanded in the Scripture, as the foundation and introduction into the ſtate of
converſion, as a conſtant duty in perſons converted to prevent Apoſtaſie. But
who is there that doth keep a daily Court thus in himſelf? That which <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Seneca,</hi> and Heathens have admired, To examine our ſelves, What have I
done to day? Wherein have I ſinned? In what have I exceeded? This Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
though inlightned by Gods Word, are horribly ſloathfull and careleſſe
about: When is this examination, this ſcruteny ſet up? When are thy actions,
thy thoughts called to the barre, and judgement given againſt them? Now this
judgement of conſcience is ſeen about a two-fold object, Our Actions, and our
Perſons; our Actions, they are to be judged, Whether they be agreeable with
the Word of God, or no? Whatſoever thou undertakeſt, and art not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of in conſcience as lawfull, is a ſinne, <hi>Rom. 14. Whatſoever is not of faith
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57719:133"/>
is ſinne:</hi> Now examine thy actions, thou prophane man; ſee whether they will
bear the Touchſtone or no: Doth thy conſcience tell thee, ſuch wayes are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
Art thou out of faith thus perſwaded to do? Look over all thy thoughts,
all thy words, thy actions, and weigh them in the balance of the Sanctuary; See
whether they be chaff or wheat; Judge them before God cometh to judge them:
As our Actions, ſo our Perſons, and the frame and conſtitution of our ſouls; and
here conſcience is more unable to do its work, then in the former; For actions
(at leaſt many of them) may be condemned by the light of nature, but when thou
comeſt to ſearch thy heart, to judge that, here is much heavenly skill and prudence
required: Did the hypocrite judge himſelf? Did the civil phariſaical man rightly
judge himſelf, what a mighty change would you quickly ſee on thoſe, who now
bleſſe themſelves in their good condition? Had <hi>Judas</hi> judged himſelf? Did hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
judge themſelves? Oh the amazement and aſtoniſhment they would be
in to ſee themſelves ſo ſoul and rotten in the bottom, when they were perſwaded
all had been well and happy with them! Let conſcience therefore ſet up her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
in thy heart, often call thy ſelf before thy ſelf, thy guilty ſell before
thy condemning ſelf, thy ſinfull ſelf before thy judging ſelf; for by reaſon of
conſcience a man cometh to have two ſelves; God hath placed it in man, as an
Umpire, or an Arbitrator, to judge the matter impartially between God, and
thy own ſoul, ſo that it may ſay that which Chriſt denied of himſelf, God hath
made me a Judge and a divider, to give to man what belongs to him, to God
what belongs to God; but conſcience being polluted, is not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
this office: Hence it is, that this Court ceaſeth, conſcience doth not
keep any Aſſize at all; There is no judgement executed within this ſpiritual
ſociety: Therefore let us groan under the weight of original ſinne in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
alſo.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Herein conſcience is greatly defiled by original ſinne, <hi>That it is afraid
of light,</hi> it is not willing to come to the Word, to be convinced, but deſireth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be in darkneſs, that ſo a man may ſinne the more quietly, and never be
diſquieted. <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come
into the World, and men love darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> As it is with the wicked
man, <hi>He hateth the light</hi> (as our Saviour, <hi>John 3. 20.) becauſe his works are
evil.</hi> Truly thus it is, conſcience being naught and rotten, therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be brought to the light: Hence <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. It is the work of Gods
ſpirit <hi>to convince the world of ſinne;</hi> but this is that the natural conſcience cannot
abide, it is unwilling to be ſearched and tried, to be ranſacked. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why men are moſt pleaſed with a formal, drouſie, flattering Miniſtry, they
rage at that which is powerfull, particular, heart-ſearching preaching; They
do not love conſcience ſhould be touched upon, to have that ſay, <hi>Thou arr the
man,</hi> and all is, becauſe conſcience is afraid of any light or conviction to come
upon it; for if that be enlightned, then thou canſt not with that delight and
ſecurity commit thy ſinnes, as thou wouldſt do; Conſcience then would belike
<hi>Michaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab.</hi> Thou wilt not abide it, becauſe it alwayes propheſieth evil
to thee, and therefore this one thing may diſcover the vileneſſe of every natural
mans conſcience, in that it deſireth to be in the dark, and that which the Church
ſaith to Chriſt, (<hi>Awake not my Beloved till he pleaſe;</hi>) They ſay to their conſcience,
Let not that be awakened, it will take away my comfort, it will make me deſpair,
and thus becauſe they wilfully keep a veil over their conſcience, it is no wonder if
they die in their ſins.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Herein conſcience is naturally defiled, <hi>That it is ſubject to many multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
ſhapes and diſguiſes,</hi> it doth appear under ſo many vizours, that it is
hard to know when it is conſcience, or when it is ſomething elſe, farre enough
from conſcience, yet ſuch is the guile and hypocriſie herein, that a man doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
flatter himſelf with the name of conſcience, when indeed it is corruption
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57719:133"/>
in him. It is good to diſcover that which is a counterfeit conſcience, that
which appeareth to be <hi>Samuel,</hi> and in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s cloaths, but is indeed a
Devil.</p>

                        <p>FIrſt, It may not be <hi>conſcientia,</hi> but <hi>cupiditas,</hi> not <hi>conſcience,</hi> but even a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
luſt</hi> may put thee upon many things, yet thou flattereſt thy ſelf with the
ſcared title of conſcience, ſaying, it's thy conſcience, when if thou didſt examine
thy ſelf, it would appear to be ſome corruption: A ſad miſtake and deluſion it is
to have conſcience, (and ſo God himſelf) abuſed, but yet it is very often ſo; We
ſee it in <hi>Saul,</hi> when he ſacrificed, and ſo was guilty of rebellion againſt God,
yet he pretended conſcience, that he had done well, and all was to ſerve God
thereby. <hi>Abſolom</hi> when he was contriving that unnatural rebellion againſt his
Father, he pretendeth a <hi>vow</hi> he had made, and ſo he muſt out of conſcience
perform that. <hi>Judas</hi> when he repined at the ointment poured out on Chriſts
body pretended conſcience and charity; but it was luſt and covetouſneſſe moved
him: Oh then take heed of treachery herein, leſt thou pretending conſcience it
appear to be thy luſt only.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It may be thy <hi>Fancy and Imagination,</hi> which perſwadeth thee, and
not thy conſcience, man conſiſting of a body as well as a ſoul, his imagination
and phantaſie hath great influence upon him, eſpecially when the body may be
diſtempered, as you ſee in melancholly perſons, when humbled for ſinnes, and
greatly afflicted, it is hard to diſcern when it is their fancy, and when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
that worketh in them. It is true, the prophaſie ones of the world, they
judge all the trouble and wounds of conſcience for ſinne to be nothing, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly
and a meer fancy, becauſe they never found the word of God kindly
working upon them, therefore they think there is no ſuch thing in the world, as
a wounded ſpirit, but ſuch will one day find that troubles of conſcience are more
then melancholly, that it is a worme alwayes gnawing, yea that this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
hell, for it is becauſe of a tormented conſcience, that hell is ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet though this be ſo, it cannot be denied, but that ſometimes in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
perſons there may be conſcience and melacholly working together, for
the Devil he loveth to move in troubled waters, and melancholly is called <hi>Balneum
Diaboli,</hi> but this may be cured and removed by medicinal helps, whereas conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is only pacified and quieted by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Cuſtome, education and prepoſſeſſed principles, theſe may work upon a
man, as if they were conſcience.</hi> Many men are affected in religious things, not
out of any conſcience, but meerly by cuſtome; They have been uſed to ſuch
things, brought up in ſuch a way of ſerving of God, and therefore they cry out,
to have ſuch uſages ſtill, and all becauſe cuſtome hath prevailed over them; Theſe
and ſuch like things may appear like conſcience in a man; ſo that our conſcience
muſt be greatly polluted, when the very ſubject it ſelf is not known, when we
cannot diſcern whether it be conſcience or corruption that doth inſtigate thee,
when we cannot <hi>Sentire illam, quae facit nos ſentire,</hi> Conſcience that maketh
us perceive other things that it ſelf is difficulty perceived. for that it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
but ſome other corrupt principle that moveth a man, will eaſily appear
in that it is mutable and changeable according to outward advantages, that which
was thy conſcience one moneth, is not the next, becauſe there are outward chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
When <hi>Shechem</hi> would be circumciſed, it was not for conſcience, but for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57719:134"/>
                           <hi>Dinah</hi>'s ſake whom he loved. When <hi>Jeroboam</hi> erected an Altar, it was not for
conſcience ſake, but carnal policy; So that the mutability of thy ſoul, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as advantages do, this argueth, it's not conſcience, but ſome other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
principle in thee, as when they cried <hi>Hoſannah</hi> to Chriſt, and afterwards
<hi>Crucifie him.</hi>

                        <head type="sub">The Pollution of Conſcience diſcovered in many more particulars.</head>
                        <p>ALthough much hath been ſaid to the diſcovering of every mans polluted
conſcience by nature, yet becauſe conſcience is ſuch an <hi>Abyſſus,</hi> a deep Sea,
wherein are creeping things innumerable, many depravations and defilements;
our work ſhall be ſtill to make a further ſearching and diving into it: Whereas
therefore the laſt particular mentioned of the natural pollution of conſcience, was
in regard of the multiformity of it, and divers reſemblances of conſcience, which
yet were not conſcience indeed, this bringeth in another particular defilement of
ſome affinity with it; And that is,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Suppoſe that it be not</hi> luſt <hi>or</hi> humour, <hi>but conſcience indeed that putteth thee
upon duties, and thoſe commanded, yet how hardly are they done for conſcience ſake.</hi>
It's not any luſt, but conſcience maketh many men pray, hear, and perform ſuch
duties, yet it is not conſcience that is the motive, it is ſome other ſiniſter and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
reaſon that inſinuateth it ſelf; ſo that the ſame duties may be done out of
conſcience to God by ſome, and from corrupt ſinfull motives by others. The
Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. preſſing obedience to Magiſtrates (becauſe it might be
thought that Chriſtian liberty freed them from any ſuch yoke) he urgeth it, <hi>Not
onely for fear, but for conſcience ſake:</hi> So that if it had been onely fear to loſe
their eſtates, to loſe their lives, and not out of conſcience to Gods Ordinance,
though they did obey, yet it was ſinfull and ungodly in them, becauſe of their
motive thereunto. This alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. whence
he inſtanceth in <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>A conſcience of God,</hi> (or as we render it) <hi>A
conſcience towards God,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, It is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
ſubjectively, as if God had a conſcience; for although God have infinite
knowledge, and in that ſenſe may be ſaid to be conſcious with our hearts of all the
evil we have done, yea, knoweth more ſin by us then we do by our ſelves, yet we
cannot attribute conſcience to God, becauſe the notion of that is to denote the
ſenſe and aw of ſome ſuperior, who beareth witnes of our evil actions, and is able
to condemn for them; conſcience therfore is in Angels, becauſe they have a ſuperior,
they are not to be a rule to themſelvs; and Chriſt alſo had an holy &amp; undefiled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
which yet becauſe of our ſins was greatly afflicted with the ſenſe of Gods
wrath; but God having no Superiour, therefore he hath indeed infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but not conſcience; Hence when the Apoſtle cals it <hi>conſcience of God,</hi> that
is <hi>objectively,</hi> a conſcience which doth reſpect the will and authority of God,
that doth not look to men, to their applauſe and praiſe, but unto God: So that
herein will appear an univerſal pollution naturally upon the conſciences of all
men, that the good things they do, the evil things they abſtain from, is not from
meer conſcience to God, but becauſe of humane and earthly conſiderations:
How many come to our Congregations? How many frequent Ordinances? Is
it becauſe of conſcience to God, they have a reverential fear of him, they dare
not diſpleaſe him? No, but only the Laws of the Land, or ſome outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
maketh them do ſo, it's not pure conſcience: Thus alſo there are many
devoted ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> to all prophaneneſſe, that would with all their hearts
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57719:134"/>
runne into all exceſſe of rioting, into drunkenneſſe and uncleanneſſe, but they
dare not, they are kept off as a dog from the bone with a whip: All their deſire
is towards it, but the penalty and juſtice which the Civil Magiſtrate will inflict
upon him, this maketh him forbear, it's farre from any conſcience towards God
that doth reſtrain them: Oh then bewail the corruption of man in this kind!
never in any duties carried out for conſcience ſake, never abſtaining from ſin for
conſcience ſake, but becauſe of puniſhment and the judgment of others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in private, though God ſeeth thee as well as if it were at the Market-croſſe,
they can runne into all leudneſſe: Oh if it were conſcience to God, thou wouldſt
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ake heed of heart-ſinnes, as well as of bodily, thou wouldſt be afraid to ſinne
in ſecret, as well as in publique, becauſe God is every where, and knoweth all
things, and thou haſt a conſcience towards him! And no wonder if conſcience be
thus predominantly polluted in natural men, for even in the godly themſelves,
how often do they find proud, vain, ſelf-ſeeking thoughts inſinuate into them?
So that it's not only out of conſcience to God they do their beſt duties: Do not
ſome vain-glorious thoughts like ſo many thieves ſecretly creep into the heart,
and are ready to rob thee of thy treaſure? It is true indeed, to the gracious
heart theſe are a burden, and therefore with <hi>Abraham,</hi> they drive away theſe
flies from the Sacrifice, yet they come again; They do <hi>Repellendo tenere,</hi> and
<hi>tenendo repellere,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in another caſe; they beat them back, and yet
they hold them alſo: they ſtrive with them, and yet imbrace them: Thus many
a ſinfull motion and vain thought, is like <hi>Bernard</hi>'s unclean ſuggeſtion, which
he found, <hi>Blande oneroſa diſplicendo placens,</hi> and <hi>Placendo diſplicens,</hi> kindly
troubleſom, and coming in with a diſpleaſing pleaſure; Inſomuch that the godly
themſelves find the weight of original corruption upon their conſciences in this
reſpect, even till their laſt hour; They do not, they cannot find their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſo purely and ſincerely drawn out to God, in the duties they perform, as
they do deſire. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. ſaith, <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
we had our converſation in the world.</hi> And again, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 17. As of God
in the ſight of God we ſpeak in Chriſt;</hi> Here was conſcience and pure conſcience,
as to any fundamental deficiency, yet not perfectly pure, for <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. he ſaith,
<hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi> ſo that whereſoever the Spirit is, there the
fleſh in ſome meaſure luſteth againſt it: Oh them let even the moſt holy bewail
original ſinne in their conſciences, even in this reſpect! That councel given by
<hi>Paul</hi> to godly ſervants, <hi>Coloſ</hi> 3. 17, 18. That what they did, they ſhould do it
<hi>in ſingleneſſe of heart, fearing God;</hi> They ſhould do <hi>it heartily, as unto God,
not unto men.</hi> The ſame are all the people of God bound to do in their ſervice
to God: Oh how unworthy is it in religious duties to have an eye to man! who
will praiſe or diſpraiſe, if conſcience were the motive, thou wouldſt neither
care for good or bad report; And this pure conſcientious working is eſpecially to
be attended unto by ſuch who are in publick Office; The Civil Magiſtrate, if he
puniſh an offender, not becauſe he deſerveth it, but from malice, or other
ſiniſter reſpects; Though he cry out and pretend conſcience and juſtice a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times over, yet God looketh upon him as an unjuſt Magiſtrate, though
the thing he doth is juſt. Thus it is alſo in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, if
they preach the Word diligently and conſtantly, but yet the principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
are either vain glory, or a mereenary reſpect unto the profit and
temporal advantage more then the ſoules of people, and the glory of God,
here alſo that is done, which conſcience requireth, but not upon conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
motives; we doe not theſe things as of God, in the ſight of
God. But I muſt not be too long in this particular, although indeed we
can never ſay enough herein, it is ſuch a cloſe inſinuating ſinne into all mens
breaſts.</p>

Secondly, <hi>The natural conſcience is grievouſly polluted by original ſinne in
regard of the limited and partial conviction, or illumination that it is apt to

convinced to doe ſome things, eſpecially if of no great conſequence, but
the greater and more weighty things they are apt to neglect. This dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baked

Saviour charged this partial conſcience upon the Phariſees, <hi>Luke 11. 42. They ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
mint and rue, but the things of mercy and judgement they neglected;</hi> The
Chief-prieſts alſo they were afraid of defiling themſelves by entring into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-hall,
and yet had no ſcruple about ſhedding the innocent bloud of our Lord
Chriſt? And what is more ordinary then this? May ye not obſerve many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as much moved with rage upon the removal of any needleſſe or ſuperſtitious
Ceremonies, as the <hi>Athenians</hi> were about their <hi>Diana,</hi> and yet for groſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe
and all manner of exceſſive riot, they are never moved at that,
they have no zeal for God's glory, though iniquity abound in every place?
Doth not all this diſcover the hypocriſie and rottenneſſe of ſuch a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Take heed then thy conſcience is not like ſome creatures begotten of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tride
matter, that in their former part have life, but in their later have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but earth or ſlime; So, in ſome part thy conſcience is alive, and in other
things it is dead: If thy conſcience tell thee, It's thy duty to pray, to hear,
to keep up Family-duties, and yet withall ſuffereth thee to do unjuſt, unclean,
and other diſhoneſt things of impiety; This is not right, it is not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
as yet: So on the other ſide, If conſcience bid thee, Be juſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in all thy dealings, be mercifull and tender to fit objects of charity, and
herein thou art ready, but thy conſcience doth not at all preſſe thee to the duties
of the firſt Table, to ſanctifie the Sabbath, to keep up Family-duties, to walk
contrary to the ſinfull courſe of the world, then it is plain that as yet thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is in the gall of bitterneſſe, it hath but ſome partial conviction, not a total
and plenary one.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The conſcience of a natural man in this alſo is greatly polluted, <hi>In
that it is very ſevere and eaſily accuſing of other mens ſinnes, but it is blind
about its own, it ſeeth no evil in it ſelf, while it can aggravate the ſinnes of
others.</hi> Thus conſcience, as in other reſpects, ſo in this alſo is like the eye, which
can ſee all other things, but not it ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 3. Such a corrupt conſcience
likewiſe our Saviour chargeth upon the Phariſees, when he calleth them <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi>
and biddeth them, <hi>Pull out the beam in their own, and then the more in other
mens.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. beginneth that Chapter, <hi>Therefore thou art
inexcuſable (O man) who judgeſt others, and doeſt the ſame things thy ſelf.</hi>
What is more ordinary then this, to be Eagle-eyed, to ſpie out the faults
and ſinnes of others, and as blind as a mole about thy ſelf? <hi>David</hi> was very
zealous againſt that injurious man <hi>Nathan</hi> repreſented in a Parable, and in the
mean while did not think that he was the man, that this was his ſinne. <hi>Judah</hi>
alſo was ſevere againſt <hi>Tamar,</hi> who had played the whore, till ſhe ſent him the
ſtaff and bracelets, that he might ſee he was the man. Thus you ſee even godly
men are greatly blinded about themſelves; no wonder then if the natural man
be wholly in darkneſſe: Oh then pray, and again pray for light to ſhine into thy
own heart! Let conſcience turn its eyes inward once more, know the worſt by thy
ſelf. Think with <hi>Paul, I am the greateſt of all ſinners,</hi> with <hi>Tertullian, Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator
ſum omnium natorum,</hi> a ſinner with the brand and mark of all ſins on me,
at leaſt in motion and inclination, ſay, I ſee thoſe ſins in my ſelf, which the world
doth not, none can judge and condemn me more then I can do my ſelf, but the
contrary is in every mans natural conſcience, he thinketh himſelf better then
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57719:135"/>
others, he bleſſeth himſelf in his good heart, and is a ſevere cenſurer of other
mens ſinnes; Thus he hath thoſe <hi>Lamiae</hi> of eyes, that he taketh up when he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
abroad, and layeth aſide, when he cometh home.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The conſcience naturally is defiled, <hi>Becauſe of the eaſe and ſecurity
it hath, though if it were awakened, and could do its duty, it would not let
thee have any reſt day or night.</hi> And this is one of the main particulars wherein ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne diſcovers it ſelf in the conſcience; all life, all ſpiritual tenderneſſe and
apprehenſion is taken away, that whereas conſcience is eſpecially ſeen in the reflex
acts of the ſoul. To know our knowledge, to judge the actions of the mind
and the heart, yea and to judge thoſe judgments; now we can no more do theſe
things then very beaſts do, and by reaſon of this there is a great calmneſſe and
quietneſſe upon the ſoul. <hi>Dives,</hi> who had his ſoul, <hi>Take its eaſe,</hi> found no
gripes of conſcience: And thus it is the condition of all men, whereas conſcience
would or ſhould pierce them thorow, and be like ſo many thorns, not in the ſide
only, but all over the body; now it is fallen aſleep, and the man is at reſt in his
ſins, though he be on the borders of hell. Thou mayeſt call this a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and bleſſe thy ſelf, becauſe it doth not trouble thee, it doth not accuſe
thee, whereas indeed it's a ſenſleſſe conſcience, like a dead member that will feel
no pain, if it were on the contrary, then it would be a good conſcience, if it did
accuſe, bear witneſſe and condemn thee, then it would be a good conſcience; for
this is a Rule in <hi>Caſuiſtical Divinity,</hi> Conſcience may be <hi>moleſtè mala,</hi> and yet
<hi>honeſtè bona;</hi> and then on the other ſide, it may be <hi>peccatè bona,</hi> and yet <hi>honeſtè
mala,</hi> Conſcience in reſpect of its troubling and condemning may be evil, and
yet in reſpect of its ſanctification good, being awakened by Gods Spirit; and
on the other ſide, it may be good, as ſometimes we call it, that is quiet, not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying,
yet in its conſtitution, be dead and unregenerate: Do not then flatter
thy ſelf, that good conſcience thou boaſteſt of, is a bad and evil one, a dead, a
ſenſleſſe one: Can that be good, which is not inlightned, is not regenerated?
Oh how much better were thy conſcience, if it did ſmite thee, terrifie thee,
make thee eat with trembling, and drink with trembling! This accuſing conſcience
is farre better, and more preparatory to true peace, then that quiet ſecure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of thine; ſo that thou art indeed to mourn over thy conſcience, as being
dead within thee.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly. As was ſaid of the underſtanding ſpeculative, ſo alſo the ſame is true of
it as practical, which is the conſcience, it is groſly defiled originally, <hi>Both becauſe
it hath loſt its ſubordination to God and his Word, the true rule of conſcience, and
alſo its ſuperiority over the will and affections.</hi> So that if we look both <hi>ad ſupra,</hi>
and <hi>ad infra,</hi> it is greatly defiled; Towards God it doth not keep its ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but naturally fals into two extreams, for ſometimes it taketh other rules
then the Scripture; as we ſee in Popery, How horribly is conſcience inſlaved by
the meer commandments of men, where there is no Scripture? Or elſe on the
other ſide, rejecting the Word wholly as a rule, as thoſe <hi>Libertines,</hi> who do
preſſe it as a duty to be above conſcience, and that a man is perfect, when he can
ſinne, and his conſcience never ſmite him for it: Many Volumes would not ſerve
to enlarge ſufficiently upon conſcience its pollution, in both theſe extreams, and
as for the affections and will, conſcience hath now loſt its power, it cannot rule
theſe beaſts, it cannot command theſe waves: Hence you ſee ſo many live in ſins
againſt conſcience, their luſts are ſtronger then their conſcience: They ſin, and they
know they ſin, and yet are not afraid to commit them: How often in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
to ſin doth conſcience meet them, as <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David</hi> informing of the grief
of heart, yea the torments of hell that will be hereafter, yet they will violently
go forward: Thus conſcience in the croud of luſts is trodden down, as that lord
was, when there was ſo much plenty.</p>

                        <p>HItherto we have been declaring the <hi>defilement of conſcience naturally by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne,</hi> as it is <hi>quiet, ſtupid,</hi> and <hi>ſenſeleſs.</hi> The next thing to be done
(wherein ſhall be concluded both this Text, and particular Subject of <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>)
is to diſcover, how greatly it is <hi>polluted,</hi> and that when <hi>troubled,</hi> or <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened.</hi>
In this particular likewiſe it will appear devoid of true goodneſs, and
any ſpiritual qualifications; conſcience troubled for ſinne without Evangelical
principles, is like the raging ſea, whoſe waves are toſſed with tempeſts and
ſtormes, vomitting forth nothing but froth and foam, And</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, <hi>Herein is the corruption of it manifeſted, that when it doth accuſe, when
it doth trouble, is doth it prepoſterouſly, not ſeaſonably, and opportunely:</hi> For when
is the fitteſt time for conſcience to interpoſe, to put forth its effectual operation,
but <hi>before the ſinne</hi> is committed? To meet a man, as the Angel did <hi>Balaam</hi>
with a <hi>drawen ſword,</hi> before he <hi>curſe the people:</hi> But this it ſeldome doth,
onely when the ſinne is committed, when God is diſhonoured, when guilt is
contracted, then it accuſeth, and that not ſo much as acting under God, to
bring about true peace by repentance and faith, but as the Devils inſtrument
to bring to deſpair, and ſo from one ſinne to plunge into a greater: Thus it
was with <hi>Judas,</hi> how many powerfull and penetrating arguments did he meet
with, to awaken his conſcience? He had thunder-claps enough to raiſe and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his conſcience, though dead, and yet for all that, it never ſmiteth him, it never
accuſeth him, till he had committed that abominable and unnatural ſin: What
predictions? What warnings had <hi>Judas</hi> to make him fly from this ſinne? our
Saviour told his Diſciples, <hi>One ſhould betray him,</hi> yea particularly he deſcribeth
<hi>Judas,</hi> he telleth him, <hi>He was the man;</hi> our Saviour forewarned him of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eſtate of that man, who ſhould betray him, <hi>that it had ben better he never had
been born;</hi> and if anger or threatning would not break him; Our Saviour uſed
love to melt him, <hi>He waſhed his feet,</hi> as well as the feet of other Diſciples, but
ſtill conſcience in <hi>Judas</hi> is like an Adamant, and when all this will not do any
good, but <hi>Judas</hi> cometh with a band of ſouldiers, as the captain and head of
them, he ſeeth ſome fall down for aſtoniſhment and amazement at the preſence
of our Lord Chriſt, yet this neither doth ſtartle him, he hath not ſo much as
any regretting and remurmurating thoughts, but goeth on deſperately to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
his deſign, and now when all is done, when every thing his wicked
heart deſired was brought to paſs, then his conſcience like a roaring Lyon,
beginneth to awaken out of ſleep and to break its chaines in peices; Then he
cryeth out, <hi>I have ſinned in betraying of innocent bloud;</hi> Oh had conſcience
ſuggeſted this before; when the motions to this ſinne were firſt kindled in his
breaſt, had he then caſt them out of doores with indignation, this is to betray
the innocent, this is to become guilty of bloud! The very thoughts, the
very motions are damnable and abominable, And he bolted them out with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
as <hi>Ammon</hi> did his defloured <hi>Tamar,</hi> then had conſcience been regular
and alſo prevvented his future confuſion. but it never pricketh, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth,
till the fact be paſt, and then when it did ſo, it was upon the Devils
deſign, to bring him to final deſpair. This may be ſeen alſo in <hi>David</hi> a godly
man, though the iſſue of conſcience its accuſation was more comfortable;
when <hi>David</hi> out of vain and ambitious ends, deſired to <hi>number the people,</hi>
though <hi>Joab</hi> withſtood it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. which might exceedingly have ſhamed,
<hi>David,</hi> that a meer mortal man ſhould ſee that ſinfullneſs, which he did not,
yet he will proceed, and the people are numbered, but aſſoon as <hi>David</hi> had
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57719:136"/>
done it, then <hi>his heare ſmote him,</hi> when it was done; it ſmote him not, while
it was a doing, the nine moneths were ſpent in numbring of the people; Why
not before, then it had prevented the deaths of many thouſands? But thus it
is, conſcience will not ſeaſonably and opportunely bear witneſs againſt ſinne
Conſider then the deceitfullneſs and falſeneſs of thy conſcience herein, all the
while thou art contriving ſinne, purpoſing, yea and acting of ſinne, nothing
doth trouble thee, but at laſt, when ſinne is committed, then it ariſeth with
horror and terror; And do we not ſee this conſtant <hi>pollution</hi> of conſcience in
moſt dying perſons, when ſummoned by God, and arraigned by death, when
the ſentence of death is upon them? Then their conſcience flyeth in their faces,
taketh them by the throat, oh ſend for the Miniſter, let him pray for me, let all
that come to me, pray for me. Thus conſcience is ſtirring now; oh but how
much better were it, if in thy health time, if in thy ſtrength and power, then
conſcience had been operative? To have heard thee then cry out, oh my
ſinnes! oh I am wounded at the heart! oh pray for me! then there had been
better grounds to hope, thy conſcience was awakened upon true and enduring
conſiderations, ſuch as would continue alwaies, living and dying, whereas
ſuch are but ſick-ſuddain fits of conſcience, and commonly turn into greater
hardneſs of heart and obſtinancy afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Conſcience troubled doth naturally diſcover its pollution, <hi>By</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                           <hi>the ſlaviſh, ſervile, and tormenting feares which do accompany it:</hi> So that
whereas the proper work of conſcience is, <hi>By Scripture-light to direct to
Chriſt,</hi> ſo that the troubles thereof, ſhould be like the <hi>Angels</hi> troubling of the
<hi>pool of Betheſda,</hi> and then immediately to communicate healing; Now it is the
clean contrary, Theſe wounds do feſter, and corrode more; The conſcience
by feeling guilt, runneth into more guilt; ſo that whereas we would think,
and ſay, Now there are hopes, now conſcience ſtirreth, now he begins to feel
his ſinnes, we ſee often the contrary, an obortive, or a monſtrous birth after
ſuch travailles of the ſoul; and wherein doth it manifeſt it ſelf more then by
tormenting teares about God? So that if it were poſſible, the conſcience
troubled would make a man runne from the preſence and ſight of God never
to be ſeen by him: Thus you ſee it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had ſinned, his
conſcience was awakened, he knew what he had done, and therefore was <hi>afraid</hi>
at <hi>Gods voice, and runne to hide himſelf,</hi> ſuch a ſlaviſh, ſervile temper doth
follow the conſcience, when wounded for ſinne. Now all ſuch tormenting
feares are ſo many manifeſt reproaches unto the goodneſs of God,
and his mercy revealed; The hard thoughts, the accuſing imaginations, that
there is no hope for thee, that thy ſinnes are greater then thou canſt bear,
or that God will forgive: theſe diſhonour the goodneſs of God, theſe oppoſe
his grace and mercy, which he intendeth to exalt in the pardon of ſinne.
Inſomuch that the Atheiſt, who denieth the Eſſence of God, is in this reſpect
leſs hainous then thou, who denieſt the good Eſſence of God, He denieth his
<hi>natural</hi> goodneſs, thou, his <hi>moral</hi> goodneſs, as it were. Is not the great ſcope
of God in the Word to advance this attribute of his <hi>mercy,</hi> eſpecially in Chriſt
he hath made it ſo illuſtrious, and amiable that it may raviſh the heart of a
poor humbled ſinner, but a ſlaviſh conſcience about ſinne rob; God of this
glory? So that although it may be the Spirit of God by the Word, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
thee of thy ſinne, and affecteth thy conſcience, yet the ſlaviſhneſs and
ſervility of it, that is the ruſt and moth which breedeth in thy own nature,
that is not of Gods Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The troubled conſcience diſcovereth its natural pollution. <hi>By the</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                           <hi>proneneſs and readineſs in it, to receive all the impreſſions and impulſes of the
Devil.</hi> That as in the ſecure conſcience the Devil kept all quiet, and would
by no means moleſt; So on the contrary, in the troubled conſience, there be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57719:137"/>
to heighten the trouble, to increaſe the flame; and he that before
tempted thee to preſumption, that God was ready to pardon, that ſinne
would eaſily be forgiven, now he uſeth contrary engines, provoketh to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
repreſents God as ſevere, and one, who will never forgive ſuch tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
that there is no hope for him, that he is ſhut out of the Ark, and ſo
muſt neceſſarily periſh: Thus you ſee he wrought upon the troubled conſcience
of <hi>Judas,</hi> and of <hi>Cain,</hi> one goeth <hi>trembling up and down,</hi> and cannot caſt off
the <hi>terrors</hi> and <hi>horrors</hi> which were upon him; The other is ſo greatly <hi>tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with <hi>anguiſh of ſoul,</hi> that he <hi>hangeth himſelf:</hi> In what whirlepooles of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,
In what ſelf-murders, and other ſad events hath a troubled conſcience
agitated and moved by the Devil caſt many into? Now all this ariſeth, becauſe
the wounded conſcience being not as yet regenerated, doth hearken more unto
the Devil, then unto Gods Spirit; The Spirit of God through the Word of
the Goſpel, ſpeaks <hi>peace</hi> to the <hi>broken in heart,</hi> offereth <hi>oil</hi> to be poured into
ſuch <hi>wounds,</hi> holdeth out the <hi>ſcepter of grace;</hi> but the troubled conſcience
<hi>heareth</hi> not this, <hi>believeth</hi> not this, but what the Devil, that ſoul-murderer,
and Prince of darkneſs doth ſuggeſt, and dart into the thoughts, that is received
and followed; Hence it is that ſo many have been under troubles of conſcience,
under terrors of ſpirit for ſinnes for a ſeaſon, but all this pain in travel was
only to bring forth wind and emptineſs, all hath either ended in tragical and
unbelieving actions, or in a bold and more hardened obſtinacy; and the
great cauſe of this hath been the Devils moving in theſe troubled waters, he
hath preſently interpoſed to marre this veſſel, while upon the wheel. Know
then, that when thy conſcience is awakened and grieved, then is the Devil
very buſie, then he tempteth, he ſuggeſteth, but keep cloſe to the Word, ſee
what the Spirit of God calleth upon thee to do; get out of the crowd of thoſe
Satanical injections, and compoſe thy ſelf in a ferene and quiet manner, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the commands of God in his Word; for the Spirit of God that calleth
to <hi>believe,</hi> to <hi>come in,</hi> and <hi>make peace with God,</hi> but the Devil he preſſeth a
final departure from God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, The <hi>troubled conſcience is internally polluted, By that ignorance and
incapacity in knowing of what is the true chriſtian-liberty purchaſed by Chriſt.</hi> I ſpeak
not as yet of that main and chief liberty which is freedome from the curſe of the
law through the bloud of Chriſt, but in many doctrinal and practical things.
The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. ſpeaketh much of the weak conſcience, which hath not
attained to that ſolid judgement, as to know its liberty and its freedome from
Judaical rites, and all other Commandments of men about the worſhip of God:
Indeed the notion of Chriſtian-liberty may quickly be abuſed to prophane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs,
but yet the true Doctrine about that, was one of the greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
brought to the Church in the firſt reformation; for there the conſcienees
of all were groſſely intangled and miſerably inthralled: yea, their <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi>
who took upon them to reſolve and direct conſcience, they were the greateſt
tormentors of all, inſomuch that they then ſeemed to be in a wilderneſs, or
rather under an Aegyptian bondage, wherein were many lawes and Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
many Doctrines and opinions that were as <hi>Luther</hi> expreſſeth it about one <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiſſimae:</hi>
Now to this bondage the conſcience of a man is more naturally prone,
then unto any obedience to the true commands of God. Indeed the conſcience of
man naturally is miſerably polluted about the knowledg of thoſe tyes and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are upon it, for ſometimes it contracteth and, limiteth them more then
it ought: Hence it is that a man, yea a godly man may live in the omiſſion
of many duties, in the commiſſion of many ſinnes, and yet not know that he
doth ſo, and all becauſe we do not ſtudy the extent of the obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and from this it is that many good men have endeavoured to grow
in more knowledge, to ſtudy the commands of God obliging of them, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57719:137"/>
upon enquiry have found cauſe to do thoſe things they never did before, and
alſo they would not for a world walk in the ſame paths they once did. Thus
<hi>Melancthon</hi> remembring his ſuperſtitition while a Papiſt, <hi>Quoties cohorrui,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>How often doth horror take bold on me, when I think with what boldneſs I went
and fell down before Images, worſhipping of them?</hi> This is one great pollution
of conſcience, not to know its divine obligations that are upon it: But then
on the other ſide, the conſcience <hi>ſmitten</hi> about ſinne, is many times prone
to ſtretch its obligations beyond the due line, they judge ſinnes to be where
there are none. They make duties where God hath not required, and all
becauſe the troubled conſcience is like a troubled fountain, a man cannot ſee
clearly the face, neither are we then able to judge of any thing truly. It is a
rule in Philoſophy, <hi>Quicquid per humidum videtur, majtu apparet;</hi> Every
object through an humid, ormoiſt medium, appeareth greater then it is, thus
alſo doth ſinne and duties through a grieved wounded conſcience: therefore
for want of the true knowledge of our Chriſtian-liberty, there is a <hi>ſcrupulous</hi>
conſcience, called ſo, becauſe as little ſtones in the ſhoe hinder the feet in going,
ſo doth the ſcrupulouſneſs and timerated thoughts much annoy in a Chriſtian
walking. Theſe commonly are without end, as one circle in the water begets
another, or (as <hi>Gerſon</hi> reſembleth it,) like one Dog that barketh, ſetteth all
the Dogs in the Town on barking, ſo doth one ſcruple beget another, and
that many more: Now although a ſcrupulous conſcience may be for the
main tender and good, yet the ſcrupulouſneſs of it ariſeth from the infirmity
and weakneſs thereof, and maketh the ſoul paralytical in all its actions;
Theſe ſcruples make a man very unſerviceable and to live very uncomfortably,
and although God in great mercy doth many times exerciſe the truly godly
ſadly with them, thereby to humble them, to keep them low, to ſay with
<hi>Agur</hi> they have not the underſtanding of a man, to be kept hereby from
groſs and foul ſinnes, yet they are to be prayed againſt, for theſe ſcruples are
like the Aegyptian Frogs alwaies croaking, coming into the chamber, and in
at every window, thereby diſturbing thee in thy duty. If thy conſcience
were ſound and clear, the light thereof would quickly diſpell theſe
miſts.</p>
                        <p>Again, From the blindneſs of a troubled conſcience, cometh alſo <hi>the ſad
and great doubtings upon the heart, whereby the ſoul of a man is diſtracted and
divided,</hi> pulled this way and haled that way, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 14. The Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at large about a doubting conſcience, and ſheweth how <hi>damnable</hi> a thing
it is to do any thing <hi>doubting,</hi> whether it be a ſinne or not. A <hi>doubting</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is more then a <hi>ſcrupulous,</hi> for Divines ſay a man may go againſt a
a ſcrupulous conſcience; becauſe the conſcience is for the main reſolved that
ſuch a thing may lawfully be done, only he hath ſome feares and ſome jealouſies
moving in him to the contrary. But a doubting conſcience is when Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not clear, but a man ſtands as it were at the end of two waies, and
knoweth not what to do: now if conſcience were well inlightned and informed

becauſe of its natural blindneſs, therefore it is at a ſtand ſo often. Hence</p>
                        <p>In the laſt place, it becomes from a ſcrupulous doubting to a <hi>perplexed</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
ſo <hi>inſnared</hi> that what way ſoever he taketh he cannot but ſinne, if he do
ſuch a thing he ſinneth, and if he doth it not he ſinneth, as in <hi>Paul,</hi> who
thought himſelf bound to ſet himſelf againſt Chriſtians, if he did perſecute
them it is plain he did ſinne, if he did not he thought he ſinned. It is true,
<hi>Caſuiſts</hi> ſay, <hi>Non datur caſus perplexus,</hi> there cannot be any caſe wherein
there is a neceſſity of ſinning, becauſe a man is bound to remove the error
upon his conſcience, but yet the ignorance and blindneſs of man doth bring
him often into that perplexed eſtate.</p>

                           <p>FIrſt, <hi>That it is a moſt bleſſed and happy thing to come out of a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

when in pain and travail, is apt to make many miſcarriages, yea
ſometimes it is ſo farre from having any joy, that a man-child is born (I mean
the true fruit of holineſs produced) that there is a monſter brought forth in
the ſtead thereof. Doth not experience and Scripture confirme this, that
many have come out of their troubles of conſcience, with more obſtinacy and
willfullneſs to ſinne again? That as the wind blowing upon coales of fire,
which might ſeem to extinguiſh the fire, doth indeed encreaſe it: Thus theſe
pangs, theſe gripes of conſcience which ſometimes they have felt, that made
godly friends ſay, Now there is hope, bleſſed be God, that maketh them
feel the burden of ſinne: Theſe hopefull workings (I ſay) do at laſt end in
a ſenſleſs ſtupidity; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for a while, and ſo alſo <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> and
<hi>Felix trembled;</hi> Conſcience in theſe did give ſome ſharp ſtings, but (alas)
it came to no good uſe, ſo rare a thing is it, to come in a gracious manner
out of theſe waves and ſtormes upon thy ſoul: Experience alſo doth give in
full teſtimony to this; How many do we ſee that for ſome time, yea (it may
be) yeares have had as it were an hell within them? They have eat their
bread, and drunk their drink with trembling and aſtoniſhment; They have
been even diſtracted with the terrors of the Lord; but if you obſerve the later
end of ſuch, they have at laſt grown ſecure and ſtupid, as if the Spirit of God
had never viſited them in ſuch a dreadfull manner: So that we may ſay to
many, What is become of thoſe troubles thou didſt once groan under?
Where are thoſe feares, thoſe cries, thoſe agonies, thou hadſt then?
Where are thoſe zealous and fervent workings of heart which did ſo burn
within thee once? Alas, after theſe meltings and thawings a greater froſt and
cold hath come upon them; That as ſometimes frequent and conſtant aguiſh
fits do at laſt end in a conſumption: Thus frequent troubles of conſcience
upon ſome fits and ſeaſons, do ſometimes end in a plain <hi>dedolency</hi> and <hi>ſtupidity

and ſtone, ſo that though thou ſinneſt never ſo groſly, yet now thy
conſcience is ſeared, and thou canſt be bold and rejoycing in the midſt of thy
impieties. Thus you ſee it's a great conſequence for any one labouring under
the troubles of conſcience, diligently to conſider, how he cometh out of them,
for now is the time of ſaving or damning of thee, now is the time thou art
in the fire, either to be purged and refined, or to be conſumed: Oh pray,
and get all thy godly friends to pray, that theſe troubles may be ſanctifie,
that they may be bleſſed to make a through change upon thee! Better never
have had ſuch a wounded conſcience, ſuch a troubled heart, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

hath an high and bloudy aggravation; Thou knoweſt how bitter ſinne
is; Thou haſt taſted what gall and wormewood is in it; Thou haſt been in the
very jawes of hell, haſt had ſome experience of what even the damned feel, and
wilt thou go to ſuch ſinnes again? wilt thou put theſe Adders into thy breaſt

                           <head>A great Difference between a troubled Conſcience, and a regenerate
Conſcience.</head>
                           <p>IN the ſecond place, You muſt know, <hi>That there is a great difference between
a troubled conſcience and a regenerated, or ſanstified conſcience.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
may be exceedingly troubled about ſinne, have no peace or reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſinne, yet be in the ſtate of original pollution, yet be deſtitute of the
Spirit of Chriſt: This miſtake is very frequent, many judging the troubles of
conſcience they once had to be the time of their converſion to God, though
ever ſince they have lived very negligently and careleſly, without the ſtrict
and lively conformity of their lives to the rule: whereas we ſee in <hi>Cain,</hi> in
<hi>Judas,</hi> theſe had even earthquakes (as it were) upon their conſciences, They
had more trouble then they could bear, yet none can ſay, they had a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
conſcience. It is true indeed, theſe troubles of conſcience may be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory
and preparatory to the work of converſion, but if ye ſtay in theſe,
and think to have had theſe is enough, ye groſly deceive your own ſoules,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37, 38. When <hi>Peter</hi> did in ſuch a particular, and powerfull manner
ſet home upon the Jews, that grievous ſinne of killing the Lord Chriſt, it is
ſaid, <hi>They were pricked in heart;</hi> Here their conſciences were awakened, here
were nailes (as it were) faſtened by the Maſter of their Aſſembly into their
ſoules; yet when they cry out, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we do? Peter</hi> doth direct
them to a further duty, which is, <hi>to repent;</hi> Thoſe troubles then, thoſe feares
and agonies, were not enough, a further thing was requiſite for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.
Thou then who art troubled reſt not in theſe, think not this is all,
but <hi>Preſs forward for regeneration, without this, though theſe troubles did fill
thy ſoul, as much as the Lecuſts did Aegypt, yet thou wouldſt go from begun tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
here, to conſummate torments hereafter.</hi> It is true, a gracious regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
conſcience may have its great troubles and agonies, be in unſpeakable
diſquietings, but I ſpeak of ſuch who are yet only in innitiatory troubles, who
are (as yet) but in the wilderneſs, journying towards <hi>Canaan;</hi> all theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
do not inferre regeneration, but are therefore brought upon thee, that
thou maiſt be provoked to inquire after this new creature.</p>

                           <head>What may be the Cauſes of the trouble of Conſcience, which yet are
ſhort of true ſaving Motives.</head>
                           <p>IN the third place take notice, of what may be <hi>the cauſe and motives</hi> which
may make thy conſcience awakened and troubled, which yet are not from
true ſaving principles.</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>The commiſſion of ſome groſs and hainous ſinne againſt conſcience; this may
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57719:139"/>
work much terror.</hi> The very natural light of conſciene in this particular is
able to fill the ſoul with feares, <hi>Rom. 2. The Heathens had their conſciences
acuſing of them.</hi> We read of <hi>Nero,</hi> that after he had killed his mother <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,</hi>
he was ſo terrified in his conſcience, that he never dared to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to the Gods, becauſe of the guilt upon him, yea, and as <hi>Tertullian (lib.
de animâ cap.</hi> 44.) obſerveth from <hi>Suetonius,</hi> after this parricide, he who in his
former times never uſed to dreame (it's noted of him as a rare and ſtrange
thing) was conſtantly terrified in his dreames with ſad imaginations. Thus
you ſee natural conſcience upon the committing of ſome groſs ſinne, hath
power of it ſelf to recoil and with heavy terror to overwhelm a man. Some
alſo do relate of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that having been the cauſe of the death of his
eldeſt ſonne <hi>Criſpus,</hi> upon groundleſs ſuſpicious, was greatly tormented in
his conſcience, not knowing what to do, and thereupon was adviſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Chriſtian Religion, in which alone there could be found an expiation
for ſo foul an offence.</p>
                           <p>2. The trouble of conſcience may ariſe <hi>from ſome heavy and grievous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that hath overtaken us.</hi> Conſcience may lie aſleep may yeares; the
ſinnes thou haſt committed long agoe may be almoſt forgotten, and yet ſome
judgement and calamity, falling upon thee afterwards, may bring them to
mind: Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren, whoſe conſciences were ſo ſtupid (as you
heard) that upon the throwing of their brother into the pit, they could ſit
down as if nothing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>led them; many yeares after, when they were in anguiſh
of mind by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſevere carriage towards them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 21. Then they ſaid
one to another, <hi>We are very guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the
anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear, therefore is this
diſtreſs come upon us;</hi> ſo that ſome unexpected calamity may be to us, as the
hand-writing on the will to <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> making conſcience to tremble with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us.</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>God as a juſt Judge can command theſe Hornets and Bees to ariſe in thy
conſcience.</hi> It is plain, <hi>Cain,</hi> when he ſet himſelfe to build Townes,
thought to remove that trembling which was upon him, but he could not do
it; how many have ſet themſelves with all the might they could to be delivered
from this anguiſh of conſcience and could not? becauſe God is greater then
our conſcience, if he command terror and trembling none can expell it. This
troubled conſcience is threatned as a curſe to ſuch, who did break the Law of
God, <hi>Deut. 29. 65<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 67. The Lord ſhall give thee a trembling heart—and ſorrow
of mind—In the morning thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were day—for the
fear of thy heart.</hi> Here we may obſerve, that God can, when he pleaſeth, ſtrike
the heart of the moſt jolly and prophane ſinner with ſuch a trembling conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that he ſhall not have reſt day or night; and when God, after much
patience abuſed, doth ſmite the ſoul with ſuch horror and aſtoniſhment many
times: This never tendeth to a gracious and Evangelical humiliation, but as in
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> is the beginning even of hell it ſelf in this life. So fearfull a
thing is it to fall into the <hi>hands of the living God,</hi> when provoked, <hi>Heb. 10. 31.
For in ſuch</hi> (as <hi>ver. 27.) there is a certain fearfull looking for the indignation and
wrath of God, which will devour the adverſaries.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>4. <hi>This troubled conſcience may, and doth often come by the Spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
and reprooving by the Word, especially the law diſcovered in the exactneſs
and condemning power of it.</hi> Joh. 16. 8. <hi>The Spirit of God doth reproove or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the world of ſinne;</hi> Now conviction belongs to the conſcience princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally;
and indeed this is the ordinary way for the converſion of any; Gods
Spirit doth by the Law convince and awaken conſcience, making it unquiet
and reſtleſs, finding no bottome to ſtand upon; it hath nothing but ſinne,
no righteouſneſs to be juſtified by; the law condemneth, juſtice arraigneth,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57719:139"/>
and he is overwhelmed, not knowing what to doe; This is the worke of
Gods Spirit; and of this ſome do expound that place, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Ye have
not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear, but of adoption;</hi> It is the ſame
ſpirit which is called the ſpirit of bondage, and of Adoption, onely it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſo from different operations; It's the ſpirit of bondage, while by the
Law it humbleth us, filleth the conſcience with fear and trembling; not that
the ſinfulneſſe or ſlaviſhneſſe of theſe fears, oppoſing the way of faith, are
of the Spirit, but the tremblings themſelves; and it is the Spirit of Adoption,
when it rebuketh all tormenting fears, giving Evangelical principles of Faith,
Love and Aſſurance; Now theſe fears thus wrought by the Spirit of God in the
Miniſtry of the Word, though they be not alwaies neceſſary antecedents of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
yet are ſometimes ordained by God, to be (as it were) a <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi>
to make way for Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Theſe troubles of conſcience may ariſe (<hi>through Gods permiſſion)
from the Devil:</hi> For when God leaveth thee to Satan's kingdome; as it was
the caſe of the <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> to be <hi>buffeted by him, tempted by him,</hi>
you ſee he did ſo farre prevail with him, that he was almoſt ſwallowed up
with too much grief: Therefore when God will evangelically compoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
by faith in Chriſts bloud, he taketh off Satan again, and ſuffereth him not
to caſt his fiery darts into us any longer.</p>

                           <p>THeſe things explained, Let us return to conſider the pollution of natural

                           <p>The firſt is, <hi>That the wounded conſcience for ſinne is very ready to uſe falſe</hi>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
                              <hi>remedies for its cure.</hi> Theſe ſtings he ſeeleth are intollerable, he cannot live
and be thus, he taketh no pleaſure in any thing he hath, but he cometh not
to true peace, for either they go to <hi>carnal and ſinfull wayes of pleaſure,</hi> ſo
to remove their troubles, or <hi>to ſuperſtitions and uncommanded wayes, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
thinking thereby to be healed:</hi> The former too many take, who when
troubled for ſinne, their hearts frequently ſmite them, they call this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly</hi>
and <hi>Puſillanimity;</hi> Tuſh, they will not give way to ſuch checks of
conſcience, but they will go to their merry company, they will drink it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
they will rant it away, or elſe they will goe to their merry paſtimes
and ſports: Thus as <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to kill <hi>Jeſus</hi> as ſoon as he was borne, ſo
do theſe ſtrive to ſuffocate and ſtifle the very beginnings and riſings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
within them: <hi>Oh wretched men prepared for hell torments!</hi> Though
now thou ſtoppeſt the mouth of conſcience, yet hereafter it will be the
gnawing worme; It's this troubled conſcience that makes hell to be chiefly
hell; It's not the flaming fire, it's not the torments of the body that are
the chiefeſt of hels miſery, but the griping and torturing of conſcience to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
This is the hell of hels.</p>
                           <p>Others, when none of theſe means will rebuke the ſtormes and waves of
their ſoul, but they think they muſt periſh, then they ſet themſelves upon
ſome ſuperſtitious auſtere waies, as in Popery, to go on Pilgrimage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into ſome Monaſtery, to undertake ſome bodily affliction and penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by theſe means they think to get peace of conſcience; but <hi>Luther</hi>
found by experience the inſufficiency of all theſe courſes, <hi>That all their

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> In the next place therefore, <hi>This pollution of a troubled conſcience is ſeen, In
it's oppoſition to Chriſt, to an Evangelical Righteouſneſſe, and the ſway of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi>
Conſcience is farre more polluted about Chriſt and receiving of him,
then about the commands and obedience thereunto; for naturally there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in conſcience to do the things of the Law, but the Goſpel and the Doctrine
about Chriſt is wholly ſupernatural and by revelation: Hence although it is clear,
That the conſcience truly humbled for ſinne ought to believe in Chriſt for expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof; Yet how long doth the broken heart continue ignorant of this duty?
Their conſcience troubleth them, accuſeth them for other ſins, but not for this,
of not particularly applying Chriſt to thy ſelf for comfort, whereas thou art
bound in conſcience to believe in Chriſt, as well as repent of ſinne; I ſay, thou
art bound in conſcience, and if thou doeſt not by particular acts of faith receive
Chriſt in thy arms, as <hi>Simeon</hi> did bodily, but then ſpiritually, thy conſcience is
to trouble thee, and to accuſe thee for it; But how averſe and froward is the
troubled conſcience in this particular? How hardly inſtructed evangelically?
How unwilling to reſt upon Chriſt onely? Their conſcience that is very tender
about other ſinnes, thinketh it no ſinne not to apply Chriſt, yea it diſputeth and
argueth againſt it; but at laſt ſuch broken hearts know, that they are to make
conſcience of the premiſſes, as well as the precepts, conſcience of faith as well
as repentance, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 14. The Apoſtle there teacheth us, <hi>That it is the blood
of Chriſt, which purgeth the conſcience.</hi> Run not to any thing, but to the bloud of
Chriſt; when thou art ſlung, behold this Serpent; Let thy conſcience be Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
as well as Legal; The Goſpel is Gods Word, as well as the Law, and by
that thy conſcience is obliged to lay hold on Chriſt for pardon.</p>

                        <p>Fourthly, You have the aggravation of this from the time, He will put them

they had the true knowledge of theſe things, if they had been ignorant, if
they had not yet underſtood theſe things none would wonder at this diligence,
but though they know theſe things, yet he dare not omit this importunity. Again,
though they did know, yet they might be wavering and ſtaggering, ready to
apoſtatize from this they did know; No, they are <gap reason="foreign">

ſetled and fixed, and yet their minds and memories need many divine helps to
excite and ſtirre them up, yea this duty upon their memories is ſo great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that the Apoſtle further amplifieth himſelf herein, as if enough could
not be ſaid about it; For at the next verſe, he giveth us a reaſon of this faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and diligence, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

he calleth his body a Tabernacle, that is, <hi>Nomen paſtorale,</hi> and <hi>militare,</hi>
it denoteth the ſhortneſs and brevity of his abode in the world, and then the great
hardſhip and difficulty he was to conflict with; It implieth, he was but a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
here, as all the godly are; and therefore whereas the <hi>Cretians</hi> called thoſe
places they had on purpoſe to receive and lodge ſtrangers in <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the ſame
word did the Church uſe and apply to the Burial places of believers, ſignifying
hereby, that they were pilgrims and ſtrangers: He uſeth alſo a ſignificant word

this ſuppoſeth even the memories of the moſt godly to be, as it were, dull and
ſleepy, very heavy and negligent about what they ought to be diligently exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with But yet the Apoſtle hath not ſaid all his mind herein, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. he
profeſſeth this care of his for the good of their memories ſhall extend even after
his death, <hi>I will endeavour that after my deceaſe, you may have theſe things alwayes
in remembrance.</hi> Now that would be done by theſe very Epiſtles, they would be
as continual <hi>memento</hi>'s to them. See then here the godly zeal and faithfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of a godly Paſtor, it extends to the future as well as the preſent, he is afraid
after his deceaſe, all he had preached ſhould be forgotten; And doth not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
ſadly confirm this? After the death of a godly Miniſter, How quickly are
all his labours, all whoſe precious truths he had made known forgotten, as if they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57719:141"/>
never had ſuch a Preacher amongſt them? However, if theſe ſoul-ſaving truths
be forgotten, <hi>Peter</hi> will take care that the ſinne ſhould not lie at his door, he
will be faithfull to do his duty. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. take notice how again he taketh
up this profeſſion of his care and zeal to help their memories. He wrote both
theſe Epiſtles <hi>to ſtirre up their pure minds by way of remembrance.</hi> Their
pure minds <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſuch as are diſcovered and tried (as it were) by the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
the leaſt more, any vain thoughts or ſinfull motions are diſcovered and
abandoned, yet though they have ſuch pure minds, he writeth Epiſtle upon Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to ſtirre them up by remembrance; and as if all this were not enough to
quicken up their memory, the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> writing to the ſame perſons doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
write the ſame things <hi>verbatim,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had written in this
ſecond Epiſtle, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. he proclaimeth this to be his end, <hi>To put them in
remembrance, though once they knew this;</hi> It was for their memories ſake by way
of exhortation, not for their underſtandings by way of inſtruction. Now from
all this we may gather,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That ſuch is the weakneſſe and ſinfulneſſe of the memory, and that even in the
regenerate, that they need daily divine helps to provoke it to its duty.</hi> And whereas
the ſinfulneſs of our memory may be two wayes, either <hi>actually</hi> by a wilfull
forgetting of holy things, and a careleſſe neglect of them; or <hi>original,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the memory through <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, as well as the other parts of the ſoul, are
become all over unſanctified, and hath no ſutableneſſe or proportion to divine
objects and holy duties. I ſhall ſpeak of this later, though as expreſſing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying
it ſelf into actual and wilfull forgetfulneſſe, for of this original and native
pollution of the memory, muſt we underſtand this Text in a great meaſure,
which the Apoſtle by frequent filing would get off, as ſo much ruſt, ſeeing he
writeth to thoſe that are ſanctified, and as alſo he ſpeaketh of this as a permanent
and an abiding weakneſſe in them; Now in the regenerate <hi>all contracted habits of
ſinne, are expelled by vertue of the new birth;</hi> And as for actual ſinnes, they are
<hi>tranſient,</hi> ſo that there remaineth no other defilement, but <hi>original,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
or immediate products thereof: If then the moſt holy do need quickning
helps to their memory, becauſe of the dulneſſe and ſlowneſſe in it about holy
things; It is plain, the memory, as well as the other faculties of the ſoul, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
by original ſinne; and if in the ſanctified perſon the memory hath this
partial and gradual ſinfulneſſe in the unregenerate, and natural man, it muſt be
all over polluted and made unſavoury about any good thing. Obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the memory of every man by nature is wholly polluted by original ſinne.</hi>
It cannot perform thoſe offices and acts for theſe holy ends, as it was at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to do in the ſtate of integrity. It will be very uſefull and profitable to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize
the ſinfulneſſe of the memory, as we have done of the other intellectual
powers, for it is from the pollution of this part that all wickedneſſe is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Scripture makes this the character of all wicked men, <hi>That they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God.</hi> Pſal. 9. 17. implying, That if we did remember God, his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
his Power, his holy Will, we ſhould not fall into any ſinne: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that we may in ſome ſenſe ſay, All they evil is committed, becauſe of
thy evil and ſinfull memory, hadſt thou remembred ſuch and ſuch threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
ſuch and ſuch places of Scripture, they would have preſerved thee from
this impiety.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>What we mean by the memory. Ariſtotle</hi> wrote a little Book about
<hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Remembrance (De Memoriâ &amp; Reminiſcentiâ</hi>) and from him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have taken up large and uſeleſſe Diſputes herein. It is not my purpoſe to teach
you with theſe thorns, it is enough that there is acknowledged a <hi>ſenſitive memory,</hi>
which is <hi>common</hi> to <hi>men</hi> with <hi>beaſts,</hi> and an <hi>intellective,</hi> though that be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but againſt all reaſon, for the ſoul ſeparated doth remember, as appeareth
in that Parable, where <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dives, Sonne, remember thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the good things of this life,</hi> Luk. 16. 25. Angels alſo muſt neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
becauſe all things are not preſent to them, therefore paſt things they
cannot know, but by way of memory: God is ſaid in the Scripture often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
but that cannot be properly, becauſe to him all things paſt and future
are as preſent, ſo that he cannot be ſaid to remember properly, no more then to
fore-know onely ſuch expreſſions are uſed by condeſcenſion to our capacity. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
diſtinguiſheth between <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Remembrance,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

(he ſaith, as farre as is yet obſerved) no creature can do but man. When
therefore I ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>Memory,</hi> I ſhall underſtand it as it is <hi>Remembrance,</hi>
and as it is <hi>Intellectual;</hi> for in man we may ſay his memory is in a great part the
underſtanding, knowing things as they are paſt. Therefore <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the
Maſter of Sentences following him (though this be diſclaimed by many that came
after) make three powers or faculties in the rational part of a man, his <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi>
his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> which they call the <hi>created Trinity,</hi> and by it,
(they ſay) is reſembled the bleſſed and <hi>increated Trinity;</hi> But I ſhall not diſpute
this, for <hi>I ſhall ſpeak of Memory as the ſame with the underſtanding onely in
this particular, as it is carried out to things that are paſt, for that is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

                        <p>IN the ſecond place, While we ſpeak of the weakneſſe of the <hi>Memory</hi> about
good things, we muſt take notice of a two-fold weakneſſe, a <hi>Natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and a <hi>ſinfull weakneſſe;</hi> a <hi>Natural weakneſſe</hi> is that which ariſeth from
the <hi>conſtitution of the body,</hi> and <hi>unfit temperature of the brain,</hi> for though the
actions of the underſtanding be immaterial, to know and to remember, yet they
require the body as the Organ and the Inſtrument; So that as the moſt artificial
Muſician cannot diſcover his skill upon an Inſtrument whoſe ſtrings are out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſo neither can the underſtanding of a man put forth its noble actions, when
the body is out of order; Hence we read that ſome diſeaſes, or other events
have deprived men of their memory, ſo that they have forgot their own name.
By this we ſee, <hi>That the ſoul doth act dependently upon the body,</hi> being the
form informing of a man, and giving his being and operations to him. Now it's
uſefull to know this diſtinction; for many good people, eſpecially when grown
in year, do much complain that their memory is gone; They cannot carry away
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57719:142"/>
ſo much of a Sermon, or from good Books, as once they did, and this doth
much grieve them, they look upon themſelves as drones, and not Bees, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
home honey from every flower, but this may ſupport them, that this is a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affect in the memory,</hi> not a <hi>ſinfull</hi> one; For as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth (<hi>Lib. de
Memoriâ &amp; Reminiſcentiâ.</hi>) neither in children, or in old men, is there ſuch a
capacity for memory, in children, becauſe of the too much moiſture; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is (ſaith he) as if a man ſhould imprint a Seal in the water, which becauſe
of its fluid nature would receive no impreſſion, nor in old men is there ſuch a
capacity of memory, becauſe of their drineſſe and ſiccity, as if a man ſhould
imprint a ſeal upon a dry peice of wood, it would not receive any forme or
character. If then in thy old age, thy memory faileth, know this is a natural
imbecillity, as ſickneſs and pain is not a ſinne. Others again they abuſe this
diſtinction, for when they are urged to holy duties, called upon to remember
what hath been preached, then they excuſe themſelvs with their bad memory, God
help them they have an ill memory; but if thou haſt a memory for other things,
jeſts and merry tales, or buſineſſes of profit, and no memory for holy things;
This is thy ſinne, thou haſt no memory in the theſe good things, becauſe thou haſt no
heart, no delight about them, as is more to be ſhewed: Yea, I muſt adde, that
though a natural weakneſſe in the memory be not a ſinne, yet it is the fruit of
ſinne, and ſo ought deeply to humble thee, for thy memory would have had no
ſuch defects and weakneſſes, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen: As therefore diſeaſes and
death, though they be not ſinne, yet are the effects of ſinne, and therefore we
are to humble our ſelves under them, ſo thou art to do under thy imperfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
though ſickneſſe or old-age hath much impaired it.</p>

of what uſe and conſequence it is, that ſo when we ſhall conſider the
dignity and ſerviceableneſſe of the memory, we may then bewail the ſinfulneſſe
thereof, for when that is made ſinfull, it is as if a fountain were poiſoned, of which
all muſt drink: or as the air peſtilential, which all muſt receive in their noſtrils: if
the memory be corrupted then all is corrupted; Hence (as you heard) all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men are ſaid <hi>to forget God.</hi> Memory is of ſo great uſe, as the Heathens made
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57719:143"/>
a goddeſſe of it, yea they make it to be the mother of the Muſes of all Arts, of
all Wiſdome and Prudence; No tongue can either expreſſe the ſerviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it, or the nature of it, not the ſerviceableneſſe of it; For if
there were no memory, there could be no diſcourſe, no civil ſociety;
if there were no memory, a man could not take heed of any danger, or prevent
any miſchief; hence they attribute it to the forgetfulneſſe and ſtupidity of the
Flie, that when it is flapt off from the meat, and was in danger of death, yet it
will immediately flie to it again: Thus would man without memory plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into all miſery; If there were no memory, there could be no learning, no
humane ſciences, for memory is made the mother of them; Yea, if there were
no memory, there would be no Religion, no Worſhip of God, or ſervice of
him: Thus both the natural, civil and religious life of a man would be deſtroyed
were there not a memory; So that we are infinitely bound to praiſe God for this
power left in us, and as deeply to humble our ſelves, that it is ſo corrupted, that
it cannot do its proper acts in a ſpiritual way at laſt, thereby to promote our
happineſſe, our memory helpeth to damn us, not to ſave us.</p>

yet could not come to any ſure knowledge. This is certain, that the things we
remember are not in our ſouls themſelves; when we remember ſuch a tree or

us, it could not be but that ſorrow remembred would make us ſorrowfull, or
forgetfulneſſe remembred make us forgetfull. The objects then remembred are
in us by way of <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> the <hi>Phantaſmata</hi> are there conſerved, and
when by them we come to remember, then they are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; Hence
(they ſay) that ſometimes a man thinketh he remembreth, when he doth not,
yea he cannot tell whether he remembreth ſuch a thing or no, becauſe (ſay they)
the <hi>Phantaſma</hi> is thus abſolutely preſented, and not as <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; Even as a
man may look upon a picture, either abſolutely, as having ſuch lineaments and
colour, or relatively, as an Image, whereby we come to remember ſuch an
one. But theſe Philoſophical notions about <hi>Phantaſmata</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> are
ſo obſcure, that it is better with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to acknowledge our ignorance of
this noble and admirable power in the ſoul, whereby it doth remember
things; whatſoever it be, though given us as an admirable and uſefull gift, yet
now it is groſly polluted, and is the conſerver of all evil and vanity.</p>

                        <p>THat the memory is thus polluted will appear,</p>
                        <p>1. By ſeveral diſcoveries thereof. And</p>
                        <p>2. By the particulars wherein.</p>
                        <p>In the former way, herein we have a full demonſtration of the depraved nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
of our memory, <hi>In that we need the Spirit of God to ſanctifie and help it;</hi>
So that one work or office of the Spirit of God is to be a remembrancer unto us
about holy things; It's the gift of Gods Spirit to give thee a good memory, to
make thee able to remember holy things: This is clearly and unqueſtionably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<hi>John 14. 26. The comforter which is the holy Ghoſt, I will ſend in my
name, and he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Here we ſee the Spirit of God hath a twofold
office or work to do:</p>
                        <p>1. To teach us holy things: We are blind and unbelieving, not knowing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
objects, till Gods Spirit doth teach us; But this is not all, ſuppoſe we be
taught and inſtructed, is all done then? Do we need the Spirit of God no more?
Yea. Therefore</p>
                        <p>2. The Spirit of God putteth it ſelf forth in a further work, which is to
bring the things thus taught to our remembrance. As then the mind in reſpect of
underſtanding and knowing cannot do any thing about what is ſpiritual without
the Spirit of God, ſo neither can the mind about remembring: Certainly if the
memory of it ſelf could do theſe things, the Spirit of God would be in vain: If
the Moon and Starres could give ſo much light as to make a day, the Sun would
be in vain: Hence the children of God do evidently find and feel the work of
Gods Spirit upon their memories, as well as their underſtandings, for in their
temptations, how ready to be overwhelmed? how ready to be ſwallowed up
with ſuch thoughts? and then the Spirit of God doth ſeaſonably re-mind the ſoul
of ſuch <hi>Promiſes,</hi> of ſuch comfortable <hi>Arguments;</hi> So alſo upon the temptation
to any ſinne, the Spirit of God doth interpoſe and prevent it by making them to
remember ſuch a <hi>threatning,</hi> ſuch a place of Scripture, and this ſtoppeth them
from the evil they were ready to do, for they are the Diſciples themſelves, though
ſanctified and made ſo eminent to whom this Spirit of remembrancing is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as uſefull and neceſſary; If then the Spirits preſence and aſſiſtance be thus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
even to a regenerate mans memory, this argueth the natural defilement
and impotency of it to any good thing, for where nature is able, there the Spirit
of God is not neceſſarily required.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond Diſcovery of the pollution of the memory may be <hi>from the end</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                           <hi>of the Scripture, why God would have it written, ſo as to be a perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
to his Church.</hi> Among other ends this is one, to be a <hi>memorial</hi> to us,
to put us in continual mind of the duties required of us: Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
indeavoureth to make believers alwaies remembring of the Goſpel by thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
he did write to them. It is true, the Orthodox do juſtly refuſe that of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
who will make the Scripture to be onely <hi>utile communitorium,</hi> as if that
were the chief end, why the Scriptures were written, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſerve for our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
only, and not to be a rule of our faith, for he himſelf doth acknowledge
it to be a partial rule: But the principal and chief end, why the Scriptures are
delivered to the Church is to be a Canon and Rule to it, ſo that the Church muſt
not believe, worſhip or live, otherwiſe then the Scripture commands: This is
not a partial but a total Rule, neither may any thing be added to it, or detracted
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57719:144"/>
from it. But yet we grant alſo, That the Scripture may have other ſecondary
and ſubſervient ends, whereof this is not the meaneſt, to be uſefull to our memory;
And certainly, one great cauſe of ſo much evil committed by thee, is forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Scripture; The Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 1. 25. doth notably inſtance
to this purpoſe, for he compareth a <hi>forgetfull hearer of the Word,</hi> to one that
<hi>looketh in the glaſſe, and going away ſtraightway forgetteth what manner of
man he was;</hi> If therefore we did abide and continue looking in this glaſſe, take
notice what we are by the direction of the Word, how quickly would we reform?
He that doth make a practical uſe of remembring the Scripture, ſo as to regulate
and order his life accordingly can never miſcarry. To have the word of God in
thy memory againſt ſuch and ſuch a temptation, would prevent all the evil thou
falleſt into, <hi>John</hi> 15. 20. when our Saviour would encourage his Diſciples againſt
the hatred of the world, he ſaith, <hi>Remember the Word that I ſaid unto you, the
ſervant is not greater then his maſter;</hi> Remember this truth, and that will make
thee ſuffer more willingly: So <hi>John 16 4. Theſe things have I told you, that
when the time ſhall come, ye may remember that I told you of them;</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Scripture in the ſeaſon, to have the Word of God in thy mind, when
a temptation like <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs is ſoliciting of thee, this will cauſe, that no
deadly thing ſhall hurt thee; for the word of God is a <hi>two edged ſword.</hi> it's an
<hi>hammer,</hi> it's <hi>fire,</hi> it's the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> by it both the Devil, and all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
are ſubdued, Chriſt overcame the Devil by Scripture. Now if that be
not in thy memory, then it cannot be any waies ſerviceable to thee in the time of
need. Exerciſe your memories therefore in the Scripture, and that not for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
ſake, much leſſe for oſtentation, to ſhew what a good memory you have
above others, but for a practical and holy uſe; Treaſure up ſuch a place againſt
thy drunkenneſſe, thy whoredoms; Treaſure up ſuch a place againſt pride,
earthlineſſe and covetous deſires; What a precious and excellent memory is that
which is like a mine of gold, or an Apothecaries ſhop, that can from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
preſently fetch what Antidotes againſt ſinne, or cordials to revive that he
pleaſeth? And truly our memory ſhould be filled up only with Scripture conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
This is the cabinet and choice cloſet of thy ſoul; If a man ſhould take
his cabinet that was for jewels and precious ſtones, and fill it only with mud and
dirt, would it not be exceeding great folly? No leſſe is it, when thy memory is
full of ſtories and merry tales, and in the mean while remembereſt not what God
ſaith in his Word, which would be ſo uſefull to thee for thy ſouls good, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then the goodneſſe of God to thee in providing the Scriptures as an help
to thy memory, and withall know that ſeeing the Spirit thought it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to commit them to writing, hereby is fully declared the pollution and
ſinfulneſſe of thy memory; For in Heaven, when the memory will be fully
ſanctified and perfected, then there will be no more uſe of the Bible, we ſhall not
then need to read the Scriptures to quicken up our minds, for all imperfection
will then be done away.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, The ſinfulneſſe and weakneſſe of the memory is manifeſted not only
by the end of the Scriptures in general, but alſo <hi>ſeveral parts of the word of God
are peculiarly ſo ordered, that they might be the more eaſily conſerved in our memory.</hi>
Thus when any great deliverances were vouchſafed to the Church, thoſe mercies
were made into Pſalms and Songs, that for the meters ſake, and the pleaſantneſs
of the matter, all might have them in remembrance: This method did ſignifie
how dull and ſtupid our memories are, and how apt to forget the benefits and
mercies of God, and therefore our memories are to be helped therein: Thus the
119<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                           <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is put into an alphabetical order, thereby to further our memory
about it, yea there are two Pſalms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 70. 1. which have this
Title, <hi>To bring to remembrance;</hi> And the matter of thoſe two <hi>Pſalms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
a complaint under afflictions and earneſt importunity with God for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57719:144"/>
The Spirit of God by inſtruments made them to be compoſed for
this end, that afflicted and troubled ſoules ſhould have them in remembrance;
and indeed we may ſay of every Chapter, as well as of thoſe <hi>Pſalmes, A
Chapter to bring to remembrance;</hi> yea, of many Verſes, <hi>A Verſe to bring to
remembrance;</hi> And becauſe the memory is ſo ſlow and dull about holy things,
you may read of a peculiar command to the <hi>Jews</hi> in this caſe; and although
the ſame obligation doth not belong to us, yet it teacheth us all, what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfullneſs
and oblivion is ready to ſeize upon us about holy things, <hi>Numb.</hi>
15. 39, 40. God doth there command <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſpeak to the children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they make <hi>fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
generations.</hi> It was a perpetual Ordinance; And why muſt this be done,
<hi>To remember all the Commandments of God:</hi> This was Gods ſpecial command?
The Church under the Goſpel may not in imitation hereof preſcribe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
or appoint Images to ſtirre up the dull memory of man. The Popiſh-Church
commendeth their Crucifixes and their Images upon this account,
becauſe ſo helpfull to the memory, being the Lay-mens Books; But (though
the memory be greatly polluted, yet) it belongs not to man, but to God as
part of his regality, to appoint what he pleaſeth, to ſtirre up and excite
the memory in holy things; God hath appointed other things, the Word,
and Miniſtery, and Sacraments for our memory (as is to be ſhewed,) and
therefore this is a devotion which God will reject, becauſe not having his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
upon it.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That the memory of man is naturally polluted is plain, <hi>By the</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
                           <hi>Miniſtry appointed in the Church of God by Chriſt himſelf, for one end of that is,
to bring us to remembrance.</hi> Thus you heard the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking, he
thought it meet <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, juſt and righteous while he was in the fleſh, <hi>to put them
alwayes in remembrance of theſe things:</hi> ſo <hi>Jude</hi> alſo: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> injoyneth
<hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 14. <hi>Of theſe things put them in remembrance:</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 6.
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of theſe things, thou ſhalt be a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He is not a good or faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt, tha
is not diligent to put you in mind of Scripture-things: The Miniſtery is not
only to inſtruct the ignorant, to convert the prophane, but alſo to put int
mind thoſe that do know, and are converted. They are like <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cock,
upon his crowing, <hi>Peter</hi> was brought to remembrance, <hi>and he went out, and
wept bitterly.</hi> Every Sermon we preach ſhould bring thy ſinnes and thy duties
to remembrance. The Spirit of God (you heard) had this office to bring
things to your remembrance, and the Miniſtery is the inſtrument by which he
doth it. <hi>Alexander</hi> would have a monitor to be alwayes prompting this <hi>memento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
eſſe hominem;</hi> And the <hi>Romans,</hi> when riding in glorious triumph, would
have ſome to remember them of their mortality. But Chriſt hath provided
a more conſtant help for thee, to have ſpiritual watchmen and remembrancers,
who are never to ceaſe minding of thee; Say not then, what ſhould I go to
hear a Sermon for, I know already as much as can be ſaid? For though that
be falſe, yet if it were granted, you muſt know, the Miniſtery is for your
memory as well as judgement, and who needeth not to have that often quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to its duty?</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>In that Chriſt hath appointed Sacraments in the Church, which</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
                           <hi>among other ends are to quicken up and excite our memory; it is plain, that they
are polluted, that we are prone to forget all the benefits of God, though never ſo
precious;</hi> Sacraments have for their generical nature a ſign; They are <hi>ſigns,</hi>
and that not only <hi>obſignatives</hi> and in ſome ſenſe <hi>exhibitive,</hi> but alſo <hi>commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative;</hi>
hence in the very Inſtitution of the Lords-Supper, we have this injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24. Not that the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Chriſts death with thankfullneſs and joy, is the total and adequate
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57719:145"/>
end of the Lords-Supper, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> affirme, making us to receive no
new ſpecial influences of Gods grace thereby upon our ſoules, or any renewed
exhibitive Communion of Chriſt with his benefits to us, but meerly a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration,
of what benefit is paſt: As (ſay they) <hi>the Iſraelites, when they ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
that publick mercy of deliverance out of Egypt, had not thereby a new
deliverance, but only there was a celebration of the old:</hi> Thus they would have
it in the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper. But the principall and chief end
of the Lords-Supper, is to conveigh further degrees of grace and comfort to
the true receivers, yet we acknowledge it alſo a ſpeciall and great end in the
Sacrament to be commemorative, and that Chriſt hereby would have our
memories quickned about that infinite love ſhewed to us in dying for us,
Now what can be more demonſtrating the naughtineſs and ſinfullneſs of the
memory then this very thing? For, who would not think that Chriſts volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
giving up of himſelf to ſuch an accurſed and ignominious death for us,
would alwayes be in our minds? Such ſignal and tranſcendent expreſſions of
love would be with us riſing, and waking, and going to bed, That though
the Devil and the world did never ſo importunately crowd in with their ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,
yet this ſhould alwayes be uppermoſt in our hearts and affections;
but Chriſt by this very inſtitution, doth hereby manifeſt, what dull and ſtupid
memories we have, and that about the greateſt mercies that we are capable
of: Would it not be ſtrange if a malefactor ſhould forget his pardon, or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
forget the <hi>ſcarlet threed in the window,</hi> that was to be the preſervative of
her life? yet our forgetfullneſs is greater, when we do not remember our
Saviour, and his ſufferings for us. And for the other Sacrament of Baptiſm;
how greatly is our obligation by it forgotten? how groſly we do forget that
covenant with God, and the dedication of us unto God, renouncing the
Devil and his luſts? That was appointed to be a commemorative ſign; But
how ſinfull is our memory? for we do (as it were) need another ſign to put
us in mind of that, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> what little power hath the memory
of theſe Sacraments upon us? Yea, how little do they come in our mind,
thereby to improve our duties and conſolations?</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Laſtly, That our memories are naturally ſinfull will appear, <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
how it was with Adam in the ſtate of integrity, he was made right,</hi> Eccl. 7.
which doth extend to the ſpiritual perfection of all the parts of his ſoul; As
his mind was indowed with all neceſſary light and knowledge, ſo his memory
alſo with all ſtrength and vigor; ſo that forgetfullneſs of any thing that was
his duty, was no more incident unto him, then any other ſinne; It was not,
becauſe naturally he had a bad or a forgetfull memory, that made him break
the Law of God; for if God had created him found and perfect, in all other
parts of his ſoul, only left him to a weak and frail memory, he could not have
been happy, either in temporal or ſpiritual conſiderations: As his ſoul was
thus perfected, ſo his body was in a found and well tempered conſtitution,
having no redundancy of humors thereby to hinder the operations of the
ſoul by memory, he was not ſubject to diſeaſes or old age, or any thing elſe,
that doth empair the memory of man, but now our ſun is become a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
and our gold droſs: As original ſinne hath peſtilentially inſected all parts
of the ſoul, ſo the memory hath not eſcaped this pollution; for where it is
naturally able, there it is ſpiritually impotent; when it might remember, if
improved and put upon, there is it negligent, and careleſs: how many ſay,
They cannot remember any good thing delivered to them? preſs them about
the Scripture, and the good truths of God preached to them, and they will
juſtify themſelves by pleading the badneſs of their memory, whereas it is for
want of a good heart, and a good will; if thy affections were ardent and
burning about theſe things, thy memory would be more retentive of good
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57719:145"/>
things then they are. Beſides, little do you know, what your memory would
do, if you did put it upon frequent exerciſe, few know what their memories
could do, if exerciſed about holy things, becauſe few are induſtrious and active
to put it on work. <hi>Auſtin (lib.</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> 
                           <hi>de origine animae.</hi>) relateth of his friend
<hi>Simplicius,</hi> how he was deſired to repeat verſes out of <hi>Virgil</hi> backwards and
forwards, and alſo the Proſe of <hi>Tully,</hi> with an inverſed order, and this he did
to their great admiration, yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Simplicius</hi> did ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
that he never did ſo before, neither had he ever tried, whether his memory
were able for ſuch an exerciſe or no. By this example. we ſee, that none know
what their memories would do, if they did more carefully and diligently put them
upon it. But grant that the memory be naturally impotent, though this you
heard be not formally a ſinne, yet it is the fruit of it, and ſo matter of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Learned men ſay, That what fit conſtitution and temperature is required
in the brain for a ſound and ſolid judgement, the contrary is for a good and
ſtrong memory, and therefore (they ſay) it is, that a ſtrong judgement, and
a ſtrong memory, ſeldom go together; As (ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) the beaſt <hi>Lynx</hi> hath
a moſt acute ſight, but is a moſt ſtupid and forgetfull creature: Now if this be
ſo, then this ariſeth from <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, for no doubt <hi>Adam</hi> had both a perfect
judgement, and a perfect memory, and it cometh through original ſinne, that
the body is ſo diſtempered, that what helpeth for one faculty of the ſoul, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
and hindreth the other. The Summe of this particular is, <hi>That wherein our
memories do now come ſhort of that, which Adam's memory while perfect was able to
do, that is either expreſly and formally a ſinne, or the immediate iſſue and puniſhment
of ſinne.</hi>

which <hi>Voſſius (De Origine Idolat. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 11.) obſerveth out of <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi>
                           <q>That there is a two-fold forgetfulneſſe, 1. When the very <hi>Species</hi> or

which ſhould flow from our memory, and this may be called a <hi>moral</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe:</q>
And indeed we have too much experience of this later kind of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe,

find it to be like thunder and lightning upon the ſoul; This would immediately
ſtop him in his waies of iniquities: Thus 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14 11. that ſuborned woman
of <hi>Tekoah</hi> in her diſguiſed Parable to <hi>David,</hi> complaining of ſome that would
riſe up againſt her, to deſtroy her ſonne, ſhe deſireth the King to ſtop the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengers
wrath by this Argument, <hi>Let the King remember the Lord thy God:</hi>
Thus when thou art ſollicited, inticed to any evil, way, Remember thou God, the
infinite God, the juſt God, the omniſcient God, the dreadfull and terrible God
in all his wayes of anger. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> alſo maketh uſe of this Argument to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
up the Jews againſt ſinfull fear and cowardiſe in Gods work, <hi>Nehem. 4. 14. 1
ſaid to the Nobles and Rulers of the people, be ye not afraid of them, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Lord which is great and terrible.</hi> This God complaineth of, <hi>Iſa.
57. 11. Thou haſt not remembred me, nor laid it to thy heart,</hi> and therefore
were they ſo propenſe to all their abominations. Theſe Texts may ſuffice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
that our memories ought conſtantly to be fixed upon God, and no ſooner
do we let him out of our mind, but immediately ſome ſinne or other is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But how unſpeakably is the memory of every man naturally polluted herein?
When is God in their thoughts? Amongſt thoſe millions and millions of objects
which thou doſt remember, when is the great God, the juſt God, the holy God
thought on? May you not ſee it by the bold impiety and undaunted wickedneſſe
of all unregenerate men, that they remember not God? Yea the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
themſelves finde in part this pollution upon their memory. Whence ariſe
thoſe carnal feares, thoſe dejected thoughts, Is it not becauſe you forget
the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of God? Bewail thy memory-ſinfulneſſe, as well
as other ſins.</p>
                        <p>2. As the Scripture preſcribes the object of our memory (<hi>viz</hi>) God himſelf,
ſo it doth inſtance in <hi>one time more then at another;</hi> Though at all times God is to
be remembred, yet in one time of our age, though there be greateſt cauſe, yet our
luſts and deſire after other things do greatly hebetate our memory; We have the
injunction from <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, <hi>Eccl 12. 1. Remember now thy Creator in the dayes
of thy youth;</hi> Here you ſee who is to be remembred, &amp; when he is to be remembred,
God is to be remembred, and that in the time of our youth, But do not the ſtrong
effects of original ſin heightned alſo by actual ſins diſcover herein moſt palpable
impiety in young perſons, they remember their luſts, their pleaſures in the dayes of
their youth, and God is never in all their thoughts: Oh where may we find a
young <hi>Timothy,</hi> that was <hi>acquainted with the Scripturee from his infancy!</hi> Where
an <hi>Obadiah, That feared God from the youth?</hi> Do not moſt young perſons live
ſo negligently about holy things, as if they were allowed to be diſſolute, as if
the things of Heaven and eternity did not belong to them, as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid
the contrary, Do not remember God in the dayes of thy youth, be not ſo ſtrict
and preciſe, but follow thy paſtimes and pleaſures? Thus the very memory of
God and holy things is a burden to young perſons; They think <hi>Solimon</hi> ſpake
farre better, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 9. when he ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth,
let thy heart cheer thee, and walk in the wayes of thy heart, remove ſorrow
and evil away;</hi> They like this well; This is good, but there is a ſting in that
which followeth, <hi>Know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee to
judgement;</hi> This will quickly damp all thy youthfull jollities. Let then young
perſons eſpecially bewail the ſinfulneſſe and forgetfulneſſe of their memory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
This is the beſt and moſt flouriſhing time for your memory, now it is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57719:146"/>
to learn either Mechanical Trades, or the Liberal Arts, your memories are
moſt drawn out in inferiour things, but take the advantage to imploy it
more about holy things; You hear old perſons complain, they have loſt their
memory, they grow forgetfull, therefore fix your memories upon good things
while you may.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>The Scripture commends the Word of God likewiſe as the object of our
memory.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">3. The Scripture.</note> 
                           <hi>Timothy</hi> had learnt the <hi>Scripture from his Infancy:</hi> The word of God
was for this end (amongſt others, as you heard) committed to writing, that ſo
we might the more readily have it in our memories, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4. the Prophet
commands them to <hi>remember the Law of Moſes with the ſtatutes and judgments,</hi>
yea they were to have ſuch a ready and familiar knowledge of the Word of God,
that when they were <hi>riſing</hi> or <hi>walking,</hi> they were to be ſpeaking of them, <hi>Deut.</hi>
6. 7, 8, 9. we may there ſee what care is taken that the Law of God ſhould be
alwayes in their mind; but do we not evidently behold the curſed and wretched
pollution of mans memory in this particular; Why is it that little children will
remember any <hi>Songs</hi> ſooner then the principles of Religion? Why is it that many
perſons who are not able to remember any thing of the Scripture, or the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
they have heard, yet can remember <hi>Ballads</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> they can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their youthfull pranks, and talk of them with delight, but they cannot give
any account of the good truths that in their younger years were preached to
them? When do ye hear ſuch ſay, Such a Sermon wounded me at heart, it ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
ſtill upon me, I ſhall never forget it? Now is not the ſinfulneſſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
greatly to be bewailed in this particular? If it were holy and ſanctified it
would take more delight and joy to remember Scripture-truths then any thing
elſe, whereas now thy memory is like a ſieve that lets the corn and weighty grain
fall through, but the light refuſe ſtuff that it retaineth: Thus what is ſolid and
would do thy ſoul good, that quickly paſſeth away: Oh that we could not fay,
our Sermons paſſe away as a <hi>tale</hi> that is told, for thoſe you do remember, and
you will carry a long while in your mind, empty, frothy things thoſe abide long
with you! Would you not judge it madneſſe in the Husbandman, if he ſhould
pluck up and hinder the growth of his corn, and let cockle and tare, with other
weeds flouriſh? Thus thou doſt about thy memory, throw away the flours and
keep the weeds, whereas thy memory ſhould be like the holieſt of holies, nothing
but what is ſelect and ſanctified ſhould enter therein.</p>
                        <p>4. That I may not be too long in theſe inſtances, <hi>The works of God, whether
in his mercy,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">4. The works of God.</note> 
                           <hi>or in his wrath, they are to be the object of our memory.</hi> Thus the
Scripture ſpeaketh often of <hi>remembring his marvellous works.</hi> Matth. 16. 19.
Chriſt reproveth his Diſciples, becauſe they did not <hi>remember the miracle of the
loaves;</hi> All the great mercies to his Church, all the ſevere judgements of God
upon thoſe that hate him, ſhould be kept in conſtant remembrance from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <p>WE are diſcovering the particulars, <hi>Wherein the memory of man is ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
polluted;</hi> we have inſtanced in the <hi>Object</hi> of it, which is <hi>God,</hi> and the
things immediately relating to God; Theſe things we conſtantly forget, though
God gave us a memory chiefly for theſe things. In the next place, there are <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the inferiour region</hi> (as it were) which the Scripture commendeth to our
memory, and about that alſo we ſhall finde our <hi>minds</hi> never exerciſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
That I may not be infinite, I ſhall ſelect ſome few of thoſe <hi>Inferiour Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>
And</p>
                        <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Sinne paſt.</note> 
                           <hi>It is a duty often urged in Scripture, To exerciſe cur memory about
our ſins paſt, to bring them to mind, and accordingly to humble our ſelves and repent.</hi>
But is not every mans memory naturally polluted herein? How many ſinnes are
there committed many years ago? How many youth ſinnes which thou never
haſt a bitter remembrance of? It is not wormwood and gall to thee to think of
thy former vanities: Thus the memory well exerciſed is the introduction to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
A man can never repent that doth not firſt remember; Can he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelf for that which he hath forgotten? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 61, 63 God there
makes a gracious Covenant and promiſe of pardon and forgiveneſſe to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;</hi>
and then he ſheweth, that this fire of his love ſhall melt and thaw
their hearts, though like iron, they ſhall be aſhamed and confounded, but how
is all this done? by remembring. <hi>Then thou ſhalt remember thy waies, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed,</hi>
ſo that it is impoſſible to ſet upon the work of repentance and converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to God, unleſſe firſt thy memory be excited up, unleſſe thou look upon thy
former life, and remember this have I done, and thus I have lived, ſuch ſinnes
and follies come into my mind, yea in true repentance thy ſinnes will alwayes be
in thy memory, when eating, or drinking, or walking, thou wilt be thinking,
Oh the wretch that I have been! Oh the beaſt and fool that I was in ſuch and
ſuch impieties! Thus <hi>Joh</hi> and <hi>David</hi> remembred the ſinnes of their youth, <hi>Pſa.
51. 3. David</hi> acknowledging that murder and adultery which he had committed a
year before, yet he ſaith, <hi>My ſinne is ever before me.</hi> Thus you ſee in repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
the memory is wonderfully quickned, bringeth thoſe ſinnes to mind that
have been committed many years ago, and therefore you have the expreſſion,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 47. of a people repenting, <hi>If they ſhall bring back to their heart,</hi> ſo
it is in the original, we render it, <hi>If they ſhall bethink themſelves;</hi> By this we
ſee, that in true converſion there is a bringing back again of our ſinnes to our
hearts, that whereas we had forgot this and that ſinne which might be charged
upon us; Now we begin to arraign our ſelves, and bring in a ſevere indictment
againſt our own ſouls, for ſuch and ſuch tranſgreſſions: Oh then, mourn bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for thy evil and wicked memory herein! How many ſinnes, how many iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
even like the ſand on the ſea-ſhore might come into thy mind and amaze thee,
giving thee no reſt, till thou hadſt obtained the pardon of them? But thou art
ſo farre from this, that rather thou ſtriveſt and laboureſt to put them out of thy
memory; If thy ſinnes come to thy mind, preſently thou diverteſt thy thoughts,
turneſt thy memory to other things; and thus as the noiſe of the Cart-wheel,
becauſe nearer to us, maketh us not bear the noiſe of thunder at that time, ſo
other things more delightſome and pleaſing, being next in our memory, we
wholly forget what might turn to our ſalvation: Hence it is that natural men love
no good conference, no reproof, no powerfull preaching that may bring their
ſinnes to remembrance, but ſay as the woman to <hi>Eliſha, 1 King. 17. 18. What
have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? Art thou come unto me to call my
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:57719:147"/>

we bring not our ſinnes to our remembrance, yea we voluntarily forget
them, uſe all the means we can, that we may never have them in our

                           <hi>The bad or good examples of others we ſhould remember, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
imitate or avoid them:</hi> All the examples of wicked and godly men,
ſhould be ſo many Monuments, ſo many Memorials to us: The Inſcription upon

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Whoſoever looks on me, let
him be godly, by remembring the wrath of God upon me for my evil wayes.</hi> Our
Saviour (<hi>Luke</hi> 17. 32.) commands us to <hi>Remember Lot's wife;</hi> In her we have
ſuch an inſtance of Gods wrath, that it ought never to be forgotten, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> turned into a pillar of falt, that ſhe might ſeaſon us; God
had delivered her out of <hi>Sodom</hi> from the fire and brimſtone ready to have conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
her, and withall he chargeth her not to look back, but ſhe either out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
or out of a worldly affection and deſire to her goods that were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
looketh back, upon which God doth immediately puniſh her in this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and unheard manner; Now our Saviour applieth this to every one who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
upon him the profeſſion of Chriſt, leaveth off his former converſation, but
afterwards returneth to it again: And is not this the condition of too many, that
do not onely with <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife look back to <hi>Sodome,</hi> but even go back into <hi>Sodome</hi>
again? How terrible will the later end of ſuch be? Remember this dreadfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
you who for a while give over your prophaneneſſe and impiety, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
fall to it again, ſuch are not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven: Thus alſo
we ſhould take notice of all the good examples we meet with in the holy Scripture,
what good men there were, how they lived, and how God bleſſed them; Our
memories ſhould be a good treaſury, whereby we ſhould be abundantly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do the good and avoid the evil, <hi>Lege Hiſtoriam ne fias Hiſtoria,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remember Hiſtories and examples, leſt God make thee an example: Thus
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. they are commanded to <hi>remember ſuch who had been guides to them,
and to follow their faith, conſidering the end of their converſation;</hi> How holy,
bleſſed and comfortable it was, the godly Miniſters and holy Paſtors God hath
given to his Church, you ſhould diligently remember, taking notice how God
was with them in their Doctrine, in their lives, in their deaths; This would much
prevent that Apoſtaſle of many into errors, and following after heretical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
Do but remember how wonderfully God was in the ſpirits and lives of
many holy Paſtors in the Church, who did bear witneſs againſt ſuch errors, as many
now are led aſide with: Who would not deſire to live the lives, and die the deaths
of ſuch holy gracious men?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Another object of our memory commended in Scripture is, <hi>The
former works of Gods Spirit which happily have been upon us,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">3. The former work of Gods Spirit upon us.</note> 
                           <hi>but we have decayed
and revolted.</hi> This were alone neceſſary for many a man, and eſpecially in theſe
times; Remember what love thou didſt once bear to the Ordinances; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what delight and ſweetneſs thou didſt once find in them, but now thou haſt
caſt them off Thus the Apoſtle remindeth the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 4. 15. <hi>Where is
the bleſſedneſs you once ſpake of?</hi> Once they did ſo rejoyce in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Miniſtry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it a bleſſing of an eminent nature, but now began to ſlight it. There
are alſo many who have formerly been zealous and active for good things, they
manifeſted their good deſires about the things of God to all the world, but now
they are become like ſo many clods of earth, they have forſaken the better part,
which with <hi>Mary</hi> once they did chuſe, and are either turned diſſolute or earthly,
crawling upon the ground like ſo many worms: Thus theſe flouriſhing trees are
quite withered, having neither fruit or leaves: Thus the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
guilty of partial Apoſtaſie, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 5. is injoyned <hi>To remember from whence
ſhe is fallen;</hi> and this counſel is to be given to many perſons, Remember it was
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57719:148"/>
otherwiſe with thee once; Remember it was not ſo with thee, as it is now; The
time hath been thy heart hath been much affected with the word of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
The time hath been thou hadſt family-duties, and daredſt not to neglect the
family-worſhip of God; But now, What is become of all this Religion, <hi>You
that began in the Spirit, do you not end in the fleſh?</hi> Eſpecially your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are often to be ſtirred up and quickned, who have been under many fears and
dangers, who have been at the point of death: Oh what thoughts, what reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
have you made againſt ſinne! What bitter thoughts and apprehenſions
had you about your former evil wayes? But (alas) how quickly are all thoſe
agonies of ſoul forgotten? In this your memories are very much polluted, that
all your vows, all your promiſes to God, all your fears and terrors are forgotten:
Thou that art now imbracing of thy luſts, entertaining thy <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s again, Oh
remember what thou didſt think of theſe things, when thou didſt look upon
thy ſelf as a dying man! Oh remember what woes and wounds were upon
conſcience! What confident expreſſions, if ever God did recover thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if ever thou wert delivered again, all the world ſhould ſee thy repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Reformation? Theſe things thou ſhouldeſt remember, and ſhame
thy ſelfe, yea be confounded and never able to open thy mouth to excuſe
thy ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Our end, and the day of Judgement.</note> The Scripture doth propound to our memory, as a ſpecial object,
never to ſlip out of it, <hi>The conſideration of our later end, the day of death, the
day of Judgement, theſe things are to be conſtantly in our memory.</hi> The neglect
of this is made by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> a bitter inſtance in his <hi>Lamentations</hi>
concerning the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Lam. 1. 9. <hi>She remembred not her later end,
therefore ſhe came down wonderfully;</hi> Here the forgetting of her later end is
made the cauſe of all thoſe ſtrange and wonderfull judgements which come upon
them: Thus <hi>Iſa. 47. 7. Babylon</hi> is there arraigned for her pride and arrogancy,
<hi>And ſhe did not lay the judgements of God to heart, neither did ſhe remember
the later end of it;</hi> And how pathetically is Gods deſire expreſſed, <hi>Deut.32. 29.
Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their
later end;</hi> Here you ſee the ſumme of all godlineſs is expreſſed, in conſidering our
later end: No wonder then if men who forget their death, and the day of
Judgement be violently carried on to all exceſs of riot; For what ſhould ſtop or
ſtay them in their paths? Whereas didſt thou remember, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth his
young man) <hi>That for all this thou muſt die, thou muſt be brought to judgement;</hi>
This would bind him (as it were) hand and foot; Quicken then up thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whatſoever thou forgetteſt, do not forget that thou art a mortal dying man,
that the day of judgement is coming upon thee, which thou canſt not avoid;
The memory of this would make thee flie from every enticing ſinne, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did
from his miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">5. The afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others.</note> The Scripture requireth, <hi>That we ſhould remember the deſolation and
troubles that are upon others, eſpecially the Church of God.</hi> So that although
it be never ſo well with us, though God give us our hearts deſire, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the afflictions and ſtraits of others ſhould make us mourn and
pray for them: Thus <hi>Col. 4. 18. Paul</hi> calleth upon them <hi>to remember his bonds:</hi>
So <hi>Heb. 13. 3. Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them:</hi> What an
hard and great duty is this, yet if thou art not a dead member in the body; if
ſpiritual life be in thee, thou wilt remember the ſad condition, the afflicted eſtate
of many of Gods children, when thou enjoyeſt all thy ſoul longeth for. It was
thus with good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> he was in the Princes Palaces, he wanted nothing for his
own advantage, yet he mourned and was ſad from day to day, becauſe he <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
how it was with Jeruſalem:</hi> See how impoſſible a thing almoſt <hi>David:</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it to forget <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Pſal. 137. 5. <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my
right hand forget her cunning; If I remember thee not, let my tongue cleave to the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57719:148"/>
rooff of my mouth; If I preferre not Jeruſalem above my chief joy;</hi> here is a gracious
worthy ſpirit; ſee what <hi>David</hi> reſolveth ſhall be in his memory more then the
chiefeſt good in this world; he will forget his own friends, his own joyes,
yea his own ſelf, ſooner then the Churches good: now may not even a godly
man bewail his forgetfullneſs herein? Thou mindeſt thy own eſtate, thy own
family, ſeekeſt thy own ſelf, but how little is thy memory about the affaires
of the Church? Thou doſt not remember how many afflicted <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, how
many impoveriſhed, <hi>Lazar's</hi> there may be in the Church of God? how many
exiles and baniſhed perſons; how many deſirous to take up the crums that
fall from thy table; Did we remember the afflictions and ſtraights of others,
it would put us more upon prayer for them, and it would alſo make us walk
more thankfully and humbly for our mercies then we do? And thus you ſee,
though the memory be a vaſt treaſure, though it hath infinite receſſes and
capacious receptacles, yet the Scripture hath preſcribed matter enough to fill
every corner (as it were) and if the memory were thus frighted, if it were
ſuch a good ſtore-houſe, how happy would it be? whereas naturally it's
like a <hi>cage of unclean birds, and a den of thieves.</hi> I proceed therefore to ſhew
(as it was to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> about the <hi>Jewes</hi>) ſtill more abomination in this memory
of ours.</p>

ſhould not be remembered as well as evil and ſinfull things, but only the native
pollution of the memory? And from hence it is, that there is ſuch a lethargy
(as it were) upon the memory; for if <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet 3. 1, writing to thoſe who
were <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and that had <hi>pure minds,</hi> yet he thought it meet to <hi>ſtirre them
up,</hi> a metaphor (as you heard) from men aſleep, who need to be awakened;

There is then a wonderfull ſtupidity and ſleepineſs (as it were) upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
it is even ruſty (as it were) and unfit for any uſe; men do not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

remember, if they did mind it, and exerciſe themſelves to remember what is
good; Thou complaineſt of a bad memory, of a ſlippery memory, No, it is
thy <hi>lazineſs,</hi> it's thy <hi>bad heart,</hi> it's thy want of diligence; Thy memory
would be as good, and as active for holy things, as it is for earthly things,
if you did put it in practice more, but the memory being naturally dull and
ſtupid, thou letteſt it alone, thou never improveſt it, never awakeneſt it, and
ſo through thy forgetfullneſs thou comeſt eternally to periſh; This lethargy
upon thy memory, though a ſad diſeaſe, yet might be cured, if thou wert
real and induſtrious about it, much praying, and much practiſing of it in holy
things, would make it as expedite, and as ready about good things, as ever it
was in any evil things.</p>

                           <hi>there it produceth not ſuteable operations,
nor doth it obtain its end.</hi> The end of remembring what is <hi>good,</hi> is to <hi>love it,</hi>
                           <pb n="264" facs="tcp:57719:149"/>
to <hi>practiſe it,</hi> and to <hi>imitate it;</hi> The end of remembring <hi>evil,</hi> is to <hi>loath it</hi>
bitterly, to <hi>repent</hi> of it, and to <hi>fly from it:</hi> Now herein our memory is groſly
polluted, that it never obtaineth this bleſſed and holy end, <hi>whereas if our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
were never ſo admirable, as that of Symonides,</hi> or <hi>Appelonius Thyaneus,</hi>
when he was about an hundred yeares old, <hi>yet if our memory be not effectual,
and operative, to make us more holy and heavenly, this is a ſinfull and defiled me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:</hi>
And for this reaſon it is, that wicked men are ſaid to <hi>forget God,</hi> becauſe
though they do remember him, yet they do not performe thoſe duties, to
which their memory ſhould be ſubſervient. For as the end of knowledge, is
action, ſo the end of memory alſo is to be doing; and as it is ſaid, <hi>If ye know
theſe things, happy are ye, if ye do them;</hi> ſo when ye remember theſe things,
it's a bleſſed thing to put them in practiſe. But how often do we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that where the memory is naturally very good, there morally it is
very bad and ſinfull? Do you not meet with many that can remember the
Scripture, remember Sermons, yet never remember the practice of them?
whereas God hath given us memory, for the ſame end he hath given us a
knowledge, which is to direct and help us in our operations. That as in beaſts,
they have a ſenſitive memory in them to preſerve their natural being, <hi>The
Oxe remembreth his Maſters crib; the bird remembreth her ſeaſons,</hi> and all this
for natural preſervation; The <hi>Bee</hi> remembereth the place of her hive; The
<hi>Ant</hi> her neſt, (though ſome Philoſophers, becauſe of the great ſiceity of the
conſtitution of thoſe creatures, attribute it to a natural inſtinct, rather then
memory:) ſo this ſhould be much more true in men, therefore doth God
beſtow on us an intellectual memory, that thereby he might ſpiritually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
himſelf, making uſe of that which is advantagious to his ſoul, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that which is deſtructive. As then we are not to know only that we
may know, or to know thereby, making oſtentation that others may take
notice of it; ſo neither are we to remember, that we may remember only,
or to brag of our memory, that others may wonder to ſee what a ſtrong and
retentive memory we have, but that thereby we may be more promoted, and
advanced in heavenly things: Let all ſuch tremble under this conſideration,
who have very quick and ſure memories about the Scripture and the Sermons
they hear, yet are very ungodly in their lives, and walk in a contrary way
to all that they do remember. This argueth thy memory is not a ſanctified
memory, that it carrieth not on the work of grace in thee; for which end
only it ought to be imployed. It is obſerved that two ſorts of men need a
good memory; Firſt, The lyar, <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem,</hi> now every
profeſſing Chriſtian living wickedly, is a lyar, for <hi>with words he acknowledgeth
him, butin workes he denieth him;</hi> inſomuch that thou who lyeſt thus to God,
ſhouldſt remember thy profeſſions and obligations, the ſecond ſort is, of
greateſt accomptants, ſuch who have great ſummes to caſt up, and to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for, theſe alſo had need of great memories, and ſuch is every man:
Oh the vaſt and numberleſs particulars of which he is one day to give an account
to God! Oh what a proficient in holineſs might thou have been, if all the
good things thou remembreſt were in a practical manner improved, if thou
couldſt give a good account to God of thy memory, for that you are to do,
as well as of the improvement of other parts of the ſoul! As God at the day
of judgement will have an account of every talent he hath given thee, of thy
underſtanding, of thy will, how theſe have been employed, ſo likewiſe of thy
memory; What is that good, that holineſs, thy memory hath put thee upon?
and this alſo you who are young ones and ſervants, living in godly Families,
are diligently to attend to, for you think this is enough, if you can remember
a Sermon, or Catechiſtical heads, ſo as to give an account to your Governors;
if you can ſatisfie them, you think this is enough, but thou art greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57719:149"/>
for therefore art thou to remember, that thou maiſt do accordingly,
Thou art never to forget this or that truth, that ſo it may be ready at hand
to direct thee in all thy wayes: and this is indeed a divine act of memory.
There are thoſe who teach the art of memory, and give rules to perfect a man
therein, but divine and holy operation, is the end of the Chriſtian art of
our memory.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The pollution of our memory is ſeen, <hi>In that it is made ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to the corrupt frame and inclination of our hearts.</hi> We remember what
our hearts are ſet upon, what our affections are earneſt for, whereas our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
ſhould precede and go before them, for the <hi>intellective memory</hi> is the
ſame with the <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> of a man; for although to remember
be not properly an act of knowledge, yet this <hi>intellective memory</hi> we make the
ſame with the <hi>mind</hi> of a man, as it extends to things that are paſt. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
then is to make way for the heart and the affections, to be directive to
them, whereas now for the moſt part it is made a ſlave to the corrupt heart;
for if the underſtanding in it all's hegemonical, and primary actions hath
loſt its power, how much more is this true in the memory? For the moſt
part therefore the badneſs of the heart makes a bad memory, and a good heart
a good memory; men complain they cannot remember, when indeed they
will not remember; their hearts are ſo poſſeſſed and inſlaved to earthly
things, that they remember nothing but what tendeth thereunto: This is the
ground of that ſaying, <hi>Omnia quae curant ſenes meminerunt,</hi> Old men remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all things, their hearts are let upon, all things, they do earneſtly regard;
They can remember their bonds, the place where their money lieth, becauſe
their hearts are fixed upon theſe things, but no holy or good things can lodge
in their memories: The rule is, <hi>Frigus eſt mater obiivionis,</hi> Coldneſs is the
mother of oblivion, as is partly ſeen in old men; and thus it is even in old and
young, their hearts are cold, earthly, lumpiſh, even like ſtones about holy
things, and therefore it is no wonder if they remember them no better; ſo
that we may generally conclude, That the cauſe of all they blockiſhneſs and
forgetfullneſs about divine things, is thy ſinfull and corrupt heart, if that
were better thy memory would be better. We have a notable place, <hi>Jer. 2. 32.
Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
me daies without number.</hi> Can a bride forget her attire and ornament?
it is impoſſible, becauſe her delight and affections are upon it, but (ſaith God)
<hi>My people have forgotten me, daies without number.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe I am not
that to them, which ornaments are to a bride (ſaith God) if they delight in me,
rejoyce in me, if they did account me their glory, then they would never
forget me: By this you ſee, that therefore we forget God, and his wayes,
becauſe our hearts are not in love with him; Can he that is powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by love of a friend forget his friend? Doth he not alwaies remember
him? Is not a friend <hi>alter ego?</hi> Is not the lovers ſoul more where it loveth
then where it animateth? Thus it would be alſo with us in reference unto God;
therefore we have bad memories, becauſe bad hearts: It is true, ſome natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cauſes may either deprive us wholly of, or greatly enervate the memory:
Thus <hi>Meſſalla</hi> that famous Orator, judged to be more elaborate then <hi>Tully,</hi>
two yeares before his death, forgot all things, even his own name. <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
alſo that famous <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> who wrote thoſe Rhetorical inſtitutions
which are read with admiration of all, and this he did when he was but eighteen
years old, and ſome ſix yeares after grew meerly ſtupid, and ſenſleſs, without
any evident cauſe of whom it was ſaid, that he was; <hi>Inter pueros ſenex, &amp;
inter ſenes puer. Thucidides</hi> (as <hi>Voſtius</hi> reporteth. (<hi>Orat. inſtitut. lib.</hi> 6.)
ſpeaketh of ſuch an horrible peſtilence, that thoſe who did recover of it, grew
ſo forgetfull, that they did not know their friends, neither remembred what
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57719:150"/>
kind of life or profeſſion they once followed; So that natural cauſes may much
weaken the memory; but if we ſpeak in a moral ſenſe, then nothing doth ſo much
corrupt the memory about holy things, as a ſinfull and polluted heart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, <hi>The pollution of the memory is ſeen, In that it is not now ſubject in the
exerciſe of it to our will and power.</hi> We cannot remember when we would, and
when it doth moſt concern us, whereas in the ſtate of integrity, <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch
an univerſal Dominion over all the powers of his ſoul, that they acted at what
time, and in what meaſure he pleaſed: Thus his affections were ſubject to him
in reſpect of their riſe, progreſs and degree; and ſo for his memory, he had all
things in his mind, as he would: Some indeed queſtion, Whether <hi>Adam</hi> did
then <hi>Intelligere per Phantaſmata?</hi> But that ſeemeth inſeparable from the nature
of man, while upon the earth, and living an animal life, though without ſinne.
No doubt his ſoul being the form of the whole man, did act dependently upon
the inſtrumentality of the body, though ſuch was the admirable conſtitution of
his body, that nothing could make the operations thereof irregular. <hi>Adam</hi>
then had nothing which could either <hi>Phyſically</hi> or <hi>Morally</hi> hinder the memory,
but all was under his voluntary command, whereas ſuch an impotency is upon us,
that if we would give a world, we cannot remember the things we would; Hence
we are force to compel our ſelves, by one thing after another, to bring to our
minds what is forgotten, for in remembring there is ſome dependance of one
thing upon another; as rings, if tied together, are more eaſily taken hold of,
then when they lie ſingly and looſly. And this <hi>Auſtin (lib. 10. confeſ.</hi>) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to be the Etimology of the word <hi>Cogito, Cogito à cogo,</hi> as <hi>Agito ab ago,
Factito à facio,</hi> as if to cogitate were to force and compell things into our minds.
Let us then mourn and humble our ſelves under this great pollution of nature,
that thoſe things which are of ſuch infinite conſequence, which are as much as
our ſalvation and eternal happineſs are worth, yet we do not, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Hence in the ſixth place, <hi>The memory being not under our command, it falleth
out, that things come into our minds, When we would not have them, yea when it is
a ſinne to receive them.</hi> How often in holy duties, in religious performances, do
we remember things, which happily we could not do, when the fit ſeaſon and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
was for them? Do not many worldly buſineſſes come into our minds,
when we are in heavenly approaches to God, that as <hi>Job.</hi> 1. when the <hi>ſonnes of
God came and appeared before God, then Satan came alſo and ſtood with them?</hi>
Thus when thou art buſie to remember all thoſe Scripture-arguments, which
ſhould humble thee in Gods preſence, which ſhould exalt and life up thy ſoul to
God, How many <hi>heterogeneous</hi> and diſtracting thoughts do croud in alſo, ſo that
this worldly buſineſs, and that earthly imploiment cometh into thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?
Inſomuch that the people of God, though their memories are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſo cleanſed in much meaſure from original filth in the dominion of it,
yet do much groan under this importante and unſeaſonable remembring of
things; for hereby our duties have not that united force and power, as they
ſhould have, neither is God ſo glorified in our addreſſes to him, as he ought to
be, <hi>Pſal. 86. 11. David</hi> there prayeth, <hi>That God would unite his heart to fear
his Name;</hi> And the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. doth therefore ſpeak ſo warily and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
in the caſe of marriage, <hi>That they might ſerve the Lord without diſtraction;</hi>
And no doubt dividing and diverting thoughts are as troubleſome to the godly
heart in holy duties, as the croaking frogs were to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when they came up
into his chamber: Say then with indignation to all thoſe intruding and violent
thoughts, which make thee not <hi>hoc agere,</hi> inſtant in the duty thou art about,
ſtand aloof off, and be gone; Bolt the door upon them, as <hi>Ammon</hi> on <hi>Thamar;
What doth Saul among the Prophets?</hi> How cometh theſe uclean things into the
holieſt of holies? Let the fear of God be like the Porter or Watchman, to keep
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57719:150"/>
out all things that would then come into thy memory, <hi>Liberet me Deus</hi> (ſaid

it is God only thy ſoul is fixed upon, and thou art not diverted otherwiſe, ſuch
duties are effectual and prevail much. Thus you have at large heard the many
waies, wherein this noble and uſefull part of the ſoul is groſly polluted, what a
Sepulchre (as it were) it is, wherein are contained nothing but loathſome and
abominable things. Come we then to make ſome Uſe of it. And</p>

                           <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Is the memory thus defiled about holy and divine objects? It is ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
of what is good? Then we ſee it is no matter of wonder, if the moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

they go away from all Sermons, remembring no more then ſtones in the wall;
They are the Apoſtles <hi>forgetfull hearers,</hi> Jam. 1. and ſo preſently let all things
ſlip out of their minds; Thus forgetfulneſs (of which you hear ſo much) is the
mother of all that diſobedience and wickedneſs many live in. The Apoſtle giveth
a good exhortation, <hi>Heb 2. 1. We ought to give the more earneſt heed to the
things Which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip out of our
mind;</hi> We muſt give earneſt heed: All your thoughts, and care, and ſtudy ſhould
be, how to keep the good truths of God in your mind, and that alwayes, leſt
that every thing thou heareſt ſhould faſten upon thee, even till thou comeſt to
the grave. The Greek word alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> is emphatical; The Margin maketh
it from veſſels that leak; Others from wet and bloached paper, upon which we
cannot write anything. Let us then look to our memories more then we have
done, pray for the ſanctification of them, ſeeing by the evil thereof the Miniſtry
is made ineffectual. And becauſe the memory is thus weak, we ſee the neceſſity
and uſefulneſſe of a two-fold cuſtom, of writing of Sermons, and of repeating
them afterwards in the Family; of writing (for whatſoever ſome pretend to the
contrary, yet) it is a ſpecial means to make a thing be more fixed in our memory;
and this was the reaſon why God would have the King of <hi>Iſrael, write the book
of the Law,</hi> and that <hi>with his own hand,</hi> becauſe hereby he would <hi>remember</hi> it
more tenaciouſly. And as for repeating of Sermons (beſides that it is part of the
Sanctification of the Sabbath) it doth greatly help to make the Word ingraſſed
into us; So that thoſe Families where there is no repeating of the Word preached,
do plainly diſcover, that they regard not the retaining of it in their hearts, and ſo
are not afraid to be found in the number of <hi>forgetfull hearers.</hi>

parents duty, in the conſtant inſtruction and teaching of their children in the
principles of Religion; children have not underſtanding to ſerve God with, and
therefore their memory, which is eaſily quickned in them, muſt be the more drawn
out, that ſo they may ſerve God as they are able: It's good ſeaſoning theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels

thou fear that the doctrinal diſcovery of that poiſoned fountain in thee, and the

but hereby thou wilt be brought to loath thy ſelf, and admire the riches of grace
in Chriſt, which ſhall pardon and glorifie ſuch a noiſome wretch as thou art by
nature. Indeed <hi>Lorinus (Comment. in 17. chap. Act.</hi>) relateth of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some therefore do underſtand this Sonſhip in reſpect of that future glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which in Scripture is ſometimes called Adoption, and 1 <hi>John 3. 1. Then it

faith and Sonſhip be together in time, yet in order of nature one precedeth the

the Deſcription of the <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> for it was not their own power and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
that made them believe; Therefore the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> is ſet down, firſt, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,</hi>
and then <hi>Poſitively; Negatively,</hi> by removing thoſe falſe cauſes that
men might imagine; and we have a three-fold enumeration of them, <hi>Not of
blood, not of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man.</hi> Divers Interpreters go
divers wayes, though much to the ſame ſenſe: Some think the Evangeliſt by <hi>blood</hi>
doth not in the general mean natural generation, and then afterwards diſtribute
it into two particulars, <hi>not of the will of the fleſh,</hi> that is of the woman; <hi>Nor
of the will of man,</hi> that is not of the man. Others (ſuppoſing the general)
interpret the diſtribution thus; <hi>Not of the will of the fleſh,</hi> that is not <hi>naturally;
Nor by the will of man,</hi> that is, not by <hi>humane adoption,</hi> for ſo ſome are made
legal ſonnes amongſt man. Others, they think all theſe enumerations are but to
ſignifie one thing, and therefore the oppoſition to all is <hi>God;</hi> But we may not
think the holy Ghoſt doth ſo induſtriouſly reckon up theſe ſeveral wayes, but
that ſome ſpecial thing is intended by every one; Although, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
the emphatical Article is not in the original. By <hi>blood</hi> therefore we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
any <hi>dignity or excellency of birth,</hi> it's <hi>bloods</hi> in the plural number, either by
an Enallage, and ſo an Hebraiſm, as <hi>Maldenate;</hi> Or elſe becauſe of the long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57719:152"/>
by birth: And this may well oppoſe the carnal opinion reigning both with
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> for all know how the <hi>Jew</hi> boaſted in his birth, becauſe he was
the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore he thought the favour of God neceſſarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
to him; And for the <hi>Gentile,</hi> What a vanity and ſinfull humour is in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to be proud of their birth, that they come of noble parents? For, although
this be an outward civil dignity amongſt men, yet it maketh nothing at all to their

in grace, the <hi>will</hi> conſidered in its <hi>natural</hi> abilities, or in its <hi>acquired</hi> abilities:
Thus 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. The propheſie in old time</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Not to come by the will of man,
but the will of God;</hi> The will of man is there ſuppoſed to be in ſome raiſed and
eminent ability above what it naturally hath, and therefore oppoſed to the will
of God in a more peculiar and extraordinary manner putting forth it ſelf. Thus
we have all falſe cauſes removed, and the true one affirmed, which is God
himſelf.</p>
                        <p>So that this Text doth plainly triumph over all the proud opinions of <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Socinians, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who either give whole or part of the
work of converſion to the will of man; For the Evangeliſt is very diligent
to exclude the will from any efficiency herein, under any reſpect whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

will, polluteth all other things) Let us ſay ſomething to the nature of
the will, not enlarging our ſelves, either as Philoſophers or Divines do in this
point, but ſelect only what is fit for our purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Therefore conſider, <hi>That God hath appointed and ordered in nature, that
every apprehenſive power ſhould have an appetitive power proportionable thereunto.</hi>
The apprehenſive being like the eye to diſcern and diſcover the object; The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive
like the hand to imbrace it: Thus the Angels, as they have an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to know things, ſo they have a will to deſire them; In beaſts there is a
ſenſitive apprehenſion by imagination, and a ſenſitive appetite accordingly. Now
becauſe man in his ſoul is like an Angel, and in his body communicateth with
beaſts, therefore he hath both a two-fold apprehenſion, <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
underſtanding</hi> and <hi>imagination;</hi> and alſo a two-fold appetite, a <hi>rational</hi>
one, which is the <hi>will,</hi> and a <hi>ſenſitive</hi> one, which is the <hi>ſenſitive appetite</hi> in a
man, wherein the paſſions and affections are ſeated; <hi>The will then is in a man
his rational appetite, following the propoſition and manifeſtation of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
For if a man did know what was good, or what is evil, and no appetite to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57719:152"/>
imbrace the one, or avoid the other, he would be no better than a ſtone or a
ſtatue for all his reaſon. We ſee then why God hath placed ſuch a power in the
ſoul, as the will is; It is that the good which the underſtanding manifeſteth may
be imbraced and entertained, and the evil it doth diſcover may be ſhunned, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this will be diſtinct really from the ſoul it ſelf, and from the underſtanding is
a Philoſophical Diſpute, and will not tend to your edification.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though it be the appetite in a man, yet it is a rational appetite, it is
ſubjected in the rational ſoul. <hi>There is a three-fold appetite,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Natural,</hi> which is in the motion of inanimate things, as in the ſtone to
deſcend downwards, this is called an appetite, though properly it is not ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it doth not follow knowledge, but is conſequent upon the forme imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
                        <p>2. There is the <hi>ſenſitive appetite,</hi> which moveth upon the knowledge of ſenſe,
and this is both in beaſts, and alſo in men, yea naturally we live and deſire, even
all the motions of the ſoul are according to ſenſe, and ſo in this reſpect man is
become like the bruit beaſt: But of this afterwards.</p>
                        <p>3. There is the <hi>rational appetite,</hi> and that is called the will, and this is in man
onely; a beaſt hath not properly any will, no more then he hath underſtanding,
ſo that the will of a man is a noble and high faculty in him, appointed to follow
reaſon, and to be regulated by it in all things; and therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas
tantum eſt in bonis;</hi> The will is only in good things; If a man love evil
or deſire evil, this is not <hi>voluntas</hi> (ſaith he) but <hi>cupiditas;</hi> It doth not deſerve
the name of the will, but of luſt, but common ſpeech is otherwiſe, there is a bad
will, a corrupted will as well as a good will, only when we ſay, the will is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
appetite, that muſt not be underſtood <hi>formaliter,</hi> but <hi>participativè,</hi> as
they ſay, that is, the will doth not know, doth not reaſon, but is directed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
therefore it is called <hi>coeca potentia,</hi> a blind power, and if you ſay, it is blind,
How then can it ſee the good propoſed? I anſwer, it followeth the good propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
not becauſe it knoweth it, but becauſe of its eſſential ſubordination to the
underſtanding; Hence it is that to have a <hi>good will,</hi> it is ſo requiſite to have a
<hi>ſound mind.</hi> Ignorant and blind minds are alwayes accompanied with corrupt
and polluted wils; There cannot be a ſanctified will, where there is not an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
mind; This ſhould make the ignorant and ſtupid to tremble in their eſtate
they live in: This ſhould make you prize knowledge above gold and pearls, as alſo
to wait upon the Miniſtery with diligence, ſeeing that by knowledge the will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be made holy.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>we are the more to inform our ſelves about its depravation, by how
much the more noble and excellent it is.</hi> It is hotly diſputed between the two facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> which is the more excellent faculty, the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or the <hi>will;</hi> The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> are for the <hi>underſtanding;</hi> the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> for the <hi>will,</hi>
but theſe two cannot abſolutely and in every reſpect be commended before each
other, only in reſpect of power and efficacy, the <hi>will</hi> is more eminent, for the
underſtanding it ſelf in reſpect of its exerciſe is ſubject to the dominion of the
will, and the will alſo is properly the original and fountain of all good or evil in a
man; for though the underſtanding hath actual ſinfulneſſe, and the affections,
yet this is becauſe of the will either directly or indirectly; ſo that to an actual
deliberate ſinne there is required ſome kind of voluntarineſſe, either expreſly or
interpretatively, either <hi>in ſe,</hi> or <hi>in causâ; Original ſinne</hi> (you heard) was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
in ſome ſenſe, although we need not judge of that by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s rules,
who was ignorant of any ſuch thing. Therefore <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian</hi> triumphed
in his <hi>Ariſtotelical</hi> Philoſophy againſt original ſinne, deſpiſing his Eccleſiaſtical
Judges, as not knowing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Categories; as if (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) he deſired a
Synod of <hi>Peripateticks</hi> rather than Judges in the Church; but though original
ſinne, with the indeliberate motions thereof, have not the actual perſonal will
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57719:153"/>
of a man, yet all other ſinnes have, ſo that the pollution of the will, is in
effect the pollution of the whole man. Hence</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, There is this difference between the underſtanding and the wil
in relation to its objects, The underſtanding doth receive the ſpecies of the object,
to it ſelf, not the objects themſelves; and therefore when we know or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
evil as an object, this doth not defile the underſtanding, but is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of it. Thus Godknoweth all the evil committed in the world, yet his
knowledge is not polluted thereby, <hi>Scire malum, non eſt malum,</hi> but the will that
goeth out to the objects as they are in themſelves, and thereby loving of them,
is what the object is. Thus if we will ſinne it is ſinne, and not if we <hi>know</hi> ſin,
becauſe the will goeth out to a ſinfull object as it is in it ſelf, ſo that above all
keepings we are to keep the will, for what that is placed upon, it preſently
becomes like it; If thou loveſt the world, or earth, thou art earth, thou art of
the world: Hence all the while ſinne is kept out from the will, though it be
in thy mind, though it be by ſuggeſtion to thee, yet becauſe there is no conſent,
it is not thy ſinne but thy miſery. I ſpeak not of the <hi>motus principatus,</hi> which
are antecedent to our will, but of ſuggeſtions only offered from without, but
when the will yeeldeth, when that conſencs, it becometh thy evil immediately,
as poiſon while it is in the remote parts of the body may not kill, but when it
ſtriketh to the heart, then it is mortall. Thus ſinne in temptation, ſinne in
ſuggeſtion doth not deſtroy till the will receive it, ſo great a matter is it to look
to this power of the ſoul. For</p>
                        <p>In the ſixth place, <hi>Becauſe of this rule and dominion the will hath therefore
it is called the univerſall appetite of the whole man.</hi> We ſee all the other powers
of the ſoul have their peculiar and proper inclination, The eye to ſee, the ear
to hear, the underſtand to know, but the will is to will the good for the whole
perſon, therefore it is not limited to one good object, more then another,
but <hi>bonum in communi,</hi> the good in general is the object of it, ſo that the will
is the univerſall appetite and inclination of the whole man; now if this great
wheel that moveth all, be irregular and out of order, what good can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in the leſs wheeles, if the foundation be deſtroyed, how can the building
be eſtabliſhed: Let then your attention, your thoughts and affections be
greatly quickned, while we anatomize all the evil of the will. This is the
moſt grievous and moſt dreadfull inſtance of all the pollution original ſinne
infecteth us with.</p>
                        <p>In the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place, When we ſpeak of the pollution of the will, <hi>The wera [will] may
be take ambigouſly;</hi> for ſometimes therby is denoted, <hi>the power to will,</hi> ſomeomes
again the very <hi>act of willing,</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>the object that we do will,</hi> is often called
<hi>our will:</hi> Thus when the Scripture ſpeaketh of Gods will, it doth ſometimes mean
the <hi>object willed,</hi> and this is often called <hi>Gods will,</hi> ſometimes the <hi>act of willing,</hi>
thus (<hi>if God will</hi>) and ſometimes that <hi>power</hi> whereby he doth <hi>will,</hi> not that there
is, <hi>Potenis volendi</hi> properly in God, for all power is, <hi>Perfectibilis per actum,</hi>
whereas every thing in God, is <hi>actum purus,</hi> only we ſpeak ſo of God, according
to our capacity. Some indeed have queſtioned, Whether we may porperly
attribute the word <hi>[will]</hi> to God; or metaphorically only? but ſeeing that
<hi>ſimply to will, is, Perfectio ſimpliciter ſimplex,</hi> and abſolute and moſt ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
therefore it is not to be denied to God; for as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith He
<hi>that maketh man know, ſhall not be know?</hi> Thus he that maketh man <hi>will,</hi> ſhall
not he <hi>will?</hi> only <hi>will</hi> is not in God, as it is in man, for mans will is carried
out to a good deſired, or not enjoyed. In our will there is, <hi>convenientia</hi>
and <hi>indigentia;</hi> Firſt, A convenience, or ſutebleneſs between the <hi>faculty</hi> and
the <hi>object,</hi> and therefore we <hi>will</hi> it: And then there is an <hi>indigency</hi> or <hi>want</hi>
of it; Now Gods <hi>will</hi> being the ſame with his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> is <hi>abſolutely perfect</hi> and
<hi>ſufficient,</hi> but the <hi>created will</hi> in man is otherwiſe, and this will ſince mans
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57719:153"/>
fall, whether taken for the <hi>power to will,</hi> or the <hi>act of willing,</hi> or the <hi>object
will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d,</hi> is altogether a <hi>corrupt</hi> and a <hi>diſeaſed will,</hi> there is nothing found or
good in it; Although our purpoſe is to ſpeak of the will as a <hi>power</hi> in the
ſoul, yet prone to put it ſelf immediately into actings.</p>
                        <p>In the eighth place, <hi>The will having this great dominion over the whole ſoul,
and being the univerſal appetite of a man, therefore it is that in it is ſeated obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
or diſobedience to God.</hi> Obedience or diſobedience to God is not properly,
at leaſt not primarily, or radically, in any part but in the will. It is true,
all the other parts of the ſoul in regeneration are made holy and ſanctified,
and thereby in their way conformable to the will of God, yet obedience and
diſobedience are primarily acts of the will; ſo that as the will is qualified, ſo
is a man ſaid to be obedient to God: A good will is the good tree, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the fruit good, and a bad will is the bad tree that maketh the
fruit bad. As then all the evil or good of a tree cometh from the
root, ſo doth all the evil or good of a man come from his will; For till this
be ſanctified, till this be renewed, nothing can be good in a man; Therefore
if you examine, what is the cauſe of all the impiety, and all the wickedneſs
that moſt commit, it is becauſe their wills are corrupt, their wils are rebellious;
Their minds, their conſciences many times, tell them they ought to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
only their wils are ſlubborn and contumacious, <hi>Joh. 5. 40. Ye will not
come unto me that ye may have life:</hi> So in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 29. when the
ſonne was commanded to go, and work in the vineyard, he ſaith, <hi>I will not,</hi>
It is then the will of man, that is the deſperate and implacable enemy to all the
things of God, men may delude themſelves with reaſons and fair gloſſes, but
it is their will, and only their unſanctified will, that maketh them continue in
ſuch oppoſition to God; now the will is therefore the root of all obedience,
of diſobedience in a man, becauſe that is like the <hi>Centurion</hi> in a mans ſoul,
whatſoever it biddeth this, or that power of the ſoul do, it doth; what it bids
the mind think, it thinketh; what it bids love to love, it loveth; what it bids
the hand move to, it moveth to; for there are two acts of the will wherein
it demonſtrateth its dominion, The <hi>Elicite acts,</hi> and the <hi>Imperate; Elicite</hi> are
thoſe which the will doth immediately produce, as election, intention, conſent,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and herein it hath full power, yet ſo, as that it's in ſubordination to God;
The <hi>Imperate</hi> acts, are thoſe which are produced by other parts of a man,
yet from the command of the will, ſo when we move our hands or our feet,
theſe are imperate acts of the will; Thus when we turn our mind from one
object, and place it upon another, this is an imperate act of the will: The
affections alſo they are in ſome meaſure under the command of the will, but
not ſo abſolutely as the body and the motions thereof are. By which you ſee
that all things in a man are reduced to his will, and therefore the more active
and univerſal this is, the greater is the defilement thereof.</p>
                        <p>In the ninth place, <hi>The will in regard of its conſtitution at firſt, hath for its
object that which is good;</hi> And in the ſtate of integrity it was alwaies a <hi>true real
good,</hi> but in this ſtate of revolt from God, the will cannot indeed be carried
out to any thing but what is good, <hi>only it's but an apparent good, a diſguiſed
good, it is a true and real evil.</hi> As the object of the underſtanding is truth,
and it cannot give its aſſent to that which doth appear to be falſe, ſo the object
of the will is good; neither can the will have any motion or tendency to any
object, which hath not the colour (at leaſt) of ſome good. As the Devil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in <hi>Samuel's</hi> cloaths, and ſo was believed to be <hi>Samuel;</hi> Thus doth all
the evil in the world, which doth at any time ſeduce and draw the will aſide,
it hath the mantle and covering of good; It being impoſſible that the will
ſhould deſire evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is evil. It is true, ſome deny, that <hi>bonnus</hi> is the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
adiquate,</hi> and <hi>general</hi> of the <hi>will;</hi> but they ſay, <hi>good</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:57719:154"/>
                           <hi>will,</hi> as it is <hi>proſequntiva, proſecuting</hi> and <hi>deſiring;</hi> but <hi>malu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> is the <hi>object of
the will,</hi> as it is <hi>perſequntiva</hi> and <hi>averſiva,</hi> as it doth <hi>repel</hi> and <hi>diſlike,</hi> ſo <hi>evil</hi> is
the <hi>object of the will;</hi> For <hi>diſplicency</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> are <hi>acts of the will,</hi> and the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
of theſe is <hi>evil.</hi> But we ſpeak of the <hi>will</hi> now, as it is a rational deſiring
appetite, ſatisfying it ſelf with love of ſome object, and if this be not good,
either real or apparent, the will can no more tend to it, then the eye to muſick,
or the car to colours; onely by original ſinne, herein ariſeth our unſpeakable
miſerey, that the good which the will doth now imbrace, is onely a counterfeit
ſpecious guilded good, no true real good; They are but ſeeming goods, and real
evils; Like the Glow-worm that ſhineth in the night, and is nothing but an
earthly worm; Like a rotten Poſt or Tree, that in the night ſeemeth to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but in the day we know what it is: Thus if we could take off the viſor, the
painting from thoſe objects, we place our wils upon, we ſhall ſee nothing but
damnable guilt, and real abominable evils, which will at laſt damne our ſouls,
<hi>Per falſa mala itur ad vera bona, per falſa bona itur ad vera mala;</hi> by
that which is ſpeciouſly good, we come indeed to that which is truely
evil; and by that which is apparently evil, we come to what is ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>Laſtly, In the will (according to thoſe that are exerciſed in School-Divinity)
<hi>We are to conceive in it ſutable and proportionable affections, to thoſe we call
paſſions in the ſenſitive part.</hi> Thus in the will (as it is a rational appetite) there
are <hi>love, joy, deſire, fear and hatred.</hi> This is plain, becauſe in <hi>Angels</hi> there are
ſuch affections; ſo alſo in the ſoul ſeparated, there is <hi>love</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> earneſt <hi>deſire</hi>
for the coming of Chriſt, and its reunion to the body; by which it appeareth
evidently, that beſides thoſe paſſions in a man, which work by a corporal tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation,
there are theſe <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>immaterial</hi> affections, or rather <hi>actions,</hi>
and <hi>operations</hi> of the <hi>will;</hi> So that the will loveth, the will rejoyceth, the will
deſireth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the more to be attended unto, becauſe hereby this pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of original ſinne, will appear the more extenſive and diffuſive; The
love of the will, the deſire of the will, the joy of the will are become abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>

dead, not as <hi>Lazarus</hi> four dayes, but ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Take notice of its defilement in all its ſeveral operations, which the will
aboundeth with;</hi> And we find them out of the Schoolmen thus marſhalled; The
<hi>will</hi> (ſay they) may be carried out to good <hi>ſimply,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely</hi> as good, and
then it is only a bare <hi>volition,</hi> which is either <hi>inefficacious</hi> and <hi>conditional,</hi> called
<hi>velleity</hi> or <hi>efficacious</hi> and <hi>abſolute,</hi> then it is <hi>volition</hi> in the general; or elſe it may
be carried out to good <hi>relatively,</hi> as it is <hi>finis,</hi> an end, and then either this end is
<hi>enjoyed</hi> and poſſeſſed, which maketh the act of the will, called <hi>fruition,</hi> or elſe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57719:154"/>
it is <hi>deſired</hi> and purpoſed to be obtained, which maketh another act of the will cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>intention.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the next place, The <hi>will</hi> may be conſidered, as it operates about <hi>the means</hi>
to its intended end. And</p>
                           <p>1. There is a <hi>yeelding unto</hi> and <hi>imbracing</hi> of ſuch a mean propounded to that
end; and this <hi>act</hi> in the <hi>will</hi> is called <hi>conſent,</hi> for the underſtanding that doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>aſſent,</hi> and the will <hi>conſent.</hi> This act of the will to conſent unto a thing is
of great importance in <hi>Caſniſtical Divinity,</hi> for there may be ſuggeſtions and
fiery injections of diabolical temptations, but if the will doth not conſent, as you
ſee Chriſts holy will did not in his combate with the Devil, they do not become
our ſins. Of this conſent more in its time.</p>
                           <p>2. If there be ſeveral means conducible to ſuch an end, then cometh another
act of the will, called <hi>Election,</hi> or a chooſing of one thing rather than another,
that which conſulation is in the underſtanding, <hi>Election</hi> is in the <hi>will.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Laſtly, When the <hi>Will</hi> hath thus intended the end, and choſen efficaciouſly its
means, then is there the laſt act of the will, which is called <hi>uſus</hi> the uſe or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of all the other powers of the ſoul, to bring this end about. It uſeth
the underſtanding, it uſeth the affections, it uſeth the whole body to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh

                           <p>Thus you ſee what are the ſeveral operations of the will; It is now neceſſary
to take all theſe ſingly by themſelves, to ſhew how groſly the <hi>will</hi> is diſordered,
and by that you will be convinced, that the corruption of the will, is indeed the

virtue to be vice. Some indeed diſpute, Whether there be any ſuch actings of
the will as may be called <hi>velleities,</hi> and not <hi>volitions?</hi> But experience teacheth

                           <p>COme we then to the next act of the <hi>Will,</hi> which is an <hi>abſolute and efficacious
willing of a thing,</hi> and here no tongue of men and Angels can expreſſe the
depravation of it; For if we do conſider the <hi>true proper and adequate object of
the will, it is God only;</hi> He is the ſupreme and univerſal good, having in him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an eminent manner all good whatſoever; So that no object can fill the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the will but God only. The good things of the creature can no more fill
up the will, then the air can the ſtomack of an hungry man; but if we conſider
how it ſtandeth with our will, as it is now corrupted, of all objects <hi>it is moſt
averſe to God;</hi> Hence the Scripture deſcribeth every wicked man by this, <hi>That
he hateth God,</hi> not under the notion as he is <hi>good,</hi> but as he is <hi>holy,</hi> as he is a
<hi>juſt Judge,</hi> who will puniſh every wicked tranſgreſſor; Know then, and bewail
this unſpeakable defilement upon thy will, that it is moſt averſe to its proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
no ſtone doth more naturally deſcend to the center, then thy will ſhould
tend to God, <hi>Amor mens pondus meum, illuc feror, quocunque feror,</hi> A mans
love is his weight; now if thy love be ſpiritual, that weigheth thee to God, but
if thy will be carnal, that preſſeth thee to carnal objects.</p>
                           <p>2. Thy will is corrupted in reſpect of its <hi>object,</hi> becauſe all the creatures are to
be willed by thee, no otherwiſe then they tend to God, or lead thee to him,
whereas naturally we will the creatures, for the creatures ſake, and ſo make it in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead
of a God to us: As the Sunne being the <hi>primum viſibile,</hi> all things are to

thing to be beloved, all things are to be loved with a participation from it:
But who may not groan under our corruption herein? Every creature we deſire,
we are apt to terminate our ſelves upon that, and to go no further; Do we will
health, parts and the comforts of this life, in reference to the glory of God? So
that herein we may ſee the depth of our corruption: It was not thus with <hi>Adam</hi>
in his integrity; There is not a creature, that thy will is pitcht upon, but thy
ſoul commits fornication with it; Leave not the meditation of this point, till thy
heart in an holy manner break within thee.</p>

                           <head type="sub">The Corruption of the Will in its Act of Fruition.</head>
                           <p>THe next Act is that which is called <hi>Fruition;</hi> An operation (you heard) of
the will, when it doth <hi>poſſeſs</hi> a thing, as its <hi>ultimate end,</hi> end reſting in it, as a
center, and deſiring no further; For as the ſtone cannot of it ſelf hang in the
air, but muſt deſcend to the earth, and there it reſteth: So the will of man mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
up and down in a reſtleſs manner, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, till it find out an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
wherein it doth acquieſce with fulneſs of content. Now there is no object
that we may thus <hi>frui,</hi> enjoy ultimately, and for it ſelf's ſake, but God onely.
That diſtinction of <hi>frui</hi> and <hi>uti,</hi> to enjoy and uſe only, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> firſt exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated,
the Schoolmen are large upon; To enjoy a thing, is to have it for its
ſelf ſake, referring it to no further end, for the Rule is, <hi>Appetitus finis,</hi> is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitus,
The ſoul never hath enough of that which it ultimately deſireth, but
yet deſireth nothing elſe but that.</hi> As in Philoſophy it is ſaid, <hi>Materia ſemper
appetit formam,</hi> the <hi>Matter doth conſtantly deſire new forms in ſublunary things;</hi>
Hence is that frequent alteration, tranſmutation and generation, but in the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
bodies, the matter (they ſay) is ſatiated, deſireth no other, becauſe of
the great activity and perfection of that form; Thus it is in moral things, the
heart of a man, while carried out to any earthly thing, cannot meet with its
complement and fulneſs of bleſſedneſs, and therefore like the Horſleech ſtill cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Give, give, Sen caret optatis, ſeu fruitur miſer eſt.</hi> It is a <hi>Sheol</hi> that is
alwayes craving, onely when terminated upon God, becauſe he is <hi>bonum quo
nihil melius,</hi> there cannot be any good deſirable, which is not tranſcendently in
him; therefore the ſanctified will doth enjoy him onely: Thus <hi>David, Whom
have I in heaven but thee, and none in earth in compariſon of thee;</hi> In Heaven <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had none but God, not Angels nor Arch-angels, Heaven would not be
Heaven, if God were not enjoyed. Indeed Divines do commonly call the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God in Heaven <hi>fruition,</hi> and that is immediate, compleat and perfect
fruition, but yet even in this life, believers partake of God, have communion
with him, and do enjoy him. It is indeed by ſaith, not yet by viſion, but the
object of faith is as real and operative in the ſoul, though not to ſuch a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as the object ſeen Thus you ſee, that according to the true order and
conſtitution of things, God onely is to be enjoyed, he onely is to be loved, and
deſired for his own ſake, and all things elſe in reference to him. But on the
breadth, the depth and length of our natural defilement therein! What ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Geometry can meaſure the dimenſions hereof? For doth not every natural
man enjoy ſomething or other, which is as a God to him? Why is <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi>
called <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Why are ſome ſaid to have their <hi>belly a God?</hi> Is not all this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they love theſe things, and enjoy theſe things for their own ſelfe's ſake?
Whereas we ought only to uſe them, as inſtruments of Gods glory, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of grace, not to abide or dwell in them; They are to be taken as Phyſick,
which is not received for its ſelfe's ſake, but becauſe of health; So that were it
not for health, a man would never uſe it: Thus it ought to be with us, in all the
comforts we have in this world, to uſe them no further then they are ſubſervient
to our ſpiritual condition; we are <hi>ex officio diſcendere,</hi> not <hi>cupiditate ruere,</hi> ſuch
a crucified and circumciſed heart the Apoſtle exhorteth to, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. The time is
ſhort, thoſe that marry muſt be as if they married not, thoſe that rejoyce, as if they
rejoyced not</hi> If a man deſire a garment, he would not have all the cloath in the
Countrey, but as much as ſerveth for his garment; So neither are we to deſire
wealth, riches, honours, any comfort without end, but as much as will conduce
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57719:156"/>
for Heaven. The travailer will not burden himſelf, no not with gold and ſilver,
who hath a long journey to go; Oh then call off thy will again and again? Say,
Why art thou faſtned here? Why ſtayeſt thou here? Look further, look higher,
This is not God; As the Angel did on a ſuddain ſo raviſh <hi>John,</hi> that he was ready
to worſhip him, but the Angel forbad him, ſaying, <hi>I am thy fellow-ſervant,
worſhip thou God;</hi> So theſe creatures had they a voice would ſpeak, when thou
art at any time raviſhed with the excellency of them, do not love us, love God;
do not delight in us, delight thou in God, we are but thy fellow-creatures, yea
not ſo much, but inferiour and more ignoble then man. <hi>Janſenius (Lib. 2. de
ſtatu naturae lapſae.</hi>) following his <hi>Auſtin,</hi> will not allow us any love to any
thing but God; we may uſe it (ſay they) but not love it; yea he rejects that
aſſertion, we may love the creatures, but moderately; this is (ſaith he) as if
we ſhould ſay, there is a moderate covetouſneſs, a moderate pride; and we muſt
grant, that the Scripture doth many times ſpeak of the love of the creature, as
abſolutely and intrinſecally a ſinne. Thus, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of
the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 15. He doth not ſay, Uſe not the world, but love not the world;
and thus, <hi>The love of money is the root of all evil,</hi> not the having of it or uſing
of it. But this ſeemeth to be too rigid and ſtoical; and it is indeed a meer Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<hi>De nomine;</hi> for, take love in the ſenſe they do, for the <hi>willing</hi> of a thing,
<hi>for its own ſelfe's ſake,</hi> thus it is <hi>intrinſecally a ſinne</hi> to love any creature, it is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Idolatry, and a breach of the firſt command, but then the Scripture doth
allow us to love the creatures, ſo we do not love them more then God. Thus
<hi>Husbands</hi> are commanded <hi>to love their wives,</hi> and we are to <hi>love our Neighbours
as our ſelves;</hi> So that to love the creatures is our duty, we ſhould ſinne, if we
did not, onely the <hi>exceſſe</hi> and <hi>inordinacy is ſinfull,</hi> and this we are guilty of,
when we <hi>enjoy</hi> any thing but God, Now though none will acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
guilty of this ſinne, yet every natural man doth <hi>enjoy</hi> ſome creature or
other, his will is faſtened upon ſomething that is not God: It is true, this ſinne
is very ſecret and ſubtile, the godly themſelves have much ado to find it out
in their own hearts; the will of a man is ſuch an unſearchable <hi>Abiſſe</hi> of all evil,
but do not thou crawl on the ground like a worme any longer, <hi>Set thy affections
on things above.</hi> It is indeed a Queſtion worthy much enquiring into, <hi>How a
man ſhall know whether he doth enjoy a creature or uſe it onely, when it is a</hi>
Sarah, <hi>when an</hi> Hagar <hi>onely?</hi> And here the godly themſelves are often in great
uncertainties; The root of things lieth hid under ground; The firſt Letter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
which beginneth a Book hath ſo many gaudy flouriſhes about it, that it is
hard to know what it is: Thus alſo it is in our hearts and converſations; what is
the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the great wheel that moveth all, the ultimate reſt of our
ſoul, it is very difficult to find out; but it is not my work now to dive into this,
it is enough that we know, <hi>The will of every man is naturally ſo polluted, that it
enjoyeth a creature in ſtead of God,</hi> it cannot will, love, and imbrace him as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

                           <p>THe word <hi>Intention</hi> is a Metaphor from the <hi>Archer,</hi> who aiming at a mark,
uſeth his greateſt skill and endeavour to hit. The Scripture ſpeaks of the
<hi>Benjamites,</hi> as famous in this way; Now every thing that man doth as a rational
agent is to have ſome <hi>end,</hi> ſome mark and aim, and what that is, the Scripture
doth direct unto, <hi>Gods glory</hi> is the aim, <hi>What ever ye do, do all to the glory of God,
1 Cor.</hi> 10. 31. So then we ſee, what is to be the object of our intention, what
we are to aim at in all that we do; Whence alſo we muſt be directed and guided
therein (<hi>viz</hi>) by the Word of God. This being concluded on, we ſee that the
will in every ſinne it commits, doth fail and erre in its intention, therefore is all
ſinne called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, an <hi>aberration</hi> from the ſcope: Every action that is not done

                              </gap>, it was to
no purpoſe, and it cannot be recovered again. All rational agents intend an end,
and if that be not obtained, there is a miſcarriage; So that as in natural things,
when there is ſome errour, a monſter is brought forth: Thus it is in voluntary
and moral things; Every ſinne is a monſter, and thou oughtſt to be more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
and trembling under every ſinne, then a woman would be in ſeeing a
monſter come from her; So that in every ſinne the will is corrupted in its inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But yet more particularly let us conſider, how the intention of the will is
deprived, and that in theſe wayes:</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>When the chief end is not intended, but ſecondary ends, intermedious ends;</hi>
Yea when thoſe things which ſhould be but means are intended as ends, when we
make a wilderneſſe a <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Tabernacle, the Temple, the Inne, a Dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place.
A ſecondary end which a man is to intend is the ſalvation of his own ſoul,
the principal and moſt noble is the glory of God. It is true, God hath ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
conjoyned his glory, and mans ſalvation together, that one cannot be
divided from the other: Therefore it is too rigid of ſome, who preſs this as a
duty upon Chriſtians, to be willing to be damned for Gods glory; That we are
to will our deſtruction, ſo that God may be glorified thereby, for we are to
ſeek for immortality and glory; It would be a ſinne to will our damnation, only
this is a ſubordinate end, Gods glory is the principal: Neither is a Chriſtian anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to perplex himſelf with this Queſtion, <hi>Whether they love Gods glory, or
their own ſalvation beſt?</hi> Some timorated conſciences, and tender ſpirits have
been apt to judge themſelves hypocrites in this thing, thinking they ſerve God
only for Heavens ſake, for their own ends and ſafety, not for Gods glory, which
yet is a greater good, and more to be preferred then the ſalvation of the whole
world; better all men be damned, then God not be glorified. But it is not good
for a Chriſtian to put ſuch Queſtions to his ſoul; Neither was that a wiſe wiſh of
one, who deſired there were neither Heaven or Hell, that ſo he might know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſerved God purely for himſelf or no. Though theſe things are to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet on the other we muſt alſo yeeld, That the glory of God is the ultimate
end, and our ſalvation in ſubordination thereunto; Not that they are to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or oppoſed, for <hi>Subordinata non pugnant,</hi> onely one is leſſe principal, and
the other more principal; But how corrupt is the <hi>wils intention herein? How
many will Heaven as a place of Salvation, but not as a place of Gods glory; they
deſire Salvation as it freeth from Hell torments, but not as it is a perfect ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole man for the enjoyment of God?</hi> Here thy intention is ſinfull and
incompleat, when thou intendeſt Heaven and happineſs, thou art to deſire <hi>all</hi> of
it, not <hi>ſome parts</hi> of it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="280" facs="tcp:57719:157"/>
Again, Our <hi>intenton</hi> is much more corrupted in making the <hi>meanes</hi> to be the
<hi>end;</hi> we make a perfect period and ſtop at a Comma, or a Colon; and truly
this is the general and univerſal corruption of every mans natural intention;
he ſhooteth his arrow too ſhort, he intends no further, then an happy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and merry life in this world; one intends honours, another intends
wealth, another intends pleaſures: There is no natural man can intend any
higher good then ſome creature or other; That as the bruit beaſts have a kind
of improper intention, as they have of reaſon, whereby they are carried out
to thoſe things only that are obvious to ſenſe: Thus it is with man in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
eſtate, deſtitute of regeneration; a worme can as ſoon fly like a Lark
towards Heaven, as this man intend any thing that is ſpiritually good: for the
natural man hath neither a mind or an heart for ſuch holy things, and ſo is like
an Archer that hath neither eyes or hands, and thereby can never reach the
mark.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>The intention of the will is corrupted in its error and miſtake about
its object, it ſhooteth at a wrong mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> It's really and indeed evil which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth,
though it be apparently good, it is in truth poiſon, though it be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
It is true, the rule is, <hi>Nemo intendens malum operatur;</hi> No man inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
evil as evil, but it is propounded under the notion of good, and that even
in thoſe who ſinne againſt the light, and dictates of their own conſcience:
But yet the Scripture ſpeaketh conſtantly of wicked men, as thoſe that <hi>love
evil,</hi> and <hi>will evil,</hi> and <hi>hate good,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>evil,</hi> which their wills are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out unto, though it hath the outward bait and colour of what <hi>is good.</hi>
Herein then we have cauſe with bitterneſs of heart to bewail our ſinfull inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
thou doſt but coſen and delude thy own ſelf, Though thou haſt many
gloſſes, many colours and pretences to deceive thy ſelf with, yet that which
in deed and truth doth alure and bewitch thy ſoul is evil in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
(as it were) of ſome real good: a ſtrumpet, in Matrones
cloaths.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>The intention of the will is herein alſo greatly defiled, that when
it doth any holy and ſpiritual duties, the true motive and proper reaſon of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is not regarded, but falſe and carnal ones. Finis operis,</hi> and <hi>Finis operan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
are not the ſame, as they ought to be. This is the wickedneſs of man, ſo
great that no heads, though fountaines of waters, can weep enough becauſe
of it: The Phariſees they were very conſtant and buſie in prayers, in giving
of almes, but what was their intention all the while? It was to be ſeen of man;
and therefore in the juſt judgement of God, they had that reward. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the will, is thought by ſome to be the <hi>eye</hi> our Saviour ſpeaketh of,
<hi>If that be darke, the whole body is darke,</hi> Matth. 6. 22. <hi>Jebus</hi> did many things
in a glorious manner, as if none were ſo zealous as he, but like the
Kite, though he ſoared high yet ſtill his eye was to ſee what prey
lay on the ground, that he might devour it; it was a kingdome not Gods
glory he intended. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> intended a bag, and riches, in all that ſeeming
love and ſervice he profeſſed to Chriſt: Oh take heed of the intention of thy
will in every holy duty! This maketh, or marreth all.</p>
                           <p>To what hath been ſaid may be further added,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, That we fooliſhly labour to juſtify our bad and ſinfull actions by
our <hi>good intentions,</hi> as if they were able to turne evil unto good, and black
into white: Is not this a continuall plea among natural people, that though
what they do be unlawfull, yet they mean no hurt in it, they have good
hearts and good intentions? Hence it is, that when they have done evil in
the eyes of God, then they ſtudy to defend themſelves by ſome intended good
or other: Thus <hi>Judas,</hi> when he muttered about the <hi>ointment,</hi> powred on
our Saviour, yet he pretends to good intentions, <hi>That the ointment might
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57719:157"/>
have been ſold and given to the poor. Saul,</hi> when he had rebelliouſly ſpared
the beſt of the Cattel, yet he carrieth it, as if his intention had been to keep them
for a <hi>Sacrifice to the Lord:</hi> Yea, the Phariſees in all their malicious and deviliſh
deſigns againſt Chriſt, would be thought, that their high and pure intentions for
the glory of God, did carry them forward in all they did. By ſuch inſtances we
ſee how prone every man is to put a good intention upon a bad action, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
think to waſh himſelf clean from all guilt; but it is againſt the principles of
Divinity, that a good intention ſhould juſtifie that which is a bad action: It is
true, a bad intention will corrupt a good action; ſo vain glory, or to do any
religious duty to be ſeen of men; This is a worme which will devour the beſt
roſe; This is a dead Flie in a box of ointment: But it doth not hold true on the
contrary, That a good <hi>intention</hi> will change the nature of an evil action; The
reaſon whereof is that known Rule, <hi>Malum eſt è quolibet defectu, bonum non
eſt, niſi ex integris cauſis:</hi> Even as in a Picture, one defect is enough to make
it uncomely, but the beauty of it is not, unleſs every thing be concurrent; So in
muſick, any one jarre is enough to ſpoil the harmony; but to make ſweet mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
there muſt be the conſent of all: Do not therefore flie to thy good heart,
to thy good meanings, thou intendeſt no hurt, for if thy action cannot be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Word, if it have not a good and lawfull ſuperſcription upon it,
this will never endure the fiery trial: The Apoſtle maketh all ſuch concluſions
full of horrour and blaſphemy (as it were) that argue, <hi>Let us do evil that good
may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was not lawfull to lie, though
it were to ſave a world.</hi> Conſider then the ſinfulneſſe of thy will, and be
more affected with it, then hitherto thou haſt been: When thou art over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with any ſinne, Doeſt thou not excuſe thy ſelfe with a good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Doeſt thou not plead ſome good or other though aimeſt at in all ſuch
unlawfull wayes? But though man cannot judge thee, yet the All-ſeeing eye of
God doth pierce into all thy intentions, and he knoweth thee better then thou
knoweſt thy ſelf.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The intention of the <hi>will</hi> is greatly corrupted in this particular
alſo, <hi>That it will adde to the worſhip of God, and accumulate precepts and means
of grace</hi> (as they think) <hi>in his ſervice, and all this while think a good intention
will bear them out.</hi> If you ask, Why the Church of God hath not alwayes been
contented with the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, why ſhe hath not wholly kept her
ſelf to divine Inſtitutions? You will find this corrupt intention of the will to be
the cauſe thereof. A good intention brought in moſt of the ſuperſtituous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtituted
Ceremonies that ever have been in the ſeveral ages of the Church,
<hi>Mat. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. In vain do ye worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the commandments
of men;</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> thought by their commands and Doctrines to teach
men the fear and the worſhip of God: This corrupt intention hath eaten out
the very life and power of godlineſs; men taking upon them a more excellent
ſtay (as they think) then the Scripture hath revealed, to teach reverence and
devotion; From whence are thoſe frequent commands to the people of <hi>Iſrael,
That they muſt not go after the imagination of their own hearts; That they muſt
not do what is good in their own eyes;</hi> That they muſt <hi>not adde to,</hi> or <hi>take from
the word of God;</hi> By theſe ſtraight and cloſe injuctions, we ſee that no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatſoever (though never ſo ſeemingly pious and reverential) will warrant
a man to appoint any worſhip of God from his own head. <hi>Vzzah</hi> had a good
intention, when he endeavoured to ſtay the Ark from falling; but God was ſo
diſpleaſed thereat, that he ſtruck him dead immediately; now the reaſon was,
becauſe Gods order was not kept about the Ark; <hi>Vzzah</hi>'s intention did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
him from Gods diſpleaſure, ſo neither will their devout intention juſtifie
ſuch who do ſuperadde to Gods worſhip. Some obſerve that expreſſion of
<hi>Eve</hi>'s, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3. where ſhe ſaith, <hi>That God had ſaid, they ſhould not eat of it,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57719:158"/>
nor touch it, left they die;</hi> We do not read that God forbad them to touch, yet
(it's thought) this was added by <hi>Eve</hi> for caution ſake, as if ſhe were ſo carefull
to keep Gods command about eating, that ſhe addeth, they muſt not ſo much as
touch it; From whence <hi>Ambroſe</hi> gathereth, <hi>Nihil vel boni causâ addendum eſt
precepto:</hi> But oh how buſie and active have many at all times been in the Church
to bring in new worſhip, new inſtitutions, of which there is no footſtep in Gods
Word, as if they were more carefull of Gods honour and glory, then he himſelf
is! But though with men this ſinne be accounted ſmall, ſaying, They cannot
worſhip God too much, they cannot be exceſſive in ſerving of him, yet this is
an high ſinne in the Scripture account; It being one of Gods royalties, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
what ſhall be his Worſhip: Shall a ſervant take upon him to make Rules
in his Maſters houſe? Let men that dote upon ſuperſtition, and are inamoured
with cuſtoms of devotion, that have no command from Scripture; Lay this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeriouſly to heart: Oh how terrible will it be, when thy Devotion and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
will appear abomination! God asking thee, <hi>Who hath required this thing at
thy hands?</hi> The Ape is therefore the more deformed, becauſe ſo like a man, and
yet is not a man: Thus all that worſhip, which hath the greateſt appearance of
humility, zeal and mortification, which yet hath not its original from God, is
the more loathſome to ſuch as are of a ſpiritual taſt and judgement in heavenly
things, ſerving of God, not in the way they chuſe, but in the manner he hath
commanded. And thus much for the act of <hi>Intention.</hi>

                           <p>WE ſhall in the next place, conſider thoſe that relate to the <hi>means which
lead to the end;</hi> and I ſhall firſt begin with <hi>Election or Chuſing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in that is contained either life or death; For as the <hi>Election</hi> of God, or his
meer <hi>chuſing</hi> of <hi>ſome to eternal life,</hi> is the fountain of all the good, which ſuch
perſons partake of, all their ſprings are in it; So the <hi>election</hi> or <hi>choice</hi> of man is
the womb, wherein all happineſs or miſery is conceived: If a man have right <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi>
and <hi>true ends,</hi> yet if he <hi>chuſe</hi> falſe, ſinfull and ungodly means, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to that end; It is as if a man ſhould intend his home, or dwelling-place,
which is in the North, and he chuſe that road or way, which leadeth into the
South. It is acknowledged by all, That in every man there is an innate appetite
to the chiefeſt good; but as naturally all men do erre about the knowledge of it,
what it is, ſo alſo about the means, how to attain it. But let us open this viper,
and ſee what a poiſonous brood is in it. As</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Herein is the ſinfulneſs of the wils choiſe manifeſted, <hi>That it electeth and
imbraceth ſuch things as are pleaſing to fleſh and blood, that are ſuitable to ſenſe,
although there be never ſo many ſnares and temptations, thereby to endanger the
ſoul.</hi> As it was with <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 13. 10, 11. when <hi>he beheld all the plain of jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
to be well watered,</hi> and that it was <hi>like the garden of God, he choſe all that
countrey, and departed from Abraham;</hi> But in what ſad dangers did this unwiſe
choice of his caſt him into? And thus it is with every man naturally, he chuſeth
ſuch conditions, ſuch wayes, as are full of pleaſure, profit and advantages, in the
mean while not conſidering how quickly this honey is turned into choler, that
rugged and difficult wayes had been better then ſuch ſweet and pleaſant wayes:
Whereas then Moral Philoſophy maketh a three-fold good, <hi>Vtile, Jucundum</hi>
and <hi>Honeſtum, Profitable, Pleaſant</hi> and <hi>Honeſt,</hi> or <hi>Virtuous,</hi> and the later is
properly and fully the object of the will, that is ſo depraved, that it chuſeth only
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:57719:158"/>
what is advantagious or pleaſant. Experience doth abundantly confirm this, for
what man naturally till regenerated doth chuſe any thing, but as it is connatural
to, and commenſurated with that depraved appetite within: <hi>David</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened
with a ſupernatural life, ſee what a choiſe he declareth that he had made,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30, 173. In both thoſe verſes he profeſſeth, <hi>He had choſen the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God:</hi> Hence the <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> who knew what was fitteſt to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
ſaith. <hi>Prov. 16. 16. That wiſdome and underſtanding</hi> (which is nothing but
grace) <hi>is to be choſen rather then gold or ſilver:</hi> If then the will were truly ſanctified,
it would not chuſe a thing, becauſe it is delightſome and profitable, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it's holy and commanded by God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. 15. it is made the deſcription of
a child, <hi>That he knoweth not to refuſe the evil, and chuſe the good:</hi> Thus the child
(and a fool) he will chuſe his bauble before gold or ſilver; ſuch folly and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
is upon us; The will is ſo perverted that it will chuſe any thing rather then
that which is indeed and ſolidly good.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The election of the will is groſly depraved, <hi>In that it chooſeth
uncertain things before certain;</hi> not only pleaſant and profitable things before
holy and honeſt, but uncertain and fading things, before that which is eternal
and will continue ever; And wherein can the wils ſinfulneſs be proclaimed more
then in this? Is it not a rule commended by all wiſe men, <hi>Tene certum &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
incertum,</hi> Hold that which is certain, and let go that which is uncertain?
All men have ſuch a will in worldly things, they would chuſe a certain eſtate, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then what is meer arbitrary, and may be loſt the next day; but if we bring
theſe men unto ſpiritual objects, and temporal objects, lay one in the one ſide,
and the other on the other ſide, yet they will chuſe the temporals, and let go
the ſpirituals; Though the temporals are tranſitory and fleeing away, whereas
ſpiritual things would be eternal, they would continue thine for ever: Oh fooliſh
and unwiſe men who make ſuch a choice! And yet this is the ſtate of every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man, What doth he ſay? Give me the good things of this world,
though I loſe Heaven and eternal Glory; Let me have a day pleaſure, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
profit, though I have an eternity of loſs and torments: Conſider then with
thy ſelf, what a fooliſh choiſe thy will doth make all the day long; Thou chuſeſt
that which will leave thee, which is here to day, and like the graſs to morrow is
thrown into the Oven, and in the mean while there is that good which will abide,
though Heaven and Earth ſhould fall, and this thou art willing to paſs by: Was
not <hi>Dives</hi> called a fool upon this account? <hi>This night thy ſoul ſhall be taken away,
and then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be?</hi> The ſinfulneſſe of thy will herein, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be enough lamented, till with <hi>Dives</hi> thy eyes be opened in Hell, and then
thou behold what a choice thou haſt made. Chriſt giveth <hi>Mary</hi> this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That ſhe had choſen the better part</hi> (Luke 10. 42.) <hi>and that ſhould never be
taken from her.</hi> Oh that this alſo could be ſaid of thee truly, thou haſt choſen the
good part! Though the wicked and ungodly of the world think it is the worſe
part, and they would never take it, yet it is the good part, and that becauſe
it will never be taken from thee: Thy grace, thy good workes will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave thee, but they will goe to the grave with thee, to Heaven with
thee.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, This ſinfulneſs of thy <hi>Will</hi> in chuſing, is ſeen, when thou hadſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>ſinne</hi> then become <hi>afflicted;</hi> and yet this is naturally adhering to every one,
he will rather chuſe to wound conſcience, to goe againſt light rather than be
brought into trouble: Doth not every man naturally judge this the beſt, and ſo
chuſe it? Hence he never mattereth what God requireth, what may damn his
ſoul hereafter, only he is reſolved he will not put himſelf upon any hardſhip for
Chriſt, but will launch no further in this deep then he can ſafely retire back again:
Every man would naturally get an Ark to ſave himſelf in, when any publick wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
do overflow; ſo they eſcape danger, they regard not Gods glory, or the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57719:159"/>
Churches good; <hi>Job</hi>'s friends did faſten this upon him, but falſly, <hi>Job 36. 21.
Take heed, regard not iniquity, for this haſt thou choſen rather then affliction;</hi> They
thought <hi>Job</hi> deſired to ſinne, and would chuſe that rather then to be afflicted by
God, though <hi>Job</hi> being ſanctified was free from this charge; yet it is too true of
every man by nature: Oh what power of grace is neceſſary to make a man chuſe
to do his duty, rather then have all the advantages of the world! It was <hi>Anſelm's</hi>
expreſſion, <hi>That if ſinne were on one ſide, and hell flames on the other, he
would chuſe rather to go through them rather then ſinne:</hi> Even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could ſay,
<hi>A virtuous man would die rather then do any diſhoneſt thing:</hi> But the Scripture
giveth an admirable commendation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> worthy all our imitation, <hi>Heb.
11. 25. Chuſing rather to ſuffer for Chriſt, then the pleaſures of Aegypt; Moſes</hi>
that might have had all the pleaſure and honours of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet becauſe he
could not have them without ſinne, he rather chuſeth the poor and deſpiſed eſtate
that his brethren were in. So that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth in this caſe ſomething like <hi>Hiram,
1 King.</hi> 9. 13. to whom <hi>Solomon</hi> gave many Cities, but <hi>Hiram</hi> did not like them,
and called that place <hi>Cabul,</hi> that is, <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> or <hi>dirty:</hi> Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> called
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and all his honours <hi>Cabul</hi> in reſpect of Chriſts favour and his
love. Did not all the holy Martyrs likewiſe do the ſame things? Were not many
of them offered life, liberty, yea great places of honour, if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Chriſt, if they would forſake his way? But they did not ſtand delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and doubting, what they ſhould do, they immediately chuſe to be impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
burnt at the ſtake, rather then not confeſs Chriſt and his way; but the <hi>will</hi>
naturally cannot make ſuch a choice.</p>

                           <p>THe ſinfulneſſe of the <hi>Will</hi> in its noble and famous operation of <hi>Election</hi> or
<hi>chuſing</hi> hath been in a great meaſure conſidered, I ſhall adde two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
more, and what is further to be taken notice of in this point, will ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
come in, when we are to treat of the <hi>Will</hi> in its freedome, or rather
ſervitude.</p>
                           <p>The firſt of theſe two to be mentioned is, <hi>The loſſe of that aptitude and readineſſe
it ſhould have to follow the deliberation and prudent adviſe of the underſtanding.</hi>
For this is the privitive Inſtitution and nature of the ſoul in its operations; The
underſtanding when the end is pitched upon doth conſult and deliberate in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
way about the means which may conduce to that end, and when prudence
doth direct about thoſe things which are to be done, then the will is to imbrace
and elect that <hi>medium</hi> rather then any other, which reaſon doth thus wiſely ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt;
Thus it ought to be, now the will being wholly corrupt doth not chuſe
according to the dictates of prudence, but the ſuggeſtions of ſenſe, and the carnal
affections within us; So that naturally a man chuſeth an object, not becauſe reaſon
or prudence ſaith, This is good, this is according to Gods will, but becauſe ſenſe or
affection ſaith, this is pleaſant and delightfull. This ſad perverting of the order of the
will in its operations, if rightly conſidered, would throw us upon the ground, and
make us with great amazement and aſtoniſhment cry out of our ſelves; For what
can be more abſurd and grievous then the will, which is ſo eſſentially ſubordinated
in its chuſing to the guidance of the underſtanding, ſhould now be ſo debaſed, that
like <hi>Samſon</hi> without eyes, it is made to grind in evey mill, that any carnal affection
ſhall command; we may ſee the good method and rule the will ſhould walk by in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:57719:159"/>
its choice, by that which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Deut. 30. 15. 19. See, I have ſet before
thee this day life and death, good and evil. I call heaven and earth to record this
day againſt you, that I have ſet before you life and eath, curſing and bleſſing;
therefore chooſe life.</hi> Obſerve what ſhould direct us in chooſing, <hi>viz.</hi> That
which the ſervants of God deliver from the Word, and ſo that which the mind
of a man enlightned from thence doth declare to us, and for defect herein it
is that we chooſe evil and death, for how often doth the Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
yea thy own conſcience it may be within thee, obteſt and adjure thy will,
as herein the Text <hi>Moſes</hi> did the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I call heaven and earth
to witneſs, ſaith conſcience, that I have ſhewed thee the good thou wert to
do, I have terrified and threatned thee with hell, and that vengeance of God
which will follow thee upon the commiſſion of ſuch ſinnes: Therefore look
to thy election, ſee again and again what it is that thou chooſeſt. But though
all this be done, yet the will will chooſe what affections ſay, what ſenſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth,
dealing herein like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who would not hearken to the advice
and direction of the ancient grave and wiſe counſellors, (thou <hi>plus valet
umbraſenis, quam gladius juvenus,</hi> as the expreſſion is in the civil law) but he
gave his ear to the yong men that flattered him, and were brought up with him,
which proved to his deſiruction. Thus the will in its choice it maketh, liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not to what the mind doth with deliberation and prudence direct to, but
what the inferior appetite doth move unto, that it followeth: And this is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all thoſe ſad and unſuccesfull choices we make in the world, this layeth
work for that bitter repentance and confuſion of ſoul which many fall into
afterward; Oh that I had never chooſen this way! Oh that I had never uſed
ſuch meanes! Oh me never wiſe! Oh fooliſh, and wretched man that I am?
Eſpecially this bitter bewailing and howling about what we have choſen, will
be diſcovered in hell, what will thoſe eternal yellings and everlaſting roarings
of ſoul be, but to cry out, Oh that I had never choſen to commit ſuch ſinnes!
Oh that I had never choſen ſuch companions to acquaint with! Thus the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and ſinnefull choice thou makeſt in this life, will be the oil as it were
poured into thoſe flames of fire in hell, to make them burne ſeven times
hotter.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The other particular wherein this corrupt frame of the will in
election is ſeen is, <hi>That in the meanes it doth chooſe, it never conſidereth how
juſt, and lawfull, and warrantable, the meanes are, but how uſefull;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though God be offended, though his Law be broken, yet he will chooſe
to do ſuch things, whereas we muſt know that God hath not only required
the goodneſs of an end, but alſo the lawfulneſs, and goodneſs of the meanes,
and the ſanctified will, dareth not uſe an unlawfull <hi>medium</hi> to bring about the
moſt deſired good that is; but the carnal heart, taketh up that rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical
Politian, <hi>Quod utile eſt, illud juſtum eſt,</hi> That which is profitable,
that is juſt and righteous: That famous act of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> being provoked
to it by <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the Juſt, may ſhame many Chriſtians, when <hi>Themiſtocles</hi>
had a ſtratagem in his head againſt their enemies, telling the people, he had
a matter of great weight in his mind, but it was not fit to be communicated to
the people, The people required him to impart it to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> who being
acquainted with it, declareth it to the people, That <hi>Themiſtocle</hi>'s counſell was
<hi>utile,</hi> but <hi>injuſtum,</hi> profitable but unjuſt; by which meanes the people would
not purſue it. Here was ſome reſtraint upon men by the very principles of a
natural conſcience, but if the will be left to it ſelf, and God neither ſanctifying
or reſtrayning it; it looketh only to the goodneſs and profitableneſs in means
never to the lawfulneſs of them. Some have diſputed, <hi>Whether it be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to perſwade to uſe a leſs evil that a greater may be avoided?</hi> They inſtance
in <hi>Lot</hi> offering his daughters to the <hi>Sodomites</hi> to be abuſed by them, rather then
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57719:160"/>
commit a more horrid impiety, by abuſing themſelves with mankind (as they
thought thoſe ſtrangers to be) but the Scripture rule is evident and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<hi>We muſt not do evil that good may come of it,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. Neither doth a
leſs evil ceaſe to be an evil, though compared with a greater; and therefore
as in a <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> if one of the premiſes be falſe, there cannot be inferred a
true concluſion, <hi>è falſo nil niſi falſum,</hi> ſo alſo, è malo nil niſi malum, from
an evil meanes there can never come, but that which is evil, though indeed
God may by his omnipotent Power work good out of evil; know then that it
cometh from the pollution of thy will, that thou dareſt make choice of means,
not becauſe juſt or righteous, but becauſe profitable for that end thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt.</p>

                           <p>VVE proceed to another act of the Will, as it is exerciſed about the
meanes which is called <hi>Conſent;</hi> for though in order of nature,
this doth precced election, yet becauſe I intend not to ſay much about it at
this time, becauſe more will be ſpoken to it, when I ſhall treat of the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
effects of original ſinne; I therefore bring it in, in this place. And for
to diſcover the ſinfulneſs hereof, we muſt know, That the will hath a two-fold
operation or motion in this reſpect, for there are <hi>motus primo primi,</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and firſt ſtirrings of the will antecedently to any deliberation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
The natural man being wholly carnal cannot feel theſe, no more then
a blind man can diſcern the motes in the air, when the Sunne-beames do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
it; but the godly man, as appeareth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. he findeth ſuch motions
and inſurrections of ſinne within him, and that againſt his will. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be true, when there are ſuch motions of the will, but reſiſted and
gainſayed, they are not ſuch ſinnes as ſhall be imputed unto us; and thus far
<hi>Bernards,</hi> expreſſion is to be received, <hi>Non necet ſenſus rei deeſt conſenſus,</hi>
yet they are in themſelves truely and properly ſinnes. The Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
are at great difference in this point. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> denying all ſuch
indeliberate motions antecedent to our conſent to be properly ſinnes, but the
Reformed do poſitively conclude they are, and that becauſe the Apoſtle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. calleth them <hi>often ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>ſinnes that are againſt the law,</hi> and which
ought to be <hi>mortified.</hi> It is true, we further adde, when the ſanctified ſoul
doth withſtand them, cry out to God for aid againſt them; as the maid in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be defloured, if ſhe called out for her help, the Law of God did then
free her; ſo God alſo will through Chriſt forgive ſuch ſinfull motions of thy
ſoul, which appear in thy heart, whether thou wilt, or no; yet for all this,
theſe ſtirrings of the will being inordinate and againſt the Law of God, which
requireth not only pure ſtreames, but a pure fountain alſo, therefore they
are truly culpable, and ſo damnable. Let then a man obſerve, whether <hi>Egypt</hi>
was once fuller of flyes then thy heart is of inordinate motions; for as the pulſe
in the body is alwayes beating, ſo the will is alwayes in action, it's alwayes
moving to ſome object or other, and being naturally corrupted, it doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
tend, either to an object unlawfull, or if lawfull, in an unlawfull and
immoderate way.</p>
                           <p>But in the ſecond place, Beſides theſe <hi>indeliberate motions,</hi> there are thoſe
which are <hi>deliberate, to which the will doth give free and full conſent;</hi> and theſe
are greater ſinnes then the former, becauſe the more voluntary; and certainly
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:57719:160"/>
the will of a man is as full of ſinfull conſents, as the Sea is of water: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
any luſt, any ſinne cometh to tempt thee, How eaſily and quickly
is thy conſent obtained? Indeed outwardly to commit the ſinne that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times hardly accompliſht, there may want the opportunity, fear or ſhame
may reſtrain men, but to conſent to ſinne, yea that which is moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
may be a thouſand times over committed by the will in a little ſpace.
Now that the wils conſent to a ſinne is a ſinne, if it be kept within onely,
and not expreſſed in the outward act, is difficulty believed; even as they
think their thoughts, ſo alſo the deſires of their will are free in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
Yea it ſeemeth to be the conſtant Doctrine of the Phariſees, <hi>That if
a man did externally obey the Law of God, though in his heart he did will
the contrary, yet the Law did not condemn him:</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
our Saviour doth expound the Law ſo exactly and ſpiritually, and that it
ſeemed a great Paradox to the received Traditions at that time, for our Lord,
doth there ſhew, That if a man doth <hi>luſt after a woman in his heart it is
adultery</hi> and ſo of all other groſſe ſinnes: If then thou doeſt will in thy
heart, deſire and conſent in thy heart to any ſinne, though thou canſt not,
or dareſt not commit it; Here God looketh upon thee, as ſuch a ſinner;
for as in holy things God accepteth the will for the deed, ſo in evil things,
the will to do it, the conſent to do it, is as if thou hadſt done it, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
fecimus, quantum volumus,</hi> even <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay. What thunder and
lightning is in this truth, if rightly underſtood; Goe and ſearch thy will,
make ſtrict examination about it, and thou wilt find ſparks, doe not flie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
from the forge then ſinfull conſentings doe iſſue from thee all the day
long. No ſooner doth any voluptuous, ambitious or profitable object ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in thy ſoul, but thy will hath ſecretly conſented to it, and imbraced,
even before thou canſt tell what thou haſt done: Now this ſinfull temper of
the will is the more pernicious and dangerous, becauſe theſe conſentings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to ſinne, are ſo ſudden and imperceivable, that thouſands of them
came from the ſoul almoſt in a twinkling of an eye, and the heart feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them not: Doe not then thinke to juſtifie thy ſelfe, becauſe thou canſt
with the Phariſee thank God, that thou art no adulterer, no drunkard, no
Publican, for if thou haſt at any time a ſecret conſent to theſe things, if
thy heart imbrace them, though thou dareſt not externally commit them;
The holy and ſpiritual Law of God will find out theſe ſins in thee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
thee for them.</p>
                           <p>In the next place, Conſider alſo that there is a two-fold conſent to a ſinne,
<hi>Expreſſe</hi> and <hi>Formal,</hi> or <hi>Interpretative</hi> and <hi>Virtual;</hi> an expreſſe conſent is,
when the will doth actually yeeld it ſelf up to any luſt that doth tempt it:
Thus <hi>Cain</hi> expreſly conſented to the murder of <hi>Abel; Judas</hi> to the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt. But a virtual conſent is, when we yeeld to that from which
ſuch a ſinne will either neceſſarily, or probably follow, although we do not
expreſly think of the ſinne: Thus a man that is voluntarily drunk, if in his
drunken fits he kill any, or commit any other groſſe impiety, he may be
ſaid interpretatively to will all that wickedneſſe, though for the preſent he
knoweth not what he doth. Thus the beſt <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> doe determine, and the
reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a man doth voluntarily expoſe himſelf to the cauſe
of all ſuch evils, and he who willeth the cauſe of a ſinne, may be juſtly ſaid
to will the ſinne that is the effect; Know then thy conſent to ſinne may
extend further then ever thou thoughteſt of; Such ſinnes may lie at thy door
ready to arraign thee, becauſe though thou didſt not expreſly will them, yet by
conſequence thou didſt. Therefore <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 44. when thoſe workers of
iniquity plead, <hi>They never ſaw Chriſt hungry or in priſon, and did not mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:57719:161"/>
to him;</hi> Our Saviour replieth, That <hi>becauſe they did not ſuch things to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
they did them not to him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>This conſent of the will is not onely to the evil that we doe in our
own perſons commit, but alſo to that which others are guilty of.</hi> And here
now might be a large field, wherein the ſinfulneſſe of our corrupt will may
be diſcovered; and this conſent of the will to other mens ſinnes, may be
(as Divines ſhew) many wayes, but I muſt not enlarge therein: It is
enough for the preſent, to know the will is ſo corrupt, that as if it were
too little to conſent to its own ſinne, it's frequently yeelding to the ſinnes
of others, whereby the ſinnes of other men are made ours, and ſo at the
day of Judgement ſhall ſtand arraigned, both for our own and other mens
ſinnes alſo.</p>
                           <p>The laſt act of the will is, <hi>That which they call</hi> uſus, <hi>the application of
the other parts of the ſoul and body to bring about the evil deſired.</hi> In this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the will, becauſe of the univerſal dominion it hath, doth demonſtrate the
vaſt extent of its ſinfull kingdome. This ſinfull will commands the body in
a deſpicable manner to be inſtrumental to ſinne; It bids the eye look upon
wanton objects, and it doth it; it commands the tongue to ſpeak obſcene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wantonly, to lie, or curſe, or ſwear, and it doth it; all thy bodily ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
is committed, becauſe the will commandeth it to be done: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the affections are not under ſuch an abſolute command by the will,
but rather they ſometimes ſubjugate and keep that under them, yet at other
times, the will cauſeth them to ariſe, men love and hate, becauſe they will.

                           <p>THis truth cannot be ſuperſtructed better, then upon this foundation in the
Text, which is a noble ingredient into that famous portion of Scripture,
wherein the Doctrine of thoſe ſublime myſteries about <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi>
are profeſſedly handled, and thoſe Objections which the preſumption of humane
reaſon is ready to produce, are fully anſwered. So that whereas in other places
that Doctrine is only occaſionally or incidentially handled, here the Apoſtle doth
induſtriouſly treat of the nature of it. Thus it hath of old been interpreted, and
of late by the <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Onely <hi>Arminius</hi> following <hi>Suecanus</hi> in part, and the
<hi>Remonſtrants</hi> after <hi>Arminius</hi> they have excogitated a new <hi>Analyſis</hi> of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
full of abſurdity and impertinencies; for they would not have the Apoſtle
at all to treat of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> of perſons, they turn themſelves and
the Scripture into all ſhapes and forms to evade that, but they interpret it of a
two-fold Purpoſe or Decree of God, The one whereof they ſay is, <hi>That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth believe ſhall obtain Juſtification, Adoption and Salvation:</hi> The other,
<hi>That whoſoever ſeek for righteouſneſſe by the works of the Law ſhall be rejected
from all theſe.</hi> This (they ſay) is the ſcope of the Apoſtle: But who ſeeth not
what forcing and wreſting this is of Scripture? So that we may wonder, how
ſuch an interpretation could come into their mind; for the Apoſtle doth not
ſpeak of <hi>Conditions,</hi> but of <hi>Perſons,</hi> his ſcope is not to ſhew, that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
who are received, and workers who are rejected. The Apoſtle had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
confirmed this in the fourth Chapter, but he intends to ſhew the <hi>Dominion</hi>
and <hi>Sovereignty of God</hi> in the eternal diſpoſing of mens perſons, and that upon
the occaſion of Gods rejecting the <hi>Jews,</hi> and calling in the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Therefore
he ſaith, <hi>To whom he will, he ſheweth mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth:

ſome Orthodox do yeeld, it will all come to the ſenſe, that he was an object
on whom God would demonſtrate his power and juſtice, or kept by God for a
while, as ſome Anatomiſts do a dead body before they bury it, to gather profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
obſervations for the good of others: not that God infuſed any evil in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
heart (though the Scripture uſeth three words concerning <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the
one is to <hi>confirm</hi> or <hi>corroborate</hi> his heart, and that is aſcribed to God ſeven times.
The other is to <hi>harden,</hi> and that is once (though we render the word to <hi>corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
to <hi>harden.</hi>) The laſt is, <hi>To aggravate or make heavy,</hi> which is once like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
aſcribed to God, (which is alſo rendered by our Interpreters to <hi>harden,</hi>)
not (I ſay) that this expreſſion denoteth, God did put any ſinfull frame into
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart; nor yet on the other ſide, is it to be underſtood of a meer bare
permiſſion of God, as if he did no more then ſuffer him by his patience to be
hardened, but <hi>God as a juſt Judge did for Pharaoh's ſinne antecedent juſtly deny him
any molifying grace, leaving him to his luſts,</hi> which in ſuch occaſions as he had, did
break out into a more violent flame; So that the whole blame lay upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
himſelf, not on God; Hence it is, that he is ſo often ſaid, <hi>To harden his own heart.</hi>
Now this example of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could not make at all to <hi>Paul</hi>'s purpoſe, if his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to prove, that God would reject all ſuch who ſeek for righteouſneſs by
the works of the Law, for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was an Heathen, he was ignorant of Gods
Law, and could not ſeek for Juſtification by the works thereof. Beſides, if the
Apoſtle did not intend to ſhew Gods purpoſe abſolutely and inconditionately (in
a well explained ſenſe) about perſons, but only his Decree about their qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
what occaſion was there for <hi>Paul</hi> to make ſuch an Objection, <hi>Is there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
with God?</hi> And then firſt to objurgate the Objector, <hi>Who art thou,
O man, that diſputeſt againſt God?</hi> And then returneth a full anſwer to the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
from the leſſe to the greater, from the <hi>Potter,</hi> who hath <hi>power over the
ſame clay to make a veſſel of honour or diſhonour.</hi> Theſe Objections and Anſwers
could have no place in the <hi>Remonſtrantical Analyſis</hi> and <hi>Interpretation;</hi> For who
would argue it injuſtice in God to reject ſuch who did not believe in Chriſt, but
ſought for Juſtification by the Law? If the Apoſtle did prove only two ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
about the wayes to ſalvation and damnation, here was no ſuch myſtery
tranſcending humane expectation. This is certain, the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> commend
their way of common Election, making the determinate event to be by man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
in a moſt plauſible and colourable manner, as being moſt agreeable to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
reaſon and equity. There is no man would diſpute againſt God in this,
whereas the other expoſition ſtrongly purſued by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and for the dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it to fleſh and bloud, which is ready to call God to an account for his
adminiſtrations was greatly diſliked by many and a ſcandal to them; Even as at
this day, it ſtill meeteth with the ſame unkind entertainment from <hi>Lutherans,
Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who make an Univerſal Conditional Election, whereby
(they ſay) God would have all to be ſaved, even the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> themſelves,
as they are pleaſed to inſtance by deriſion. Well if this part of Scripture will not
convince, I know not what light will, and they muſt needs be prepoſſeſſed, who
can let their judgements aſſent to ſuch a remote and forced explication; Not to
adde that the Decree which they make about Gods rejection of ſuch who ſeek for
Juſtification by works <hi>is falſe;</hi> for did not many <hi>Jews</hi> following the righteouſneſs
of the Law, at laſt believe in Chriſt; Was not <hi>Paul</hi> once zealous for the works
of the Law? Yet afterwards an affectionate admirer of the righteouſneſs by faith.

But we leave theſe bold Interpreters who do aſſume more to themſelves in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

make a ſenſe of honour and a ſenſe of diſhonour.</p>
                           <p>Come we therefore more particularly to the words in hand, and as appeareth

As for thoſe, though men of great Antiquity, who ſuppoſe theſe words ſpoken
not by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, as in his own perſon, but in the perſon of ſome opponent,
it is ſo weak that it is not worth the reſuting; For the Apoſtle in the beginning of
the Chapter, uſeth great aſſeveration and atteſlation, even with a ſolemn oath
concerning his great affection to the <hi>Jews</hi> and their ſalvation, to whom alſo he
attributeth great Church priviledges and ſpiritual prerogatives, and this he doth,
becauſe he was to deliver moſt dreadfull matter, which would be exceeding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing

they were circumciſed as well as the other, and called <hi>Act. 3. The
children of the promiſe,</hi> and if this were not ſo, the Apoſtle ſhould in the ſame

<hi>That to them did belong the Covenants and the Promiſes:</hi> Hence that whole
Nation is ſometimes called <hi>his ſonne,</hi> yea his <hi>ſieſt born, and ſonne of delights;</hi> But
though <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children thus after the fleſh, and in ſome ſenſe of the promiſe
alſo, yet not in that ſenſe, as the Apoſtle meaneth here, ſo as to be the bleſſed
ſeed, and elected by God in Chriſt: Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, <hi>That the promiſes in
reſpect of the efficacy and gracious benefits flewing from them did belong onely to
the elect;</hi> And this he proveth, firſt from <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> And whereas it
might be ſaid, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> for his actual impiety deriding of, and perſecuting <hi>Iſaac</hi>
was rejected, and alſo that he was born of <hi>Hagar</hi> a bond-woman; then he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exemplifieth in <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> born both of the ſame father, and of the
ſame mother, and at the ſame time, and yet <hi>before they had done good or evil;</hi>
The one even the younger was <hi>loved of God,</hi> and the <hi>Elder</hi> to whom the <hi>birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>

(ſo that for all this both <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> might be elected, as ſome have
charitably thought of <hi>Elau,</hi> that he repented of his cruel intentions to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
changing his mind to him, and ſo (as they think) dying a converted man,
or whether they be propounded as <hi>Examples</hi> alſo as well as <hi>Types (viz.</hi>) as thoſe
perſons whom God had excluded from grace, and therefore the Scripture giveth
this Character of <hi>Eſau</hi> that he was a profane man,) is not much material. This is
enough, that the Diſcourſe of <hi>Paul</hi> is carried on with great ſtrength: And
whereas it might be objected, That God was unrighteous in making ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between thoſe that were equal, the Apoſtle anſwereth from a Text of
Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19. where <hi>Moſes</hi> deſiring to ſee the glory of God, God
grants his requeſt, giving this reaſon, <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and mercifull to whom I will be mercifull:</hi> Thus even <hi>Moſes</hi> hath that great
glory put upon him, even to ſpeak to God <hi>face to face,</hi> and that not for any
worth or dignity in himſelf, but the meer gracious will of God; Therefore there
is no unrighteouſneſſe in this act, whereby God receiveth one and leaveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe this Aſſumption is an act of grace and ſavour, and in things of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57719:163"/>
and liberality, there is no injuſtice: If I meet two poor men equally indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and I relieve one paſſing by the other, there is no injuſtice in not relieving
of him. Now from this expreſſion of God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Apoſtle maketh this
inference in my Text, removing all cauſes and merits of the grace of God from
man, and attributing it wholly to God.</p>
                           <p>In the negation we have a diſtribution, It is not of him that willeth, <hi>nor of
him that runneth. [It is not.]</hi> Here is much diſpute, what is meant by that?
But the Context maketh it evident, that election <hi>is not,</hi> nor the bleſſed effects of
Election, Converſion, Juſtification and Salvation. Some alſo adde, The act of
volition, <hi>It is not of him that willeth to will; for God worketh in us to will:</hi>
So that all is to be given to God; for <hi>Voluntas bons,</hi> is one of Gods good gifts
to us, <hi>Nelentem pravenit ut velit, volentem ſubſequitur ne finſtra velit:</hi> A
good will cannot precede Gods gifts, ſeeing that it ſelfe is one of Gods
gifts.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Not of him that willeth]</hi> Here we ſee plainly the will of man ſo importent, yea
ſo polluted by ſinne, that it cannot put it ſelf forth to any good.</p>
                           <p>Again, <hi>It is not of him that runneth.]</hi> The <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> limit this too
much (as if it were) an alluſion to <hi>Eſau,</hi> who neither by running (when he
wearied himſelf in hunting for veniſion;) nor by <hi>willing</hi> (when with tears he ſo
earneſtly deſired the bleſſing) could obtain it; for the Scripture doth uſually
compare Chriſtianity to a race, and our converſation to a running. So that it is
neither our inward willing, or outward performing of duties, (though with
much induſtry,) that make us obtain this grace from God: Not that we are to ſit
ſtill and to be idle, but we are to wait on the means onely, it's Gods grace not
our wils which do make us holy and happy. Therefore you have the poſitive
cauſe of all, <hi>But it is of God that ſheweth mercy,]</hi> It is then the meer mercy
and compaſſion of God, which maketh a diffrence between men lying in the ſame
ſin and miſery; he ſpeaketh not of juſtifying mercy, adopting mercy, but of electing
mercy, converting and calling mercy. This diſcriminating power and grace of
God doth evidently appear every where, there being two in a family, one taken,
the other left; Two hearing a Sermon, one humbled and converted, the other
remaining blind and obdurate; If to this it be replied, that the meaning is, It is
not of the will alone, nor of him that runneth alone, but of Gods mercy alſo,
then (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old did ſolidly obſerve) it might as truly be ſaid, That it is
not of God that ſheweth mercy, but of him that willeth and runneth; And
this is very abſurd, <hi>Pia aures non ferunt,</hi> Godly ears (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi> on this
place) would not endure it; and <hi>Newe Chriſtianus dicere andebit,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Auſtin.</hi>)
The weightineſs of the matter hath made me thus long in opening the Text: We
come to the Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That the will of man is ſo greatly defiled by ſinne, that we cannot obtain
any ſpiritual mercy by it.</hi> It's the grace of God, the compaſſion of God that
maketh thee abhorre thy ſinnes, and cloſe with that which is holy, thy will is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
an enemy and an adverſary to it; Should God let thee alone, till thou come
to meet him, thy condition would be hopeleſs; The will of a man naturally ſtands
at a defiance againſt the things of God; elſe why is it, that under ſuch means of
grace that many enjoy, why is it that when there are ſo many invitations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations
that the underſtanding and conſcience is convinced, that cannot tell
what to ſay, yet the will of a man is obſtinate and refractory?</p>

a man is expoſed to diſeaſes, yet I ſhall briefly ſelect ſome of the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
inſtances. And</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Herein is the natural ſinfulneſſe of the will manifeſted, <hi>In that it is
wholly perverted about the ultimate end, which is the proper and adequate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of it; God is the ſupream and ultimate end of the will:</hi> Therefore were
our ſouls endowed with this noble faculty, that the will might firmly and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably
adhere to him; That as the elements have their proper principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby they never reſt, till they come to their center, or ultimate term
in which they wholly acquieſce; Thus alſo if we reſpect the primitive inſtitution,
the will was given us for ſuch a principle which ſhould carry us out conſtantly to
the enjoying of God. But oh the ſad perverſion and inordinacy that is now
come upon this chief power of the ſoul, for now a <hi>mans ſelf is put into Gods
room;</hi> So that whereas God was the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and end of
a mans will; Now a mans ſelf is made his god, he willeth himſelf, he loveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
all things are done in reference to himſelf, as the utmoſt end: So that this
ſelf-ſeeking, this ſelf-loving is the root of all other iniquities; when the Apoſtle
was to reckon up a Catalogue of manifold notorious impieties, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. he
reckons up <hi>men, lovers of themſelves,</hi> as the bitter root of all wormwood ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it; you cannot reckon up any ſinne, whether ſpiritual or carnal, that
doth not flow from this, becauſe a man doth inordinately will, and love himſelf;
That as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reporteth of one <hi>Antipheron,</hi> which through the weakneſs of
his eyes, the very air was in ſtead of a Looking-glaſſe, making a conſtant refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:57719:164"/>
ſo that he ſaw himſelf, beheld himſelf all the day long; Thus it is with
the will, all the motions and actings of it are onely to ſelf-glory, ſelf-pleaſure,
ſelf-profit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas at firſt the will was created ſo ſubordinate to God, that
it did will the glory, and honour, and bleſſedneſs of God infinitely above its
own ſelf; If they could ſay to <hi>David, Thou art worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> how
much more could <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of integrity ſay unto God, that his Name,
his Glory and Majeſty were to be eſteemed and ſet up farre above the good of all
men and Angels. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerveth truly, That thoſe two Cities, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and
<hi>Babel,</hi> of God and the Devil, had theſe two contrary foundations, <hi>Babel</hi> had
<hi>Amor ſui uſque,</hi> and <hi>Contemptum Dei,</hi> The love of a mans ſelf, even to the
contempt of God and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> The love of God, even to the contempt of a
mans ſelf: Oh then look upon this as the <hi>Goliah</hi>-ſinne, as the <hi>Beelzebub</hi>-evil in
thy will, that it cannot, it doth not any thing, but exceſſively will and love it
ſelf to the contempt of, and rebellion againſt God! The Command of God is,
<hi>To love him with all our heart, ſoul, and might, and to love our neighbour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi>
but there is no injunction to love our ſelves; Indeed that is ſuppoſed as a duty,
when a mans ſelf is made the rule and meaſure of love to our neighbour: Some
think the reaſon why there is no expreſſe command to love our ſelves, is, becauſe
that is required in loving of God, becauſe he onely loveth himſelf that loveth
God, and in loving of God we love our ſelves; whereas when we love our ſelves
for our ſelves ſake, not ſubordinately to God, we do indeed hate our ſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
our ſelf damnation. Let us then bewail this fall of the will by original
ſinne from God into its ſelf, whereby we will our own glory rather then Gods;
our own intereſt then the great Gods, who yet giveth us all we have; This is to
break the order which the wiſe and holy will of God hath immutably ordained,

a rule and meaſure of things to be done, being the will of a creature, therefore
he prayeth, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> Luk. 26. 39. If then Chriſts
humane will was to be regulated by that ſuperiour and increated will, how much
more is the will of a ſinfull and corrupt man; This then is that which maketh the
whole ſoul like a Blackmoor; This is the eſſence (as it were) of all ſinne; A
mans own will, not Gods will is regarded, but a mans own proper will is wholly
followed, we would give Laws to God, and not God to us; Whenſoever thy
heart is carried out to luſts, to any wickedneſs, What is this but to exalt thy will,
and to depreſs the will of God? Hath God ſaid, Be not proud? thou wilt be
proud: Hath God ſaid, Swear not? thou wilt ſwear: Thus all ſinne is nothing

will of ours that was the cauſe of hell: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> they preferred their
will before Gods will, and that brought in death and demnation: Therefore
regeneration is the writing of Gods Law in our hearts, whereby we come
to ſay, as Chriſt, <hi>I come to do thy will O God,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> immediately upon his
converſion ſaith, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me do,</hi> he giveth up his will as a
blanck on which God may write his will, O Lord there ſhall not be any longer
my will to perſecute, my will to oppoſe thy Church, I will break this will of
mine, renounce this will of mine: Thus as a veſſel melted in the fire may be

if you ſay this corruption of the will is not in every man by nature, I grant
it for the degree, but it is habitually and radically there. Let any man be put
in ſuch temptations, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were, and left alone to this inbred
pride and original pollution, it would break out into as great a flame: Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                           <p>3. This pride of the will is ſeen, <hi>In the preſumption and boldneſs of it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the conſels of his Majeſty, and to call God himſelf to account for his
adminiſtrations.</hi> Rom. 9. 20, <hi>who art thou</hi> (O man) <hi>that diſputeſt againſt God?</hi>
[O man,] that is ſpoken to humble and debaſe him; Wilt thou call God to
an account? Shall God be thought unjuſt, becauſe thou canſt not comprehend
his depths? Certainly God hath more power over us then the Potter over his
clay, for the Potter doth not make the materials of that, he only tempreth it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
God giveth us our very beings; and therefore it is intolerable impudency
for us to ask God, why he made us ſo? yet how proud and preſumptousis man,
to diſpute about Gods precedings, whereas the great Governors of the world will
not allow any Subject to ſay, why doſt thou ſo to them? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
of this pride in ſome men, <hi>Pſal. 12. 4. Our lips are our own, who is
Lord over us?</hi> Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, who is the Lord that I ſhould obey
him?</hi> This pride in the will, whereby men will audaciouſly intrude into things
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:57719:165"/>
they know not, hath made theſe heretiques in judgements, the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and
<hi>Socinians,</hi> Their will doth not captivate their underſtanding to Gods <hi>Ipſe
dixit,</hi> for us the Schoolemen obſerve truly, in every act of faith, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>pia affectio,</hi> and <hi>inclinatio voluntatis,</hi> and when that is refractory and
unſubmitting, it cauſeth many damnable hereſies in the judgement; for it is
the pertinacy of the will, that doth greatly promote the making of an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>This pride of the will is ſeen, In raging and rebellious riſings up againſt
God in his proceedings againſt us.</hi> In this the pride of the will doth ſadly diſcover
it ſelf, what rage, what fretting and diſcontent do we find in our hearts,
when Gods will is to chaſtiſe or afflict us? If we could bind the armes of the
Omnipotent to prevent his blowes, how ready is preſumptuous man to do
it? It is therefore a great work of regeneration to mollity and ſoften the will,
to make it ſacile and ductile, ſo as to be in what forme God would have us to
be. When <hi>David</hi> had ſuch holy power over his will, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26, that in
his miſerable flight from <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he could ſay, <hi>If ye have no delight in me,
behold here I am, let him do to me as ſeemeth good to him;</hi> he could abound
and want, be rich and poor, a king and no king all in a day, this argued the
great work of ſanctification upon his will. This iron was now in the fire, and
ſo could be molleated as God would have it; Thus in the fore mentioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he cryed out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Here
was a tender humble reſignative of the whole will to God, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
or proviſoes; But oh the pride and unrulineſs of the will, if left to its
natural pollution! When God ſhall any wayes bring his judgements upon
us, how impatiently do we riſe againſt God, even as if we would be revenged
of his Majeſty? As it is ſaid of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> when it thundereth and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
they ſhoot againſt heaven, as if they would bring God to order.
<hi>Xerxes</hi> ſcourged the ſea, and ſent a Bill of defiance againſt the hill of <hi>Athos.
Auguſtus</hi> being beaten with a tempeſt at ſea, defied their god <hi>Neptune,</hi> and
cauſed his image to be taken down from the place where the reſt of their gods
were. Yea <hi>Charron</hi> ſpeaketh of a Chriſtian King, who having received a
blow from God, ſwore be would be revenged, and gave a commandment,
that for ten yeares no man ſhould pray to him, or ſpeak of him; I tremble to
mention theſe dreadfull inſtances, but they are uſefull to demonſtrate, what
pride and unſubdued contumacy is in the will of man, even againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
when he croſſeth us of our wills: Yea do not the godly themſelves though
grace hath much mollified their will, and made it in a great meaſure obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to God, yet do they not mourne, and pray, and groane under the pride
of their will? do they not complain, oh they cannot bring their will to Gods
will! They cannot be content and patient under Gods diſpenſations, they fret,
they mutter, they repine. Is not all this becauſe the will is proud, the will
doth not ſubmit? Heavenly skill and art to order thy will, would make thee
find reſt in every eſtate.</p>

Gods will;</hi> There is not onely a <hi>privative incapacity,</hi> but a <hi>poſitive contrariety,</hi>
even as between fire and water; Gods will is an holy will, thine is unholy; Gods
will is pure, thine is impure; Gods will is carried out to will his own glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and greatneſs, thine is carried out to will the diſhonour and reproach of
God: Thus as Gods will is infinitely good, and the cauſe of all good, ſo in ſome
ſenſe, thy will is infinitely evil, and the cauſe of all that evil thou art plunged
into; Therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the carnal mind is enmity againſt
God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

as well as of the mind; It is enmity in the very abſtract, ſo that it is <hi>neither ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to God, nor can be:</hi> Oh that God would ſet this truth more powerfully upon
our hearts, for what tongue can expreſs the miſery of this, that thy will ſhould
naturally have ſuch irreconcilable oppoſition and implacable enmity to the Law
of God, that it ſhould be diametrially oppoſite to Gods will, which at firſt was
made ſo amicable and compliant with Gods will, that there was the <hi>Idem velle,</hi>
and <hi>Idem nolle.</hi> Beſides, many other conſiderations there are two eſpecially that
may break and exceedingly humble our ſouls herein: For</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>Gods will and his law, which is his will objectively taken, are abſolutely in themſelvs
very good, and therefore the proper object of thy will;</hi> So that if thy will be carried out
to any thing in the world, it ſhould be carried out to Gods Law above any thing:
This is to be willed above any created good what ſoever, How is it that thou canſt
will pleaſures, profits and ſuch created good things, and art not more raviſhed and
drawn out in thy deſires after the chiefeſt good, but to be in a ſtate of oppoſition to
this chiefeſt good, to contradict and withſtand it, this is the hainous aggravation?
Could there be a <hi>Summum malum,</hi> it would be in the will, becauſe of its direct
oppoſition to the <hi>Summum bonum?</hi> Herein mans will, and the Devils will, do
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57719:166"/>
both agree, that they are with hatred and contrariety carried out againſt Gods
will: If therefore thou wert to live a thouſand and thouſands of years upon the
earth, and thou hadſt no other work to do, but to conſider and meditate about
the ſinfulneſs and wretchedneſs of the will in this particular, thou wouldſt even
then take up but drops in reſpect of the Ocean, and little crums in reſpect of the
ſand upon the ſea-ſhore. But</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>This contrariety of thy will is not only againſt that which abſolutely
in it ſelf is the chiefeſt good, but relatively it would be ſo to thee, and therefore
thy contrariety to it is the more unjuſtifiable.</hi> What to be carried out with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
hatred, to that which would be thy bleſſedneſs and happineſs, who
can bewail this enough? To have a delight and a connaturality with thoſe
things that will be thy eternal damnation, with much readineſs and joy to will
them, and then to be horrible averſe and contrapugnant to thoſe things, which
if willed and imbraced would make thee happy to all eternity: Oh miſerable and
wretched man, thy condition is farre more lamentable then that of the beaſts,
for they have a natural inſtinct to preſerve themſelves, and to deſire ſuch things
as are wholſom to them, but thou art naturally inclining to will and imbrace all
thoſe things which will be thy eternal woe and miſery! What is the cauſe that thy
will cannot imbrace the Law of God? Why art thou ſo contrary to it? Alas
there is no juſt reaſon can be given, but original ſinne is like an occult quality in
thy will, making an Antipathy in it againſt the ſame; ſo that thou doeſt not love
what is holy, neither art thou able to ſay, Why? only thou doſt not love it; yea,
there is the greateſt reaſon in the world, and all the word of God requireth it
likewiſe, that thy will ſhould be ſubordinate and commenſurated unto it, but
there is no other cauſe of this evil will, then the evil of it; It is evil, and therefore
cannot abide that which is good.</p>

                           <p>THirdly, <hi>The original pollution of the will is ſeen in the rebellion of it
againſt the light of the mind, and the ſlavery of it to the ſenſitive part
in a man, to the carnal and ſinfull affections therein:</hi> Both which do ſadly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
how the will is by nature out of all holy order, and fallen from its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
integrity; For in the former reſpect therefore did God give us reaſon, that
by the light and guidance thereof, the will ſhould proceed to its operations; So
that for the will to move it ſelf before it hath direction from the mind, is like the
ſervant that would ſet upon buſineſs before his maſter commands him, like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured
dog, that runneth before his maſter do ſet him on: To will a thing firſt,
and afterwards to exerciſe the mind about it, is to ſet the earth where Heaven
ſhould be: But oh the unſpeakable deſolation that is brought upon the ſoul in this
very particular! The will ſtaieth for no guidance, expecteth no direction, but willeth
becauſe it will, what is ſuteable and agreeable to the corrupt nature thereof, that it
imbraceth be it never ſo deſtructive and damning; God made the mind at firſt, that
it could ſay like the Centurion, I bid <hi>the will</hi> go and it goeth; the affections move,
and they move; but now the inferior ſouldier biddeth the Centurion go and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
This then is the great condemnation of the will, that though light come in
upon it, yet it loveth not the light, but rebelleth againſt it; and this ſinfulneſs of
the will is more palpably diſcovered under the means of grace, and the light
of the Goſpel, then under the light of nature meerly, for ſuch are ſaid compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57719:167"/>
to ſit in darkneſs, and to have no light; The more then the light of the
Goſpel doth appear, the more any beams of truth do gloriouſly ſhine into thy
breaſt, and thou for all this gain-ſayeſt them, liveſt againſt them, the more is thy
will in a ſinne. This then doth greatly aggravate the polluted nature of the will,
that it can contradict the powerfull arguments of the ſoul, when it was made
ſubordinate to knowledge, then to become tyrannical and uſurping over it, this
argueth the will hath a peculiar infection in it, inſomuch that if it had never ſo
much light, yet that would be evil, becauſe it will be evil. I know there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned men, that ſay, The will cannot but follow the practical dictate of the
underſtanding; There is (ſay they) a natural connexion between them, ſo that
if the will at any time offend, it is becauſe the light and conviction of the mind
is faint and inefficacious: But this opinion doth greatly retract from the nature of
grace, and the nature of our original ſinne, from grace, as if that did ſanctifie the
underſtanding and affections only, and from original ſinne, as if that were not
ſeated in the will, but in the other parts only, whereas the will of a man may be
called the throne of wickedneſs, becauſe from it properly all ſinnes have their
riſe and being; Do we not ſee this plainly in the Devils, who are <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowing and underſtanding, yet no Devil is able to will what is good, but
willeth to ſinne alwayes, and cannot reſrain it; How cometh this about? They
do not want knowledge, they are not capable of ſinnes of ignorance, and yet
with what irreconcilable enmity is the Devil ſet againſt that which is good, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he cannot all the day long, but will thoſe things that are offenſive to
God. Although they know this is to their eternal torment; By which you ſee
how depraved and poiſoned without Chriſt the will is, though the underſtanding
meet it like an Angel to ſtop this <hi>Balaam</hi> in wicked and unjuſt wayes: Never then
plead ignorance, or plead paſſions, for it is the defect and wickedneſs of the
will that makes thee ſo vile; But as the will in the upper region (as it were) is ſo
much polluted, ſo in the lower region alſo; for if we conſider it as bordering
upon the affections, there we ſhall find as horrible a ſinne daily committed, as
when Gods Law ſorbids a woman to fall down before a beaſt; for when the will,
which is in it ſelf a rational appetite, ſhall make it ſelf like one of the vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and paſſions; what is this but a ſpiritual and unclean luſt with a beaſt; Lay
then this more to heart than thou doeſt; Think how horrid a ſight it would be,
if thy body ſhould become like a beaſts, and thou go on the ground as that doth,
what would then become of that <hi>Os ſublime?</hi> And is not this as bad, when thy
will is made a vaſſal to every inordinate affection? Thou willeſt what thy paſſions
call for, yet thus it is with every one till grace doth elevate the will, and ſet it in

                           <p>FOurthly, <hi>The mutability and inconſtancy of the will about what is holy, is
a great part of the original deſolation upon it.</hi> It is true, <hi>Adam</hi>'s will
was mutable at the firſt Creation, though he had full power and perfection to
ſtand, yet becauſe his will was changeable, therefore he fell from his holy eſtate,
and no wonder that <hi>Adam</hi>'s will was mutable, for the will of the Angels ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſcending man in glory, was alſo vertible and changeable, ſo that to have
the will confirmed in what is good, that it cannot fall into the contrary condition,
is a bleſſed and gracious priviledge vouchſafed by God alone; Therefore there
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57719:167"/>
are no men, though never ſo much ſanctified, but their wils would make them
fall off from God, did not God outwardly ſupport him. This natural mutability
is in the will, becauſe it's the will of a creature, onely the will of God is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unchangeable, and this is onely <hi>a negative imperfection, it is not a ſinne,
but the inconſtancy and changeableneſſe that I now mention is a ſinfull and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
one.</hi> This mutability of the will and inſtability, diſcovers it ſelf in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>In ſome great fears or judgements of God upon a man, then though he hath no
more but nature, yet his will doth ſometimes ſeem to yeeld, and to melt before God.</hi>
Thus <hi>Pharaob</hi>'s will, <hi>Ahab</hi>'s will, did abate of their contumacy while the heavy
rod of God was upon them, but how quickly did they lick up their vomit again?
When the iron was taken out of the fire, it grew as cold as ever; And is not this
inconſtant will the ruine of many? Oh that thou hadſt ſuch a will alwayes, as thou
hadſt in ſuch ſtraits, in ſuch extremities, then how happy wouldſt thou be!</p>
                           <p>2. This inconſtancy of thy <hi>will</hi> appeareth to thy undoing, <hi>When in ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
the Word preached, the Sacrament adminiſtred or reproof applied to thee,
then thou beginneſt to yeeld, then thou ſayeſt, I will do it, I will be ſo no more, I
will become new, but theſe April ſhowrs hold for a ſeaſon, the winter will come
when all will be froſt and ſnow.</hi> Mat. 21. 29. One of thoſe ſons, who ſaid to his
father, <hi>I go, ſir,</hi> ſeeming to be very willing; (whereas on the other ſide, <hi>I will
not,</hi>)
did quickly falſifie his Word; So that he who refuſed at firſt, proved better
then he that ſeemed ſo forward, and thus truly it falleth out ſometimes, that the
later end is farre better of ſome, who for a long while ſay, they will not, that
are ſtubborn and rebellious, but God afterwards maketh them to will, then of
ſuch who give many fair promiſes, now they will, and then they will, in ſuch
ſickneſs they will, in ſuch a powerfull motion they will, but afterwards they
will not.</p>
                           <p>3. The ſinfull inconſtancy of the <hi>will</hi> about holy things, is, <hi>When after a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and willing profeſſion of Chriſt, in times of temptation and great extremities then
they fall off, and their fall is great.</hi> This is becauſe the will was not reſolved and
fixed, that whatſoever ſhould fall out, yet they would not treacherouſly depart
from God, <hi>Act. 11. 23. Barnabas</hi> exhorted the Diſciples, <hi>That with purpoſe of
heart they ſhould cleave to God,</hi> otherwiſe if the will be not ſtedfaſt and reſolved,
every temptation is able to drive it back.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>The lazy, ſluggiſh and half-deſires of the will about good things, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the inconſtancy of it.</hi> Jam. 1. <hi>A double-minded man,</hi> (and ſo a <hi>double-willed
man) is inconſtant in all his wayes;</hi> when the <hi>will</hi> is divided between the creature
and the Creator; or when like the ſluggard, he deſireth meat, but will not put
forth his hand out of his boſom, he willeth and willeth, but never doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſet himſelf upon working: This man is <hi>like a reed that is toſſed up and down
with every wind.</hi> Many more ſinfull affections might be named, for they are like
the motes in the air, or the ſand upon the ſea ſhore; But let this ſuffice, becauſe
more will then be diſcovered, when we ſpeak of the ſlavery of it to evil, having
no freedom to will what is good. Only let this Truth be like a coal of fire fallen
upon thy heart, let it kindle a divine flame in thy breaſt, conſider this corrupt
will is the root of all evil; If thy will were changed, if thy will were turned to
God, this would bring the whole man with it: Oh pray to God, to maſter thy
will, to conquer thy will? Say, O Lord, though it be too hard for me, yet it is
not for thee; Remember hell will be the breaking of thy corrupt will; Thou
that wouldſt not do Gods will here, ſhall not have thy will in any thing when in

the will, in its <hi>Originals</hi> and <hi>Naturals,</hi> both in the ſeveral operations
and affections of it; The next thing in order is, <hi>To treat of the will in
regard of its ſtate, as in freedome of ſervitude,</hi> about which ſo many
voluminous Controverſies have been agitated: And indeed a ſound judgement
in the point of <hi>Free will</hi> is of admirable conſequence to advance Chriſt, and the
grace of the Goſpel; For whoſoever do obſcure the glory thereof, they lay their
foundation here; They praiſe nature to the diſpraiſe of grace, and exalt <hi>God</hi> as
a <hi>Creator,</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Although it is not my purpoſe to go with this Point as many miles as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
would compel me, yet becauſe the Doctrine of <hi>Free-will</hi> is ſo plauſible
to fleſh and bloud, that in all Ages of the Church it hath had its profeſſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons;
And becauſe the cauſe of Chriſt and the Goſpel is herein intereſſed, and
further, becauſe it is of a great practical concernment to know what a ſlavery and
bondage is upon the will of man to ſin; it will be neceſſary and profitable (in ſome
meaſure) to inlarge upon it; for there is ſcarce one in a thouſand, but is puſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up with his own power and ſtrength, ſo that he feeleth not the want of
grace.</p>

                           <p>THis Text I have pitched upon will be a good and a ſure foundation for the
ſuperſtruction of our future Diſcourſe; For <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his hot diſputes
with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> about the <hi>freedom of the will to what is good,</hi> doth often flie
to this Text, as a ſure Sanctuary: And <hi>Calvin</hi> (gravely upon this Diſcourſe of
our Saviour) ſaith, <hi>Eunt nunc Papiſtae</hi> (we may adde <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians)
&amp; liberum arbitrium factuosè extollunt, &amp;c.</hi> Let them presumptuouſly exalt
<hi>free will,</hi> but we being conſcious of our own bondage, do glory in Chriſt onely
our Redeemer: Though <hi>Maldonate</hi> is pleaſed to cenſure this expreſſion of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>Let us therefore take notice of the Coherence, and we will go no higher then
to the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, where we have ſpecified a bleſſed and fruitfull event upon
Chriſts Diſcourſe, concerning his <hi>Perſon and Office, For as he ſpake thoſe words,
many believed on him;</hi> not by their own natural ability and power, but the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did draw them</hi> by his omnipotent and efficacious grace: Chriſt while he ſpake
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57719:168"/>
to the ear did alſo reach to the heart; he did not onely preach, but could inable
the hearer alſo to believe, herein exceeding all Paſtors and Teachers that
ever were in the Church of God; Chriſt plants and watereth, and giveth the
increaſe likewiſe all of himſelf; Yea Chriſt ſeemeth here to <hi>ſow his ſeed</hi> upon the
<hi>high way,</hi> and among <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> yet ſome <hi>ſeed</hi> cometh up and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
well.</p>
                           <p>Upon this we have the love and care of Chriſt mentioned to theſe new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
he immediately watereth theſe plants, and ſwadleth theſe new born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
that they may not miſcarry; This is ſeen in the counſel ſuggeſted to them,
where you have, <hi>The Duty ſuppoſed,</hi> and the <hi>admirable Priviledge iſſuing from
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> The <hi>Duty ſuppoſed, If ye continue in my Word;</hi> It is not enough to begin,
unleſs there be perſeverance. It is not enough to receive Chriſt and his Word,
unleſs we abide therein and have our ears (as it were) boared, never to depart
from ſuch a Maſter; The neglect of this maketh all that dreadfull Apoſtaſie, and
thoſe ſad ſcandals to Religion, which in all Ages do terribly break forth, <hi>Except
ye abide in Chriſt,</hi> as well as be in him, we ſhall fall ſhort in the wilderneſs, and
not be able to enter into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is alſo obſervable, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye abide in my Word;</hi> it muſt be the
true Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> it muſt be what he hath delivered, which denoteth two
things:</p>
                           <p>1. That hereſie and errour can no wayes make to our Chriſtian-Diſcipleſhip,
they cannot ſet us at liberty from any luſt or ſinne; and therefore no wonder if
you ſee men of corrupt judgements at laſt fall into ſinfull and corrupt practices;
For the word of God is only the inſtrument and inſtituted means of ſanctification,
<hi>Sanctifie them by thy word,</hi> Joh. 17.</p>
                           <p>2. Hereby we ſee the neceſſity of the Miniſtry of it; by the preaching of Gods
word they are firſt brought to believe, and after that are continually to depend
on it; The Miniſtry is both for the begetting of grace, and the increaſe of it;
Thoſe that deſpiſe and neglect the Word preached, do greatly demonſtrate they
never got any good by it.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>conſequent Priviledge</hi> upon this <hi>continuance in the Word,</hi> is to be <hi>Chriſts
Diſciples indeed;</hi> From whence we have a diſtinction of a Diſciple in appearance
and ſhew, or profeſſion onely, and a <hi>Diſciple indeed.</hi> There were many that
became Chriſts Diſciples in profeſſion onely, they followed him for a ſeaſon, but
afterwards forſook him, which cauſed our Saviour ſo much in his Parables and
Sermons to preſs them upon a pure. thorow and deep work of grace upon their
ſouls: The title without reality will be no advantage. <hi>Muſculus</hi> obſerveth, That
Chriſt uſeth the Preſent tenſe, <hi>Then are ye my Diſciples indeed;</hi> From whence he
gathers, <q>That Continuance or Perſeverance in grace doth not make the truth of
grace, but the truth of grace maketh the perſeverance, they do continue, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are Diſciples indeed, but they are Diſciples indeed, therefore they continue in
Chriſts Word.</q> But <hi>Beza</hi> maketh <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, as in other places; and if ſo, then it
muſt be thus underſtood, That our Perſeverance in grace doth not make grace to
be true, but doth demonſtrate and evidence the Truth; ſuch will appear to be
ſtarres indeed fixed in the firmament, when others like blazing Comets will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vaniſh away: But this is not all the Priviledge, there is a two-fold mentioned
in the next verſe,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Ye ſhall know the truth;</hi> when they did at firſt believe the Word, they
did know the Truth in ſome meaſure, but now their knowledge ſhould be more
evident, clear, and encreaſing; And indeed the godly they do ſo grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
about heavenly things, that they account their former knowledge even
nothing at all.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond Priviledge is, <hi>The truth ſhall make them free; Every man (till rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated)
is in bondage and captivity, to blindneſs in his mind, to luſt in hiswill;</hi>
                              <pb n="304" facs="tcp:57719:169"/>
And there is nothing can ſet us at liberty from this dungeon and priſon, but the
grace of God by the Word preached.</p>
                           <p>But no ſooner is this Priviledge ſpoken of, then it ſtirreth up the Cavils and
Objections of ſome that heard it, <hi>They anſwered him, We be Abrahams ſeed, and
were never in bondage to any man, How then doeſt thou ſay, Ye ſhall be made free?</hi>
Some think, That thoſe who are ſaid to believe did argue thus; But this ſeemeth
very harſh; Therefore no doubt ſome others that were in the multitude, that
did not believe, they were offended at this ſpeech of our Saviours, and therefore
diſpute againſt it, arrogating to themſelves both a <hi>Native</hi> freedom, <hi>We are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams
ſeed;</hi> and alſo an <hi>actual</hi> one, <hi>We were never in bondage to any man.</hi>
This expreſſion exerciſeth Interpreters very much, for whether by <hi>[We]</hi> they
mean their Anceſtours or Themſelves, living at that time; It is plain, at firſt
they were in bondage in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> afterwards in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and at that preſent in
bondage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, How then could they affirme ſuch a notorious
lie, that they were never in bondage to any man? Some ſay, They mean of
ſuch vaſſals and ſlaves, as ſometimes in warre are taken and ſold to others: Now
(though the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were often conquered, and brought under the power
of others, yet) they were never ſold ſlaves, and ſo not in bondage in that
ſenſe. Others ſay, They doe not ſpeak of a Civil, or Publique, and State-Liberty,
but (as it were) a religious and holy freedome; For, though they
were in civil bondage, yet they glorified in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, and the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
freedome thereby in reſpect of Gods favour. So <hi>Henſius</hi> (in his <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarchus
Sacer.</hi> upon this place,) <hi>They</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who ſpake this, did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Law and Covenant, for ſuch who obeyed the Law, they called free.</hi>
Hence they had a paradoxal Proverb, <hi>None unleſſe he exerciſe himſelf in the
ſtudy of the Law, is to be accounted a free man;</hi> And, <hi>Qui obſervat legem
eſſe Regem,</hi> even as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſay of their wiſe man. <hi>Sixtus Seneſis</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
theſe words to be ſpoken by ſome of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> who would never
owne any forreign power, but did chuſe rather to die, then to make ſuch
an acknowledgement. That which many pitch upon is, <q>That the <hi>Jewes</hi>
ſpeak this to Chriſt from their pride and arrogancy, not willing to take
any notice of their external ſubjection, but ſo that they may oppoſe Chriſt,
care not what they ſay, though never ſo contrary to Truth.</q> Although
<hi>Calvin</hi> well addeth, They might have a pretence for what they ſaid, as if
the <hi>Roman</hi> power did by force reign over them, and therefore that they were
(<hi>de jure) free.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But our Saviour ſpeaking of one kind of freedome and ſlavery, and they
of another, he doth in the next verſe more particularly open his meaning,
and withall layeth a foundation to prove, That though they boaſted and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in their freedome, yet they were indeed ſervants and ſlaves; This he
proveth by that univerſal Propoſition, <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſinne is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of ſinne;</hi> You muſt lay an Emphaſis in that <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, it is not to
be underſtood of every <hi>actual</hi> committing of ſinne, but of the <hi>wilfull, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi>
and <hi>conſtant</hi> committing of it: And thus though great men may boaſt
in their Sovereignty they have over many others; though they may glory
in multitude of ſervants, yet if they be overcome by any one vice, they be
the vileſt ſlaves and vaſſals of all, <hi>Quot vitia, tot Domini,</hi> ſo many vices,
ſo many Lords: Now original ſinne that is a Lord and Maſter to every one,
that reigneth over all mankind; ſome actual ſinnes enſlave one man, and
ſome another; but original ſinne doth every man; yea though the godly
are (in ſome meaſure) freed from the dominion of it, yet it keepeth up a
tyrannical dominion over the moſt holy, as appeareth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of <hi>Paul, He could not doe the good he would, becauſe he was ſold under
ſinne.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="305" facs="tcp:57719:169"/>
This foundation then being laid, our Saviour ſhewing the difference between a
<hi>ſervant</hi> and a <hi>ſonne,</hi> doth in my Text ſuppoſe,</p>
                           <p>1. A neceſſity of every one till ſanctified to be made <hi>free.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. The <hi>Manner</hi> how. And</p>
                           <p>3. That this is freedom <hi>indeed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Neceſſity</hi> ſuppoſed is, <hi>If the Sonne make them free;</hi> Though he ſpeaketh
this to thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who were in a two-fold bondage to ſinne, original and actual;
natural and voluntary, yet this is to be applyed to <hi>every man</hi> that is not in the
ſtate of regeneration, <hi>He hath no liberty or freedome of will to do what is good,
but is a vaſſal to all ſinne;</hi> ſinne is the luſts thereof do prevail-over him, ſo that
he hath neither will or power to come out of this bondage.</p>
                           <p>2. There is the <hi>Manner</hi> how, or the <hi>Perſon</hi> by whom we obtain true liberty,
<hi>If the Sonne make you free.</hi> In ſome Cities the elder brother had power to adopt
ſonnes, and ſo to make free, however Chriſt is therefore called the Redeemer,
becauſe he doth obtain ſpiritual freedome for his people, and that not onely in
reſpect of the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne freeing from that; which grace of Chriſt the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>
did acknowledge (and would conſtantly interpret my Text in this ſenſe
onely) but alſo the power of ſinne by inherent Sanctification and Renovation
of the whole man; and of this freedom the Text doth here principally ſpeak,
not ſo much the freedom from the <hi>guilt of ſinne;</hi> by juſtifying grace, as from the
<hi>power</hi> of ſinne by <hi>ſanctifying grace.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. You have the Commendation of this ſpiritual liberty, it is called <hi>freedome
indeed,</hi> implying, that though they had never ſo much civil freedom, never ſo
much dominion and power, yet if ſervants to ſinne, they were in the vileſt bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
that could be: Civil freedom is thought to be ſo great a good, that it can
never be prized enough; Therefore the <hi>Rabbins</hi> have a ſaying, <hi>That if the Sea
were ink, and the world parchment, it would never ſerve enough to contain the
praiſes of liberty.</hi> The Scripture informeth us, how great an honour it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to be free of <hi>Rome,</hi> but if all this while men are captivated either to
perſonal ſinnes, or to ſinnes of the nature, they remain in worſe bondage,
then ever any Gally-ſlaves were in; The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their iron furnace
and houſe of bondage did cry and groan for a Redeemer; but this is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
evil of this ſoul-bondage, that we delight in it, that we rejoyce in it;
all our indeavour and care is, that we may not be ſet at liberty, and have theſe
chains taken off us. From this explication obſerve,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>That no man hath any liberty or freedom of will to what is good, till Chriſt by his
grace hath made him free.</hi> We do not by freedom of will obtain grace, but by
grace we obtain freedom of will: So that by the Scripture we have not any true
ground for a <hi>liberum, arbitrium,</hi> but a <hi>liberatum</hi> in ſpiritual things; There is no
ſuch thing as a free-will, but a freed will in a paſſive ſenſe, and <hi>tunc eſt liberum,</hi>
when it is <hi>liberatum,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin;</hi> Then it's actively free, when it is firſt paſſively
made free, <hi>Rom. 6. 16. Being made free from ſinne;</hi> He doth not ſay, you have
made your ſelves free, but <hi>ye are made frre</hi> by the grace of Chriſt. And again,
<hi>verſ. 22. Ye are now made free from ſinne;</hi> and <hi>Rom. 8. 2. The Law of the
Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of ſinne and
death:</hi> By which expreſſions is implied, 1. That <hi>all men</hi> till ſanctified are in an
abſolute <hi>vaſſalage</hi> and <hi>thraldom</hi> to ſinne. And, 2. That it is onely the <hi>grace of
Chriſt</hi> that doth <hi>deliver from this bondage.</hi> It is Chriſt not our own will that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
us free.</p>

                           <p>TO enter into the depths of this Doctrine, Conſider, What kinds of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the Scripture ſpeaketh of, and which is applicable to our purpoſe.
The Schooles have vaſt diſputes about liberty and free-will, What it is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a compounded faculty or a ſimple one; and whether a faculty, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
or act; eſpecially they digladiate about the definition of free-will, what
it is; but if any thing ſhall be thought neceſſary to be ſaid in this point, it
may be pertinently brought in, when we ſhall anſwer ſuch Objections as the
Patrons of nature do uſe to bring in the behalf of Free-will: only it is good to
know, that in the Scripture we find a <hi>civil liberty</hi> and a <hi>ſpiritual liberty</hi> ſpoken of,
a <hi>civil liberty;</hi> Thus <hi>bond</hi> and <hi>free</hi> are often oppoſed, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 8. Col. 3. 11.
1 Cor.</hi> 7. 22. But this is not to the Text, nor to our purpoſe; Therefore the
Scripture ſpeaketh much of a <hi>ſpiritual freedome,</hi> and that is,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, In the tranſlating of us out from the dominion of ſinne and Satan,
into a gracious ſtate of holineſs; and this is called by Divines, <hi>Libertas gratia,</hi>
or (as <hi>Auſtin) libertas à peccato.</hi> The freedome of grace of which thoſe
Texts ſpeak that we mentioned before.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, There is the <hi>Evangelical and Chriſtian liberty,</hi> whereby we are
freed from many things of <hi>the law,</hi> not only the <hi>curſe</hi> of the <hi>moral law</hi> and the
<hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> which did accompany the legal adminiſtration thereof,

good advice, <hi>That we turn not our liberty into licentiouſneſs;</hi> It is true, the
Apoſtle doth once uſe the word <hi>[free]</hi> abuſively and improperly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 20,
where the ſervants of ſinne are ſaid to be <hi>free from righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
now this is improperly called a freedome; for as the ſervice of God is
the trueſt freedome, ſo freedome from holineſs is the greateſt ſlavery. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Auſtin</hi> doth from this Text make a diviſion of liberty into two kinds,
which he maketh perpetual uſe of, <hi>Libertas à peccate,</hi> and <hi>Libertas a juſtitiâ;</hi>
The godly man hath the former liberty, the ſinner hath the latter, but this
latter is improperly called liberty.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, There is a <hi>ſpiritual freedome</hi> mentioned by the Scripture, <hi>as the utli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mte
and complete perfection of all,</hi> when the ſoul ſhall be freed not only from
the dominion of ſinne, but the preſence of it, all the reliques and remainders
of it, and the body ſhall be freed from death, pain, and all corroptibility,
<hi>Rom. 8. 2. This is called, the glorious liberty of the ſons of God;</hi> and for this every
godly man is to groan and mourn, even as the woman in travel to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
This is called by Divines <hi>libertas gloriae,</hi> and <hi>libertas à miſerià.</hi> But we
are to ſpeak of the <hi>liberty of grace;</hi> and herein we are not to admire the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
of man, but the free grace of God: man hath no free-will to do that
which is ſpiritual and holy; Free-will is an Idol which the corrupt heart of man
is apt to advance; he is unwilling to be brought out of himſelf, to be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

yet the ſence of it is in the Scripture; for <gap reason="foreign">

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 37, and indeed it is diſputed, whether to do a thing <hi>voluntariè,</hi> and

only <hi>voluntas</hi> denoteth the power and liberty, the qualification of it in its

                              </gap>, liberty,
yet this is not ſo much applied to the liberty of the will, as to the liberty of a
man, as here in the Text, <hi>the ſonne ſhall make you free,</hi> your perſons not your
wils; but becauſe there is an univerſal bondage in all the powers of the ſoul to
ſinne, blindneſs in the mind, contumacy in the will; (for <hi>Quid eſt libertas
ſine gratiâ, niſi contumacia.</hi>) What is liberty in the will without grace, but
contumacy againſt God, and a wilfull delight in evil wayes, Inordinacy in the
affections: therefore the perſon is ſaid to be made free, not but that the will
is principally included in this, only the will is not all that is made free, 2 <hi>Cor
3. 17, where the ſpirit of the Lord is, thereby is liberty;</hi> It's from the Spirit of
God we obtain liberty from ſinne, and alſo from ſervile ſlaviſh feares.
The Jeſuites would have this liberty nothing to the purpoſe in the controverſie
<hi>de libero arbirio,</hi> for (ſay they) this is a ſpiritual miſtical liberty, <hi>libertas à
peccate,</hi> and they are treating of <hi>libertas naturae,</hi> which they make to conſiſt in
an indifferency to good or evil, but by their favour this is a proper liberty, and
it is this that the Pelagians did moſt controvert about, and ſtill the proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
between the orthodox and their adverſaries is in this particular, <hi>Whether
there be any liberty or freedome in a mans will without grace to ſhake off the demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of ſinne,</hi> ſo that they keep moſt properly to the ſtate of the queſtion, who
are diligent in the opening of the nature of this liberty. Another word which
the Scripture uſeth to expreſs this free-will by, is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 2, Phil.</hi> 1. 4,
and this is very proper and full, when we do a thing not by conſtraint, or by a
natural neceſſity, then we do it freely, therein we ſhew our liberty,
ſo that liberty doth oppoſe coaction and natural neceſſity; It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57719:171"/>
the will ſhould in its immediate elicite acts be compelled, for then it
ſhould be <hi>voluntas</hi> and <hi>noluntas,</hi> at the ſame time; then <hi>velle</hi> would be <hi>nolle,</hi>
which is an high contradiction: Therefore liberty doth neceſſarly oppoſe
conſtraint, but <gap reason="foreign">

neceſſity (for there are other neceſſities that liberty doth conſiſt with, yea
and the more neceſſary the more free, as in time is to be ſhewed.) Thus though
the ſtone hath an inclination to deſcend downwards, yet becauſe the ſtones
motion is from a natural neceſſary principle, therefore it is not free: Beaſts
likewiſe though, they exceed the inanimate creatures, yet they do not <hi>agere</hi>

                              </gap>, which is the Scripture expreſſion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;

greatly prejudiced the Doctrine of <hi>free-grace,</hi> ſetting up <hi>free-will</hi> in the room
thereof. There is one expreſſion more, and the Scripture hath it but once,
which is the moſt emphatical in deſcribing of this liberty, and that is 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 37.
Having power over a mans own will,</hi>

in ſome kinds of ſome dominion to have our own will; hence in liberty we may

                           <p>SEcondly take notice, <hi>That it is the great purpoſe and deſign of ſome to go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the plain intent of the Scripture;</hi> For many in all ages of the
Church have (with all their learning and parts) endeavoured to ſet up this
Idol of <hi>Free-will,</hi> whereas the great drift of the Scripture is to advance and
ſet up the <hi>free grace</hi> and <hi>free gift</hi> of God: The Apoſtles they write to debaſe
man and to exalt the <hi>grace</hi> of God; Erronious perſons, they diſpute, and write,
to exalt the <hi>will</hi> of man, and to take off from the <hi>grace</hi> of God; What a loud
trumpet is <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles to ſound forth the praiſes of <hi>free grace,</hi> not only
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57719:171"/>
                              <hi>free grace</hi> in <hi>juſtification,</hi> but <hi>free grace</hi> alſo in <hi>ſanctification?</hi> It's the grace of
God that doth not only pardon the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne, but conquer the <hi>power</hi> of it:
Conſider then whether it be better, to ſet up <hi>Dagon</hi> or the <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>free-will</hi>
of man, or the <hi>free gift</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God. Truly it is a very uncomfortable
task, to be diſputing againſt that grace, which yet we muſt wholly rely upon,
when we come to die. It is one thing what men write while they are in health,
what cobweb-diſtinctions they pleaſe themſelves with in their voluminous
writings, and another thing when they are in the agonies of death, and are
to appear at the tribunal of a righteous God. It was that (which that famous
Champion for the grace of God) <hi>Bradwardine</hi> comforted himſelf with, when
he undertook the cauſe of God againſt <hi>Pelagians, That he could pray for the
grace of God, to help him in his undertakings, to be preſent with him, and to direct
him, whereas his adverſaries could not do ſo.</hi> And indeed how can an <hi>Arminian,</hi>
or a <hi>Pelagian</hi> with any of thoſe Naturiſts, cordially pray for the grace of God
to aſſiſt them, while they write againſt <hi>grace,</hi> and patronize <hi>free-will?</hi> Let
them ſacrifice to their own nets, to their own parts and abilities; It's from
their will that grace is efficacious. This arrogancy is like that of the <hi>Heathens,</hi>
whoſe ſaying was, <hi>Ignavis opus eſt auxilio Dei,</hi> It is only the ſluggiſh that need
the help of God: Yea <hi>Tully</hi> argueth the caſe, <hi>That we are not beholding to
God for our vertue; therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>our anceſtors have praiſed the gods for
their ſucceſs and outward advantages, but never for their vertues;</hi> Happily it
is awe and reverence that men bear to the Chriſtian Religion, that keepeth
them from ſuch blaſphemous expreſſions; yet even in Chriſtian Writers
(pleading for the power of nature) inſtances might be given of proud and
ſwelling expreſſions.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, It is good to obſerve, <hi>That even in all thoſe whoſe end avour hath
been to advance the free-will of a man to what is truly good, there hath appeared
ſome guiltineſs</hi> (as it were) <hi>in them,</hi> therefore they have often changed, (if
not their minds yet their words) thus they have removed from the mountaines
to the valleys: The <hi>Pelagians</hi> did incruſtate their opinions often, and the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak ſometimes ſo plauſibly, that you would think <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and
<hi>Calvin</hi> did imbrace each other. <hi>Pelagius</hi> did at laſt come to uſe the word
<hi>grace,</hi> yea did <hi>anathematize</hi> ſuch as ſhould not hold the <hi>grace of God requiſite
to every good act;</hi> by which crafty guiles he did deceive the <hi>Eaſtern Biſhops,</hi>
and ſtill in the ſerpents-skin do the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> appear; They think
it the greateſt calumny that can be caſt upon them, to ſay, they are againſt
the <hi>grace</hi> of God; hence they uſe the <hi>word of grace</hi> often, as well as of <hi>free-will,</hi>
but all this ariſeth from guilt; they do uſe the word grace <hi>ad frangendam
invidiam,</hi> to decline, envy, to inſinuate more into the hearts of credulous
hearers: ſo that men ſacrilegiouſly advance the will of man' make man to
have the greateſt praiſe in <hi>converting himſelf, in ſaving himſelf;</hi> and whereas
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Not I, but the grace of God with me;</hi> They will on the contrary
affirm, <hi>Not the grace of God, but I;</hi> yet for all this they would be thought
to advance the <hi>grace</hi> of Chriſt, but that is a true rule of <hi>Auſtins, Gratia non

                                 </gap>uitous</hi> every way; Therefore the inconſtancy, the
changes and ſhifts all ſuch are put to, who plead for this liberty of the will,
argue they are not in the Truth, but like thieves do hate the light, and change
their garments often, that they may not be diſcovered; They are afraid of the
Scripture, and would more gladly have the controverſie ended by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
then by <hi>Paul;</hi> ſo that this <hi>Pelagian error</hi> hath had <hi>Cain</hi>'s curſe (as it were)
upon it, a trembling, leſt every place of Scripture it, does meet with) ſhould
kill it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>To maintain the ſlavery of the will to ſinne, and to deny any liberty
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57719:172"/>
to that which is holy and godly, is a truth ſo unpleaſing to fleſh and blood, doth ſo
reproach</hi> (as it's thought) <hi>mankind, that it hath alwayes in the Church of God,
(by ſome heretical perſons or others) been ſpoken againſt;</hi> It hath been judged
very ſcandalous and offenſive, as that which did lay the axe to the root of all
Religion and holineſs; But yet experience hath taught us, that none have
expreſſed ſo much holineſs in their lives, as thoſe who have had this truth of
Chriſts grace incorporated into them; and on the other ſide, the <hi>Pelagian</hi>
Doctrine hath left upon mens ſpirits, like leaven, <hi>à cornu &amp; tumorem,</hi> a
ſowreneſs and bitterneſs, as alſo a tumor and vaunting confidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
So that if the denying of <hi>free-will</hi> and exalting the <hi>grace of God</hi> be ſo
prophane an opinion in its <hi>genius</hi> and inclination (as ſome calumniate,) it's
a miracle, that from ſuch a poiſoned fountain ſuch ſweet ſtreames ſhould
flow, and from ſuch thornes ſo pleaſant grapes ſhould grow. But the reaſon
of this offence to fleſh and blood, is the ſelf-love and ſelf-fullneſs that is in
every man by nature; ſpiritual pride and ſelf-confidence do reign in all men
by nature; hence it is that though they be <hi>naked,</hi> yet they are not <hi>aſhamed</hi> of
it, which in <hi>Adam</hi> (while innocent) did come from his <hi>integrity,</hi> but in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
man from his <hi>ſenſleſneſs and ſtupidity.</hi> No wonder then if this Doctrine
of <hi>grace</hi> be not juſtified cordially, and as it ought to be, but by the <hi>ſonnes of
grace, who have felt the power and efficacy of it upon their hearts, who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
found the grace of God freeing their will from all that bondage it was
in to ſinne and Sataen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, From this it is, <hi>that a gracious heart is required to ſtudy this point,
as well as a learned head. Experience</hi> of <hi>regeneration,</hi> of being made a <hi>new
creature,</hi> of the <hi>conflict</hi> between the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> will excellently direct
in this controverſie. I wonder not to ſee a man, though come out of <hi>Egypt</hi>
loaden with <hi>Egyptian</hi> gold, to make a <hi>molten-calf</hi> for a <hi>god</hi> and to worſhip it:
men of great learning, and it may be of great external civility (as they ſay of
<hi>Pelagius</hi>) if not humbled by the grace of God, and throughlyu emptied of
themſelves, how can they ſtoop and yeeld all up to Chriſt? It was therefore
<hi>Auſtin</hi>'s wiſh, <hi>That the Pelagians would turne their disputations into prayers,</hi>
for it is the heart as well as the head that is uſefull in this point. Though all
Divinity be practical, and practice is the end of knowledge, yea in Scripture
language, <hi>Tantum ſcimus quantum operamur,</hi> we are ſaid to <hi>know</hi> no more
then we <hi>do;</hi> yet ſome truths have a more immediate influence into practice
then others, whereas ſome opinions do ſtand in the Court (as it were) others
enter into the holieſt of holieſt: Now this truth about the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and
<hi>free-will</hi> is <hi>practice (practice</hi>) as I may ſay, what ſome do of the ultimate
dictate of the underſtanding; This truth lieth in the vitals of Religion, and
therefore the experience of all the godly is juſtly brought after Scripture ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to confirme this great truth; Therefore <hi>humble</hi> your ſelves more,
<hi>commune with your own hearts,</hi> be <hi>much in prayer</hi> and <hi>ſelf-emptineſs,</hi> and <hi>you
will quickly find the light of this truth ſhining into your hearts; Come and taſt,
Come and ſee,</hi> what you hear with your eares; pray that God would grant
you an experimental knowledge of grace, and then you will quickly confeſs
not unto your own <hi>free-will,</hi> but to the <hi>free grace</hi> of God, all praiſe, and glory
doth belong.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, This truth therefore being ſo contrary to fleſh and blood, <hi>It is
by the grace of God that we come to acknowledge the grace of God.</hi> Error in mind
is part of our bondage, as well as luſt in our heart; It is therefore by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> grace
of God that we are delivered from both theſe thraldoms; we have a freed mind
from ignorance, and a freed will from concupiſcence; It is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God
that <hi>leadeth us into all truth,</hi> called therefore <hi>the Spirit of truth,</hi> John 14. 17. It is
by the grace of God that thou falleſt not in this errour of advancing free-will;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57719:172"/>
It's by the grace of God that thou art no <hi>Pelagian</hi> or <hi>Arminian;</hi> It is this that
maketh thee to differ from them; Thy judgment, thy heart would be ſelf-confident
herein, did not the Spirit of God teach thee.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Conſider that the grace of God is neceſſary to guide us in this point,
<hi>Becauſe this Queſtion hath alwayes ſeemed very difficult. Auſtin</hi> acknowledged
it ſo; Hence he ſaith, <hi>That when grace is defended, we are thought to deſtroy free-will,
and when a free-will is acknowledged (though in ſome ſenſe onely) we are
thought to deny free-grace.</hi> Indeed the Truth is not ſo difficult (<hi>viz.</hi>) that we
have no ſpiritual liberty to what is good, or that grace onely maketh the will
free; but <hi>how to reconcile this with the natural liberty of the will,</hi> that it ſhall not
be as a ſtock or ſtone, that hath ſeemed to ſome even inſoluble, and therefore
they adviſe to captivate our underſtandings in this point, as we doe in the
Doctrine of the Trinity; however whether ſoluble or inſoluble, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
argueth the neceſſity of Gods aſſiſtance, while we preach, and you hear
about it.</p>

good, appeareth, <hi>In the Neceſſity of ſinning that every man is plunged into, that
he cannot but ſinne in all that he doth;</hi> That as the Angels and Saints in Heaven
have <hi>Beata Neceſſitas,</hi> a bleſſed neceſſity of loving of God, and delighting in
him, ſo that no temptation in the world can draw them off: Thus every man by
nature is in an unhappy and wretched neceſſity of ſinning, <hi>Dura Neceſſitas,</hi> as
<hi>Auſtin</hi> called it. Inſomuch that though the Scripture doth repreſent the things
of Heaven in a moſt glorious manner to affect us, yet we cannot be taken off
from our ſinne to love that; Hence it is that every man till regenerated is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to <hi>an evil tree,</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. they are ſaid to be <hi>unclean,</hi> and every thing made
unclean to them; The perſon being not accepted, neither can any duties be:
This is our ſad and miſerable condition by nature, But whoſe heart is throughly
affected with it? Thy eating, thy drinking, thy buying and ſelling, yea thy
praying and all other duties, as they come from a man not ſanctified by grace are
<hi>ſinnes</hi> in the eyes of God. Think then to what an infinite aggravation they will
ariſe, and whether thou mayeſt not truly complain, they are more then the ſands
upon the Sea-ſhore; ſo that as the Toad and Serpent do neceſſarily vent what is
poiſon, and can never do that which is ſweet and wholſom: Thus no man in his
natural eſtate can ever do any thing but be ſinning, and ſo damning of himſelf all
the day long; Onely when we ſay it is thus naturally neceſſary to a man to ſinne
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57719:173"/>
in all things he doth, you muſt know, that we do not herein make him abſolutely
like a <hi>bruit beaſt,</hi> which is not <hi>capable</hi> either of vice or virtue; for this neceſſity
is <hi>voluntarily</hi> brought by man upon himſelf, he did wilfully ſtrip himſelf of all
power and ability to do that which is good, and ſo having ſhut out the light from
himſelf, he doth neceſſarily remain in the dark, having chaced away the Spirit
and preſence of God from his ſoul, which is the life thereof, he becometh ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
dead, and ſo in a neceſſity of ſinning: But it is not thus with <hi>Serpents</hi> and
<hi>Toads;</hi> for whether they were at firſt created ſolely, with ſuch a poiſonous nature,
or whether upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall it was inflicted upon thoſe creatures as a curſe, it is
plain, that theſe creatures could not with any will or conſent bring themſelves
into this eſtate, but man did <hi>voluntarily at firſt,</hi> having no ſeed of evil, or inward
propenſity to ſinne tranſgreſs the Commandment, whereupon his ſoul became
more ſhamefully naked then his body. This <hi>neceſſity</hi> therefore whereby he is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
onely to ſinne,</hi> ariſeth from his own <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary impiety;</hi> As a
man that hath wilfully put out his own eyes muſt blame himſelf for ever if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee: If then this bondage be upon thee, that in all things thou ſinneſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
thou undertakeſt, evil is preſently over ruling of thee, blame not God,
or any providence of his, no nor the Devil neither, for though he doth tempt, yet
he doth not neceſſitate to ſinne, but thy own ſelf, for from thy own bowels this
deſtruction doth ariſe.</p>

                           <p>IT is good to obſerve, and it may clear many difficulties in this point, <hi>That a
neceſſary determination may ariſe ſeveral wayes, ſome whereof are very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent
with liberty, yea the more neceſſary the more free.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> himſelf doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
will that which is good, and yet freely alſo: And if you ask, Whence
doth it ariſe that God is thus determined to what is good? I anſwer, It is from
the <hi>infinite and abſolute perfection of his holineſſe,</hi> whereby he is not, nor cannot
be a God that willeth iniquity. <hi>Arminius</hi> indeed maketh it little leſſe than bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy
to ſay, God is <hi>liberè bonus,</hi> but that is, becauſe he cannot part with his
<hi>Helena,</hi> or <hi>Dalilah</hi> (viz.) <hi>That liberty conſiſts in an indifferency to good and
evil,</hi> and in this ſenſe to ſay, God doth ſo freely will good, that he can as freely
will evil, would be <hi>blaſphemy;</hi> but to will evil is no part at all of freedome, it is
a defect in a mutable creature, as is to be ſhewed. Such a determination to good
only was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo from his perfection, and is likewiſe in the <hi>Angels</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>Saints</hi> glorified; here is no power to ſinne, yet have they liberty in an
eminent degree, though determined to good onely: On the contrary, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
and damned men they are neceſſarily determined to that which is evil, they
cannot but hate God, they are not able to have one good thought, or one good
deſire to all eternity, yet all this is done freely by them; Now as the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to good did ariſe from perfection, from the ſtrong principles of holineſſe
within, ſo in theſe their neceſſary determination to evil doth ariſe from that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of iniquity and ſinne they are delivered up unto: In this neceſſity of ſinning
are all natural men (till regenerated) abſolutely plunged into, and that from
the dominion which ſinne hath over them; Onely herein they differ from the
Devils and damned men, they are in their <hi>termino,</hi> in their journeys end, and ſo
are not in a capacity of being ever freed from this neceſſity and thraldome to
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57719:173"/>
ſinne: There will never be a converted Devil, or a converted man in hell, their
ſtate is unchangeable, and they can never be recovered, but with wicked men in
this life, God hath dealt in many plentifull wayes of mercy, ſo that though for
the preſent determined only to evil all the day long, though for the preſent under
the chains and bonds of ſinne, <hi>Yet the grace of God may deliver them out of this
priſon, and ſet them at liberty,</hi> but till this be, they are as the Devils carried out
neceſſarily in all hatred unto God, and this determination to <hi>one</hi> is from imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, There is a determination to <hi>one</hi> from principles of Nature without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and judgement, and where ſuch is there cannot be any liberty, for reaſon and
judgement is the root of liberty, though it be formally in the will.</p>
                           <p>By this then you ſee, That this neceſſity of ſinning doth not take away
the natural freedome that is in the will, ſo that a man and a beaſt ſhould
be both alike. <hi>Luther (De Servo Arbit.</hi>) indeed wiſhed that the word <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi>

                           <head type="sub">The ſecond Argument of the Servitude of the Will is its being carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out unto ſinne voluntarily, and with delight.</head>
                           <p>SEcondly, <hi>This neceſſity of ſinning doth not at all take off from the volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe
and delight therein, but every natural man is carried out ſo volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
and readily unto every ſinne ſuggeſting it ſelf, as if there were no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

Job</hi> 15. 16 Even as the feavoriſh or <hi>Hydropical</hi> man is never ſatiated with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Therefore the neceſſity of ſinning is never to be oppoſed to his willingneſs
and freedom; for though a man hath no freedom to good, yet he hath to evil,
<hi>Eoque magis libera, quo magis Ancilla,</hi> the more he is ſubject to ſinne, the
more enſlaved to it by his delight therein, the freer he is to act it; We muſt not
then imagine ſuch a neceſſity of ſinning in a man, as if that did compel and force
a man againſt his inclination and deſire: You muſt not think that it is thus with a
man, as if he could ſay, O Lord, my will is ſet againſt ſinne, I utterly abhorre
and detect it, but I am neceſſitated to do it; for the will being corrupted,
doth with all propenſity and delight rejoyce in the accompliſhing of that which
is evil.</p>

thing that is Spiritual; And wherein that inability conſiſts.</head>
                           <p>THirdly, <hi>This bondage of the will to ſinne is evidently manifeſted in its utter
impotency and inability to any thing that is ſpiritual.</hi> It's like <hi>Samſon,</hi>
that hath loſt its ſtrength, <hi>God made man right,</hi> whereby he had an ability to do
any thing that was holy, there could not be an inſtance in any duty, though in
the higheſt degree, which <hi>Adam</hi> had not a power to do, and now he is ſo greatly
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57719:174"/>
polluted, that there is not the greateſt ſinne poſſibly to be committed by the vileſt
of men, but every man hath the ſeed and root thereof within him, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
man by nature is not onely compared to the <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>deaf,</hi> but alſo to
ſuch who are wholly <hi>dead</hi> in ſinne: So that as the dead man hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to raiſe himſelf, ſo neither hath a man who is ſpiritually dead in his
ſinnes.</p>
                           <p>That this Truth may greatly humble us, Let us conſider, wherein this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
impotency to what is holy, is in every man, for this is a great
part of the demonſtration of our ſpiritual bondage to ſinne and Satan.
And</p>
                           <p>Firſt, Such is the thraldom of the <hi>will, That a man by nature cannot reſiſt the
leaſt temptation to ſinne, much leſſe the greateſt, without the ſpecial grace of God
helping at that time.</hi> We matter not thoſe <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctors who hold a man
by his own power may reſiſt leſſe temptations, yea more grievous ones, though
not continually; for when our Saviour teacheth us to pray, <hi>That we may not be
lead into temptation,</hi> doth not that imply, whatſoever is a temptation, whether
it be <hi>ſmall</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> if the Lord leave us thereunto, we preſently are overcome
by it. Certainly, if <hi>Adam</hi> while retaining his integrity in a temptation, and
that about ſo ſmall a matter comparatively, for want of actual corroborating
grace, was overtaken by it: Is it any wonder that we who have no inward ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
principle of holineſs within us, but are filled with all evil and corruption,
that we are reeds ſhaken with every wind? The rotten Apple muſt fall at every
blaſt: Know then that it is either <hi>ſanctifying</hi> or <hi>reſtraining grace,</hi> that keeps thee
from every ſnare of ſinne thou meeteſt with; Thou wouldſt every hour fall into
the mire did not that uphold: Theſe <hi>Dalilahs</hi> would make thee ſleep in their laps,
and then as <hi>Jael</hi> to <hi>Sicera,</hi> ſo would they do to thee. Herein is our bondage
diſcovered.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Our thraldome is manifeſted, <hi>In that we are not able of our ſelves
to have one good thought, in reference to our eternal ſalvation;</hi> But if any ſerious
apprehenſion, if any godly meditation be in thy ſoul, it is the <hi>grace</hi> of God that
doth breath it into thee; The wilderneſs of thy heart cannot bring forth ſuch ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:
Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>We are not able of our ſelves</hi> (2 Cor. 3. 5.) <hi>to think any
thing as of our ſelves;</hi> Though the Apoſtle ſpeaketh it occaſionally in his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
imployment, yet (it holdeth generally true of every one, of thy ſelf)
then thy heart is like a noiſome dung-hill, nothing but unſavoury thoughts
doe ariſe from it; but if at any time any good motion, any ſad and ſerious
thought ſtirreth within thee, know this cometh from without, it is put into thee,
as the cup of gold in <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s ſack; and therefore this muſt greatly debaſe us.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>We are not able of our ſelves to have the leaſt deſire or longing after
grace, and a ſtate of holineſſe.</hi> Not only <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> but <hi>Semi-pelagianiſm</hi> is
a dangerous rock to be avoided: The later made our deſires to <hi>begin,</hi> and then
Gods grace to <hi>ſucceed</hi> and <hi>accompliſh;</hi> But there is not ſo much as the leaſt groan,
the leaſt deſire can ariſe in thy heart: Oh that God would change me!
Oh that I were in the ſtate of thoſe that do truly fear God! And the reaſon is,
becauſe the Scripture deſcribeth us by nature to be <hi>dead in ſinne,</hi> and compareth
the work of grace to a ſpiritual <hi>reſurrection:</hi> Oh how great is thy bondage which
doth ſo farre oppreſs thee, that thou canſt not ſo much as long for any freedom!
Oh hopeleſs and wretched man, if left to himſelf!</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, From this followeth the next demonſtration of our vaſſalage and
ſpiritual impotency, <hi>That we cannot pray to God, that he would deliver us out of
this miſery.</hi> No natural man can pray, it is the grace of God that doth inable
thereunto, he may utter the words of prayer, he may repeat the expreſſions,
but (alas) he doth not, he cannot pray, as God requireth, and ſo as he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it. The Apoſtle is clear for this, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The Spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57719:174"/>
for we know not what to pray for as we ought;</hi> Is not this unſpeakable
miſery, who needeth to pray more then thou, and yet thou canſt not pray? Thou
art ſinning, thou art dying, thou are damning, and yet canſt not pray: Is not
thy heart like an adamant, if this break thee not?</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, Such is our impotency and bondage, <hi>That we are not able to affect our
ſelves with the fear and terrour of the Law, thereby to be convinced and humbled
in our ſelves.</hi> If we cannot do the preparatories for grace, much leſſe grace it
ſelf; if we cannot do the leſſe, How ſhall we do the greater? Now one great
preparatory work is, To have a divine and powerfull fear in our ſouls, by reaſon
of the Law, whereby we are afraid of hell, of the day of Judgement, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have any reſt in our ſpirits, becauſe of this. Now this is wrought by the
Spirit of God in a preparatory way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. It is called <hi>The Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:</hi>
And <hi>Joh. 14. The Spirit doth convince the world of ſinne;</hi> So that in and
through the preaching of the Law, and diſcovery of ſinne, the Spirit of God
doth awaken and terrifie the conſcience of a man, maketh him afraid, that he
cannot eat, or drink, or take the delight he uſed to do. It is true, the ſlaviſh
ſinfulneſs of this fear the Spirit of God doth not work, but the heart being like
a mudded pool, when it is moved, ſuch ſlaviſh fears will ariſe likewiſe; But how
farre is every natural man from this, he is ſecure and jolly, bleſſing and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, crying peace, peace, all is at quiet within him, becauſe the ſtrong
man doth keep the houſe? It is the voice of the Lord only that can make theſe
mountains to quake and melt.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, Such is our weakneſs, <hi>That we cannot barden or ſoften our hearts in the
leaſt manner, but they remain obdurate and like braſſe and iron.</hi> Thy heart is like
a ſtone within thee, and thou art no wayes able to mollifie it; Therefore God
maketh it his work, and he graciouſly promiſeth, <hi>I will take away the heart of
ſtone</hi> (Ezek. 11. 19.) <hi>and give an heart of fleſh;</hi> As if God had ſaid, I know
this work is above you, you are not able to do it: And certainly, if the godly
themſelves (becauſe of the remainders of original corruption doe complain
of the hardneſſe of their hearts,) cannot mollifie or ſoften them, as they deſire;
Is it any wonder if the wicked man be not able to remove the ſtone from
him.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, <hi>A man cannot by the power of nature believe, no not ſo much as with
an hiſtorical faith, till grace prepare the heart therein.</hi> Now faith is the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-ſtone,
<hi>Heb. 11. He that cometh to God muſt believe he is,</hi> and ſo he muſt
believe the truth about Chriſt; But we ſee by the Phariſees, who heard Chriſt
preach, ſaw the wonderfull miracles he did, yet in ſtead of believing in him did
deride and oppoſe him; ſo that all the acts of faith, whether <hi>dogmatical</hi> or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
we are enabled unto only by the grace of God, <hi>Matth. 13. 11. To you it
is given to know the myſteries of the kingdom of Heaven, but not to them:</hi> Thus
<hi>Act.</hi> 18. 27. the Diſciples are ſaid <hi>to believe through grace,</hi> faith then is <hi>the gift
of God,</hi> not the work of mans <hi>free-will.</hi>) And if he cannot do this, it is plain, he
cannot move one foot of himſelf towards Heaven.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, Such is our impotency, <hi>That when grace is offered and tendered to us,
the will of it ſelf hath no power to conſent to it, or make improvement of it.</hi> It can,
and oft doth reſiſt and refuſe grace, but of it ſelf it cannot imbrace it. It is true,
<hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> plead hard for this power of the will, but this is to give
more to mans will then to Gods grace, this is to make man to differ himſelf from
others.</p>
                           <p>It might be thought, that the will indeed cannot chuſe Chriſt, or receive him
as a Lord, becauſe there is no revelation or manifeſtation of a Chriſt; They are a
people happily who ſit in darkneſs, and have no light; and therefore though
they may have an inward power to ſee, yet for want of light to actuate the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
they cannot; ſo that the defect ariſeth not from the power within, but the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57719:175"/>
manifeſtation of the object without: And this indeed is gratly to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whether an <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> (for example) doth not believe, becauſe there
is no propoſition of the object in the Miniſtry, otherwiſe if he enjoyed that, then
he had power over his own to aſſent to it. Now even the <hi>Pelagians</hi> themſelves, and
their followers, yea even all that give not grace its full due, yet thus farre they do
acknowledge there muſt be a doctrinal revelation by the Spirit of God, of the
truths to be acknowledged; and when this light is ſet (as it were) upon the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,
then a man of his own ſelf is able to ſee; but ſuch is the corruption of
man, that not only grace muſt bring in the light, but it muſt alſo give the eye to
ſee; So that the work of Gods grace is both <hi>objective</hi> and <hi>ſubjective, objective</hi> in
revealing the object, and <hi>ſubjective</hi> in preparing and fitting the ſubject; It being
the Lord who doth give the <hi>ſeeing eye,</hi> and the <hi>hearing ear,</hi> Prov. 20. 12. Yea
the <hi>Arminians</hi> go further, acknowledging that grace doth <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> work
upon the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of a man, for it being a paſſive faculty it cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
its illumination, but the will that retaineth its <hi>indifferency,</hi> when grace hath
done all it will do: This therfore is granted, That without the grace of God
enlightning and revealing, we are not able to believe the myſteries of Chriſt
Kingdom; but though all this be granted, yet we ſay, <hi>That without further
grace (even grace regenerating and ſanctifying the will.) we are not able to cleave to
that which is good:</hi> You muſt not then conceive, as if God only offered grace in
the Miniſtry, and then the will of man by its own ſelf doth love and delight in it;
No, <hi>the heart of ſtone</hi> is firſt to be removed, we are to be <hi>new born,</hi> and made
<hi>new creatures,</hi> before we can put forth any ſpiritual life at all; Not that a man
is converted without his will, or that he doth not believe or repent, but the grace
of God, only God changeth the will, he quickneth it, and enliveneth it ſo, that
whereas it was like <hi>Sarah</hi>'s dead womb before, now it was made fruitfull. The
grace of God doth not compel the will, but change it; As if water which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deſcendeth be turned into air, then it doth as naturally aſcend; Indeed this
is a phyſical change, but the moral change by grace in the will, is as notable to
its operations. To conſent therefore to grace is the work of grace; It is grace
that maketh us to will and receive grace: Hence we ſee by experience of thoſe
many who enjoy the means of grace, how few do effectually and powerfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them: Whence is this difference? Is it becauſe one doth uſe his free-will
better then another? Surely this would attribute farre more to free-will, then to
Gods grace; for it's the will of man that maketh grace effectual, not grace that
maketh the will of man pliable: By this <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be no more beholding to
the grace of God then <hi>Judas;</hi> nor <hi>David</hi> then <hi>Saul,</hi> ſeeing (<hi>ex parte Dei</hi>)
all had grace alike, onely one uſed this grace of God by his own power better
then another, and thus we ſhall have ſomething that we did not receive, and we
ſhall make our ſelves to differ from other; How derogatory and injurious is this
to the grace of God?</p>

                           <p>THis want of freedom to any thing that is good, is ſeen, <hi>In the concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

God:</hi> And certainly, if you ask, Wherein doth the bondage of the will to ſin
conſiſt? We may in the general ſay, in its creature affection, ſo that the will,
which while entire and ſound did love God as the chiefeſt good, and all creatures in
reference, and with ſubordination to him, is now ſo debaſed that it creepeth upon
the ground, and is not able at all to love any thing but it ſelf and the creature; So
that now every one taketh up that requeſt <hi>Pſal. 4, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi>
Any temporal good, they deſire the Devils offer; So that if he would ſhew them
the glory of the world, and beſtow it on them, they would preſently fall down
and worſhip: Oh the unhappy and miſerable change that ſinne hath now made
upon the will! being in abſolute ſubjection to every thing that he was made lord
over; God put all things under his feet, and now all things have put man under
their feet: It's the love of the world, and the things of the world, that is the
<hi>Iron chain</hi> about the <hi>will,</hi> as that about <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s ſtump of the Tree;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:57719:176"/>
ſo that it can never lift it ſelf up to what is Heaven: This maketh the will like that
woman, who was bowed down with her infirmity, and could not look up, till
Chriſt healed her, and made her ſtraight: This maketh the neceſſity of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
reſurrection, that ſo we may ſet our affections upon things above. This
love of the world, and the things thereof, is the Summe of all thoſe particular
wayes, whereby we are thus wretchedly enſlaved; Therefore grace when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
doth looſen theſe bonds, and make us free, by working in us a contrary love,
and a contrary ſweetneſs and delight; So that now all the world, with the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereof, are but as ſo many husks in compariſon of that manna he now feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon; And as he that ſtedfaſtly beholds the Sunne for a while, his eyes
are ſo dazeled, that he cannot for a ſeaſon behold any thing elſe: Thus when
grace hath ſo ſanctified and affected the will, that it findeth no greater ſweetneſs
and delight then in holy things, this preſently maketh him throw away all thoſe
bonds that were upon him.</p>

who though a drunkard, yet coming to hear <hi>Xenocrates</hi> his Lecture about tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
was ſo immediately perſwaded thereby, that he preſently forſook that
beaſtly ſinne? In this Argument <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian</hi> did often triumph; But
<hi>Auſtin</hi>'s anſwer was good, and juſtifiable by Scripture, That when they left one
ſinne, they fell into another, they did cure one luſt by another luſt, a carnal one
by a ſpiritual one; for when they did abſtain from ſuch ſinnes, it was not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to <hi>God,</hi> and from <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt, but it was either from <hi>vain glory,</hi> or to
be ſure a <hi>ſinfull confidence,</hi> and reſting upon themſelves; and therefore even the
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> who pretended the higheſt, <hi>viz. That we were to do virtuous actions for
virtues ſake,</hi> yet they came too ſhort of the right mark; for virtue is not to be
loved <hi>ultimately for virtues ſake,</hi> but that thereby we might draw nearer to God,
and be made happy in enjoying of him; Therefore the <hi>Stoicks</hi> opinion did teach
a man nothing but ſelf-confidence and ſelf fulneſs, which ſinnes are <hi>forbidden</hi> by
the Word of God, as well as <hi>Epicurean</hi> and groſſe ſinnes: Oh then the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
bondage of the will to ſinne! That as the bird in a net, the more ſhe ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to get out, the more ſhe intangleth her ſelf: Thus it is with the natural
man, the more he ſtriveth of himſelf to come out of this mire, the faſter he ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in: Thou then who art a natural man, though ſuch a ſinne and ſuch a ſinne
be left, yet ſee if when the Devil was caſt out, a worſe did not come in the room
thereof; See if it be not with thee, as in that repreſentation to the Prophet,
<hi>Thou haſt broken a woodden yoke, and an iron one is made in ſtead thereof;</hi> Thou
haſt cured a carnal ſinne by a ſpiritual one; For you muſt know, That not onely
grace doth expell ſinne, but ſometimes one luſt may expel another, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
ſpiritual pride, and ſelf-righteouſneſs did make them abhorre the Publicans
ſinnes; ſo that even then the natural man cannot but ſinne, while he is caſting
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57719:176"/>
off ſinne. Therefore though unregenerate perſons may do that which is materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
good, and for the ſubſtance of the act, yet they can never do that which is
formally ſo; or as <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſſed it of old, we muſt diſtinguiſh between the
<hi>Officium,</hi> the Duty it ſelf, and <hi>Finis,</hi> the end of the Duty: Now the end of all till
regenerated, can never be right or pure, it never aſcends high enough even to God
himſelf, becauſe they want faith; So that though <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was <hi>juſt,</hi> yet he was
not <hi>the Scriptures juſt man, that liveth by faith;</hi> None of the renowned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
were chaſte by <hi>faith,</hi> charitable by <hi>faith,</hi> temperate by <hi>faith,</hi> and therefore
their glorious actions were only ſplendid, gliſtering ſinnes, they had a pompous
appearance, but were indeed real vices, which were ſo farre from profiting them
as to eternal happineſs, that they were an hinderance to them, for hereby they
truſted in themſelves; The <hi>Epicurean</hi> he ſaid, It is good for me <hi>frui carne,</hi> To

he groaned under, <hi>Rom</hi> 7. That the Law which was for good, wrought in
him all manner of evil: Thus the Goſpel, yea Chriſt preached, is the occaſion
of more wickedneſs and impiety in unregenerate men, then otherwiſe they would
be guilty of; And if this be ſo, though our heads were fountains of water, yet
we could not weep enough for the guilt and wretchedneſs we are in by this
means, for our <hi>remedies</hi> make our <hi>diſeaſes</hi> greater, light increaſeth our darkneſs,

in the uſe of theſe means, they might be no longer the means of grace, but of
anger and judgement, and the preaching of the Goſpel, becauſe of the ſad effects
which it hath through the wilfull indiſpoſition of many who hear it, might be as
much trouble to us, as the preſence of the Ark was to the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> Therefore
the clearer light, the more powerfull means of ſalvation a people do enjoy, the
more is the impiety and wickedneſs of ſuch (whom grace doth not convert) daily
increaſed; inſomuch that the Goſpel ſhining upon ſuch men, is like the Sunne
ſhining upon a noiſome dunghill, which maketh it the more loathſome; How
then can there be free-will in a man to good, when if left to himſelf all helps are

                           <p>
                              <hi>WE proceed therefore to make a further diſcovery of the bondage of
the will to ſinne, and that it hath no liberty, no power or ability to
do any thing that is truly godly;</hi> If we take notice of all thoſe wayes, wherein
learned men do place liberty or freedome of will, we ſhall find evidently, that none
of theſe deſcriptions, or definitions are any wayes competent to the will, while it is
unſanctified; <hi>For,</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, if that opinion be received, (which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others follow)
<hi>That liberty is radically in the underſtanding, though formally in the will, (that is)
the reaſon of the wils liberty is from the underſtanding, which doth propound ſeveral
objects, and thereupon the will is indeterminate, whereas in beaſts their appetite
is plainly limited, becauſe they want reaſon;</hi> as it is <hi>arbitrium,</hi> ſo (they ſay)
it is in <hi>intellectu,</hi> as <hi>liberum</hi> ſo in <hi>voluntate.</hi> Now (I ſay) let this be received
(for I do not diſpute the truth of it) then we muſt ſay, <hi>The will hath no liberty
to what is good, becauſe it faileth in the root;</hi> The ſtreame cannot runne, when
the ſpring is dried up; for if we take the underſtanding in reſpect of ſpiritual,
and heavenly things, ſo it is altogether <hi>darkened</hi> and <hi>blinded;</hi> Therefore there
is the grace of illumination required that it may know and believe the things
of God, without which men love and delight in darkneſs rather then light:
The things of God are ſaid to be <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to a natural man; ſo that all the
while a man hath no more then nature in him, he is like thoſe birds that can
ſee in the night, but are blind in the day; They have quick and ſharp appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
in worldly and earthly matters, but are altogether ſtupid and ſenſleſs
in regard of heavenly; How then can the will be free, when the mind is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
dark; for God in converſion, when he will ſet the will and affections
at liberty from ſinne, begins firſt in the underſtanding, light in the mind is
firſt created, there are holy thoughts and ſpiritual convictions wrought in the
ſoul, and by this light the other parts of the ſoul they come to be ſanctified;
now then if there be not ſo much as this antecedaneous work upon the mind,
the will is as yet very farre from the Kingdom of heaven? Wonder not then if
ye ſee unregenerate men walking and ſtumbling in the dark; that you ſee them
ſo captivated unto every luſt; you may as ſoon remove a mountain out of its
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57719:177"/>
place, as take them off from their iniquities; For how can it be otherwiſe while
the will hath <hi>no guid</hi> to lead it, none to informe it concerning the evil and
danger of thoſe wayes it is going in? If there be no light in the mind, there is
no liberty in the will; ſo that hereby both horſe and rider are (as it were)
thrown into the ſea.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, If to be that liberty doth conſiſt <hi>in an active indifferency to good or evil,
then the will is not free, becauſe the former part of this deſcription (upon Scripture-grounds)
can no wayes be accommodated to the will.</hi> This deſcription is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received and applauded by <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> as the beſt, (though
<hi>Gibieuſ</hi> ſaith it is the worſt) making the very <hi>formal nature of liberty to conſiſt
herein,</hi> that when all requiſites to an action are ſuppoſed, yet the will <hi>can
do, or not do;</hi> and this they extend even to <hi>spiritual objects,</hi> to that great work
of converſion, affirming, when grace doth aſſiſt and help all it can; (ſo that
<hi>Ex parte Dei,</hi> all things are ready that do concurre to our converſion;) yet
the will, becauſe it is free, retaineth an <hi>active indifferency,</hi> either to accept of
this grace offered, or to reject it. This deſcription we do <hi>no wayes acknowledge,</hi>
as that which depriveth <hi>God, Chriſt, and the glorified Saints from liberty;</hi> and
beſides, liberty being perfection, and ſo in the moſt perfect manner in the moſt
perfect ſubjects, this doth debaſe it making a defect part of this perfection:
It is wholly abſurd to make a power to ſinne part of liberty: Indeed this was
a concomitant of <hi>Adam</hi>'s liberty, but <hi>not becauſe liberty,</hi> but becauſe his will
was <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>changeable,</hi> ſo that if he had been corroborated and confirmed
in grace, he had not put forth any ſuch experience of his liberty: well though
we cannot aſſent to it, yet let it be ſuppoſed to be true; The Scripture is very
clear and pregnant, That a man hath no ſuch indifferent power in him to good
or evil; Indeed to evil, that he is carried out unto with all delight, he can of
himſelf kill himſelf, but he cannot of himſelf give life to himſelf: But as for
the other part, to be able to love what is good, to believe and to turn himſelf
unto God, this is above his power, for the order of nature and of grace differ
as much, as the order of ſenſe and reaſon; ſo that as the ſenſitive faculty cannot
put forth acts of reaſon, (the eie cannot diſcourſe and reaſon,) ſo neither can
the rational faculties put forth the acts of grace, which come from a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that which is borne from above; All theſe places which deſcribe man
in a ſpiritual ſenſe to be <hi>blind in mind, deaf in eares, and hardned in underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
yea which ſay, he is <hi>dead in ſinne;</hi> and therefore the work of converſion
is compared to <hi>regeneration,</hi> and to a <hi>reſurrection;</hi> all theſe do plainly declare,
that the will hath <hi>no activity at all as to the firſt beginnings of grace.</hi> It is true
indeed, there are commands <hi>to repent, to be converted,</hi> yea we are bid to <hi>chooſe
life and death,</hi> but there are none of theſe duties commanded, which in other
places are not made the gracious gifts of God; ſo that to repent, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
they are promiſed by God as the workings of his grace, whereby they
are both duties and gifts; Although the <hi>Arminian</hi> thinketh that impoſſible:
They are duties becauſe we are the people who do believe and do repent, and
are commanded thereunto; They are alſo gifts becauſe it is the grace of God
alone that doth enable thereunto; when therefore you read of ſuch commands,
you muſt not think, that they imply our power and ability, for then
grace would be wholly excluded, ſeeing theſe Texts ſpeak abſolutely, as
if a good work were wholly done by our own power; whereas the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi>
and <hi>Papiſt</hi> will not wholly exclude grace, and ſo theſe Texts would
prove more then they contend for; But ſuch commands are ſtill impoſed
upon us by God, to ſhew what doth belong to him; what he may juſtly expect
from us; for ſeeing he created man with full power and ability to keep theſe
commands, if man wilfully caſt himſelf into an utter impotency, God hath
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57719:178"/>
not thereby loſt the <hi>right</hi> of commanding, though we have the <hi>power</hi> of
obeying.</p>
                           <p>Beſides by theſe Commands, as we are to know our duty, ſo thereby alſo we
are provoked to be deeply humbled under our great inability, ſeeing our ſelves
treaſuring up wrath every day, and preparing more torments for our ſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the grace of God doth deliver us; Yea by theſe commands God doth work
grace, they are practical and operative means, whereby he doth communicate life
unto us.</p>
                           <p>And laſtly, Therefore God doth uſe Commands, Becauſe this way is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to man, who is a rational Agent; For although the work of grace is
more than meerly <hi>ſwaſive,</hi> it is <hi>efficacious</hi> and <hi>really changing the heart,</hi> ſo
that the Spirit of God doth farre more in converting of a ſinner, then the
Devil doth in tempting to ſinne; yet God dealeth ſuitably to the nature
of a man; We are not like ſtocks and ſtones, to whom it is ridiculous to
preach, there being not in them a paſſive capacity of receiving the worke
of grace; Hence it is that the Word is preached, Miracles are wrought,
powerfull Arguments are uſed to draw off the heart; So that grace doth
worke <hi>Ethicophyſically</hi> (as ſome expreſſe it,) Commands then and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are uſed, becauſe grace is wrought in us after a rational manner, in
an attempered manner to our conſtitution; The underſtanding being firſt
wrought upon, that ſo the will and affections may more readily give up themſelves.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>If liberty be the ſame with voluntarineſs and no more, (as many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men do contend, making</hi> voluntas <hi>and</hi> liberum arbitrium <hi>all one, as that which is
oppoſed to coaction and natural neceſſity;</hi> yea if we adde <hi>Aurtelus</hi> his opinion to
this, that <hi>libertas</hi> was nothing but <hi>complacentia, liberty</hi> is the complacency and
delight of the will in its object) <hi>then in this ſenſe, (if rightly underſtood,) a man
hath no freedom to what is holy.</hi> It is true indeed, the learned to ſhew, that grace
in converting doth not deſtroy the liberty of the will, (<hi>viz.</hi> the natural liberty)
no more then the will it ſelf; Grace doth not compel the will, or put an inherent
natural neceſſity upon it; for if there could be coaction, the <hi>velle</hi> would be
<hi>nolle,</hi> which is a contradiction; and if a natural neceſſity could be impoſed upon
it, it would not be <hi>appetitus rationalis,</hi> a rational appetite; ſo that though grace
in converting of man doth inſuperably, and invincibly change the will, making
it of unwilling willing, ſo that there is a neceſſity (not natural,) but of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
and unchangeableneſs; The will doth moſt certainly give it ſelf up to the
grace of God mollifying and faſhioning of it for that purpoſe: This Iron (as it
were) is put into the fire, and then it is made pliable to receive any form or
impreſſion, yet the eſſential liberty is not deſtroyed; For the Queſtion about
<hi>Free-will</hi> is not <hi>An ſit?</hi> but <hi>Quid poſſit?</hi> And herein lieth the difficult knot in this
whole point about grace and the will of man, <hi>How to aſſert the irreſiſtible</hi> (as
many call it, but others reject that expreſſion, though the ſenſe of thoſe who
uſe it, is very ſound and ſignificant enough) <hi>work of grace, inſuperably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the will to that which is good, and yet to be free from coaction or ſuch
a neceſſity as is deſtructive to liberty?</hi> The <hi>Quomodo.</hi> How theſe two are to
be reconciled, is that which in all ages hath exerciſed the moſt learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious;
inſomuch that ſome have adviſed to reſt in it by faith, as in a myſtery
above our underſtanding, even as we doe in many other Doctrines to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us; But I am not to aſcend this mountain at this time; This is enough
for our purpoſe, to ſhew, <hi>That if liberty be ſaid to conſiſt in willing a thing
freely from coaction and neceſſity, even in this reſpect, we have not thus farre
liberty to good, becauſe it is God that worketh in us to will.</hi> Indeed when
we doe will, we are not compelled by the Grace of God, onely we
cannot will till the Grace of God enable us thereto; <hi>It is
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57719:178"/>
not of him that willeth, but of God that ſheweth mercy; Neither are, we born
of the will of man, but of God;</hi> It is grace then onely that maketh us to will
the good things tendered to us, though the will in eliciting of this <hi>is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
but doth it freely,</hi> yea grace giveth this freedome to it, ſo that grace
doth not deſtroy, but give liberty; And therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old urged,
<q>That they denied <hi>Liberum arbitrium,</hi> who would not have it <hi>Liberatum;</hi>
                              </q>
They cannot hold free-will in a true ſenſe, that doe not hold free and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
grace, which giveth the will all the ſtrength it hath to what is
good: Thus liberty, if it be the ſame with willingneſs, we have it not of our ſelves,
till the grace of God beſtow it upon us.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>If liberty conſiſt in having dominion and power over our actions,
then alſo the will cannot be ſaid to be free, as to doe holy things;</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the will, when it doth will, is the ſubordinate cauſe under God of its
own action, and as a cauſe, ſo alſo may be ſaid to have dominion over it, yet
becauſe the actual willing of what is good, doth not ariſe or exiſt by the
ſtrength of the will, but by the grace of God, therefore it is that (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of good things) the will cannot be ſaid to have the dominion over
them. This Definition of liberty (<hi>viz.</hi>) [to have a dominion over our
own actions,] is by <hi>Janſenius</hi> aſſerted to be the true and proper meaning
of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that his judgement is, then the will is ſaid to be <hi>free,</hi> when
it hath <hi>dominion</hi> and <hi>power</hi> over what it doth; and if ſo, no wonder then
the will be ſo often ſaid to be captivated and enſlaved, that it hath no freedom
to what is holy; For what power can the will have over holy actions, when
it is corrupted and defiled, that no holy thought, or holy motion is under the
power of it. It was <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his complaint of old, That <hi>Cor noſtrum non eſt
in noſtrâ poteſtate;</hi> Our heart is not in our power, but ſinnefull and evil
workings of ſoul riſe up in us, which we are no wayes able to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, If liberty be (as <hi>Anſelme</hi> of old defined it, to which ſome <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otericks</hi>
doe adhere, viz) <hi>Facultas ſervandi rectitudinem, propter rectitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
ipſam, That it is a power to obſerve that which is right, for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſake,</hi> then this doth evidently proclaime, That man hath no <hi>Free-will,</hi>
for to obſerve that which is holy and righteous for holineſſe ſake, which muſt
needs argue a man regenerated and borne again; And indeed liberty in this
ſenſe is nothing but the Image of God repaired in a man, and ſo is no
more then to be like God himſelf; And now that every man by nature
hath loſt this Image of God, is ſo plain, that the experience of every man
concerning his diſtance from God may fully confirme it. If to this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Aquinas</hi> his Deſcription, That it is, <hi>Vis electiva mediorum ſervato or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
ad finem.</hi> A power to chuſe means with a due order and reſpect to
the end (yet ſtill freedome in the will to what is good cannot be found)
For as (ſaith he) <hi>The underſtanding which is an apprehenſive faculty, hath
its ſimple and bare apprehenſion of a thing</hi> (viz. <hi>of the firſt principles</hi>) And
then it hath another act, which is to Reaſon and Diſcourſe, and that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
of Concluſions to be deduced from thoſe principles; So what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are in reſpect of concluſions to the Underſtanding, the ſame the end is,
in reſpect of the means to the will; And therefore as the underſtanding
doth neceſſarily erre, when it doth not diſcourſe ſuitably to the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
So the will, which is the appetitive part of a man, muſt neceſſarily
ſinne, when it doth not chuſe means with a due order to the end: <hi>Now
God being the chief end of all our actions, how impoſſible is it for the will corrupted
as it is, to will riches, health, learning, or any creature in reference to God as
the end.</hi>

Laſtly, If liberty conſiſt (as <hi>Gibieuf</hi> would have it) in an <hi>amplitude of
ſpirit and independency upon the creature, ſo that it is above every created ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
with an eminent magnanimity of ſpirit adhering to God alone, and reſting
in him as the chiefeſt good,</hi> then it is plain alſo, That by nature the will of
man is utterly impotent to this thing, for the love of the creature is ſo
predominant that we live and doe all things in reference to that; So that
whereas grace maketh us to doe all things of God, and through God, and
to God; Now the creature doth ſo reigne in our hearts, that we move on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in all the workings of our ſoul to it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth, That ſome
<q>are ſlaves by nature, and ſuch have no reaſon of their owne to guide
them, that doe <hi>Sentire rationem magìs quàm habere,</hi> Feele Reaſon rather
then make uſe of it:</q> And if we ſpeak in a ſpiritual ſenſe, we are all thus
borne ſlaves and vaſſals, not being able to put forth the actings of true and right
reaſon, but do follow the luſts of our own ſoul, and are taken captive by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
at his will.</p>
                           <p>Thus we have at large diſcovered the bonds and chaines of ſinne our
wils are faſtened in; Oh that in the reading of this, God would breathe
into the ſouls of ſuch wretched ſinners, ſtrong deſires and ardent groans to
be redeemed from this thraldome! Shall the ungodly ſay, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſt, <hi>Let us break his bonds,</hi> when yet they are bonds of love, which
are for our eternal happineſs? And wilt not thou rather cry out, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe bonds, and theſe yokes, which are for thy eternal damnation, <hi>Let
us break them and rend them aſunder?</hi> Doth not the ſenſleſneſſe and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of men, while they hear theſe things too ſadly evidence the ſtate of thraldom
we are in to ſinne?</p>

for that would make the work to ſwell too big, but I ſhall ſpeak in the general of
them, inſtancing in particulars, as occaſion offereth.</p>
                        <p>The Scripture doth not ſpeak of the ſeveral parts of the ſoul, according to that

is uſed in the New Teſtament three times, where the word <hi>Affection</hi> is not barely
intended, but an horrible depravation of it, even to unnatural uncleanneſs, as
<hi>Rom. 1. 26. God gave them up to vile affections,</hi> and how unnatural they were is

                           </gap> here for
thoſe ſinnes which ariſe from the iraſcible appetite, and ſo take the word, though
generally ſpoken in an ill ſenſe; Even as the <hi>Stoicks</hi> held all paſſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be ſinne; and the affections which are placed in the concupiſcible appetite
the Apoſtle meaneth (ſay they) by the next expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">

If this be ſo (as <hi>Grotius</hi> expounds it) then we have here the Apoſtle
ſpeaking of affections according to philoſophical notions, but I will not determine
this to be the meaning.</p>
                        <p>The laſt place is, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 5. where the Apoſtle ſhewing, <hi>God hath called

Here it ſeemeth to be taken ſtrictly for thoſe luſtfull affections,
which flow from the ſinfull concupiſcence in a man; But if the Scripture doth
uſe the word differently to Philoſophers, to be ſure the thing it ſelf is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
as appeareth by my Text, where we have a Command directing of us
about the <hi>Object</hi> we are to place them upon, and that is ſet down, Firſt, Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively,
and then Negatively. The Directive Duty is in that expreſſion,

                           </gap>, <hi>Set not your affections,</hi> we render it in the margin, or <hi>mind;</hi> ſo that
the Greek word doth ſignifie the acts of the <hi>mind,</hi> but not them onely, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
alſo the <hi>affectionate part</hi> of a man; It includeth the mind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
alſo, becauſe commonly the intenſe actings of the mind excite and ſtirre up
proportionably the intenſe actions of the affections: Therefore it's ſometimes
tranſlated ſavouring, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 23. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, doth not
onely comprehend the mind, but chiefly the affectionate workings of the fleſh
againſt the Spirit of God.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall treat of it, as relating to the affections, therefore we have the <hi>Object</hi>
preſcribed them, they are to be upon <hi>things above,</hi> heavenly things This implieth
naturally they are placed <hi>other where</hi> then they ſhould be, upon earthly and ſading
objects. The Serpents ſeed (and ſo we are all by nature) cannot but lick up
the duſt of the earth, and live upon that; So that there is (for more emphaſis)
added the Negative alſo, <hi>Not on things on the earth;</hi> By theſe ſome mean thoſe
humane and ſuperſtitious Ordinances that the Apoſtle mentioned before, for
theſe were not of the Fathers heavenly planting; and indeed it is true, the more
a man is made ſpiritual, and hath had the experience of that wonderfull reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his ſoul from the ſtate of ſinne, in which it was dead, the more doth he
nauſeate and reject all ſuperſtition and humane wayes of devotion, rejoycing in
the purity and ſimplicity of Chriſts Inſtitutions, as thoſe alone by which he can
obtain any ſpiritual proficiency. But the Context ſeemeth to extend this Object
further to all ſinfull objects, yea and to lawfull objects, that we are not in an
immoderate and inordinate manner to let our hearts runne out upon them.</p>
                        <p>So then we have in the Text a moſt divine Injunction impoſed on us, <hi>To ſet our
affections upon things above,</hi> alwayes to put in practice that Exhortation, <hi>Surſum
corda,</hi> but ſuch is the horrible corruption of theſe affections by nature, that they
can no more aſcend up to them, then a worm can flie upwards like a Lark;
Therefore the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, that ere this be done, there muſt be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
laid of a ſpiritual Reſurrection, <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things
that be above;</hi> Our ſpiritual Regeneration and Reſurrection is both a <hi>cauſe</hi> of our
heavenly affections, and alſo it is a <hi>motive</hi> and <hi>obligation,</hi> it being contrary to
the nature of ſuch things that aſcend upwards, that they ſhould deſcend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
How can fire fall like a ſtone to the center? From the Text then we may
obſerve.</p>
                        <p>That ſuch is the corruption of the affections of man by nature, that till the grace
of regeneration come, they are placed only on earthly objects, and cannot move towards
heavenly.</p>

                        <p>BEfore we come to anatomize their evil and ſinfulneſs, let us take notice a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>The Nature of theſe Affections,</hi> And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, You muſt know that in man (beſides his <hi>underſtanding and will,</hi> which
are either the ſame with the rational ſoul, or powers ſeated in it) there is alſo a
<hi>ſenſitive appetite</hi> placed in the body, from whence ariſe thoſe motions of the ſoul,
which we call <hi>affections</hi> and paſſions, ſuch as <hi>anger, love, joy, fear</hi> and <hi>ſorrow,
&amp;c.</hi> It is true indeed, many learned men place affections in the will alſo, they
ſay, The <hi>will</hi> hath theſe affections of joy and ſorrow, and ſo Angels alſo have,
onely (they ſay) theſe are ſpiritual and incorporeal, and this muſt neceſſarily
be acknowledged; But then in men (beſides thoſe affections in the will) there
are alſo <hi>material ones ſeated in the ſenſitive appetite;</hi> for man being compounded
of ſoul and body, hereupon it is, that as in his <hi>rational part,</hi> he doth agree with
<hi>Angels,</hi> ſo in his <hi>ſenſitive part</hi> with the <hi>bruits;</hi> Therefore in man there are <hi>three
principles</hi> of actions that are internal, his <hi>Vnderſtanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi>
theſe later are implanted in us only to be ſervants and helps, but through our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
they are become tryants and uſurpers over the more noble powers of the
ſoul; ſo that man is not now as reaſon, much leſſe as grace, but as affections do
predominate. The Scripture (you heard) calleth theſe affections by the name
of the heart, though ſometime that comprehendeth the mind and will alſo. The
common Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is rendered <hi>paſſions,</hi> and they are ſo called,
becauſe of the effect of them, for when put forth, they make a corporeal tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation
and change in a man: Some make this difference between <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> (a word

                           </gap>, they make paſſions to be, when in a mild and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
motion of the ſoul without any violence or exceſs, and <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, when they
are turbulent and troubleſome, but <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> doth rather ſignifie the manners of men,
then their affections. Theſe paſſions have ſeveral names, ſometimes they are
called <hi>perturbations,</hi> but that is moſt properly, when they have caſt off the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of reaſon; Sometimes the <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>commotions</hi> of the ſoul; ſometimes
<hi>paſſions,</hi> which expreſſion is diſliked by ſome; That which ſeemeth to be moſt
proper and full, is to call them <hi>affections,</hi> becauſe the ſoul of a man is affected in
the exerciſe of them; So that by theſe we mean no more, then <hi>that whereby a
man about good or evil is carried out with ſome affection and commotion of his ſoul,</hi>
onely you muſt know, that when we call them paſſions, it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>formally,</hi> but <hi>cauſally;</hi> In their nature they are not paſſions, but motions
and actings of the ſoul, onely they cauſe a paſſion and ſuffering by ſome alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the body.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe affections in the ſoul are of a various nature, yet by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
they are reduced into two heads, according to the ſubject they are ſeated</hi> (viz.)
The <hi>appetite concupiſcible,</hi> and the <hi>appetite iraſcible;</hi> not that this is a two-fold
diſtinct appetite, onely the ſame appetite is diſtinguiſhed according to its <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of objects;</hi> The <hi>appetite concupiſcible,</hi> doth contain thoſe affections that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to good or evil abſolutely conſidered; For if it be <hi>good</hi> that is propounded,
then there is firſt the affection of <hi>love,</hi> if this good be <hi>not enjoyed,</hi> then there
is the affection of <hi>deſire;</hi> if it be <hi>obtained</hi> and enjoyed, then it is the affection of
<hi>joy;</hi> if it be <hi>evil</hi> that is preſented, then there is the affection of <hi>hatred,</hi> whereby
we diſtaſt it, and hereupon we flie from it; This is called <hi>Fuga,</hi> or abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but if we <hi>cannot</hi> eſcape it, then there is the affection of <hi>ſorrow;</hi> Thus there
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57719:181"/>
are ſix affections in the concupiſcible part; The object of the <hi>iraſible appetite</hi> is
good, as difficult or evil, as hardly to be avoided; good, if it be poſſible to be
obtained, then there followeth the affection of <hi>hope,</hi> if it be not poſſible, then
of <hi>deſpair,</hi> and as for the evil, that is difficulty overcome, if we can maſter it,
then there ariſeth the affection of <hi>boldneſs</hi> or <hi>confidence,</hi> if we cannot, then of <hi>fear;</hi>
if the evil preſſe us hard, that we cannot obtain what we would have, then ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the affection of <hi>anger;</hi> Thus there are five affections in the iraſcible appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
ſo that in all there are eleven paſſions, although from theſe come many other
affections of the ſoul, that we may call <hi>mixt ones,</hi> as <hi>Errour, Zeal, Pity,</hi> &amp;c.
in which many and ſeveral affections are ingredient: If then there be ſo great a
number of theſe in man, and they all corrupted, yea predominating over a man,
what ſea is more troubled and toſſed up and down with ſtorms and tempeſts, then
the heart of a man? What a miſerable wretched creature is man, who hath eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of theſe paſſions tyrannizing over him, if God leave thee to an inordinate
love of any thing? What unſpeakable bondage doth it put thee into, if to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
anger? What torments and vexations doth it work, making thy ſoul like
an hell for the preſent, if to exceſſive fear and ſorrow? Will not theſe be like
rottenneſſe in thy bones immediately? In how many particulars may thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
ariſe? Thy <hi>love</hi> may damn thee, thy <hi>fear</hi> may damn thee, thy <hi>anger</hi>
may damn thee, or any other affection, which yet do continually work in thy

                        <p>THirdly, Theſe affections may be treated of in ſeveral reſpects, but what is

                        <p>1. The <hi>Natural Philoſopher</hi> he is to treat of them, while he writeth <hi>De animâ,</hi>
of the ſoul; and certainly the nature of them is as neceſſary to be known as any

affections, (but it is loſt,) The Philoſopher he diſcourſeth of them, but as to
their natural being, not at all regarding the holy mortifying of them; and

hurtfull in the body; <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> diſcovered the inordinate love of a great man
by his pulſe; <hi>Amnon</hi> did pine and conſume away by his inordinate affection to
<hi>Tamar;</hi> Therefore the Phyſitian he conſiders them no further then how they
may be cured, that the health of the body may be preſerved; And indeed this is
alſo a good Argument in Divinity, to urge, that you muſt take heed of the
ſinnes of the paſſions, for they torment the body, indiſpoſe the body, they kill
they body, <hi>Worldly ſorrow worketh death,</hi> ſo doth worldly anger and worldly fear;
But of this hereafter.</p>
                        <p>3. The <hi>Rhetorician</hi> and <hi>Oratour</hi> he alſo writeth of the affections, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
in his <hi>Rhetoricks;</hi> Now the Oratour he diſcourſes of them no further, than as
they may be ſtirred up or compoſed by Rhetorical ſpeeches, how to put his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57719:181"/>
into love, anger, fear and grief, as he pleaſeth; for it is a ſpecial part in
Oratory to bow the affections; This was repreſented in <hi>Orphens</hi> harp, which is
ſaid to make beaſts follow him, yea very trees and ſtones, that is, Oratory doth
civilize and perſwade the moſt rude and ſavage. Now although thoſe who write
of the method of preaching, do much commend this gift in a Miniſter of the
Goſpel to be able to ſtirre up, and quicken the affectionate part, yet the grace of
God is required to go along herein; For it is eaſie for a <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to
ſtirre up the affections of their Auditors, when they declaimed about ſuch civil
and temporal matters, that they ſaw themſelves deeply concerned in; The very
principles of nature did inſtigate them to this; but we preach of ſupernatural
things, and the matters we preſs are diſtaſtfull and contrary to fleſh and bloud,
therefore no wonder if men hear without affection, and go away without any
raiſed affection at all.</p>
                        <p>4. There is the <hi>Moral Philoſopher,</hi> and he looketh upon it as his moſt proper
work to handle the affections; for what hath moral virtue to do, but to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the affections, that we do not over-love, or over-fear; This is the proper
work of the Moral Philoſopher, but neither is this handling of them high enough
for a Divine; The curing and ordering of them, which Moraliſts do preſcribe,
is but to drive out one ſinne with another, ſo that their virtues were but vices,
if you regard the principles and ends of their actions; Therefore</p>
                        <p>In the laſt place, The <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Miniſter of God,</hi> he is to preach of them,
and he only can do it ſatisfactorily having Gods Word to direct him, for by that
we find they are out of all order, by that we find they are to be mortified, by
that we find only the Spirit of Chriſt, not the power of nature is able to ſubdue
them; The true knowledge therefore about the pollution of them, will greatly
conduce to our humiliation and ſanctification.</p>

from this dung-hill: A man doth now for the moſt part reaſon, believe and will
according to his affections and paſſions; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved this, That <hi>Prout
quiſque affectus eſt it a judicat,</hi> As every man is affected, ſo he judgeth; They are
ſinfull affections which make the erroneous and heretical judgements that are,
they are ſinfull affections, which make the raſh, corrupt and uncharitable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are: Thus the vanity may be obſerved in the ſoul, which <hi>Solomon</hi> took
notice of to be ſometimes in the world, <hi>Princes go on foot, and ſervants ride on
horsback;</hi> God did at firſt implant affections in us for great uſefulneſs and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs,
that thereby we might be more inflamed and quickned up in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57719:182"/>
of God; They were appointed to be hand-maidens to the rational powers of
the ſoul, but now they are become <hi>Hagars</hi> to this <hi>Sarab,</hi> yea they are become
like <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> for they lift themſelves up above all that is called God in the ſoul.
The underſtanding and conſcience is made to us, as God appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it is ordained as a god to us; but theſe paſſions will be exalted above it,
and ſo man is led, not by reaſon, not by conſcience, but by affections; This is
the very reaſon, why either in matters of faith towards God, or in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of tranſactions with men, our judgements are ſeldome partly and
ſincerely carried out to the truth, but ſome affection or other doth
turn the balance in all things; Therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> was to go out of his
own Countrey, and ſo to worſhip God in a right manner: Thus if we would
ever have a ſound faith, a right judgement, we muſt come out of all affections
that may prepoſſeſs us; What a wofull aggravation of our ſinfull miſery is this,
that our affections ſhould come thus boldly and ſet themſelves in the throne of the
ſoul, that they ſhould bid us judge, and we judge, that they ſhould bid us believe,
and we believe? So that we moſt juſtly in a ſpiritual ſenſe complain, as the Jews
in a temporal one, <hi>Servants have ruled over us;</hi> Is not this a more troubleſome
judgement then that of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> when <hi>Frogs</hi> came croaking into their

becauſe it diſhonours God; our <hi>ſorrow</hi> it is principally to be becauſe of our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to him; ſo that there is not any affection we have, but it doth either <hi>primarily
or ſecondarily relate to God,</hi> but who can bewail the great deſolation that is now

loving of <hi>God,</hi> we love the <hi>world,</hi> we love our <hi>pleaſures</hi> rather then <hi>God;</hi> Inſtead
of <hi>hating of ſinne</hi> we hate <hi>God,</hi> and cannot abide his pure and holy Law and Nature:
Thus we fear not whom we ought to fear, <hi>viz.</hi> God, <hi>That can deſtroy both ſoul and

diſpleaſure of men, when we are to do our duties; Our <hi>ſorrow</hi> likewiſe is not that

never move within us. Thus our affections, out of all order to their proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
ought to be groaned under, more than if all our bones were out of joynt, for
that is only a bodily evil, hindring a natural motion, this is a ſpiritual one, depriving
us of our enjoyment of God. This particular pollution it is, that the Text doth
immediately drive at, when it commands us, <hi>To ſet our affections above,</hi> it plainly

was Chriſts divine power that made the <hi>woman bowed down with her infirmity for

God to raiſe up theſe affections that are crawling on the ground to heavenly
things; Poſſeſs then thy ſoul throughly with this great evil, that thou haſt not one

the ſuperiour part of the ſoul is affected with, the inferiour alſo doth receive, and
by this means the work of grace in the ſuperiour part is more confirmed and
ſtrengthned, and the heat below doth encreaſe the heat above: Thus you ſee

and inclining to thoſe things which are to be moſt abhorred by them; even as
the corrupt appetite in ſome perſons, delighteth to feed on traſh and moſt
offenſive matter to a found ſtomack. But</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, there are other <hi>objects</hi> which the Scripture doth allow
us to let our affections runne out about, and theſe are not evil in themſelves,
no more then to have affections is a ſinne: <hi>love</hi> in it ſelf is not a ſinne, neither
is <hi>love</hi> of <hi>husband, health,</hi> and ſuch comforts, but when we <hi>go beyond our bounds,
when theſe are loved more then God, or the love to them doth hinder and dead the
heart to holy things, then doth love become ſinfull and damnable:</hi> Now ſuch is the
original depravation of all the affections, <hi>That they cannot in a moderate and
well-regulated way, with ſubordination to God move to any lawful object, but
they do exceedingly tranſgreſs,</hi> and that many wayes. For</p>
                        <p>1. Whereas they ſhould be carried out to theſe lawful things <hi>only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to God, as the cheifeſt end, to love them, to deſire them, no otherwiſe then
thereby to be brought nearer to the end;</hi> we are apt to make them the end, to ſtay
there, to make a full ſtop at a <hi>Colon</hi> or <hi>Comma;</hi> Even as the children of <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi>
who deſired to take up their reſt in a country on this ſide <hi>Cannan,</hi> becauſe
it was a <hi>fruitfull place, and fit for cattel:</hi> Thus we who ſhould let our affections
ſtirre to theſe things only as a way to heaven, or meanes to bring us nearer
to God; <hi>we center in them,</hi> deſiring them for their own ſakes; It is a rule,
That the deſire of the end, is a rule to the deſire of meanes; we deſire drink to
ſatisfie thirſt, we deſire garments to cloath us, and we deſire no more then is
commenſurate to ſuch an end; and indeed thus it ought to be with us in our
affections to all things upon the earth, not to be affected with wealth, health,
learning, or any advantage any otherwiſe, then to be more enabled <hi>to do God
ſervice, and thereby to enjoy him;</hi> but as the dark night cannot be diſpelled till
the Sunne doth ariſe, ſo neither can the regulating and ordering of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(with ſubordination to God in lawful things) ever be accompliſhed till
ſanctifying grace doth interpoſe.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>We are apt in the affecting of theſe things to find more ſweetneſs and delight
in a ſenſible manner, then when our heart is turned unto God.</hi> The objects of
ſence do more affect us ſenſibly, then Chriſt laid hold on by faith, and the
Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſuppoſeth ſuch a proneneſs in us, when he ſaith, <hi>He that loveth
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57719:184"/>
not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how ſhall he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
1 Joh. 4. 20, Hence, it is that the Schooles have a diſtinction, about the love
of God <hi>appretiative</hi> and <hi>intentive;</hi> The former is, when in our judgement
we do <hi>more</hi> highly eſteem of God, then <hi>all</hi> the things of the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are ready to part with all (even life it ſelf) to pleaſe him: But the other,
they make to be a ſenſible paſſionate moving of the ſenſitive part, which is
(they ſay) very variable, according to the complexion and conſtitution of the
body; and therefore ſuch do adviſe, That believers ſhould not be diſcouraged,
if they cannot find ſuch ſenſible affections of love to God, as they do to their
freinds, or ſuch ſenſible ſorrow about ſinne, as they do about the loſs of a dear
freind; and this diſtinction may be received (in ſome ſence,) yet there, are
learned men that do greatly diſlike it, and do poſitively affirm, That <hi>appretia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi>
and <hi>intentively,</hi> both <hi>intellectually,</hi> and <hi>affectionately,</hi> we are to love God
and to delight in him: Certainly we find <hi>David</hi> acknowledging, <hi>That God
had put more joy and gladneſs in his heart, then they had, whoſe wine and oil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,</hi>
Pſal. 4. And when God doth require us, to <hi>love him with all our heart,
mind, and ſtrength,</hi> there is both the intellectual, and ſenſitive part of a man
underſtood. No doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of integrity would have found
his very affectionate part carried out to God, preemiently to all creatures,
ſeeing the affections were implanted only as Handmaids to wait on thoſe noble
parts of the ſoul; yea <hi>David</hi> (you heard) profeffing that his <hi>fleſh,</hi> as well as
his <hi>ſoul did long for the living God:</hi> Beſides, ſeeing the ſoul is the forme of a
man, thereby becometh ſuch a natural and eſſential union between the ſoul and
body, that what the ſpiritual part doth ſtrongly and ardently cloſe with, the
ſenſitive part by its eſſential ſubordination, doth find a proportionable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiveneſs
in the affections threof, even the waters from the hils do overflow
the valleys, though therefore the ſenſible part of a man be not abſolutely
ſubject to his will: (hence thoſe who have deſired ſenſible ſweetneſs, or melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teares in a bodily manner could not enjoy them, though they would give
a world for them) yet this we may conclude of, <hi>That whenſoever thy want of
ſenſitive affections doth ariſe from the want of powerfull impreſſions upon thy
ſpiritual part, and therefore thou canſt not find ſuch joy, or ſorrow, becauſe the
mind and will are not powerfully quickned by grace, this is alwaies a ſinne;</hi> if thy
mind were more enlightned, thy will more ſanctified, thy affections would be
more enflamed.</p>
                        <p>3. (Not to enlarge in this more) The affections are ſinful when carried
out even to lawful things, <hi>Becauſe thereby is retarded or ſtopt the current of
them after heavenly things:</hi> We ſee the Apoſtle; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, admirably preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
a diet to our affections, <hi>Thoſe that marry muſt be as if they married not;
Thoſe that weep as if they wept not,</hi> and ſo thoſe that <hi>rejoyce as if they rejoyced
not:</hi> Thus whatſoever affections we are allowed to have, they muſt not in the
leaſt manner diſtract or dull the motions of our ſoules to heavenly things,
but ſuch is our corruption, that our affections though to lawful things put
quite out, or (at leaſt) exceedingly hinder our affections to heavenly
things.</p>

now this kingdome is divided againſt it ſelf, our fear doth put out our joy;
we do not take that quiet delight which might be in having any temporal good,
becauſe we are ſo moleſted with feares leſt we ſhould looſe it; How often are
we diſtracted <hi>Inter ſpem &amp; metum,</hi> between hope and fear? Thus theſe affections,
that by their primitive inſtitution were all of one accord, they all mutually
aſſiſted one another, now they are become like contrary winds; hope driveth
one way, fear another; love one way, anger another; ſo that by this meanes
every man is miſerably tormented within himſelf: There is an <hi>heartquake</hi> as

all thy diſcontents, and all the turmoiles that are in thy ſoul; thy love
that haleth thee one way, thy anger draggeth another way; Thus thou
art like one that is to be torn in peices by wild horſes, one draweth one limb
aſunder, another teareth another part aſunder; ſo that thy ſoul is become

the Apoſtles complaint which he maketh <hi>Rom</hi> 7, to be nothing more then the
contrariety of the mind and affections in an unregenerate man, eſpecially when
the mind is legally convinced, and that hath ſome powerfull influence upon it,
and among other reaſons, he giveth this, that it would be very injurious to

incontinent perſon was, wheras indeed convinced of better things, but had no

power to follow them: But there is a two-fold conflict and combate to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
The firſt a <hi>natural one,</hi> betwen conſcience and affections; The other a
<hi>ſpiritual one,</hi> and that is <hi>not</hi> between theſe ſeveral powers in the ſoul, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>regenerate part in every particular, and the unregenerate,</hi> ſo that there
is not only ſpiritual light againſt corrupt affections, but affections ſanctified
againſt unſanctified ones, they have love againſt love, fear againſt fear, hope
againſt hope; This oppoſition in the regenerate man is univerſal, whereas this
natural conflict is ſeated only in ſome particular parts of the ſoul: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7, doth ſpeak of this ſpiritual fight in himſelf as regenerate, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
becauſe he ſaith, <hi>In the inward man he delighted in the Law of God,</hi> which
no unregenerate man can do; and although the Apoſtles and ſome other
eminent and godly men, may attain to farre higher degrees of greace then others,
yet it may not be thought, that there is any godly man living or did live that
doth not more or leſs find this combate of fleſh and ſpirit in him: Certainly,
if it ſhould be ſo in any man, we might ſay that in that man original ſinne was
quite ſubdued, the flux of bloud was wholly dried up in them, but that is the
prerogative of heaven. But our work is to conſider the ſad difference that is
now brought upon all men by original corruption, between the <hi>rational</hi> and
<hi>affective part,</hi> our very conſtitution is in diſcord, there is no more agreement
then between fire and water; Even as in the <hi>Romane</hi> Governement, there was
commonly perpetual oppoſition between the <hi>Senatus,</hi> and the <hi>Plebs,</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and the common People, they were very difficultly ever reconciled:
Thus in man, his intellectual and ſenſitive part they are carried out to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
objects, one inviting to one way, another to another: Indeed even the
<hi>rational</hi> part is in the Scripture ſence become <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is wholly corrupt and
mindeth only ſinful things, yet this corruption doth not put out thoſe natural
dictates and practical maxims which conſcience hath, againſt which the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men do naturally ſo rebell: It is true, that there are ſome who have
ſo hardned themſelves in evil, by a voluntary obſtinateneſs, and are made ſuch
bruits in their luſts, that they have none of this conflict at all they are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with all delight to ſinne, and have not ſo much as the leaſt regreet
within themſelves, but this is acquired partly by the juſt judgement of God
upon mans wilful impiety, being from him delivered up to ſuch a ſenſleſsnes,
otherwiſe there is in all ſuch a fundamental contrariety between the ſuperior
and inferior part of his ſoul, that there is no reſt within: It is true, the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
and ſo the <hi>Socinians</hi> they affirme his repugnancy to have been in <hi>Adam</hi> in the
ſtate of integrity, yea a <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> attributeth it blaſphemouſly to Chriſt
himſelf, but ſeeing <hi>that God made man right,</hi> this rectitude is to be underſtood
univerſal, and that could not be without an admirable harmony and agreement
between the ſpiritual and, ſenſitive part in a man: There are ſome alſo who
place the hurt that we have by original ſinne in this affectionate part only, as
if the mind and the will they did eſcape in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and no ſinne infected
them, only the ſenſitive part becomes all over poiſoned, but the contrary to
this hath already been demonſtrated; yet we grant that in the affectionate
part is the Serpents brood there are the Cockatrices eggs, that is the womb
wherein many ſinnes even all the bodily ones are conceived, and brought

becauſe theſe affections hurry the ſoul otherwayes? In Heaven, when we ſhall
enjoy God face to face, and the affections be fully ſanctified, then the heart will
not for one moment to all eternity be taken off from God; but now becauſe our
affections are not ſpiritualized, neither are we fully conquerours over them;
Hence they preſſe down continually the creature; for where a mans affections
are, there is his heart, there is his treaſure; The godly they do exceedingly
groan under this exerciſe of diſtractions in holy duties: Oh how it grieveth
them, that their hearts are not united, they cannot <hi>hoc agere,</hi> they cannot be

be, As affections do denote any paſſions, or imperfections intermixed with
them, ſo they cannot be attributed to him, who is the fountain of perfection,
yet becauſe the Scripture doth generally attribute theſe affections unto God, he
is ſaid to love, to grieve, to hope, to be angry: Hence it is that Divines do in
their Theological Tractates, beſides the attributes of God, handle alſo of thoſe
things, which are (as ſome expreſſe it) analogical affections in him; They treat
of his love, his mercy, his anger, which are not ſo properly Attributes in God,
as analogical affections; As when the Scripture ſaith, God hath eyes and hands,
theſe are expreſſions to our capacity, and we muſt conceive of God by thoſe
words according to the ſupream excellency that is in him: Thus it is alſo in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
There is an <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> in the later.
It was of old diſputed by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> Whether anger was truly and properly in
God? Some denied it, ſome affirmed it; But certainly the difference did ariſe
from the different uſe of the Word; for take anger, as it ſignifieth an <hi>humane
imperfection,</hi> ſo it cannot be ſaid to be in God, but as it is a <hi>Will to revenge</hi> an
impenitent ſinner, ſo it is in God; Hence theſe things are ſaid to be in God <hi>per
modum effectus,</hi> rather than <hi>affectus;</hi> And ſome learned men like this expreſſion
better than of analogal affections, ſaying that metaphorical ſpeech applied to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57719:186"/>
God (<hi>viz.</hi> about deſire, hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is rather equivocal then analogical, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
deſire, hope and fear in God: Some <hi>Arminianizing</hi> or <hi>Vorſtizing</hi> have
ſpoken dangerouſly: Yea ſome <hi>Socinians,</hi> as <hi>Crellius (Vide Horndeeck. Socin.
Confut. lib.</hi> 2.) doe poſitively maintain affections to be properly in God;
And although to mollifie their opinion, they ſometimes have fair explications of
themſelves, yet they grant the things themſelves to be in God, which we call affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
Hence they call them often, The commotions of Gods will, which are
ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe; Yea they are ſo impudent, as to ſay the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of ſuch affections in God, is to overthrow all Religion: But this opinion is
contrary to the pure ſimplicity and immutability of Gods Nature, as alſo to his
perfect bleſſedneſſe; and by the way obſerve the wickedneſſe of theſe Heretiques
who take from the Divine Nature, the perſons thereof, as alſo ſome glorious
Attributes, ſuch as Omniſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet will give to the ſame ſuch things,
as neceſſarily imply imperfection.</p>
                        <p>To return, Affections are not in God as they imply any defect, yet we are
by Scripture to conceive of ſome tranſcendent perfection in God eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

deformity that is upon our affections, the unlovelineſſe of them, if comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Rule; Do we <hi>love</hi> as God loveth? He doth infinitely love himſelf, and all
things in ſubordination to his own glory. But the love of our ſelves, and all
things in reference to our own ſelves, is that which doth moſt formally exclude
and oppoſe the love of God: The poiſon and ſinfulneſſe of all the affections doth
ariſe from the ſinfulneſſe of our love. It is <hi>corrupt love</hi> that cauſeth <hi>corrupt anger,
corrupt hatred, corrupt ſorrow,</hi> and therefore the way to crucifie all other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
is to begin with <hi>love:</hi> But oh the irreconcilable and immediate oppoſition
that is between our love, and his love, our love is to be copied out after his; We
are to imitate God in our love, but we place our ſelves in Gods room, and are
carried out to love our ſelves, <hi>not rationally,</hi> but according to a <hi>bruitiſh appetite.</hi>
as it were, hence <hi>whereas in the love of others, we require ſome preſuppoſed good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
in the love of our ſelves we look for none at all.</hi> The vileſt and moſt prophane
ſinner, who ought to judge himſelf worthy of the hatred of God and all creatures;
yet he doth intenſively love himſelf even to the hatred of God: Had we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
holineſſe, infinite purity and perfection as God hath, then we might love
our ſelves principally; but becauſe the goodneſſe we have is a rivolet from that
Ocean, a beam-line from that Sun, therefore we are to love our ſelves in reference
to God; Our love to God ſhould make us love our ſelves; but how impoſſible
and paradoxal is this to our corrupt natures? As our love is thus diſtantial from
Gods love, ſo our hatred and anger alſo is, for the hatred of God is only againſt
ſinne; It's ſinne he puniſheth, it is ſinne that he hath decreed to be avenged of
to all eternity; Wicked men and Devils are damned, becauſe of ſinne in them,
could that be taken out of their natures, they would be the good and acceptable
creatures of God: But oh the vaſt difference between Gods hatred and ours, for
that is not againſt ſinne, but that which is truly godly and holy; ſo deſperately

and (as ſome ſay) doth neceſſarily yeeld to the ultimate and practical Dictate
thereof, yet the will doth need a peculiar ſanctification of its own nature,
neither is the illumination of the mind all the grace the will wanteth; So it
is with theſe affections, although they be appointed to follow the directions and
commands of the mind and will, yet they muſt be ſanctified and enlivened by
the peculiar grace of God, elſe they move no more than a ſtone: Now this
neceſſity of enlivening and quickning grace upon the affections, the godly
are experimentally convinced of: How often doe they complain, they know
Chriſt is the chiefeſt good, they know eternal glory is an infinite treaſure?
Oh but how barren are their hearts, no affections, no cordial ſtirrings of
their ſoul when they think of theſe things? Doe the children of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of any thing more than their want of affections in holy things? They
have them as hot as fire for the things of the world, but are clods of earth
in ſpiritual duties; This maketh them cry ſo often with the Church, <hi>Draw us,
and we will runne after thee;</hi> This maketh them pray, <hi>Ariſe, O Southwind,
and blow O North, upon the garden of my ſoul, that the flowers thereof may
ſend forth a ſweet fragrancy;</hi> Thus that ſaying is true, <hi>Citò prevolat intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,
tardus ſequitur affectus:</hi> If therefore there were no other pollution upon
the affections, then their dulneſſe and ſenſleſneſſe as to holy things; This may
make the godly go bowed down all their life time; Their affections are green
wood, much fire and frequent blowing will hardly inflame them; and hence
it is that the godly are ſo well ſatisfied, and do ſo thankfully acknowledge
the goodneſſe of God to them, when they find their affections ſtirring in any
holy thing: Inſomuch that they judge that duty not worth the name of a duty,
which is not an affectionate duty; That prayer not worthy the name of prayer,
which is not an affectionate prayer; But how dull and heavy are theſe till ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as to any holy object; Yea, ſuch is the perverſe contrariety that is now
come upon the ſuperiour and inferiour parts of the ſoul, that when the more
noble parts are intenſively carried out to any object, the inferiour are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
debilitated and wholly weakned, ſo that many times the more light, the
leſſe heat; the more intellectual and rational, the leſſe affectionate; Now this
is contrary to our primitive creation, for then the more knowledge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57719:187"/>
things, the more affections alſo to them did immediately ſucceed: But
now experience doth confirme, That thoſe men whoſe underſtandings are moſt
deeply ingaged in finding out of truths, their affections are at the ſame time
like a barren wilderneſſe; Hence you may often find a poor inconſiderable belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more affectionately tranſported in love to Chriſt and holy things, than many
a great and learned Scholar; That as natural fools have a greater ſtomack to
meat, and can digeſt better than wiſe men, whoſe animal ſpirits are much
tired and wearied out; So it is here, the leſſe diſputative, the leſſe head-work
a godly man hath, many times he hath the better heart-work: Oh then
bewail this in thy ſelf as a moſt degenerating thing from primitive rectitude,
when thou findeſt thy knowledge, thy controverſal Diſputes dry up thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions!
So that truth is indeed earneſtly ſought after, but the goodneſſe of it
doth not draw out thy affections. When <hi>David</hi> commended the word of God
<hi>above the honey and the honey-comb,</hi> it was evident he found much experimental
ſweetneſſe of the power of it upon his affections.</p>

the Pollution of them.</head>
                        <p>THirdly, Herein alſo is apparent the original pollution of our affections,
<hi>That when they are moved and ſtirred up in any holy duties, yet it is not
a ſpiritual motive that draweth them out, but ſome corrupt or unlawfull reſpect.</hi>
Thus there is a world of guile and hypocriſie in our affections, we think it is the
love of God that affecteth us, when it is love to our ſelves, to our own glory,
to accompliſh our own ends: Thus in our ſorrow, we think it is for ſinne that
we grieve, when it is becauſe of temporal evil, or ſome outward calamity: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that this very conſideration of the hypocriſie and deceitfulneſſe of our
affections may be like an <hi>Abyſſe</hi> or deep to ſwallow us up, when the heart is ſaid
to be ſo <hi>deſperately wicked, and that none can know it but God;</hi> by that is meant
in a great part our affections: none knoweth the depths of his love, of his fear, of
his ſorrow; How often doth he bleſſe himſelf, when he finds theſe things mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in him, eſpecially in holy duties? Whereas (alas) it is not any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God, any heavenly reſpect moveth him, but ſome earthly conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or other: You may obſerve this in <hi>Jehu,</hi> what ardent and burning affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did he ſhew in the cauſe of God, deſtroying Idolatry, and executing the
judgements of God upon his enemies? But what moved his affections all this
while? It was not the glory of God, but ſelf-reſpects, ſelf-advancement: Oh
this is the treacherous deceitfulneſſe of our affections, we may find them very
ſtrong in preaching, in publick prayer with others, and the fire to them be onely
vain-glory! Yea our affections may be blown up with our own expreſſions and
delight in them; ſo that as it is a long while ere thou canſt get thy affections up to
any holy duty, ſo it is as difficult to ſearch out, What is the cauſe of them? Why
they riſe up? Thoſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. that would cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> did by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the word demonſtrate lively affections, yet they were ſuch whom
God would bid depart, as not knowing of them: Here therefore is the miſery of
man, that as all the ſpeculative knowledge in the world, unleſſe it be alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained
with an affectionate frame, doth not at all commend us to God, ſo all hot
and ſtrong affections do not preſently ſuppoſe the truth of grace within: Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth ſadly confirm this, that many who have had great affections and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of heart in the profeſſion of godlineſſe, have yet deſperately apoſtatized, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57719:188"/>
become at laſt a ſenſleſſe and as ſtupid about heavenly things, as any prophane
ones are: The <hi>Jews</hi> are ſaid for a while to rejoyce in <hi>Johns</hi> light, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. The
word ſignifieth more then ordinary affections, even ſuch as to make them trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
and leap for joy, yet this was but for a ſeaſon: So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. there are ſome
hearers, who yet had <hi>not root enough,</hi> that did <hi>receive the Word with joy.</hi> By theſe
inſtances it is plain, That our affections are full of deceit, full of falſhood, we know
not when to truſt them; It is hard to tell, what it is that draweth them out, even
in our holy duties; and if the godly (though in ſome meaſure regenerated) find
the power of this deceit upon their affections, certainly the natural man, he is all
over coſened, his affections are altogether a lie to him; he ſaith, he loves God
with all his heart; he ſaith, he is grieved for all his ſins, when all the while his
affections are moved from other reſpects.</p>

their way, then the godly can be in a true way, and the reaſon is, becauſe our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
have more ſutableneſſe with what is corrupt and falſe, then with what is true
and of God: Obſerve all the falſe religions that are in the world, may you not
admire at the zeal, at the pains they take for the propagation of their opinions,
how reſtleſſe they are? Which certainly may exceedingly ſhame the children of
the truth, that men ſhould be more active for the Devil, then they can be for God:
Our Saviour obſerved it of the <hi>Phariſees, how they compaſſed ſea and land to make
proſelytes;</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. <hi>He beareth them record

a wrong way, the more dangerous it is. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>in a good thing,</hi> Gal.4. 18. This he ſpeaketh, becauſe the falſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
did appear with a great deal of affection, none ſeemed to manifeſt ſuch paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
bowels to people as they did, but (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) they <hi>zealouſly affect you, but
not well;</hi> It is not from ſpiritual and heavenly motives that they are thus affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
towards you; Well then, this is ſadly to be bewailed, that our affections will
vehemently runne like a torrent down any falſe or erroneous way, whereas to that
which is truth indeed we can hardly raiſe them up. Wonder not then, if you ſee
the Papiſt in his ſuperſtitious way, the erroneous perſon in his falſe way to be ſo
full of affections and devotion in his perſwaſions; for (alas) it is eaſie falling
down the hill; error and ſuperſition is agreeable with the corrupt nature of man:
When we read what ſome <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Hermites</hi> have done in ſolitary places, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
themſelves, macerating their bodies, we may admire, how their affections
in that way could hold out ſo long, but mans heart like the earth will bring forth
nettles and weeds of it ſelf, but it cannot corn or flowers without diligent managing
of it. Let us then mourn for this evil that is come upon our affections, look upon
all the ſuperſtitious and falſe wayes in the world; See with what greedineſſe and
vehemency they are carried out to them; but as for thee, whom God preſerveth
in the truth, and keepeth in his wayes, thou art quickly weary in well-doing: Oh
be afraid, leſt all the pains and diligence of man in falſe wayes, do not riſe up to
condemn thee for thy ſlothfulneſſe in Gods wayes!</p>

becauſe the affections are firſt corrupted; theſe lye as <hi>Saul</hi>'s men did, all aſleep,
while his enemies had the opportunity to take away not only his ſpear, but his

to the true rule, for then the <hi>underſtanding</hi> did firſt apprehend and take

they immediately followed without any delay, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> had

<hi>Quicquid eſt in voluntate, prius fuit in appetitu ſenſitivo,</hi> whatſoever is in the
will was in the affections, and no wonder it is ſo now, ſeeing that the Devil did
bring ſinne into the world by beſeiging the affections at firſt, and thereby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the underſtanding; for as Satan did firſt tempt <hi>Eve</hi> the weaker veſſel,
and ſo beguiled <hi>Adam,</hi> whereupon the woman is ſaid to be <hi>firſt</hi> in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
ſo even in man, he did firſt begin with the affectionate part, the <hi>Eve</hi>
(as it were,) and by that did overcome the rational part which was like the
<hi>Adam; Eve</hi> then was tempted to ſinne, although ſhe had no corrupt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
within her, meerly becauſe the bait laid for her, was ſutable to her ſenſe
and affections: how much more then do affections like ſo many thieves open
all the doors, and let iniquity come in every where, when reaſon and grace
have no command over them. Sit down then and well conſider this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
That thy affections do firſt beatray thee, Thy ruin doth begin in them,
and therefore whoſoever would keep any ſinne from taking the Caſtle of the
ſoul, he muſt watch over his affections, he muſt be ſure to put out every ſpark
of their fire (as it were) <hi>Job</hi> made <hi>a covenant with his eyes,</hi> becauſe they
would quickly carry ſinne to the affections, <hi>Vt vidi, perii</hi> ſaid he, from ſeeing he
came to periſh, but that was from ſeeing he came to be affected with the object,
and ſo periſhed. This is notably expreſſed, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7. 20. 21, When <hi>Achan</hi> was tempted
to ſteal the Babyloniſh garment, he acknowledged that <hi>when he ſaw them,</hi> that
he coveted them, and coveting of them made him ſteal them; we may then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that there is ſcarce any ſinne committed by thee, but thy corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do begin it, the frame (as it were) is firſt laid there, all bodily ſinnes
of drunkenneſs and uncleaneſs; It is plain, that they are the product of ſinful
affections, ſinful love, ſinful deſires, ſinful joyes, and pleaſures are the puddle,
(as it were) wherein theſe vermin are bred: That as in muddy lakes, frogs,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57719:189"/>
and toads are produced, thus it is in theſe groſs and polluted affections, and it
is no wonder that theſe come out from the affections, ſeeing the ſinnes of the
more noble rational part are alſo procreated by theſe corrupt affections; <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies</hi>
and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> theſe are ſinnes of the underſtanding, yet they ariſe from
ſinful and inordinate affections; The ruſhes grow in ſuch miry places, men
ſeek after profit, applauſe, or other carnal advantages, and thus theſe are like
a bribe to blind the eies of wiſdome; ſo that it behooveth every one in the way
of Religion that he profeſſeth, to conſider, whether they be pure conſcientious
grounds, or corrupt affections that inſtigate therein: There are <hi>very few</hi> that
have the Scripture, lay the firſt ſtone in the building of their faith, their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have firſt cloſed with an opinion, their affections have ſecretly imbraced
ſuch a religious way, and then they go to Scripture to confirme it; Thus they
bring Scripture to their affections, not affections to Scripture, thus as any little
duſt doth quickly hinder the eie in ſeeing, ſo the leaſt corrupting of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons
doth obnubilate the underſtanding, and what the Sun and the Earth are in
the great world, the ſame is the ſenſitive part in man the little world, and
as their conſtant vapours and exhalations from the earth, do frequently cloud
the Sunne and deprive us of the comfortable light thereof, ſo here our affections
do continually aſcend like ſo many ſmoaking vapours, whereby we runne into
dangerous wayes: It is therefore a rare and a moſt bleſſed thing, when a man
is able to ſay, O Lord it was no affection, no paſſion, no corrupt intereſt hath
prevailed with me to take up this way, to forſake my former opinions, but the
powerful light of the Scripture ſhining into my heart: But theſe precious flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are hardly to be found, as affections corrupted do generally corrupt the
underſtanding in matters of faith, ſo alſo in matters of publique adminiſtration.
What is the reaſon of unjuſt Magiſtrates, of unjuſt Officers, that righteouſneſs
in places of judicatory is ſo often perverted, is it not becauſe affections do
judge, affections do determine, how many times doth the Law ſay one thing,
conſcience and righteouſneſs ſay one thing, but affections they cry another
thing: They were ſinful and wicked affections that put the High Preiſt and
Elders upon the condemning of Chriſt, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaw that they did it for envy,
and that is a compounded affection; hence are thoſe frequently commands to
all that are concerned in righteous adminiſtrations to have covetouſneſs, to
accept of no mens perſons, to do nothing for fear or favour; what doth this
ſignifie, but that all juſtice and righteouſneſs is perverted by ſinful affections,
ſinne is not puniſhed, offenders are not reſtrained, wholeſome Lawes are not
put in execution, becauſe men are carried by ſinneful affections: Therefore
in the Aereopagite Court, which was ſo famous for integrity, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
were reverenced like Oracles, all cauſes were pleaded in the night, in the
dark, that the Judge might not know who pleaded leſt his affection might be
pre-poſſeſſed, and here all their pleadings were to be without any Preface or
affectionate expreſſions, all which ſhew how hardly it is to be a righteous man
in his place, while affections are not conquered.</p>

not carried out to the moſt common and univerſal good, but to what is ſelfiſh
and particular, whereas if our affections did retain their primitive integrity,
they would have been in the firſt and moſt principal manner carried out to what

ruined, ſo as he have his ſelf-affections promoted, he mattereth not! This is that
which you have heard, that man in his Apoſtaſie from God did <hi>cadere à Deo
in ſeipſum,</hi> he fell from God into himſelf, and hereupon referreth the whole
world, even God himſelf to his own welfare, as if God were for him, and
he not made for God: It was not thus from the beginning; but as we ſee
in natural things, they all deny their particular motions to ſerve the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;
or as Philoſophers ſay about the Orbs, they are carried on by the
motion of the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> even contrary to their particular motions:
Thus it was alſo in the firſt conſtitution of man, yea better; for the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
had no private particular propenſity to any object, which the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
part did not direct unto: But oh the ſad change that now ſinne hath
made upon our affections in this particular, making them to monopolize all
things, and to preferre our ſelves more then the honour of God himſelf, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in two particulars we may greatly lament the ſinne of our private affections,
in oppoſition to publique.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The glory and honour of God is to be eſteemed by us, as infinitely more
worthy then all the world, then all Angels and men, and therefore not to be
affected to our ſelves more then that.</hi> It will eaſily be granted, That an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
good is to be preferred before a finite one, an univeſal illimited one
before what is particular, and limited, an ocean before a drop; Now ſuch
is God comparatively to man, yea to all the Nations of the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.
If then God be thus infinitely tranſcending us in goodneſſe, and our love is
to be drawn out according to the goodneſſe of the object; if a greater
good, then a greater love; if the greateſt good, then the greateſt love,
then it followeth that our affections are to be carried out infinitely more to
the honour of God, then to our own glory: If the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could
ſay to their King, becauſe a publique perſon, <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand
of us;</hi> How much more may we ſay to God, his glory, his honour, his
truth is worth all our eſtates, all our lives, yea ſuch ought to be our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to Gods honour, that we ought to preferre it above our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo although through the goodneſſe of God, his honour and our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ſo inſeparably joyned together, that one cannot be parted from the
other, yet in our mindes we are to eſteem of one above the other, Gods
glory above our own happineſſe; But the higheſt degree of grace in this
life doth hardly carry a man to this, much leſſe can nature elevate him thus
high.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond particular, wherein the privacy of our affections is to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is in reſpect of the publique good, we are not onely to preferre the glory of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57719:190"/>
God above our ſelves, but alſo <hi>The publique good of the Church, yea the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good of the Commonwealth above our particular advantages.</hi> What a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
demonſtration of this publique affection do we find in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
which may make us aſhamed of all our ſelf-affections? We have <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. where he deſireth to be <hi>blotted out of the book of

in his own particular, then have the general ruined; and when God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to make him a great name by conſuming the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he would not accept
of it; It was <hi>Tullie</hi>'s boaſt, That he would not accept of immortality it ſelf to
the hurt of the publique; but this was breath, and ſound of words only, <hi>Moſes</hi>
is real and cordial in what he ſaith. As for <hi>Paul</hi>'s publique affections to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

put men upon, and never plead that this is the caſe onely of ſome few, we cannot
charge all with this, for its only the ſanctifying or reſtraining grace of God that
keepeth in theſe paſſions of thine; ſhould God leave thee to any one affection,
as well tempered as thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to be, it would be like fire let alone in
combuſtible matter, which would preſently conſume all to aſhes, of thy own
ſelf, having nomore ſtrength than thy own, and meeting with ſuch temptations

they have upon our ſelves, <hi>but what they produce upon others alſo.</hi> They are
like a thron in the hedge to prick all others that paſſe by; Violent affections do
not only diſturb thoſe that are led away with them, but they do greatly annoy the
comfort and peace of others; The Prophet complained of <hi>living among ſcorpions</hi>

                        <p>LAſtly, <hi>In that they are ſo readily receptive of the Devils temptations.</hi> Herein
doth appear the pollution of them; The Devil did not more powerfully
poſſeſs the bodies of ſome men, then he doth the affections of men by nature; Are
not all thoſe deluſions in religious wayes, and in ſuperſtitious wayes, becauſe the
Devil is in the affections? Hath not the Devil exalted much error, and much falſ-worſhip
by ſuch who have been very affectionate? Many eminent perſons for a
while in Religion, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> have greatly apoſtatized from the truth, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too credulous to ſuch <hi>women who have great affections in Religion;</hi> So that it
is very ſad to conſider, how greatly our very affections in religious things may be
abuſed, how buſie the Devil is to tempt ſuch above all into errour, becauſe they
will do him the more ſervice; affections being among other powers of the ſoul
like fire among the elements; They are the Chariot-wheels of the ſoul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more danger of them, if running into a falſe way. The Devil hath his
falſe joy, his falſe ſorrow, and by theſe he doth detain many in falſe and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

falſe teachers, how buſie they are to pervert women, as being more affectionate,

which we have by nature, and handled them in this order
(though the Doctrine about the ſinfulneſſe of the <hi>Imaginative

connexion with the will, belonging to the <hi>appetitive part</hi> of a
man.</p>
                        <p>The next ſeat of original ſinne in man I ſhall conſider of, is the <hi>Fancy,</hi> which
we ſhall find to be inſtrumental to great iniquities, becauſe in it ſelf it is polluted
ſinfully. To which truth this Text will give in a full and pregnant teſtimony.</p>
                        <p>To open which you muſt underſtand, that we have here related the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of
that univerſal and dreadfull judgement which God brought upon the whole
world; The cauſe was that univerſal and deſperate wickedneſſe, whereby all fleſh
had corrupted their wayes; The long-ſuffering of God would bear no longer,
eſpecially they being ſo often admoniſhed by <hi>Noah the preacher of righteouſneſſe:</hi>
Thus the general actual impieties every where abounding on the face of the earth,
is the <hi>proxim</hi> and immediate cauſe of drowning of the world.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>remote</hi> and mediate cauſe, which is internal, and that
is, the univerſal ſinfulneſſe of every mans heart by nature, which is alwayes
emptying it ſelf into ſinfull thoughts and luſts, ſo that it is never quiet, or like a
fountain ſealed up, but diffuſing it ſelf into poiſonous ſtreams; There are always
ſparks flying out of this furnace.</p>
                        <p>Now this natural pollution is deſcribed in the moſt emphatical manner that
can be.</p>
                        <p>There are ſome who complain, that we are too tragical in explaining the nature
of original ſinne, that we aggravate it too much; but if we conſider the ſcope
of the holy Ghoſt in this place, we will eaſily be perſwaded that none can ſay
enough in this particular. For</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="349" facs="tcp:57719:191"/>
1. Here is the <hi>heart</hi> ſaid to be <hi>evil,</hi> that which is the very life of man, and is the
fountain of all actions and motions; Not the <hi>eyes</hi> or the <hi>tongue,</hi> but the <hi>heart,</hi>
which is the whole of man, which implieth alſo, that he ſinneth not by example
and outward temptation only, but from an inward principle.</p>
                        <p>2. In this <hi>heart</hi> that is ſaid to be evil, which we would think is not capable of
ſinne, at leaſt of very little, the <hi>thoughts,</hi> not onely the affections, or the will,
the appetitive parts of the ſoul, but the ſublime and apprehenſive.</p>
                        <p>3. He doth not only ſay the <hi>thoughts,</hi> but the <hi>imagination,</hi> the very firſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and framing of them: It is a Metaphor from the Potter who doth frame his
veſſels upon a wheel in what ſhape he pleaſeth: Thus the heart of man is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſhaping and effigiating ſome thoughts or other: Now theſe are not onely
ſinfull when formed, and it may be conſented unto, but the very firſt faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, even as they riſe immediately from the heart are ſinfull: If we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
it as others do, who obſerve this word ſignifieth to frame a thing with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
art and induſtry, then it aggravateth likewiſe, informing of us, that thoſe
thoughts which are poliſhed by us in the moſt accurate manner they are altogether
evil.</p>
                        <p>4. Here is the <hi>Vniverſality, Every Imagination;</hi> In thoſe millions and milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thoughts which ariſe in a man, like the motes in the air, there is not one
good thought, <hi>all and every imagination.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Here is not onely the extenſion of this ſinne to every thought, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
likewiſe, <hi>It is onely evil,</hi> there is no good at all in it; Godly men in their
beſt actions have ſome ſinfulneſſe adhering to them; There is ſome water in their
beſt wine, but here is all droſſe and no gold at all, <hi>only evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of it from the <hi>perpetuity;</hi> It is thus <hi>only evil,
and that continually;</hi> Thus the holy Ghoſt, which is truth it ſelf repreſents our
Blackmore natures to humble and debaſe man, as alſo to juſtifie God under any
effects of his wrath and vengeance that he may bring upon us; How wretched
then are the attempts of ſome Writers, who lay out the utmoſt of their power
and wit, to make this ſinne nothing at all, (as Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> and as <hi>Papiſts</hi>)
or to have very little guilt in it? If you ſay, This Text ſpeaketh of actual ſinnes,
of evil imaginations, I grant it, but as flowing from original pollution, it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of bitter fruit, but as flowing from that bitter root within; And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

the Scripture uſe to ſpeak of this ſinne commonly, as putting it ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

immediate evil motions; becauſe though original ſinne be not <hi>peccatum</hi>

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
yet it is <hi>peccatum actuoſum</hi> (as hath been ſaid;) It is an <hi>acting,</hi> and an <hi>active
ſinne,</hi> though not actual. <hi>Pererius</hi> would evade this Text by having it to be an
<hi>hyperbole,</hi> or elſe to be true only of ſome particular wicked men, the Gyants in
thoſe dayes; As for the <hi>hyperbole,</hi> which both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> ſo often flie
unto, when the Scripture doth intend to exagerate this ſinne, we ſhall eaſily in
time convince of the falſhood and vanity of ſuch an exception.</p>
                        <p>And as for the ſecond particular, we will readily grant, That the <hi>actual</hi> impiety
of all men generally was exceedingly <hi>heightned,</hi> ſo that this gave the occaſion to
mention that <hi>internal</hi> corruption which is upon all mankind, but yet we muſt
neceſſarily ſay, that beſides thoſe <hi>actual</hi> impieties, <hi>original ſinne</hi> is alſo aimed at
as being the <hi>cauſe</hi> of them; for the ſcope of <hi>Moſes</hi> is to give an univerſal cauſe
of that univerſal judgement; ſeeing therefore the deluge drowned <hi>Infants</hi> as
well as grown perſons, and they could not be guilty of <hi>actual</hi> impieties, it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the native pollution they were born in, was the cauſe of their deſtruction;
and indeed original ſinne did greatly aggravate thoſe actual wickedneſſes, for
hereby was demonſtrated the incurableneſs of their natures; No patience, no
mercy would do them any good; for they are not only evil, but their hearts the
fountain of all was evil likewiſe, and then how could grapes ever grow from
ſuch thorns? Neither may we limit it, (as ſome would) to particular great
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57719:192"/>
ſinners, who then lived, becauſe <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 21. we have the ſame ſentence in effect
repeated, when yet the wicked men of the world were deſtroyed, when thoſe
eight perſons onely were alive and preſerved, God giveth this character of mans
nature. Beſides, it is ſpoken <hi>indefinitely,</hi> the imagination of <hi>mans heart,</hi> not of
thoſe men, or of ſuch particular men.</p>
                        <p>Why this very reaſon ſhould be uſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. that God would not deſtroy
the world any more, which is in this Text brought for the deſtruction of it, is to
be ſhewed when we come to treat of the effects of original ſinne.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, Let us conſider what a late Writer (Doctor <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi> of
Repent. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.) who uſeth to ſharpen his weapons at the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> forges, the
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> and commonly the worſt of them, as alſo the <hi>Socinians,</hi> with whom
we reckon <hi>Grotius,</hi> from theſe (I ſay) he delivereth his poiſonous aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt, It is pretended,</hi> That the Scripture maketh this their own fault, and not
<hi>Adam</hi>'s becauſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. it is ſaid, All fleſh had corrupted his way upon the
earth. <hi>But</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is very feeble and weak, for it is willingly acknowledged, that the increaſe
of actual wickedneſs was the <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>proxime</hi> cauſe of this general judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had not their iniquities in that age riſen higher, and cried louder for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
then ordinarily ſinne did, we may conceive God would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to ſuch an unheard of, and extraordinary judgement: Therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.
it is ſaid, <hi>God ſaw the wickedneſſe of man was great in the earth;</hi> The Hebrew
word comprehends both the greatneſs in <hi>quantity,</hi> it was exceedingly multiplied
as alſo in <hi>quality;</hi> They were enormous ſinnes, all this the Text is clear for, but
this is not all; The Text goeth higher, to aggravate theſe impieties from the
<hi>fountain,</hi> which is a corrupt nature, even as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. doth heighten his
actual wickedneſs from the ſinfull nature he was born in; Therefore both <hi>actual</hi>
ſins, as the fruit and <hi>original</hi> ſinne as the root, is here made the cauſe of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
judgement.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond Exception, to which the third may be adjoyned, is,</hi> That this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is ſuppoſed by thoſe who hold it to be natural and unavoidable, and therefore
God could no more puniſh mankind for that, then for ſleeping or being hungry; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>Anſwer this, Here is either groſſe ignorance, or elſe a wilfull miſtake about
the word <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>unavoidable:</hi> We grant it to be natural and unavoidable in
ſome ſenſe, but not in that which he taketh it, as if it were natural like ſleep or
hunger, which are not culpable, or have any guilt in them; But of this largely
in its time, becauſe the Adverſaries do uſually in an odious manner repreſent this
inevitableneſſe of ſinning unto their Reader, though we ſay voluntarily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at firſt, and ſeem much to triumph in it.</p>
                        <p>As for the other addition <hi>[Eight perſons were excepted]</hi> It is anſwered, That
thoſe who were godly then, and eſcaped that judgement, they were delivered
from the dominion and guilt of this original ſinne, and therefore it being pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, though the remnants in ſome meaſure continued in them, they were
not involved in this judgement.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, What ignorance is manifeſted in ſaying, <hi>[It muſt be reſpect of perſons]</hi>
If God amongſt thoſe that were equally guilty ſpared ſome, and rejected others;
For he may learn out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers, <hi>That reſpect of perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in matters of liberality and munificence, for where that is, there
is ſome juſtice and debt ſuppoſed.</hi> Now if God had not ſaved any one man,
more then any apoſtate Angel, I ſuppoſe he would not have charged God with
in juſtice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly, It is queſtioned,</hi> If it were the natural corruption God complained of,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57719:192"/>
Why did he it but thus, as if it were a new thing?</p>
                        <p>It is anſwered, The though original corruption was in all mankind, as ſoon as
ever the Image of God was loſt, and therefore <hi>Seth</hi> is ſaid to beget his ſonne
after his own likeneſs ſinfull and mortal, yet becauſe it did not break out into
thoſe violent torrents of iniquity before, as it did at this time; Hence it was that
God did more ſeverely take notice of it, as putting it ſelf forth in ſuch bitter
effects.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly, It is objected,</hi> That <hi>Noah</hi> the Preacher of righteouſneſſe was
ſent to draw the world off from that which was likely to deſtroy it, but
no man can think, he would dehort them from being guilty of original
ſinne.</p>
                        <p>To this we alſo anſwer, That as for being guilty of original ſinne in our birth,
and how that can be our ſinne, then, when we were not capable of a precept, I
have at large treated of it, and ſo ſhall not <hi>actum ager<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </hi> as alſo how farre ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne is to be repented of; Onely to the preſent Objection we ſay, That
though the Miniſtry be not to hinder us from being born in ſinne, yet it is to be
inſtrumental in working our Regeneration (which great gift of God thoſe that
deny original ſinne muſt alſo neceſſarily deny) which is a ſubduing and mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of original ſinne in ſome degree, and is a renovation of all thoſe parts which
original ſinne had corrupted; For Regeneration (<hi>John</hi> 3.) is proved neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
from the ſuppoſition of original ſinne, <hi>Whatſoever is born of the fleſh is

                        </p>
                        <p>The Text then thus vindicated from corrupt gloſſes, for the imagination and
devices of many men, though learned, have been very evil, and that continually
in the interpretation of it; I ſhall only adde this, That although by the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

yet becauſe the imaginative power or phantaſie in a man, is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubſervient to the underſtanding in its operations, and is therefore called <hi>ratio

and immaterial faculties of the ſoul, as alſo beſides the external ſenſes, there are
<hi>internal material ſenſes,</hi> about the number whereof they greatly diſſent; Some
make five, The <hi>Common Senſe, the Phanſie, the Imaginative Power the Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and the <hi>Memory;</hi> Others there; Others four; Some but one; only it may ſeem many, becauſe of the ſeveral manners of operation; It is not worth the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57719:193"/>
while to conteſt herein; it is enough to know that there is in man ſuch a power,
whereby he doth imagine and fancy things, witneſs thoſe dreams which uſually
riſe in our ſleep: The uſe of this imagination is to preſerve the <hi>ſpecies</hi> ſuggeſted
to order them, and judge of them, and thereby is neceſſary to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
according to that Rule, <hi>Oportet intelligentem phantaſmata ſpeculari;</hi> And
certainly, The power of God is admirably ſeen in this imaginative faculty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in men or beaſts; For how do birds come ſo artificially to make their neſts,
and the Ants and Bees to be ſuch admirable provident, creatures in their kind, but
from that natural inſtinct in them, whereby their phanſies are determined to ſuch
things? So it is from this imagination that the Sheep is afraid of a Wolf, though
it never ſaw one before; eſpecially in man his imagination being perfect, there
are many admirable things about the nature of it, which, when learned men have
ſaid all they can, they muſt confeſs their ignorance of; onely you muſt know,
that as the affections are very potent in a man, to turn him this way or that way,
ſo alſo is the imagination and fancy of a man; Inſomuch that it is a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to have a ſanctified fancy, that is commonly in men, the womb wherein
much iniquity is conceived. It is greatly diſputed in Philoſophy, <hi>What the power
and ſtrength of imagination is.</hi> Some have gone ſo farre as to attribute all mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
whether Divine or Diabolical to the ſtrength of imagination: Yea <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardus</hi>
his poſition was, That <hi>fides</hi> was <hi>eſtimatio,</hi> Faith was nothing but a ſtrong
fancy, but theſe are abſurd; Onely it is granted, that ſome ſtrong impreſſions it
may make on the party himſelf, as alſo on the fruit of the womb in conception:
As for <hi>Jacob</hi>'s art of laying parti-coloured ſticks before ſheep, when they came to
be watered, that in the time of gendring they might bring ſuch coloured lambs,
though imagination might be ſomething conducible thereunto, yet rather aſcribe
this (with ſome learned men) to a miracle, and the peculiar bleſſing and power
of God towards <hi>Jacob.</hi> But I ſhall not hold you any longer here, let us proceed
to the diſcovery of the natural ſinfulneſs thereof.</p>

                        <head type="sub">The Natural Sinfulneſſe of the Imagination appeares, in making
Idols, daily Supports, and vain Conceits, whereby it pleaſeth
it ſelf.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, <hi>The metaphorical expreſſion in the Text doth fully declare it;</hi> For as the
Potter doth make veſſels upon the wheel daily, or as ſome explain it, as the
Artificer doth of his wood and other materials make Idols, which he worſhippeth
as gods, though they be vanities; <hi>Thus the imagination of man doth daily fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
ſuch fancies and Idols to it ſelf, making gods of them, and putting confidence
therein;</hi> And if you obſerve what riſeth daily in the heart of a man devoid of
grace, you ſhall find, <hi>That it is a continual Idol-maker, it maketh daily puppets
and vain conceits, whereby it pleaſeth it ſelf, and accounteth it ſelf happy therein.</hi>
Thus we ſee what ſhops (as it were) our hearts are; The imagination having
that ſinfull artifice, as to make and erect <hi>Idols all the day long;</hi> Even as children
naturally delight to make babies, and then to play with them, ſo do all men by
nature; How many vain Idols do the ambitious men, the unclean men of the
world daily build up in their fancies? Hence it is that the glorious things, the
pleaſant things they pleaſe themſelves with, are <hi>more</hi> in the <hi>imagination</hi> then in any
<hi>real poſſeſſion,</hi> as is more to be dilated upon: In the mean while let us ſadly mourn
under this horrible corruption of the imaginative part of a man, that it ſhould
be daily making new gods, continually erecting Idols, in which we are apt to put
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57719:193"/>

wherein it only fabricateth evil; and a ſhop of <hi>vertue,</hi> wherein it imagineth
good things; but what can be directly to confront a Text, and to put the lie
upon it, if this be not? Let us then be willing to be found out in all this evil;
Let us acknowledge, that our imagination doth continually ſet up vanities,
Idols; we make to our ſelves gods, and ſo leave the only true God.</p>
                        <p>We have made ſome entrance already upon the diſcovery of that wound and
deadly blow the imaginative power of man hath received by original ſinne;
and wonder not if in the managing of this point, we often mention <hi>thoughts,
diſcourſe, invention</hi> and <hi>apprehenſions,</hi> attributing theſe to the Imagination;
for although the underſtanding be properly the power of the ſoul, from whence
theſe operations do proceed; yet becauſe (as you have heard) the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

dependance on it, ſo that it is hard to know or perceive when ſome <hi>internal
parts</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> are the <hi>operations</hi> of the <hi>fancy,</hi> or of the mind; Though indeed
ſometimes reaſon doth correct our imaginations, even as they do ſenſe: Yea
Divines and Philoſophers do commonly attribute ſome kind of opinion, and
judgement, yea imperfect diſcourſe unto it; and this difference is given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>common internal ſenſe</hi> and the <hi>imagination:</hi> The common ſenſe doth
<hi>receive the ſimple impreſſions of things,</hi> as of a ſtone, of bread, as the <hi>wax</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the impreſſion of a <hi>ſeal,</hi> not the <hi>ſeal</hi> it ſelf, but the image of it; Thus doth
the common ſenſe receive the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things, and retaineth them; But the

                        <p>SEcondly, <hi>In reſpect of its defect from that end and uſe, which God did intend
in the Creation of man by making him with this imaginative power.</hi> We
muſt readily yeeld, that as God did ſhew his wonderfull wiſdome and power
in making of man, which the Scripture often obſerveth, comparing the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
of our body, to the curious needle work of ſome ſkilfull woman,</hi> Pſal. 139.
15. ſo all theſe powers and parts of the ſoul were made for ſingular and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
uſe, and therefore the <hi>imagination</hi> as well as the reſt; yea we are to
know, that in all thoſe viſions and dreames by which God did appear to the
Prophets and others, it was by exciting and working upon their <hi>imagination;</hi>
ſo that God hath exceedingly honoured that part of the ſoul in this way. The
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57719:194"/>
uſe of this imaginative power, is two-fold, as of the other ſenſes; The one
<hi>proxime</hi> and <hi>immediate,</hi> which is to performe their operations for which they
were given to men; The other remote and more general, which is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to the ſalvation of the ſoul, and alſo to the glorifying of God;
For by the imagination we are to glorifie God, as well as by other parts of ſoul
and body; The former end of the imagination, I may call <hi>naturall;</hi> The later,
<hi>morall;</hi> I ſhall not ſpeak of the former, becauſe whatſoever defect is now upon
the fancy in that way, not being able to do its office, as at firſt Creation, it is
meerly <hi>penall,</hi> a puniſhment, and not ſo much our ſinne; Thus, that men are
ſubject to <hi>madneſs</hi> in their fancy, that the imagination by any diſtemper in the
organ, where it is fixed, may be wholly perverted, as we ſee in ſeavers, and
in phrenſies, and ſometimes in dying men; This is not ſo much a ſinne in the
fancy, as a puniſhment, even as death is inflicted upon us, becauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
tranſgreſſion. It is true, that <hi>Adam,</hi> though created with full and perfect
knowledge in naturals and ſupernaturals that was neceſſarily required to his
bleſſedneſs, yet as <hi>Suarez</hi> well determineth, (<hi>De Creatione homines lib. 3. cap.</hi> 9)
in the uſe of his knowledge he had recourſe to <hi>phantaſmes</hi> in the <hi>imagination,</hi>
becauſe that is a natural way to the ſoul, while joyned to the body, only in
that ſtate, as the organ was not ſubject to any bodily diſtempers, ſo neither
could his imagination any way erre; but the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> hath not
onely brought on that part an obnoxiouſneſs to many bodily diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
but filled it alſo with ſinnefulneſs, which is eminently ſeen in its aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from that two-fold main end it was at firſt beſtowed on us for: The one
whereof is, the ſalvation of our ſouls; for if the ſence of hearing the Word of
of God, and of ſeeing the wonderfull works which God hath wrought, be
ſo greatly inſtrumental to our ſanctification, why ſhould not the imagination
much more? but who may not complain what an impediment and hinderance
his fancy is to his ſouls good, it imagines evil and vanity, it is wholly pleaſed
with empty and vain things, neglecting the true ſolid good, ſo that there is no
man that is acquainted with the frame of his ſoul, but may groane under the
ſinful unrulineſs of his imagination, eſpecially (as is to be ſhewed) in holy and
religious approaches to God; When all the powers ſhould be united in one
way, then what ſwarmes of roaring imaginations? What importunate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
fancies are ready to fill thy ſoul, as flies ſometimes did <hi>Egypt?</hi> Was
it thus in the ſtate of Creation? Did God create us with ſuch fickle confuſed
and erratique imaginations? how greatly would it diſhonour God to affirm
ſo? Affect thy heart therefore greatly with this, to think that that which
was ſo exceedingly conducible to thy ſouls happineſs, is now ſuch an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and enemy thereunto. It is a corrupt licentious opinion, which <hi>Speran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>
(though a Papiſt) attributeth to ſeveral famous Schoolmen, <hi>viz. That a
man is not bound to repell an evil thought, if there be not danger of conſent to it,

that it is there:</hi> but this is juſtly called by the foreſaid Author, (<hi>Spiranza ſcrip.

block and ſcandal to ſouls, neither may our ſinfull imaginations greatly humble
us, if this were true. And as for the other end, which is <hi>to glorifie God;</hi>
Wherein hath God been more diſhonoured then by the imaginations of men?
Whence hath that <hi>Idolatry</hi> filled the whole world? How come ſuperſtitious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical

and that in their high profeſſion of wiſdome, yet ſaith, <hi>They became

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57719:194"/>
of man hath cauſed all the Idolatry of the world; They have not gone to
God as revealing himſelf in the Word by faith, but according to their natural
light, by carnal and groſs imaginations; whereas therefore Images were
brought into the Church at firſt, that they might be (as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaid) <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
mens <hi>Books;</hi> the truth is, they did teach, and confirme in erronious ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
for from ſuch pictures do ignorant people ſtill conceive of God, as
an old man, and of the Holy Ghoſt as a Dove, they imagining ſuch things,
as theſe Images do repreſent. The imagination then of man doth ariſe unto an
high degree of impiety, when it will fancy or conceive of God without the
guide of the Scripture; if ſo be the underſtanding cannot comprehend this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Eſſence, how much leſs can our imagination? if he ſaid <hi>Quinquid de Deo dici poteſt, eo ipſo eſt indignum, quia dici poteſt;</hi> and, <hi>Tunc Deum digne eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
cum ineſtimabil indicimus:</hi> If I ſay he be thus above the higheſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations
of our minds, no wonder if he infinitely tranſcend our imaginations.
It is an evaſion that ſome Papiſt hath, (as I have read, though I cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where for the preſent) when preſſed with this Argument, that it is a great
diſhonour to God, and full of reproach to his Majeſty, to repreſent him under
ſuch external formes and ſhapes, he would (I ſay) evade by inſlancing in the
imagination, as a natural faculty in the ſoul; The underſtanding cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
of God, but by the imagination, and the imagination doth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
receive Images and repreſenteth <hi>ſpecies</hi> about God; otherwiſe we cannot
at all think of him, and yet this is no Idolatry. But</p>
                        <p>Firſt it may be anſwered, Theſe formes and repreſentations in the fancy,
when we think of God, ariſe from the natural conſtitution of man, ſo that it
cannot be avoided; It doth ariſe from our finite and corporeal nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
nothing can come into the underſtanding before it hath been in the ſenſe
and the imagination, but their Images and Idols are external groſs and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
ſet up to worſhip God by. And</p>
                        <p>Again, Howſoever ſuch ſhapes and formes may come into the imagination
of man about God, yet it's the duty of the underſtanding to expel them, and
to conceive of God without any corporeal forme, as a Spirit of infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſly,
and therefore the imagination muſt not guide the underſtanding, but the
underſtanding lead the imagination, that ſo we may not have the leaſt thought
about God, but what becometh his glorious being: but of this more in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
by it ſelf, becauſe of its gret concernement. Thus we ſee how the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
is wonderfully defective <hi>from its main end,</hi> both in reference to Gods
glory, and mans own ſalvation and happineſs.</p>

the ſinfulneſs of it is continual, as the eie is alwayes twinkling: Is there a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

The will, the mind, they only ſinne at that time, <hi>this fancy is many times very
ſinful in the night time;</hi> how many polluted and wicked dreames do men fall into
at ſuch a time, at which they tremble and abhorre themſelves when awakened?
Thus though all ſleep, yet ſinne doth not, but liveth and acteth in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57719:195"/>
But of the ſinfulneſs of dreames by the corrupt imagination, more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:
Only for the preſent let us humble our ſelves under the perpetual
and inceſſant motion of our ſinful fancy, there being no hour or moment
wherein we are free from the corrupt ſtirrings thereof: If there could be a
breathing time or a reſpite from ſinne, this would at leaſt leſſen the damnable
guilt thereof, but to be daily minting and faſhioning corrupt imaginations
without any intermiſſion; how heavily ſhould it preſſe us down, and make
us to judge our ſelves worſe then beaſts, yea equal to the apoſtate Angels in
perpetuity of ſinning? For whereas it is ſaid, that in this particular mans wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
is not ſo great as the Devils, becauſe the Devils ſinne continually, they
neither ſlumber or ſleep, as God who keepeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth not; ſo neither they
who oppoſe <hi>Iſrael;</hi> The Devil doth vent his enmity, and never hath any ſtop
therein by any natural impediment. Now whereas in man by reaſon of ſleep,
there is to be a natural intermiſſion and interruption of evil, the imagination
being corrupted, doth thereby keep the fire of ſinne, like that of hell from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>SIxthly, <hi>The impertinency and unſeaſonableneſs of thy imagination,</hi> this is alſo
to be bewailed: Indeed the unregenerate man findeth no load or burden here,
therefore if theſe weeds choak up all the corn, if ſinful imaginations fill his heart
full all the while that religious duties are performing, he never mattereth it,
he had rather his heart ſhould be full of dung and earth, then of pearles, he is
more deſirous that his ſoul ſhould be fraughted with pleaſing imaginations,
then attentive to thoſe things that are ſpiritual and heavenly. But oh the ſad
complaints the people of God make in this particular, the unſeaſonableneſs of
their fancy in heavenly approaches to God, commonly in religious duties more
then at any other time do roving imaginations obtrude themſelves, which even
the children of God can no more hinder, then the birds flying in the air: This
is the ſad temptation that you have moſt of Gods people exerciſed with, and for
redemption out of this bondage they do earneſtly pray to God, but as long as
the ſoul though ſanctified is thus joyned to the body, and acts dependently upon
the organs thereof, it cannot be otherwiſe, but as when a ſtone caſt into the
water maketh one circle, and that maketh another: This it is in mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
one fancy cauſeth another, and that another, whereby the ſoul is ſcarce
ever quiet in any duty, but theſe phantaſmes lie knocking at the door, and do
breed great diſturbance; and which is ſaddeſt of all, the Devil (as is to be
ſhewed) doth uſually at ſuch times caſt in his fiery darts, his blaſphemous injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do oftentimes violate the ſoul; ſo that in ſtead of drawing nigh to God, it is
filled with doleful and terrifying imaginations.</p>

                        <p>SIxthly, <hi>Herein doth the ſinfulneſſe of it appear, that it doth eclipſe, yea for the
moſt part exclude and keep out the underſtanding, which is the more noble light,
and to which it ought to be ſubſervient, ſo that men (whether in religions or civil
affairs) are more led by</hi> fancy <hi>then by</hi> reaſon, <hi>there imagination is more predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
then the underſtanding.</hi> It is with man the little world, as the great world,
God made in this two great lights, the Sunne and Moon, one to rule in the day,
the other in the night: Thus man hath two lights created in him, which are to
direct him in all his operations; the Sunne that is the Underſtanding, the Moon is
like the Imagination, which giveth a glimmering light, and that onely in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and corporeal things. Now as it would be an horrible confuſion in the world,
if the Moon ſhould ſhut out the Sunne, and take upon it to rule in the day time
all the light the Moon hath (let it be ſuppoſed it hath ſome of its own) would
not ſuffice to make a day: Thus it is in man, his fancy which hath not light enough
to guide him in his actions to his true end, yet that uſurpeth upon the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and doth in effect command all: Thus the inferiour light prevaileth over
the ſuperiour: Oh what groaning ſhould the new creature be in, till it be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this bondage: See then to thy ſelf, and examine all things that paſſe
through thy ſoul more narrowly and exactly. It may be thy imagination is the
cauſe of all thy Religion, of all thy opinions; It may be it is not <hi>faith</hi> but <hi>fancy;</hi>
It may be it is not <hi>conſcience,</hi> but <hi>imagination</hi> that inſtigateth thee; Thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<hi>me thinks,</hi> and <hi>I imagine ſo,</hi> are not high enough, or becoming thoſe
glorious actings of faith in the ſoul, which the Apoſtle calleth <gap reason="foreign">

apparitions that are made in the air, as the Rain-bow, which hath no real ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency;
and truly ſuch are the conceits and apprehenſions many have in Religion
and Piety; They are not of a ſolid, true, and well-grounded knowledge, but are
like meteors in the air: Thus do their opinions flie up and down in their head.
We may obſerve it a very ordinary thing in controverſies and polemical writings,
that both parties will often charge one another with their fancies and their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
that there is no ſuch thing in Scripture or in reaſon, but a figment in the
brain; Yea the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> call this very Doctrine of original ſinne,
<hi>Auguſtini figmentum, Auſtin</hi>'s fancy, as if it were an evil imagination to hold,
That <hi>the thoughts and imaginations of the heart are only evil, and that continually.</hi>
Thus you ſee in what confuſion we are in, when ſometimes the ſolid Doctrine of
the Scripture is traduced for a meer imagination; And again, meer fancies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
and earneſtly contended for, as ſundamental pillars of Religion and
Piety. Seeing then our imaginations are ſo apt to get into the chair of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and as <hi>Athaliah</hi> deſtroyed the ſeed royal, that ſhe might reign; ſo fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
bolteth out all ſolid reaſons and arguments, that it alone may do all, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
us the more to watch over our hearts in this reſpect, and to be ſure they are
the ſolid works of faith, and not the fickle motions of the fancy that do guide
thee, and the rather, becauſe it is the perpetual cuſtome of wicked and ungodly
men, to brand and ſtigmatize both the true faith and all ſolid piety with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of a meer <hi>fancy.</hi> Do not <hi>Papiſts, Arminians, Socinians,</hi> and the like,
exclaim againſt the Proteſtant Doctrine, as if it were but an Idol of <hi>Calvins</hi> and
<hi>Luthers</hi> making, when they condemned the bleſſed Martyrs to burn at the ſtake,
they concluded ſuch ſuffered but for their fancies and their humours. It being
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:57719:196"/>
therefore the conſtant charge by all enemies to truth, that it is not thy faith thou
pleadeſt for, thou ſuffereſt for, but thy meer fancy, it behoveth thee to be the
more diligent in Scripture knowledge, and to pray, that the Spirit of God may
thereby quicken thee up to a found and ſure faith: Thus alſo it is in practicals,
Let a man ſet himſelf to the power of godlineſs, walk ſtrictly, in oppoſition to
the looſneſs and profaneneſs of the world; Let his ſoul mourn for ſinne, and his
heart grieve for his evil wayes, what do carnal people preſently ſay, This is your
fancy, theſe are your melancholly conceits, they judge it to be ſome diſtemper in
your imagination, that it is a kind of a madneſs. Now that we may withſtand
ſuch accuſations, it behoveth us to ſeek after, and pray for ſuch a thorough work
of ſanctification, that we may be aſſured it is no more fancy then that we live or
have our being, that if to be godly, if to be converted be a fancy onely, then to
be a man, or to be a wicked man is only a fancy alſo. Well, though we muſt take
heed of calling faith a fancy, and the work of grace a melancholly conceit (for
that is a kind of blaſpheming the holy Ghoſt) yet experience doth evidence, That
many have not faith, have not true piety, but meer empty ſhadows and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Religion, witneſs the <hi>Scepticiſm</hi> of many in theſe dayes, who are of no
faith, and no Religion, who change it often, as they do their garments, who have
no rooting or immovable foundation, but are as the water which receiveth every
impreſſion, but retaineth none, that are <hi>Reeds ſhaken with every wind,</hi> and are
clean contrary to Chriſt, for they are not the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and
for ever: Can you ſay, this is the work of Gods Spirit? Can we ſay, this is the
Scripture-truth? No, you read the Character of ſuch, who have true faith, and
that in a ſanctified manner, <hi>If it were poſſible to deceive the very elect,</hi> Matth. 24.
24. Certainly the prevalency of the imagination above the underſtanding in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
things, is one of the ſore evils which original ſinne hath brought upon
all mankind.</p>

                        <p>SEventhly, This alſo doth greatly manifeſt the ſinfulneſs of the Imagination,
<hi>That</hi> (as in the affections, ſo likewiſe) <hi>in it are conceived for the moſt part
all actual impieties.</hi> The Imagination and the Affections joyned together are
commonly that dunghill, wherein theſe ſerpents lay their eggs; yea ſinne many
times lieth a long while breeding in the imagination, before it be brought forth
into action, yea many times it is never brought forth, but the womb of ſinne is
alſo the tomb, it lived and died in the imagination: We may obſerve the Scripture
attributing the greateſt works of impiety to the imagination, as the cauſe of it,
<hi>Pſal. 21. Why do the people imagine a vain thing?</hi> All the oppoſition of wicked
men, and their carnal policy to overthrow the wayes of Chriſt flow from this
imagining: Thus <hi>Pſal. 38. 12. They imagine deceits all the day long,</hi> Zech. 7. 10.
All the injuſtice, oppreſſion and fraud that may be uſed to other men is attributed
to this, <hi>Let none of you imagine evil againſt his brother in his heart.</hi> It is true,
this Imagination ſpoken of in the Text, comprehends alſo acts of the mind, yet
becauſe (as you heard) the mind acteth dependently upon the imagination,
therefore we conjoyn them together: How polluted then muſt that fountain be,
which ſends forth ſo many polluted ſtreams? Sinne (as we told you) may be a
long while breeding here, before it be compleatly formed and actuated; yea and
God beholdeth and taketh notice of thy ſinnes thus prepared in thy imagination

groſs and loathſom ſinnes can come even from the godly themſelves. Alas, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
not at it, theſe Serpents and Toads were a long while breeding in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
The pleaſure or profit of ſuch a ſinne was often fancied before; It was
again and again committed in thy thoughts, before it was expreſſed in thy life, ſo
that a man can never live unblameably in his life, that doth not keep his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <p>THirdly, The ſinfulneſs of the Imagination is further to be amplified, <hi>In that
many times ſinne is acted with delight and content there, without any relation
at all to the external actings of ſinne.</hi> So that a man while unblameable in his life,
may yet have his imagination like a cage of unclean birds, and this is commonly
done, when there are external impediments, or ſome hinderances of committing
the ſinne outwardly; The fear of mens laws, outward reproach and ſhame,
want of opportunity may keep men off from the outward committing of ſome
luſt, when yet at the ſame time their imaginations have the ſtrong impreſſions of
ſinne upon them, and ſo in their ſouls they become guilty before God; The
Adulterous man, Is not his imagination full of uncleanneſs? The proud man, Is
not his fancy lifted with high and towring conceits? As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of ſome <hi>whoſe eyes were full of adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſinne,
2 Pet.</hi> 2. 14. or as ſome read it according to the original <hi>[Adultereſſe]</hi> imagination
made them have her in their eyes continually, though abſent, for if their eyes
were, their imaginations alſo muſt neceſſarily be, becauſe of the immediate natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
connexion between them; ſo then when there are no outward ſores or ulcers
to be ſeen upon a mans life, yet his imagination may be a noiſom dunghill, what
uncleanneſs fancied, what high honours imagined, that whereas thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from the actings of ſinne, yet thy heart burneth like an oven with luſts
inwardly; It is the emphatical ſimilitude that the holy Ghoſt uſeth, <hi>Hoſ. 7. 8.
They have made ready their heart like an oven;</hi> The meaning is, that as the
oven heated is ready to bake any thing put therein, ſo was the heart of thoſe evil
men prepared for any kind of naughtineſs; Some underſtand it of the adultery of
the body only, as if that were the ſinne intended by the Prophet; Others, of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57719:197"/>
the ſpiritual adultery of the ſoul, by which name Idolatry is often called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
Others referre it to both; we may take it to be a <hi>proverbial expreſſion,</hi>
denoting the readineſs of a mans heart to commit any ſinne, that it lieth in the
heart and the imagination day and night, men highly ſinning againſt God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
when outwardly they are reſtrained; Know then that when the grace of
ſanctification ſhall renew thy ſpirit, ſoul and body, thou wilt then be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to look to thy very imagination, that no tickling fancies or conceits of any luſt
do defile thee, thou wilt keep thy imagination as a precious Cabinet, wherein preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pearls ſhall be treaſured up, not dirt and filth: As we fitly uſe an expreſſion
concerning delight in ſinne, that it is the <hi>rolling of honey under the tongue,</hi> ſo there
is a rolling of ſinne in the imagination with great titillation and pleaſure, when
ſinne cannot be committed in action, we do it in our imagination; Hence it is that
by the imagination old men become guilty of their youthfull luſts, when they
have not bodies to be as inſtrumental to filthineſs, as they have been, yet in their
imaginations they can revive their by-paſt ſinnes many years ago committed:
Thus men became (as it were) perpetual ſinners in their imaginations: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this more ſeriouſly, and pray for an holy, chaſte and pure imagination,
knowing thou haſt to do with an omniſcient God that knoweth what is working
therein, though it be hid from the world beſides; think not ſinfull imaginations
will eſcape the vengeance of God, though no ſutable operations of impiety do
accompany them.</p>

that is, <hi>How prone we are to provoke God in his worſhip, declining from the true

the cauſe of all that diſpleaſure which God ever had in his Church concerning the
worſhipping of him: No, ſinne doth more provoke God then the corrupting of
his worſhip, to adulterate this is to meddle with the apple of his eye; God bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
other ſinnes a long while till his worſhip become to be corrupted, and then he
will endure no longer: Now the original of all ſinfulneſs in this kind hath been
our imagination, we have not attended to what God hath commanded; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not his inſtitutions, but our own fancies, the pleaſing of them: Hence
when God promiſeth a reſtauration to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a reformation
from their former Idolatries, he ſaith, <hi>Neither ſhall they walk any more after the
imagination of their evil heart, Jer.</hi> 3. 17. It was this Imagination carried them out
to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whence came thoſe goodly Images, thoſe glorious Altars, and many
other ſuperſtitious wayes of worſhip, but becauſe the fancy was pleaſed herein,
what is pleaſing to the ſenſes is alſo carried with delight to the Imagination: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that thoſe Heathens <hi>Numa</hi> and others, who would have no Images to

and did not give way to the Imagination; and this is a very neceſſary truth,
for all ſuch who are ſo difficulty taken off from their Idolatries and Superſtitions,
for what is it but thy fancy thou wouldſt have ſatisfied, thou doeſt not look upon
Ordinances and the worſhip of God; as ſpiritual means to quicken thy faith, and
to make thee more ſpiritual, but as that whereby thou wouldſt have thy Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Let us therefore proceed.</p>

evils, becauſe of its invention, it is continually inventing new ſinnes or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of ſinnes;</hi> As if the old ſinnes and treſpaſſes which had filled the world
were not enough, What new wayes of impiety are invented, new fancies in
evil wayes? For although invention be indeed principally an act of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
yet becauſe (as you heard) the underſtanding in its operations hath
recourſe to the imagination, and that is ſubſervient and under-agent to it,
therefore we may attribute the ſame things to both, eſpecailly the things of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
becauſe a mans imagination hath a peculiar influence therein; Now
in this reſpect, if there were no other, the ſinnes of the imagination will encreaſe
like the ſands upon the ſea-ſhore: It were poſſible to ſhew, by going over
every particular Commandment, that the imagination of man doth conſtantly
invent new ſinnes againſt them; the Apoſtacy of man from his firſt rectitude
is emphatically deſcribed by the Scripture in this, as the general and ſumme of
all, <hi>that he ſought out many inventions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29. where the wiſe man having
declared that amongſt men and women, though leſs amongſt women, one not
ſo much as good in an ethical and moral ſenſe could be found; for in a ſpiritual
ſence there is not one man amongſt a thouſand, no not in all mankind that is

there is not one amongſt a thouſand that deſerveth the name of a man, not ſuch
an one as the primitive righteouſneſs did require, but not ſo much as reaſon judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rightly by ethical Rules would commend, he doth clear God from being the
Author of this; And becauſe this truth is of ſuch great conſequence, he uſeth
a word of attention [Lo] <hi>Ecce, Conſider it diligently;</hi> And ſecondly, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
you, how he came to the knowledge of it, <hi>I have found it,</hi> (viz.) <hi>in the

to be inveſtigated by humane reaſon, as it is diſcovered by divine revelation. <hi>I
have found it after much and diligent ſtudy;</hi> Oh that thoſe corrupt teachers, who
deny this original pravity, could with <hi>Solomon</hi> ſay, <hi>They have at laſt after much

it is ſaid, <hi>Vzziah uſed engines invented by cunning men, to ſhoot arrows and great
ſtones withall:</hi> So that by this word is denoted that ſubtilty and great artifice
which is in mans Imagination to invent any evil way, ſinnes that never were
acted before are found out: Every age almoſt hath new ſinnes, and whence is
this, but from the ſubtilty of mans Imagination to find out new wayes of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30. one character in the Catalogue of thoſe ſinnes attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Heathens, is to be <hi>Inventers of evil things;</hi> And certainly here the
Imagination of man is very prone, that whereas to <hi>learn Trades,</hi> or the <hi>Arts,</hi>
there <hi>they muſt have teachers,</hi> and much time muſt be allowed them to learn; In
the <hi>invention of evil things there men are taught of their own corrupt hearts to do
ſo.</hi> We might inſtance in divers things, wherein the ſinfull Imagination of man
is diſcovered about inventing of evil, new ſinnes, new oaths, new blaſphemies,
new wayes of cheating and diſhoneſty, eſpecially in thoſe new wayes for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
pride, and wantonneſs, <hi>Which is the ridiculous, abſurd and uncivil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
in apparel and deportments of body, which are truly and properly the genuine
iſſue of the ſinfull fancies of men.</hi> The Ape being a creature of ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but wanting reaſon doth ſtrive to imitate more then any other creature;
And thus it is an argument that that mans <hi>imagination and fancy</hi> are farre greater
then their <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>prudence,</hi> who are <hi>ambitiouſly ready to imitate every fooliſh
and childiſh faſhion that mens corrupt imaginations have produced.</hi> Look upon all
the ſeveral faſhions, all the changes and mutabilities, which are in mens and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
apparel, and you will preſently be perſwaded, that their imaginations are
corrupted; From this alſo ariſeth the uſe of auxiliary beauty, painting, ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which is the higheſt aggravation of our ſinfulneſs; herein we do
not onely conform to ſuch fooliſh and indecent faſhions, but we plead for the
lawfulneſs thereof; but remember to let Scripture-gravity, modeſty and chaſtity
be more powerfull in thy heart, and manifeſted in thy garments and geſtures,
then the ſinfull impreſſions of unjuſtifiable faſhions upon thy imagination: To
how many transforming themſelves into the new guiſes and modes of the times
they live in, if the gravity of the Miniſter would permit it as well, as the vanity of
the ſubject deſerve it, may you apply <hi>Martials</hi> verſe,
<q>Si mihi cauda foret, Cercopithermeram.</q>
                           <hi>Baſſianus</hi> the Emperour did ſo greatly degenerate into effeminateneſs, that he
would not only conform to womens attire, but would alſo make his name femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57719:199"/>
he would be called <hi>Baſſiana</hi> not <hi>Baſſianus.</hi> By this you ſee, how corrupt
fancies will make men degenerate from the gravity and prudence of a man, much
more the holy deportment of a Chriſtian, this is to ſhew that all the ſinful
faſhions and ridiculous ones which are in apparel, geſture and otherwiſe, they
come from the imaginations of men defiled. To this head alſo is to be referred all
thoſe new <hi>amorous Songs,</hi> all ſinfull <hi>Comedies</hi> and <hi>Playes,</hi> with a world of ſuch

                        <p>ELeventhly, <hi>The ſinfull Imagination of a man doth in a great meaſure manifeſt
it ſelf, in reference to the Word of God, and the Miniſterial Preaching thereof.</hi>
Here it diſcovers much enmity and contrariety to what is godly; For the Word
it ſelf, How greatly is the Imagination offended thereat, both in reſpect of the
ſtyle and the matter? The language is not ſo imbelliſhed and poliſhed, that the
fancy ſhould delight therein; This hath been a rock of offence to many great but
unſanctified wits; They have diſdained the ſimplicity of the ſtyle, and affected a
more gaudy Oratory; This is the ſinne of the fancy chiefly. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
doth much bewail his pride and tumour in this particular; He diſdained
to become like a little child, and to lay aſide the admiration of humane eloquence;
by which he was ſo much puffed up; What prophaneneſs and the love to their
filthy luſts do to ſome in making them oppoſite to Scripture wayes, The ſame
doth an unmortified fancy, eſpecially where there are learning and parts in
others; Even as we ſee Chriſt became a ſtumbling block to many, becauſe he
came not in that external dignity and pomp of a King which they deſired; Thus
alſo it is with the Scriptures, becauſe they are not in ſuch pleaſing words, ſuch
florid expreſſions as their Imagination would have: Hence it is they take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the reading of them, or in meditating therein, whereas they are never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in reading of Comedies, Hiſtories that are full of delight and exact lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
in reading of Poetry and Romances, thou readeſt (it may be) not one
Chapter in the Bible to many of theſe: Oh do thou humble thy ſelf under that
vain and proud fancy, <hi>It is a great enemy to thy converſion!</hi> If ever God open thy
eyes, thou wilt with <hi>Auſtin</hi> bewail thy folly herein, and at laſt regard fruit more
than leaves, ſubſtances more than ſhadows. This was alſo <hi>Hierom</hi>'s temptation
to be much inamoured with humane Oratory, and therefore ſpeaks of himſelf,
what terrors, yea bodily ſmart he was in, hearing a voice at the ſame time, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Ciceronianus es non Chriſtianus.</hi> I do not ſpeak this as if humane Oratory
and Eloquence were not lawfull; yea where it is well uſed, it is an excellent gift
of God. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and others carried this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> gold out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to
<hi>Canaan. Chryſoſtome, Nazianzen, Baſil,</hi> were ſo many Divine <hi>Orphe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </hi>'s to
change the natures of beaſtly men; Therefore it may lawfully be uſed where
God giveth it; Hence in the Scripture we have metaphors and ſimilitudes, yea
Chriſt is full of Parables, which do in their nature pleaſe the fancy repreſenting
ſpiritual things by ſenſible; but then we muſt be ſure, that we ſtay not in this
eloquence, that it be not like muſick affecting the ear for a while, having no ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at all, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s preaching was to his hearers, but it is to be like the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
that maketh us ſwallow down the bitter pils more willingly: To admire the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57719:199"/>
Artifice of a Cup, and never drink of the liquour within, is a childiſh vanity;
to be affected with the words and language of a Miniſter, and not to conſider
what wholſome food it is to thee, whether it be the bread of life to thee or no, is
abſurd impiety: As the proud fancy of a man is thus offended at the Word of
God, ſo alſo it is at <hi>the preaching thereof in a ſolid and ſubſtantial manner in a
ſoul-ſaving way;</hi> This is not according to a mans fancy, which looketh for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
not profit. <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſed this alſo in himſelf, that he did with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
go to hear <hi>Ambroſe</hi> preach, not that he regarded the ſpiritual matter and
heavenly truths delivered, but becauſe of the eloquence and pleaſing elocution
which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> had. Though it is true, ſuch was the goodneſs of God to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
that though hearing <hi>Ambroſe</hi> onely for eloquence ſake, yet ſecretly ſome
power of truth was inſtilled in him, which made to his converſion; So that from
looking to the art in the Sermon, he came at laſt to mind the grace of God in it:
Even as it is ſaid of <hi>Apelles,</hi> that by his often beholding and looking on the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whoſe picture he was drawing, though at firſt he minded his Art onely,
yet ſecretly love did creep into his affections at the ſame time, which made him
languiſh away, till <hi>Alexander</hi> helped her to him as his wiſe. But though admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of gifts and oratory may ſometimes thus be bleſſed, yet commonly it is
otherwiſe, and the inclination of ſuch a fancy is to reject with ſcorn and contempt
the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel without words of mans wiſdom, as a moſt
low and deſpicable thing: Thus the preaching of Chriſt crucified was <hi>fooliſhneſſe
to the Gentiles,</hi> who gloried in humane literature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. Though it is
true, <hi>God will by theſe weak things bring to nought the great admired things of the
world.</hi> Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. The miniſterial weapons of the Goſpel <hi>are mighty
through God, to pull down ſtrong holds, and to caſt down imaginations, and every
high thing that exalteth it ſelf,</hi> as Cannon-ſhot doth ſtrong Caſtles; By this of
the Apoſtle you ſee the imaginations of men raiſe up ſtrong and mighty oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the Word preached, though the Word of God ſet home by his own
power overcometh every thing that doth withſtand it. It is good then, eſpecially
for men of quick parts and raiſed fancies to ſuſpect themſelves, to fear leſt from
them ariſe all their deſtruction, leſt theſe be the bolts and barres that keep Chriſt
out from poſſeſſing of their hearts.</p>

                        <p>TWelfthly, <hi>The ſinfulneſſe of the Imagination is ſeen, in that it is more affected

Inſomuch that neither our life and delight are worthy of the name; All the things

not: Hence a wicked man in his greateſt triumph and glory is compared but to a

purſue riches, honours, all the while our hearts are haſtening after the creatures,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57719:200"/>
we are but in a dream; What is true riches? What is true food? What is true
glory? We miſſe and imbrace onely a ſhadow: This is notably repreſented by
the Prophet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 29. 8. The enemies of the Church that had in their hopes and
expectations devoured <hi>Zion,</hi> are compared to an <hi>hungry man that dreameth he
eateth, but when he is awakened his ſoul is empty:</hi> Thus it is in all theſe worldly
enjoyments, this life is but a dream, we are not awaked till we come within the
borders of eternity: Oh that this were truly conſidered, how greatly would it
mortifie that inordinacy in us to theſe ſading things? When the child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth

when there is no ſolid foundation for it, ſo on the other ſide, <hi>When
the conſcience is awakened for ſinne, many times the imagination doth work ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly,
and filleth us with ſuch ſad apprehenſions, that we fear, where no fear

times work with the troubles of conſcience, hindering both the working of
our judgement, and of faith, repreſenting God and Chriſt to us farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

turn a mans fancy againſt his own ſelf; To have our conſcience againſt us, and
our imaginations againſt us is an hell upon an earth, and it is juſt with God to
fill theſe Imaginations that once received nothing but luſtfull and pleaſant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

when the ſenſes and the rational part are bound up, ſo that they ceaſe from

dreams.</hi> Dreams are the proper work of the Imagination, and Divines do
make three ſorts of them, <hi>Natural Dreams,</hi> which ariſe from natural cauſes,
and theſe commonly either have much ſinfulneſs in them, or great troubleſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<hi>Diabolical,</hi> ſuch as are caſt into the imagination by the Devil; or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
ſuch as are cauſed by God; for the Spirit of God hath uſed the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſome operations thereof: Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> and others were <hi>warned by God
in a dream;</hi> And <hi>Joel</hi> 2. the promiſe is, <hi>That their young men ſhould dream
dreams.</hi> Theſe Divine dreams <hi>Tertullian (Lib. 3. de animâ</hi>) doth divide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Prophetica,</hi> ſuch as are meerly fore-telling things to come; <hi>Revelatoria,</hi>
ſuch as reveal ſomething to be done, as <hi>Peters</hi> viſion concerning <hi>Cornelius;
Aedificatoria,</hi> ſuch as build up to any holy duty; And <hi>Vocatoria,</hi> that call to
ſome ſpiritual ſervice, as that viſion of <hi>Paul</hi> inviting him to come into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia.</hi>
Concerning <hi>Diabolical Dreams</hi> they are not a mans ſinnes but afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
unleſs a man doth directly or indirectly conſent thereunto, or walk ſo
that he deſerveth God ſhould leave him to ſuch unclean or polluted apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
But we ſpeak of <hi>Natural Dreams,</hi> and not ſuch as are meerly natural,
that ariſe from ſome natural cauſe, but ſuch as have had ſome <hi>voluntarineſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
thereunto,</hi> while waking, ſuch now are <hi>proud</hi> dreames, <hi>malicious</hi>
dreams, <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> dreams. All theſe do either expreſly or virtually
come from a polluted Imagination while we are awake, though happily we
cannot remember any ſuch thoughts we had. The ſinfulneſs then of our
dreams we are to be humbled under, as coming from ſinne the cauſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo ſinnes in themſelves: No doubt but <hi>Adam</hi> would have dreamed, (it
being common to all mankind, onely it is ſaid of <hi>Nero,</hi> That he ſeldome or
never dreamed till after the murder of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> after which he was afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with terrible ones; As alſo of the <hi>Atalantes,</hi> that none dream amongſt
them. Though <hi>Tertullian</hi> faith, Perhaps ſame did deceive <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in that
report,) yet his dreams had been meerly natural, not having the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of any ſinne, or any diſquieting with them: But how greatly is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
brought upon us in this very reſpect? Inſomuch that what the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tempt to, while waking, he doth allure unto, while dreaming: Indeed it
is folly and ſuperſtition (as many people do) to regard dreams ſo as to make
conjectures and propheſies thereby, but ſo to obſerve them, as to take notice of
the filthineſs and ſinfulneſs of them, that is a duty, for although the reaſon and
the will do not operate at that time, <hi>yet there is ſinne in our dreams,</hi> becauſe they
are the <hi>effects of the ſinfull motions of thy ſoul ſometimes or other.</hi> Let it then be
thy care to have pure and ſanctified imaginations both dreaming and waking,
and do nothing that may provoke the Spirit of God to leave thee to the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

that room of the ſoul wherein he doth often appear. Indeed (to ſpeak exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
the Devil hath no efficient power over the rational part of a man, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
change the will, he cannot alter the heart of a man, neither doth he know
the thoughts of a man, ſo that the utmoſt he can do in tempting of a man to
ſinne, is by ſwaſion and ſuggeſtion only; but then. How doth the Devil do
this? <hi>even by working upon the imagination.</hi> Learned men make this his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
that he obſerveth the temper and bodily conſtitution of a man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſuggeſts to his fancy, and injects his fiery darts thereinto, by which the
mind and will come to be wrought upon; for it is <hi>Ariſtotl</hi>'s rule, That
<hi>Phantaſmata movent intellectum, ſicut ſenſila ſenſum;</hi> ſo that as the object of
ſenſe, being preſent, doth preſently move the ſenſe; ſo do phantaſmes and
imaginations move the underſtanding. The Devil then, though he hath no
imperious efficacy over thy will, yet becauſe he can thus ſtirre and move thy
imagination, and thou being naturally deſtitute of grace canſt not withſtand
theſe ſuggeſtions; hence it is that any ſinne in thy imagination, though but in
the outward works of the ſoul, yet doth quickly lay hold on all; and indeed
by this meanes do ariſe thoſe horrible deluſions that are in many erronious
wayes of Religion, all is becauſe their imaginations are corrupted; yea, how
often are theſe <hi>diabolical illuſions of the imagination taken for the gracious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Gods Spirit?</hi> Divines give many excellent Rules, how we may diſcern
between thoſe deluſions of the imagination by Satan, and the ſavourie work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Gods Spirits in illumination, and conſolations: It is not my purpoſe to
enter on that Subject, only bewail and humble thy ſelf under this, that the
Devil hath ſuch command over thy fancy, that he can ſo quickly dart in, like
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57719:202"/>
ſo much lightning ſo many unclean or blaſphemous imaginations, it is from
hence that many have pretended to <hi>Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> that regard dreames, that
they leave the Scripture, and wholly attend to what they perceive and feel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them. And thus much for the opening of this noiſome dunghill alſo.</p>

                        <p>NOw from the corruption which you have heard of all the parts of the ſoul
both the <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive</hi> part of a man conjoyned together, we may
ſee the unſpeakable miſery of man in theſe particulars; and oh that every au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
would ſmite upon his breſt and ſay, O Lord I am the man thus polluted!
O Lord all this poiſon and pollution lyeth here! For</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>In having all the powers of the ſoul thus defiled, both ſuperior and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
hereby man hath loſt all liberty, and is become a miſerable ſlave and vaſſal to
ſinne and Satan.</hi> For whereas man was made only to ſerve God, and by love
to cleave to him, the creature is come in his room, and thereby man is inſlaved
in his affections to theſe temporal things only; ſo that we do very improperly
ſay, that a man is the Maſter or the Lord of ſuch an eſtate, of ſuch an houſe,
for indeed he is a ſlave to them, <hi>Fiunt ſervi, dum domini eſſe deſiderant,</hi> as
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> while thou doſt ſo earneſtly deſire to be maſter of ſuch an eſtate, thou
art indeed made a ſervant to it; but remember thou canſt not ſerve God and
the creature, theſe are two contrary maſters.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>He hath by this pollution loſt all true judgement to diſcern of things,
he doth not know what are the beſt things, yea he doth groſſely miſjudge, he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
earth before gold, droſs before pearles.</hi> The natural man cannot diſcern ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
things, becauſe he wants a ſpiritual eye; he miſtaketh about God, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgeth
about true bleſſedneſs, he is deceived about the true nature of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;
ſo that he can no more judge of theſe things, then a worm can of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
actions: The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. Thus we
are become like <hi>children,</hi> yea <hi>natural fools</hi> as to ſpiritual things; when we are
invited to this feaſt, we pretend excuſes; when Chriſt is tendered to us, we had
rather keep our ſwine; when exhorted to labour for everlaſting bread and riches
and an eternal crown of glory, we had rather have our Barley-Corn, then all
theſe: Thus we have loſt all ſpiritual judgement and will not part with our
<hi>bables,</hi> though for an <hi>inheritance in heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>A man being thus in his intellectuals and affectionate parts of his ſoul
carried out only to theſe earthly things, and from God;</hi> hence is it, that he is as
it were made <hi>one with them;</hi> we may ſay, <hi>earth thou art</hi> not only in reſpect of
thy body, but alſo of thy ſoul; for if the Apoſtle ſay, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17, he that is
joyned to the Lord is made one spirit;</hi> may we not alſo ſay, he that is joyned to
ſinne, to creatures, is made (as it were) the ſame with them. Although
(ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) the mind when it inclineth to theſe bodily things is not made
<hi>corpus,</hi> a body, yet by theſe appetites and deſires <hi>quodammodo corporaſcit,</hi> it
doth (as it were) become bodily; It is as if a mighty Prince ſhould come from
his throne of glory, and wallow in the mire like a ſwine; this is our ſtate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
to that primitive happineſs and holineſs; we are now no better then
thoſe luſts and thoſe creatures that we do adhere unto; <hi>Junge cor tuun ater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitati
Dei, &amp; cum ille aeternus eris;</hi> and again, <hi>Si terram amas terra es;</hi> Thou
art in Gods account that which thy heart is ſet upon; Oh then, God cannot
look upon thee as his primitive creature, he ſeeth his image and ſuperſcription
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:57719:202"/>
defaced, and another brought in the ſtead thereof very loathſome and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Even as they that worſhipt Idols are ſaid <hi>to be like them,</hi> to become as abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
yea and as ſenſleſs, and as ſtupid, as they are, ſo it is in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>From hence alſo ariſeth that impoſſibility of looſing our ſelves from
the creature to return again to God from wn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>m we fell;</hi> Had not the Lord ſhewed
mercy to ſome of mankind, none of them could ever have recovered out of
their loſt eſtate, no more than the Devils can to that habitation which they
forſook; All theſe creatures are the bird-lime that now hinder the wings of the
ſoul from flying to Heaven: Oh that we could ſay, <hi>The ſnare is broken, and
we are delivered; Who will give me wings that I may flie as a Dove, and my
ſoul find reſt with God!</hi> Yea as a man hath no power to break theſe bonds of
ſinne, ſo <hi>neither hath be any deſire,</hi> for he is kept thus faſt joyned to ſinne <hi>by
delight</hi> and by <hi>pleaſure;</hi> ſo that the more ſinne and the creatures delight him,
the more ſtrongly is he poſſeſſed; <hi>Samſon</hi> was as much under <hi>Dalilah</hi>'s power,
though it was by his delight and conſent, as when under the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> by force
and conſtraint; So that the will and affections of man are hereby ſo glued to ſin
and the creature, <hi>That nothing is more offenſive and troubleſom to them, then to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from theſe things:</hi> So that whereas <hi>David</hi> having experience of the ſweetneſs
of Gods favour, ſaith, <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God;</hi> They (on the
contrary) judge it their greateſt good to draw nigh to, and poſſeſs the creature,
Hence</p>
                        <p>In the fifth place, <hi>There is that difficulty in man to bear the want of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of ſinne, and the delight of the creatures, yea the exceeding great ſorrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the loſing of them:</hi> Were not man fallen from that glorious ſtate of holineſs,
and enjoyment of God, he could not ſo ſadly deplore and bewail the loſs of any
creature, no more then a man ſhould be troubled to have the Moon taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
when the Sunne is in the room thereof; but becauſe, when fallen from
God, we center upon theſe earthly things; therefore it is, that as we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
delight in the poſſeſſing of them, ſo immoderate ſorrow in the loſing
of them; For that is a true Rule about all theſe things, <hi>Non eſt earendo difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
niſi cum in habendo eſt cupiditas;</hi> Now all this trouble and perplexing grief
ariſeth from the pollution of the ſoul being deſtitute of that glorious Image.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Man having loſt the Image of God thus in his ſoul, hence it is that
<hi>he liveth a wretched inſtable and unquiet life, for being off in his heart from God,
he therefore is toſſed up and down according to the mutability of every creature;</hi>
Hence no man having no more then what he hath by <hi>Adam,</hi> can live any quiet,
ſecure and peaceable life, but is toſſed up and down with contrary winds, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>fears,</hi> ſometimes <hi>hope,</hi> ſometimes <hi>joy,</hi> ſometimes <hi>ſorrow,</hi> ſo that he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the Haven, but alwayes floting upon the waters; Thus miſerable is a
mans life, till the Image of God be repaired in him.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, From this univerſal pollution upon a man, it followeth, <hi>That be
abuſeth every good thing he hath, that he ſinneth in all things, and by all things;</hi>
That whether he <hi>eateth or drinketh,</hi> whether he <hi>buyeth or ſelleth,</hi> he cannot refer
any one of theſe to the ultimate end, which is Gods glory, but to inferiour and
ſelf-reſpects: Oh wretched and miſerable eſtate, wherein thou haſt abuſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mercy God hath given thee to his diſhonour and thy damnation! Thou haſt
turned all thy honey into gall and poiſon; thou waſt never able to fulfill that
command, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. So to uſe the world as not to abuſe it;</hi> Thy meat, thy rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thy health, thy wealth, they have all been abuſed; neither hath God
been glorified, or the ſalvation of thy ſoul promoted thereby.</p>

overflow all mankind, There is corruption in the ſuperiour parts of the ſoul,

                        <p>FOr the Coherence of it, obſerve, that the Apoſtle having in the former

have been needleſs.</p>
                        <p>In the prayer it ſelf we may conſider, the matter it ſelf prayed for, and that
is ſet down,</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Summarily,</hi> and in the <hi>General.</hi> And then</p>

<hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were ſuppoſed to be ſanctified already, but yet the Apoſtle doth
here pray for their further ſanctification, which doth evidence, <hi>That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of perfection in this life, is a proud and preſumptuous errour;</hi> If
they had, attained to the higheſt pitch of ſanctification already, why ſhould they
ſtill grow in it? Thus the Apoſtle doth often preſs Goſpel-duties upon ſuch as
attain to them already, but becauſe they have not perfection, therefore they
are to be urged forward: Thus the Apoſtle writing to thoſe that were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. ſaith, <hi>We pray you be reconciled to God;</hi> So to the <hi>Epheſ. 4.

                        </p>
                        <p>Now that which I intend chiefly out of theſe words, is the <hi>Subject</hi> to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and that not the two former (<hi>viz.) Spirit</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> of whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
we have largely treated already, but of the <hi>Body,</hi> which is laſt of all;
Only it is neceſſary to ſpeak a little to the explication of theſe three parts of
man, how they differ, for commonly when the Scripture ſpeaketh of man it
enumerateth but two parts, the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body,</hi> as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. and in the
creation of man, we have only two parts inſtanced in, which are his <hi>Soul</hi> and
his <hi>Body;</hi> Becauſe of this there have been various conjectures upon this place,
for ſome have hence made three parts of man, his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>Soul,</hi> which they
make to be the ſenſitive part of man, and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which they make to be
ſome part (as it were) flowing from the eſſence of God, and this they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<hi>immortal,</hi> but the ſoul and the body (they ſay) are <hi>mortal;</hi> And
the ancient Heretiques the <hi>Apollinariſts</hi> might runne to this refuge, who denied
Chriſt to have any rational ſoul, but his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and his <hi>ſenſitive ſoul
and body,</hi> do make upon Chriſt. The <hi>Manichees</hi> alſo affirmed two ſouls in men,
the one <hi>rational</hi> that was good, and of God; The other evil, and the fountain
of evil, the <hi>ſenſitive ſoul,</hi> coming from the Devil. Yea <hi>Cerda</hi> upon <hi>Tertul. (de
anima lib.</hi> 3.) ſaith, not only <hi>Dydimus,</hi> but others of the ancients did incline
to this opinion, that the Spirit was a diſtinct part in a man from ſoul and body,
which opinion <hi>Auſtin</hi> oppoſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="374" facs="tcp:57719:204"/>
Thus this Text hath favoured (as ſome think) that opinion of two ſouls in
a man, his <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive,</hi> not in the <hi>Manichean</hi> way, but in a <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi>
way; and ſome learned men indeed have thought by holding two diſtinct
ſouls, many inconveniences would be avoided, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are maintained in Philoſophy,
and alſo the conflict and combate that is between the fleſh and the ſpirit, would
be better explicated. But certainly the Scripture ſpeaketh conſtantly of man, as
having but one ſoul, <hi>What will it profit a man to winne the whole world and
loſe his ſoul?</hi> not his ſouls, which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> uſed as an argument to make
man watchfull to the ſalvation of it, ſaying, <hi>If thou haſt loſt one eye, thou haſt
another to help thee; if one arm, another to ſupport thee, but if thou loſeſt
thy only ſoul, thou haſt not another to be ſaved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Others therefore that they may avoid this inconvenience of holding three
parts in a man, do by <hi>ſpirit</hi> underſtand the work of grace in a man; Thus the
Greek Interpreters of old, and ſome learned men of late, but this doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
any wayes probable, nor will the Context runn ſmoothly, to make grace
(as it were) a part of a man; neither is it coherent to pray, that God would
preſerve our grace, our ſoul and body, but rather grace in them; Therefore
we take <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> for the ſame real ſubſtance in a man, <hi>onely diverſified by
its ſeveral operations. Lactantius</hi> cals it an inextrieable Queſtion, Whether
<hi>animus</hi> and <hi>anima</hi> be the ſame thing in man, meaning by <hi>anima,</hi> that whereby
the body is enlivened; by <hi>animus</hi> that whereby we reaſon and underſtand, but
there ſeemeth to be no ſuch difficulty therein, the Scripture promiſcuouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it ſometimes a ſoul, and ſometimes a ſpirit. It's called the ſpirit in regard
of the underſtanding and reaſon, as <hi>Epheſ 4. 23. Be renewed in the ſpirit of
your mind,</hi> and ſoul becauſe of the <hi>affectionate part</hi> therein; ſo that the Apoſtle
doth not mean <hi>two diſtinct parts</hi> in a man, but <hi>two diſtinct powers</hi> and <hi>offices in
the ſame ſoul;</hi> You have a parallel expreſſion <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. where the word of
God is ſaid, <hi>To divide between ſoul and spirit,</hi> which afterwards is expreſſed by
diſcerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart: Thus when <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid,
<hi>Luke 1. 46, 47. My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoyced in
God;</hi> ſhe meaneth the ſame part within her, only giveth it divers names.</p>
                        <p>This being explained, whereas we ſee the Apoſtle praying for the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the body as well as the ſoul, it is plain, <hi>That it is unclean and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as well as the ſoul,</hi> elſe it did not need Sanctification. From whence
obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the body of a man naturally is defiled and ſinfull;</hi> Sanctification ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
adequately to our pollution: Seeing then it is required of man, that
his body be holy, and he is to glorifie God in that as well as in his ſoul, and this
cannot be without the ſanctification of it, it remaineth that our bodies are not
only mortal but ſinfull; And indeed under the corruptibility of them, we do
readily groan and mourn under the diſeaſes, pains and aches of the body, but
ſpiritual life is required to be humbled for the ſins of the body.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this it is anſwered, That the body is called ſinfull, not becauſe
ſinne is formally in it, for ſo it is in the ſoul, but <hi>becauſe by it as an inſtrument
ſinne is accompliſhed;</hi> The <hi>ſubjectum quod,</hi> or of denomination of ſinne, is the

The <hi>medium</hi> or <hi>inſtrumentum quo</hi> is the <hi>body,</hi> not that the body is <hi>only</hi> an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ſoul, for it is an <hi>eſſential part</hi> of man with the ſoul, as is further to
be ſhewed. Thus we truly call them ſinfull eyes, ſinfull tongues, becauſe they
do inſtrumentally accompliſh the ſinfulneſs of the heart; when the Apoſtle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

                           <hi>That they might be ſanctified wholly in ſpirit, ſoul and body,</hi> he prayeth
for the <hi>reparation of Gods Image again;</hi> Now when that was perfect in <hi>Adam,</hi>
the <hi>ſpirit</hi> was immediately ſubject to God, the <hi>ſoul</hi> to the ſpirit, the <hi>body</hi> to the
ſoul; So that what the ſpirit thought, the ſoul affected, and the body accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed;
but now this excellent harmony being diſſolved, as the ſpirit is
diſobedient to God, the affections to the ſpirit, ſo alſo in the body to both, and
thereby it becometh a co-partner with the ſoul in ſinne, and therefore muſt be

                        <p>THat the very body of a man is ſinfull and needeth ſanctification, is plain
from theſe Texts, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our
ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe;</hi> This is ſpoken
to thoſe alſo that are regenerated, none is perfect, they muſt be perfecting;
As <hi>Apelles,</hi> when he drew his line would write <hi>faciebat</hi> in the Imperfect tenſe,
not <hi>fecit,</hi> as if he had finiſhed it, he would be ſtill making it more exact; ſo
ſhould we be in our beſt holy duties, <hi>Amabam</hi> not <hi>amavi, credebane,</hi> not <hi>credidi,</hi>
there remaineth a further complement and fulneſs to be added to our beſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
Now this perfection is by <hi>cleanſing of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> that is the <hi>body</hi>
and the <hi>ſoul.</hi> It is a great errour among ſome Papiſts, that they hold the ſpirit
and mind of a man free from original contagion, and therefore confine it only
to the inferiour bodily parts, but that hath ſufficiently been confuted, yet we
deny not but the bodily part of man is likewiſe greatly contaminated, and like
an impure veſſel defileth whatſoever cometh into it. The uncleanneſs of the
body appeareth alſo from that command <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. where the Apoſtle enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
that we ſhould <hi>preſent our bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable;</hi>
So that whatſoever we do by our body it is to be holy and acceptable unto God:
Now this exhortation was needleſs, if we did not naturally offer up our bodies
a ſacrifice to ſinne, and to the Devil: For meerly a natural man ſerveth ſinne
and the Devil with all the parts of his body: Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking to
perſons converted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. ſaith, <hi>As ye have yeelded your members ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to uncleanneſs and to iniquity, ſo now yeeld your members ſervants to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi>
Thy eye was once the Devils and ſinnes, thy tongue was, thy ear
was, by all theſe ſinne was conſtantly committed, ſo now have a ſanctified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
an holy eye, a godly ear, an heavenly tongue, a pure body; And indeed
we need not runne for Texts of Scripture, experience doth abundantly confirm
the preparedneſs and readineſs of the body to all ſuitable and pleaſing iniquity;
Conſider likewiſe that pregnant place, <hi>Heb. 10. 22. Let us draw near with a
pure heart in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and our bodies waſhed with pure water;</hi> As the heart muſt be cleanſed
from all ſinnes, that our conſciences may condemn us for, ſo our bodies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
muſt be waſhed with pure water; it is an alluſive expreſſion to the legal
cuſtom, which was for all before they drew nigh to the ſervice of God, to
ſprinkle themſelves with pure water, to take off the legal uncleanneſs of the
body; And thus we muſt ſtill in a ſpiritual way, that ſo the body may be fitted
for Gods ſervice: As it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 10. 5. A body thou haſt prepared
for me,</hi> becauſe the Spirit of God did ſo purifie that corpulent maſs, of which
Chriſts body was made, that being without all ſinne, he was thereby fitted for
the work of a Mediator; For as for the <hi>Socinian</hi> Interpretation, who would
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57719:205"/>
apply it to Chriſts body, made immortal and glorious, as if it were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of Chriſt entring into Heaven, the Context doth evidently confute it, that
which the Apoſtle, following the <hi>Septuaginnt</hi> in the original, calleth, <hi>Preparing the
body,</hi> out of which it is alledged, <hi>Pſ. 40. 6. It is, my ears haſt thou opened,</hi> aliuding
to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtom, who when a ſervant would not leave his Maſter, his ears
were to be boared, and ſo he was to continue for ever with him; The ears were
boared, becauſe they are the inſtrument of hearing and obedience, and thereby
was ſignified, that he would diligently hearken to his Maſters commands:
Thus it was with Chriſt, his ears were opened, his whole body prepared to do
the will of God; Now as it was thus with Chriſt, ſo in ſome reſpect it muſt be
with us; God muſt prepare and fit a body for us, till grace ſanctifie and poliſh
it, there is no readineſs to any holy duty, <hi>The ſeeing eye, and the hearing ear,
God is ſaid to make both,</hi> Prov. 20. 12. By theſe inſtances out of Scripture,
you ſee what a Leproſie of ſin hath ſpread over the body as well as the ſoul: Oh

five kinds of them, yet the Apoſtle inſtanceth in two only (<hi>viz.</hi>) of <hi>racers</hi>
and of <hi>wreſtlers,</hi> as being moſt ſuitable to his purpoſe. Now by this Metaphor
the Apoſtle would teach us, what an enemy and adverſary the body is to the
ſoul, what ſnares it layeth for us, what great danger may ariſe to us from it
alone; He doth not name his fighting with the world and the Devil, though
theſe be potent enemies, but the body only, becauſe theſe adverſaries cannot
do us any hurt, till this domeſtical enemy and home-adverſary do betray us; and
as it ſignifieth, that the body is an enemy, ſo it declareth alſo with what auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and mortification we are to obſerve our bodies, for they are like our beaſts,
if we take not their provender from them, they will quickly grow too unruly,
as is implied in the next word. It is true, the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>I kill my
body,</hi> nor I mutilate my body, for that had been unlawfull; neither doth this
Text give any encouragement to thoſe Popiſh Penances and Diſcipline they uſe
to their bodies (although their learned men think this place alone to be enough
to juſtifie their flagellations, their whippings and ſcourgings of the body) but
commands ſuch an abſtinence about our bodies, that thereby they may be the
more prepared and uſefull for any ſpiritual duty, for ſuch who live in bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
they make their bodies a very noiſom ſink or dunghill to the ſoul; Hence
the word is to be underſtood metaphorically, as <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 5. where it is applied
to the importunate widow that troubled the Judge: And although the Apoſtle
by the body doth chiefly mean the carnal and ſinfull part of a man, yet he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the body, becauſe that, if not diligently watched unto and obſerved, will
quickly produce many carnal luſts; The other Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">

maſterfull, it will prevail over the ſoul, and even overcome the workings of
grace, if we do not carefully attend: As in deep mines there do ſometimes
ariſe ſuch foggy vapours that put their light out who are digging there, and ſo
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57719:207"/>
endanger them if they do not diligently obſerve them: Luſts then and ſinnes
lie in the body (as it were) like fire in the ſlint, any temptation will draw
them out: It was the ſpeech of one, who (though ſick) yet would not have
the temptation come nigh him, ſaying, <hi>Auferte ignem adhuc enim paleas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo;</hi>
Take away the fire, for I have yet chaff within me: Thus if <hi>Paul</hi> be
afraid of his body, if he fear himſelf leſt temptations ariſe from thence, what
ſhould we do? if the Ramme fear ſo, what ſhould the Lamb do? as <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon
this point; If the green tree thus fear burning, what ſhould the dry one do?
Though bodily ſinnes are very many in number, ſo that it would be too tedious
to reckon up all, yet I muſt not paſs by one more, which the Apoſtle is ſo
large in, and that is the ſinfulneſs of the tongue, that is one part of the body,
yet the Apoſtle ſaith, a world of evil is in that, how many worlds of evil are
then in the whole man? <hi>James</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7. The Apoſtle from his former coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
given, that they <hi>ſhould not be many maſters,</hi> that is, as ſome expound it, and
that moſt probable, Do not affect to produce new opinions, and ſo to create
many Diſciples to follow you, as if you only found out this or that Doctrine;
(Like that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 23. 10. And be ye not called Maſters,
for one is your Maſter even Chriſt,</hi>) and that they muſt depend upon your
authority only; From this councel (I ſay) he doth occaſionally declare the
evil and general wickedneſs of the tongue, becauſe where there are contrary
maſters, and they hold contrary opinions, commonly theſe are maintained by
them with much pride and arrogancy, with bitter cenſuring and condemning
of one another: Therefore the Apoſtle doth fully inform us, what an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of evil the tongue is, that it ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature; It is
from the tongue that houſes, Towns, Cities, yea the whole world is ſet into
combuſtion, and no wonder, for that is ſet on fire from Hell, that is, from the
Devil, who by the corruption of man doth now reign and rule in him; yea it
is ſo full of deadly poiſon, and ſuch an unruly evil, that no man can tame it;
From which expreſſion <hi>Auſtin</hi> did well gather the neceſſity of Gods grace, for
the tongue only is ſo ready to evil one way or other, that without Gods grace it
cannot be tamed, and though nature hath given teeth, and lips, as ſo many
barres to keep in the tongue, yet grace only muſt over rule it: As then the
Phyſician by looking on the tongue doth diſcover the heat and diſeaſe of the
body within, ſo by thy tongue, thy paſſionate tongue, thy unruly tongue, thy
raging tongue, original ſinne which is in the whole man, is notoriouſly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted;
How quickly is the poiſon in the heart emptied into the tongue? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may you object, ſaying, That drunkenneſs, adultery, and evil bitter
words are actual ſinnes, and what is this to original? Yes, very much, as the
fruit to the root, as the ſtreams to the fountain; For were not the body thus
originally polluted with the ſoul, the fruit would be then anſwerable to a pure
and perfect root; And well may we diſcourſe after this manner, ſeeing we have
the Apoſtle a Preſident herein; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, 12. having aſſerted both
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> to be under ſinne, ſo that there is not one good of all mankind
by nature; he demonſtrateth this both by the ſoul-ſinfulneſs and the body ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
and that by actual impieties, <hi>Their throat is an open ſepulchre, the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of Aſps is under their lips, their feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud:</hi> Thus it is plain,
that original ſinne lying latent in the heart of a man, is diſcovered by the actual
impieties of the body, and all the parts of the body are one way or other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive
of the fruit of this ſinne.</p>

about <hi>Michal,</hi> is become a ſnare to us, a worſe evil then is in that
imprecation, <hi>Let their table become a ſnare to them,</hi> for our body, which is ſo
dear and ſo intimate, that is alſo become a ſnare, <hi>But then objectively it doth
occaſion much ſinne to the ſoul.</hi> In the former particular our bodies had ſome
kind of efficiency and working in thoſe ſinnes, but here it is paſſive (as it
were) an object that doth allure and draw out the ſoul inordinately to it, ſo
that we mind the body, look to the body, provide for the body more than the
ſoul; ſo that whereas the ſoul is farre more excellent and worthy than the
body; ſo that our thoughts and ſtudies ſhould be infinitely more zealous to
ſave that then the body, yet till grace doth ſanctifie and life us up to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, who doth not look after his body more than his ſoul, which
yet is, as if (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) a man ſhould look to his houſe to ſee that be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
and that be in good order, but neglect his own ſelf: The ſoul that is
properly a man, the body is but his houſe, and a vile one alſo, is an houſe of
clay; it is but a garment to the ſoul, and a ragged tottered one. Now it is good
to take notice in what particulars our bodies are thus objectively a cauſe of ſinne
to us. And</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>It is evident in that diligent and thoughtfull way of car we have about
the feeding and cloathing of it.</hi> Doth not our Saviour even to his very Diſciples,
prohibit this perplexing care, <hi>Matth. 6. 25. Take no thought for your life what
ye ſhall eat, nor for your body what ye ſhall put on;</hi> but how faulty are we here,
comparatively to our ſouls? we that have ſo many thoughts to provide for the
body, how few have we about the ſoul? Is not the body well fed, when the
ſoul is ſtarved? Is not the body well cloathed, when the ſoul is naked? How
juſtly may thy ſoul cry out murder, murder, for thou art deſtroying and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that every day? Will not thy ſoul witneſs againſt thee at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the body was taken care for, the body was looked to, but I was negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted?
Will it not cry out in hell, Oh if I had been as diligently attended unto,
as the body, I had not been roaring in theſe eternal torments.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond particular, wherein the body doth objectively and occaſionally
tempt the ſoul to ſinne, is <hi>about the adorning and trimming of it, not only the
care to provide for it, but the curioſity to adorn it doth provoke the ſoul to much
ſinni.</hi> And whereas our very garments ſhould put us in conſtant mind of our
original pollution (for there was no ſhame uponnakedneſs till that firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion)
and thereby greatly humble us; we now grow proud and vain from
the very effect of the firſt diſobedience: Every morning we put on our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we ſhould remember our original ſinne; The body before ſinne was
not expoſed to any danger by cold and other damages, neither was the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
thereof any cauſe of bluſhing, but all this and more alſo is the fruit of the
firſt ſinne, and if ſo, how inexcuſable is it, to be curious and diligent in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up, and adorning our bodies by thoſe very garments, the thoughts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſhould greatly debaſe us, but this is not all; The great attendance to the
glory of the body doth wholly take off from the care of the ſoul; How happy
were it, if perſons did take as much pains to have their ſouls cloathed with the
robes of righteouſneſs, to have them waſhed and cleanſed from all filth, as
they do about their bodies, one ſpot, one wrinkle in the garment is preſently
ſpied out, when the ſoul at the ſame time, though full of loathſomneſs, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:57719:208"/>
neglected, as if our ſouls were for our bodies, and not our bodies
for our ſouls. The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> indeed had ſuch high thoughts of the ſoul, and
ſo low of the body, that their opinion was, <hi>Anima eſt homo,</hi> the ſoul is the
man, they made the body but a meer inſtrument, as the Ship is to the Pilate,
or muſical inſtruments to an Artificer; This is not true in Philoſophy, though
in a moral ſenſe it may have ſome affinity with truth, but if we do regard the
affections and actions of all by nature, we may rather ſay, The body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> man;
Yea the Apoſtle goeth higher, he maketh it ſome mens God, <hi>Phil. 3. 19.
Whoſe belly is their God,</hi> Why their God? Becauſe all they look at in Religion,
all they mind is only to ſatisfie that. The Monks belly in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time was their
god; When then a man liveth his natural, civil and religious life onely to have
his belly ſatisfied, this man maketh his belly his god. And again, there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whoſe backs are their god; For never did Heathens or Papiſts beſtow
more coſt upon their Idols and Images to make them glorious, then they do on
their backs, little remembring that we came naked into the world, and that
we ſhall not carry any thing out with us; If this care were for ſoul-ornaments,
if thou didſt ſpend as much time in prayer to God and reading the Scriptures,
whereby thy ſoul might be made comely and beautifull, as thou doeſt about
thy body, this would prove more comfortable; If thou didſt as often look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the glaſs of Gods word, to find out every ſinne thou doeſt commit, and to
reform it, as thou doeſt into the material glaſſe to behold thy countenance,
and to amend the defilements there, thou wouldſt find that the hours and day
ſo ſpent will never grieve thee, whereas upon the review of thy life ſpent in
this world, thou wilt at the day of judgement cry out of, and bewail all thoſe
hours, all that time in unneceſſary adorning of the body; The Apoſtle giveth
an excellent exhortation, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 3, Whoſe adorning let it not be of plating the
hair, or of wearing of gold—but let it be the hidden men of the heart, in that
which is not corruptible,</hi> The Apoſtle doth not there ſimply and abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the wearing of gold in ſuch who by their places and calling may do it, for
<hi>Iſaac</hi> gave <hi>Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ccah</hi> earings of gold; but he ſpeaketh comparatively, rather
look to the adorning of the ſoul, then of the body, ſpend more time about one
then the other. It is a known Hiſtory of that <hi>Pambo,</hi> who ſeeing a woman
very induſtriouſly trimming her ſelf to pleaſe that man with whom ſhe intended
naughtineſſe, wept thereupon, becauſe he could not be as carefull to dreſſe up
his ſoul in ſuch a poſture as to pleaſe God: Oh then look to thy body hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
Let it not ſteal ſo much time from thee, as thereby to neglect thy ſoul,
and to loſe thoſe opportunities thou mayeſt have of humbling thy ſelf before
God!</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>The body doth objectively draw out ſinne from the ſoul, In that the
fear of any danger to that, especially the death thereof, will make us damne our
ſoules and greatly offend God,</hi> which doth plainly diſcover, that our bodies are
more to us, then God or heaven, or our ſoules are: Therefore we have our
Saviour preſſing his Diſciples againſt this fear, if fear about hurt to the body
may inſnare the godly, and keep them from their duty, no wonder if it totally
prevail with the natural man. <hi>Mat. 10. 28. Luk. 12. 4. I ſay to you may friends,
fear not them which can kill the body only but fear him who can caſt both body and ſoul
into hell;</hi> But what Apoſtacies, what ſad perfidiouſneſs in religion hath this love
to the body cauſed? the inordinate fear of the death thereof hath made many
men wound and damne their ſoules: Times then of dangers and perſecutions
do abundantly diſcover how inordinate men are in their love to their bodies,
looking upon bodily death worſe then eternal damnation in hell; although our
Saviour hath ſpoken ſo expreſly, <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole
world and loſe his own ſoul,</hi> Mark 8. 36. It is the Scriptures command that we
ſhould glorifie God in ſoul and body which are Gods, our body is Gods, that
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57719:208"/>
is bought with a price as well as your ſoul, ſo that it ought to be our ſtudy how
we ſhould glorifie God by our eies, by our ears, by our tongues: It is not
enough to ſay thou haſt a good heart and an honeſt heart if thou haſt a ſinful
body; now though there be many wayes wherein we may glorifie God by our
bodies, yet there is none ſo ſignal and eminent as when we do willingly at the
call of God give our bodies to be diſgraced, tormented and killed for his ſake,
then God ſaith to thee, as he did to <hi>Abraham</hi> upon his willingneſs to offer up
his ſon <hi>Iſaac, Now I know thou loveſt me;</hi> Thus you have <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſing,
<hi>Gal. 6. 17. I bear in my body the marks of the Lords Jeſus,</hi> The Greek word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
ſuch markes of ignominy as they did uſe to their ſervants, or fugitives,
or evil doers, now though in the eies of the world ſuch were reproachfull,
yet <hi>Paul</hi> gloryed in them, and therefore he giveth this as a reaſon why noue
ſhould trouble and moleſt him in the work of the Miniſtery this ought to
be a demonſtration to them of his ſincerity, and that he ſeeketh not himſelf,
but Chriſt, hence alſo he ſaith, <hi>Phil. 1. 20. Chriſt ſhall be magnified in his body,
whether by life or by death.</hi> By this it is evident that we owe our bodies to
Chriſt as well as our ſouls, and that any fear to ſuffer in them for his ſake ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
we love our bodies more then his glory.</p>

to any ſervice for God, though it may be the ſoul is willing and deſirous.</hi> The
drouſineſſe, dulneſſe and ſleepineſſe of the body doth many times cauſe the
ſoul to be very unfit for any approaches unto God; Our Saviour obſerved
this even in his very Diſciples, when he ſaid, <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the fleſh
is weak,</hi> Matth. 26. 41. when our Saviour was in thoſe great agonies, making
earneſt prayer unto God, and commanding his Diſciples <hi>To watch and pray,
that they might not enter into temptation,</hi> yet they were heavy and dull, and
therefore were twice reproved for their ſleep; and this ſleepineſſe of theirs,
was at that time, when (if ever) they ſhould have been throughly awakened;
but thus it falleth out often, that in thoſe duties, and at thoſe times, when we
ought moſt to watch and attend, then commonly the body is moſt heavy and
dull; Hence is that drouſineſſe and ſleepineſſe while the Word is preached,
whereas at thy meals, or at thy recreations, and in wordly buſineſſes there is
no ſuch dulneſſe falleth upon thee; This ariſeth partly from the ſoul, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the body; The ſoul that is not ſpiritual and heavenly, therefore it doth
not with delight and joy approach unto God, and then the body is like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
out of tune, as earth is the moſt predominant element in it, ſo it is a
clog and a burden to the ſoul; Therefore bewail thy natural condition herein;
<hi>Adams</hi> body was expedite and ready, he found no indiſpoſition in his body to

a weight and trouble to thee. <hi>Nazianzene</hi> doth excellently bewail this, <q>How

                           <p>FOurthly, <hi>The body is from the original defiled, in that it is eaſily and readily
moved and ſtirred by the paſſios and affections thereof.</hi> It cannot be denied
but that Heathens and Heretiques have declamed againſt, and reviled the body
of man, (as appeareth by <hi>Tertul de Reſurrect. Carmi.</hi>) as if it were an evil
ſubſtance made from ſome evil principle, hence it is written of <hi>Piotinus</hi> the great
<hi>Plateniſt,</hi> that he was aſhamed his ſoul was in a body, and therefore would by
no means yeeld to have the picture of it drawn, neither would he regard pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
or kindred, or countrey, becauſe his body was from them; but we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
not upon theſe mens account we follow the Scripture-light, and by that
we ſee the body conſociated with the ſoul in evil, whereof this of the paſſions
is not the leaſt. The paſſions they are ſeated in the ſenſitive and material part
of a man, and therefore have an immediate operation upon the body, being
therefore called paſſions, becauſe they make the body to ſuffer, they work a
corporal alteration: Hence anger is defined from its effect, an ebullition or
bubling forth of bloud about the heart; and thus grief, becauſe it is ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſeated in the body, is therefore ſaid to be rottenneſſe to the bones, and it
is ſaid <hi>to work death, 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 10. But it was not thus with the body from the
beginning, <hi>Adam</hi> indeed had ſuch paſſions as do ſuppoſe good in the object,
ſuch as love and delight, though they were bounded and did not tranſgreſſe
their limits, but then he was not capable of thoſe paſſions which do ſuppoſe
evil and hurt, as anger, fear and grief, for theſe would have repugned the
bleſſed eſtate he was created in; but ſince original ſinne hath made this violent
breach upon the whole man, the body is become the foaming and unquiet ſea,
while tempeſts and ſtorms blow upon it, How quickly do theſe paſſions of love,
anger, fear and grief put the whole body out of all order? So that it is not fit
to hear, to pray, to do any ſervice for God; when we are to pray, we are to
<hi>life up our hands without wrath,</hi> 1. Tim. 6. 8. and ſo without any other inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
motion, for theſe make an earthquake (as it were) in the body; Theſe
are like a ruſhing wind and fire, but not ſuch as the holy Ghoſt will appear in;
We may therefore lie down and roll our ſelves upon the ground with ſhame and
confuſion, conſidering what an unquiet, reſtleſs and diſturbed inſtrument to
the ſoul, our body is now become, ſometimes anger that ſet it on fire, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſorrow that is ready to drown it; Even as we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 15. the
poor lunatique perſon vexed with the Devil, he did ofttimes fall into the fire,
and oft into the water two contrary elements, but dangerous: Thus where
paſſions do reign in the body; They oft fall into the fire of anger, and then
as oft into the water of grief and ſorrow; ſo that thy body is moulded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thy paſſion, even as iron heated appeareth no longer iron but fire. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the experience of this ſhould grieve thee, and break thy very heart; How
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:57719:209"/>
many tempeſts and ſtorms do ariſe in thy body daily; What whirlwinds of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do carry thee away violently from reaſon and grace: Oh remember this was
not in the ſtate of innocency, neither will it be in the ſtate of glory. Therefore
be ſo farre from being proud of the beauty or ſtrength of thy body, that the
very thoughts of thy body, as now vitiated by original ſinne may juſtly humble
thee; and though <hi>Plotinus</hi> the <hi>Platoniſt</hi> (as you heard) was juſtly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for the hatred of his body, proceeding upon evil principles, yet <hi>Auſtin</hi>

neceſſary to take notice of ſeveral things relating to the body, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
mentioneth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13, 15, 19. For having there ſpoken briefly to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes
that were then very prevalent about meats, the uſing or not uſing of our
liberty therein, he giveth this remarkable reaſon againſt too much ſervency in
debate thereof, becauſe God ſhall deſtroy both belly and meats; Theſe were
corruptible things, and were but for a temporary uſe, and therefore their hearts
ſhould be more attentive to thoſe things which are of eternal conſequence, A
neceſſary truth to moderate our ſpirits in diſputes of that nature. Having done
this, being to aggravate the ſinne of fornication, which was then generally
thought either no ſinne, or very venial, he bringeth in ſome arguments that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
general make againſt any ſinfulneſs of the body as well as uncleanneſs; As
1. The body is for the Lord (that is Chriſt) and the Lord for the body; our
body is intentionally not for any ſinne, but the Lord Chriſt, and he demands it
as a body dedicated to him; How powerfull ſhould this reaſon be to make us
watch againſt any bodily pollution whatſoever? 2. He argueth, <hi>Know ye not
that your bodies are the members of Chriſt? Know ye not?</hi> He ſuppoſeth that this
ought to be; If it were an undoubted received truth, That our bodies when
regenerated do become members to Chriſt their Head; and if ſo, <hi>Shall I take
the members of Chriſt and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid;</hi> He
apprehendeth matter of trembling and abomination at ſuch a thing, and this
holds of every bodily ſinne, Shall I take the eye of Chriſt, the ear of Chriſt,
the tongue of Chriſt, and imploy it in any luſts or paſſions? God forbid. And
at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe he goeth yet higher, with a <hi>Know ye not again, that your bodies
are the temple of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is in you, and which ye have of God?
This doth denote an holy dedication of the body to God; So that every ſinne
committed in the body hath a ſacriledge in it, with what purity, reverence and
ſobriety ſhould we uſe our bodies, thus it ought to be; but take a man in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
condition, there is his whole body ſet apart to the Devils work, all the parts
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:57719:210"/>
thereof are to <hi>fulfill the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> but when a man is regenerated there
doth become an intimate and unſpeakable conjunction, not only of our ſouls,

bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> but the body naturally is farre from any ſuch myſtical
conjunction with Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>The pollution of the body from the womb is ſeen, in regard of the ſenſes of
the body, which are the moſt noble parts thereof.</hi> They are the windows or gates
to let in all wickedneſs; The greateſt part of our impiety entereth into the heart
by the bodily ſenſes; The ſubordinate end of the ſenſes were to be a preſervation
to the body, and to maintain the natural life thereof; but the principal and
chief end was to be inſtrumental to the ſalvation of the ſoul: God gave us eyes
and ears chiefly thereby to glorifie him, and to help forward the ſalvation of our
ſelves; but how greatly are the bodily ſences fallen from this principal end, <hi>Rev.</hi>
2. 7. and in many other places we have that expreſſion, <hi>He that hath an ear to
hear, let him hear;</hi> no man hath an ear to hear till God open it; and by that
phraſe is denoted, that the ear is principally for this uſe, to hearken to what
God ſaith, and therefore <hi>Rom. 10. Faith</hi> is ſaid to <hi>come by hearing;</hi> Thy ear is
not given thee to hear ſtories and merry jeſts, chiefly for commerce with
men, but to hearken what God out of his Word ſaith to thee; And ſo for the
eyes, they are not to behold wanton objects, or to take delight in ſights, but to
behold the creatures, that thereby God may be glorified; Therefore our eyes,
our ears need Gods grace to ſanctifie them and prepare them for any heavenly
duty, <hi>Prov. 20. 12. The hearing ear and ſeeing eye, the Lord hath made even both
of them.</hi>

pollution upon thee, the ſoul in all the parts thereof, the body in all the
members thereof; Nothing clean and pure, but all over leprous and ulcerous,
How canſt thou any longer delight and put confidence in thy ſelf? Why doeſt
thou not with <hi>Job</hi> ſit abhorring of thy ſelf, and his indeed were ulcers of the
body only, and they were a diſeaſe, but not ſinne, whereas thou art all over in
ſoul and body thus defiled, and that in a proper ſinfull way? Oh that the Spirit
of God would convince all of this ſinne! The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was to cry, <hi>All

was chiefly comprehended, All fleſh is ſinne, and the fruit thereof damnation:
What though this be harſh and unpleaſing to fleſh and bloud? What though
many erroneous ſpirits deny it, or extenuate it, yet ſeeing the Scripture is ſo
clear and evident, with which every man that hath experience of his own heart,
doth alſo willingly concurre? Believe it ſeriouſly and humble your ſelves deeply,
think not tranſient and ſuperficial thoughts will prevail, as the weighnneſs of
the matter doth require; If ever thy heart can be broken and ſoftned, let it be
diſcovered here, riſe with the thoughts of it, walk with the thoughts of it, and
leave it not, till thou find the belief thereof drive thee out of thy ſelf with fear
and trembling, finding no reſt till thou art intereſſed in Chriſt.</p>

ſo born, becauſe conceived after a miraculous manner, it therefore neceſſarily
followeth, that all others are comprehended under this guilt; Though you may
ſee ſome men from the youth up, leſſe vicious then others, more ingenuous and
civil then others, yet even theſe are by nature all over ſinfull; ſo that there is
no ſuch thing as a natural probity and goodneſs, of which the <hi>Socinians</hi> diſpute,

not only from all actual ſinne, but alſo original and birth-ſinne is evident by
this Text, which containeth an anſwer of the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> who with ſome trouble and amazement had queſtioned, how ſhe ſhould
conceive a Sonne, who knew not a man? The Angels anſwer conſiſteth in the

as ſome endeavour: It is true, The works of God <hi>ad extra,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the three Perſons, yet there is a peculiar order and appropriation,
and therefore the preparing and forming of Chriſts body out of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> is peculiarly aſcribed unto the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Efficacy</hi> is ſet down in two words, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, which is to be underſtood
of the operation of the holy Ghoſt, not his eſſence, for that is every where;
The like expreſſion, though to another purpoſe is <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond word is <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, concerning which there is more difficulty;
The word in the New Teſtament is applied to a Cloud covering a man, with a
Dative Caſe, though <hi>Favorinus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> make it to have uſually an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſative,
<hi>Matth. 17. 5. Mark</hi> 9. 7. and <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 15. ſuch an overſhadowing,

Others which may be additional to the former, render it, <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhall

among Poets the word is ſaid to be uſed,

body of Chriſt was formed of the maſs, and fleſhly ſubſtance adminiſtred by
the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> But this we are to take heed of, leſt the mind of man ſhould
apprehend any indecent thing in this great myſtery; Therefore <hi>Smalcius</hi> the
<hi>Socinian,</hi> his aſſertion is to be rejected with great abomination, that feared not

be ſometimes put for the Maſculine, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. yet here it is emphatical to
ſhew the extenſiveneſs of Chriſts holineſs, that he is all over holy, having not
the leaſt ſpot of ſinne, and that not only as God, for ſo he is eſſentially and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57719:211"/>
infinitely holy, nor only by the perſonal Union with the Godhead, but in his
humane Nature, both originally having no natural ſinne in him, and habitually
and alſo actually, in which ſenſe he is every way holy.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Predicate</hi> is, <hi>He ſhall be called the Sonne of God,</hi> that is, he ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

                        <p>Laſtly, There is the note of <hi>Inference,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>Therefore alſo.</hi> At this the
<hi>Socinians</hi> greatly catch, for they denying Chriſt to be the Sonne of God by
eternal generation, ſay, That he is called the Sonne of God for many other
Reaſons, whereof one is gradual to another; ſo that he was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
the Sonne of God, till after his Reſurrection, when he was indowed
with that glorious power God had given him, ſitting down at the right hand of
God.</p>
                        <p>Now the firſt reaſon, why Chriſt is called the Sonne of God, is (ſay they)
<q>not becauſe of any eternal generation from the Father, as if he had been God
before he was man from all eternity,</q> but from this miraculous and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
production in time; And they affirm, <q>Nothing can be plainer, becauſe
when he had ſaid, <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhould over ſhadow her,</hi> then is added, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhould be called the Sonne of God.</hi>
                           </q> The Remonſtrants they do (or
at leaſt ſeem to do) hold Chriſt to be the Sonne of God by eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Apol. Confeſ. c. de Trin.</note>
and alſo to be called ſo for other cauſes alſo, as (<hi>viz.</hi>) by this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
production; And it may not be denied but <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Papiſt doth
plead for this, as the reaſon in the Text, why he ſhould be called the Sonne of
God: So that (ſaith he) if Chriſt had been a pure man, yet by this
miraculous production, he would have been made the Sonne of God.
But <hi>Gontzen</hi> his fellow Jeſuite doth anſwer his reaſon; <hi>Zanchy</hi> alſo is too
liberal in this point, acknowledging that Chriſt is here to be called the Sonne
of God, becauſe of this miraculous communication of an humane being
to him. But his is no wayes to be received, for the note of inference is not
from the holy Ghoſts overſhadowing, as a cauſe of his filiation, but as from
the ſign; It is (I ſay) an argument not from the cauſe, but the ſign; ſo that
the meaning is, This extraordinary way of conceiving without a man, is a ſign
that he is the true God, who was before promiſed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap.
9. <hi>That a Virgin ſhould conceive, and his Name ſhould be called Immanuel,
God with us;</hi> For that there is a reſpect to that Prophecy, appeareth plainly
by <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 23. And indeed it muſt needs be ſo, for Chriſt is never called the Son
of God, becauſe born of a woman, though in a miraculous manner, but the
Sonne of man alwayes; And if this Expoſition ſhould be granted, Chriſt
would have two filiations, one as whereby he was made the Sonne of God, and
another as whereby he was made the Sonne of man. It is alſo abſurd to ſay,
Chriſt may be called the Sonne of God for ſeveral cauſes, when there is one
true and proper one, he that is a Sonne by natural generation, cannot be by
Adoption, or any other adventitious cauſe.</p>
                        <p>Again, That particle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, is urged both of old and late, <hi>That alſo which

                        <p>Thus you have the Text vindicated, only one thing more is to be obſerved,
the expreſſion uſed by the Angel, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Which ſhall be born of thee,</hi> doth
fully demonſtrate, That Chriſt had a body framed by the holy Ghoſt of the
ſubſtance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he had not a phantaſtical body, neither
did he bring a body from Heaven, and ſo paſſe through the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as
ſome of old and late have dreamed; Therefore <hi>Marcion</hi> who denied the true
body of Chriſt, and thereby alſo his Conception and Nativity, did wholly
evade this Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> and would not receive it as Canonical, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Tertullian, Mus ponticus,</hi> becauſe of his corroding and gnawing out of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57719:212"/>
Scripture, as he pleaſed, when he ſaw any place make againſt him. The words
thus explained, Obſerve</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That Chriſt onely is born holy, and that all the reſt of mankind is polluted with
ſinne.</hi> It is a ſaying, <hi>Exceptio format regulam,</hi> if then Chriſt be exempted, ſo
that it is his peculiar priviledge, then certainly all the reſt are included: As
there are ſome, who make all men pure by nature; So ſome have blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
vented, <hi>That Chriſt had original ſinne:</hi> Yea a <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> writeth,
<hi>That the humane nature of Chriſt had that fight and conflict in it which is
between the reaſon and the appetite,</hi> which we ſay muſt neceſſarly be ſinne.
The <hi>Socinians</hi> they affirm, <hi>That Chriſt had a holy of ſinne,</hi> but then by
ſinne they mean onely infirmities and weakneſſes, not that which is truly ſo,
for this alledging, <hi>Heb. 7. 27. Heb.</hi> 9. 28. The true meaning whereof we ſhall
give anon, But with Chriſtians we need not long to inſiſt upon the proof of
this, <hi>That Chriſt was without all ſinne, either original or actual,</hi> typified
therein by the High Prieſt in the Law, who had this written upon him, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
to the Lord,</hi> and therefore he is not onely holy <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, but alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
He that ſanctifieth and maketh us holy by his bloud; And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
demonſtrateth his preheminency above all the Prieſts of the Law, <hi>That
they were to offer for their own ſinnes as well as for the ſinnes of the people,</hi>
but ſo it was not with him, if he had had ſinne in him, he could not have been
our Saviour, but he would have needed a Saviour himſelf; yea <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. he
is called <hi>Sanctum ſanctorum,</hi> the Holy of holies, or moſt holy: And to this
truth the Scripture ſpeaketh clearly, not onely when it ſaith, <hi>That be knew
no ſinne, and that no guile was found in his mouth,</hi> which happily might be
thought to be limited only to actual ſinne, (but alſo as to the original and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
evil of mans nature,) that though he be a man of like nature with us, yet
ſinne is ſtill exempted, <hi>Rom. 8. 3. He ſent his own Sonne in the likeneſſe of
ſinfull fleſh,</hi> not in the likeneſs of the fleſh, for he had our true fleſh upon
him, but in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, he had not the ſinne of our nature,
though he had the nature it ſelf: As the brazen Serpent was like a Serpent, but
it had not the poiſon and venom of a Serpent; And certainly ſpeaking this as
the peculiar commendation of the Sonne of God ſent into the world, it plainly
evidenceth that all other are indeed ſinfull fleſh, and not onely in the likeneſs
of it; Now he is ſaid to be in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, becauſe he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to miſery and death, which is the reward due to ſinners; We have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a comfortable place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. for Chriſts holineſs is the foundation
of all our conſolation; This is that which we muſt reſt upon under the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of the Law, under the ſtrict demands of juſtice, when God ſhall
require, that righteouſneſſe we once had or call for that purity, which the Law
doth command, our ſupport is this, though we have not a perfect holineſſe,
yet Chriſt our High-Prieſt and Surety hath; and to this end is that place, when
the Apoſtle had ſhewed, we had an <hi>High Prieſt</hi> who was touched compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
with a ſenſe and feeling of all our infirmities, <hi>and that he was tempted in all
things like unto us,</hi> he addeth, <hi>but without ſinne;</hi> That temptation is not meant
of enticing to ſinne, but it is as much as exerciſe and affliction, he was ſubject
unto the common miſeries of mans nature; yea the Apoſtle meaneth more,
not only the ſubſtance of mans nature, but the affections and qualities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he had grief and fear upon him, onely all theſe were without ſinne; And
this is to be our comfort, that in all the miſeries, all the oppoſitions he confli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with; yea in all thoſe ſoul-affections and agonies, even when he cried
out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me?</hi> yet ſtill there was no ſinne,
now all this was for us, we needed a Saviour that could in an holy manner
work out our redemption for us; So that it is not our inherent holineſs, but
Chriſts holineſs that we muſt truſt to, when we have to do with God. We have
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57719:212"/>
the Apoſtle alſo again conſidering this property of our High-Prieſt, becauſe it
is ſo uſefull, <hi>Heb. 7. 26. It behoved us to have ſuch an High-Prieſt, who is holy,
harmleſs, undefiled ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> How many glorious properties are
here? The <hi>Socinians (Schlitingius in locum.</hi>) would apply this to Chriſts
condition in Heaven, his immortality and glory there, expounding this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and harmleſneſs not in reſpect of grace inherent, but freedom from infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and miſeries, becauſe it is added, <hi>Made higher then the Heavens;</hi> But
theſe properties do belong to him while on earth, with relation to what he ſhall
have hereafter, for that ſheweth Chriſt is above Angels, and that no Angel
could be our Mediator; Now thoſe ſeveral properties in Chriſt ſignifie the ſame
thing, only the laſt is very emphatical, <hi>Separate from ſinners,</hi> not that he was
not among ſinners, while he was in the world, but this ſheweth, that he was
ſegregated, or divided from all men in reſpect of the ſinne of their natures,
though he communicated with them in their natures; and therefore, though
happily ſome High-prieſts, as <hi>Aaron</hi> might be holy and unblameable, yet none
of them was ſeparate from ſinners. Theſe places may abundantly confirm this
fundamental Article, That Chriſt only was pure from original ſinne, and that
all thoſe who deny original ſinne, make Chriſt to have no priviledge in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
but that we are all alike, pure in reſpect of nature; Well then, How
ſhall we underſtand thoſe places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27. where it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt needed not

<hi>He once offered himſelf for the ſinnes of the people,</hi> for if it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with the other paſſage, it would be contradictory to the Apoſtles ſcope,
which is to ſhew, that he was <hi>ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> and therefore had no cauſe
to offer for any of his own. The other Text is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. where it is ſaid,
<hi>Chriſt ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſinne,</hi> which might ſeem to imply, that
he had ſinne in the firſt coming; but the Text doth not ſpeak of any ſinne of his
own inherent in him, but of ours which was laid upon him, as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>He who knew no ſinne became ſinne,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. And indeed to ſay with the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi>
That Chriſt offered for his own ſinnes, that is, his bodily infirmities,
is a moſt abſurd expreſſion, for all Sacrifices were for ſinne properly ſo, or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally,
and in a typical ſenſe, not for what was a meer affliction or bodily miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
So that from theſe things we may undoubtedly conclude, <hi>That Chriſt and
Chriſt only of all mankind, is not polluted with this original contagion.</hi>

                        <p>CHriſt (we heard) had this peculiar prerogative alone to be the holy one, the
contrary in the Text is true of every one born in a natural way; To every
mother, we may ſay, that unholy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called
the child of the Devil, for it is by nature the child of wrath, only it may ſeem
difficult to give the reaſon why he is exempted; for ſeeing he is a man <hi>ejuſdem
ſpeciei</hi> of the ſame nature with us, and though he had his humane nature in an
extraordinary manner by the over-ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, yet that doth
not hinder but he is a man as well as we are: Even as <hi>Adam</hi> was made a man
after a different manner from his poſterity, they by generation but he by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
production out of the earth in reſpect of his body, yet we are men of the
ſame kind with him; ſeeing then Chriſt was a man though he had a different
original from us, will not that neceſſarily involve him in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne? And if
it be ſaid that the power of the Holy Ghoſt ſanctified that corpulent maſs of
which Chriſts body did conſiſt, that may happily free him from original inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſinne, but how can it from original imputed ſinne? Muſt not Chriſt be
ſaid to ſinne in <hi>Adam</hi> though he had no inherent defilement becauſe he was a
man? yea the Scripture doth not only make him a man, but calleth him the
ſeed of <hi>David</hi> and of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he came out of their loynes, and which is
more, <hi>Luke</hi> reckoning the genealogy of Chriſt by his humane nature doth carry
it up to <hi>Adam</hi> making him the ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and if the ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> how
could he not but ſinne in <hi>Adam</hi> by imputation, though he had none by inheſion.
This conſideration hath ſo much ſtrength, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> though he is labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to prove that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was exempted from original inherent
ſinne, that ſhe had an immaculate conception, yet be confeſſeth ſhe had origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
imputed ſinne that ſhe ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe ſhe was in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To anſwer then this Objection about Chriſt. The <hi>Arminians</hi> (as you
heard) glory in their invention of <hi>Arminius,</hi> as if he only had found out the
true anſwer to this, and not the Reformed Divines; The reaſon (ſaith he) of
Chriſts immunity from all ſinne by <hi>Adam,</hi> was becauſe Chriſt had his being
not by vertue of that original bleſſing, <hi>Increaſe</hi> and <hi>multiply,</hi> but by a ſpecial
promiſe made after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall; ſo that Chriſts being is not ſuppoſed till <hi>Adam</hi>
had fallen, and then upon a ſpecial promiſe (<hi>viz.) The ſeed of the woman to
bruiſe the head of the Serpent,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. Chriſt is to become man; Thus Chriſt
could not be any way included in him. This hath ſome truth in it though the
anſwer be not every way cogent; for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was born (as we argued formerly)
by a ſpecial promiſe, there being no poſſibility for his exiſtence in a natural
way, yet he was born in original ſinne; and although to me it ſeemeth moſt
conſonant to Scripture, that Chriſt would not have been made man, unleſs
<hi>Adam</hi> had fallen, becauſe the end of his coming into the fleſh is ſaid to be a
<hi>Saviour and a Redeemer;</hi> yet there are men of great learning that hold, Chriſt
would have been made man howſoever, though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, and to ſuch
this reaſon would be of no great validity. But it muſt be confeſſed, that Chriſt
could not be included in <hi>Adam,</hi> for the Scripture maketh him a publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and head to believers as <hi>Adam</hi> was to all men; hence he is called the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam,</hi> ſo that Chriſt was a publique perſon and head as well as <hi>Adam,</hi>
and one publique perſon eſpecially in an oppoſite way could not be repreſented
by another; Though this be ſo, yet we ſhall adhere to the Anſwer that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
given by Reformed Divines, That Chriſt therefore was free from ſinne,
becauſe conceived in that miraculous manner, and though he had his being
in reſpect of his corpulent ſubſtance from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yet this was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially
only, not by way of efficiency, and any active diſpoſition; ſo that
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:57719:213"/>
Chriſt could not be ſaid by imputation to be in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeeing there was no
efficient diſpoſition in <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity to cauſe his humane being. That is
juſtly rejected as a fond conceit of <hi>Galatinus</hi> and others, who that they might
maintain the fleſh of Chriſt to be free from ſinne, as well in himſelf as parents,
affirm, <q>That God did in <hi>Adam</hi> deſign and ſeperate as it were ſome part of
his ſubſtance, that it might be preſerved from the law of ſinne, and that this
was ſucceſſively tranſmitted even to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſo of it Chriſts

                        </p>
                        <p>Let us now conſider this Doctrine as it is excluſive of all other of mankind,
only Chriſt (we ſay) is free, all the reſt born of mankind in a natural way are
all over defiled with this native pollution. To clear this I ſhall proceed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Propoſitions.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That the only way by which original ſinne as inherent is communicated
to Adaems poſterity is by natural generation;</hi> Not indeed by generation ſimply,
for that is by Gods inſtitution, and a good thing in its kind, but by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a man that is fallen and corrupt; ſome few have thought that if <hi>Adam</hi>
had not fallen, <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity would have been multiplyed not by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
but by ſome other way, which is a moſt irrational conceit: If then
<hi>Adams</hi> children abiding in integrity had been by generation, then thereby
would have been conveyed original righteouſneſs, and an holy nature, as there
is now a ſinful and impure nature; original ſinne cometh then to us by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from ſinful parents; ſo that if God ſhould miraculouſly create ſome
men <hi>de novo,</hi> make children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of ſtones, theſe would have no ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne; neither if they ſhould beget children would original ſinne be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to them, becauſe theſe would not be in <hi>Adam</hi> as a corrupt root; as for
ſuch a Queſtion, <hi>What if God ſhould make a man or woman out of the rib, or
ſhoulder, or any other part of man now fallen, as Eve was at firſt made of a rib,
whether ſuch a perſon would have original ſinne?</hi> It is a queſtion of needleſs cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,
and ſo no Anſwer is to be formed to it: This is enough, That the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way and meanes whereby we become polluted in ſinne is, becauſe we
are begotten and born of ſinful parents, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal 51.
Auſtin</hi> indeed limiteth it to the libidinous diſpoſition of mankind in begetting
of children, he ſeemeth to lay the whole cauſe upon that, but he is carried out
too immoderately in that point againſt the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> for though parents
ſhould have no ſinful actual luſt, yet becauſe they are ſinful originally, this is
enough to infect their poſterity; and if this were ſo, it would follow, That
godly parents the more ſanctified and mortified they were, they would have
children leſs infected with original ſinne, then the children of thoſe who are
groſſely wicked and unclean; It is then becauſe we are born of parents pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Adam,</hi> that we alſo are polluted; as for that famous Queſtion how ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne ſhould be communicated to the ſoul of a man by generation, ſeeing
that is created? we have already ſpoken to that: The ſumme whereof is,
That though we are to conceive of the ſoul, as pure, while coming from God,
yet conſidering it <hi>in termino,</hi> as the part of man who deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi>
ſo it is polluted, not by any phyſical cauſe for that ſinne cannot have, but a
moral one, which is the firſt trangreſſion of <hi>Adam;</hi> for although that hath had
no being theſe thouſand yeares, yet it is not requiſite that a moral cauſe ſhould
exiſt to produce its effect. Becauſe then the ſoul in the ſame inſtance it is created,
it is alſo united, as a forme to the <hi>compoſitum,</hi> which is man, Therefore it is
deprived of its primitive purity, not by any poſitive efficiency, but meerly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,
God denying his image to it, becauſe the ſoul is part of a man, it is
corrupted; therefore if the ſoul were only an aſſiſtant form not inwardly
compounding man, it would not receive pollution by generation. Hence</p>

                           <pb n="394" facs="tcp:57719:214"/>
The ſecond Propoſition is, <hi>That the children even of holy and ſanctified perſons,
who have their original ſinne in the guilt of it quite taken away, and in the filth and
power of it much ſubdued, yet they beget children in original ſinne, and ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are by nature the children of wrath as well as of the moſt profligate and wicked
men.</hi> It is uſuall with <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> to charge upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi>
that they deny original ſinne in part (at leaſt) becauſe they affirm, That the
children of believers are holy; but herein they do either ignorantly or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
calumniate, for they ſay no more then what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in that
famous place, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 15. Elſe were your children unclean, but now are they
holy;</hi> on the ſenſe of which place I ſhall not here inlarge, having inſiſted upon
it before; The ſumme of which then delivered is, That they are called holy,
becauſe of that external Covenant, whereby God takes believers and their ſeed
into his family, ſo that they have not that uncleanneſs upon them which the
children of Heathens have, but have a right of admiſſion into Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
ſo that this outward Covenant [holineſs] may and doth conſiſt
with that inherent natural pollution that they bring with them into the world.
And although parents be never ſo eminent in holineſs, yet their children are
full of ſinne, and ſo obnoxious unto the wrath of God; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are fathers to their children, not as godly, but as men, and original
ſinne is the conſequent of mans nature, whereas the parents grace is a perſonal
excellency, and ſo cannot be tranſmitted: Even as learned parents do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
learning to their children, but they are born in ignorance as well as others;
Thoſe known ſimilies of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> are full to this purpoſe, <hi>A Jew that was
circumciſed, be begat children not circumciſed, but uncircumciſed and the ſeed in
the ground, though ſewen without huskes, yet it produceth corn with huskes; ſeeing
then holineſs is a perſonal qualification of the parent, and original ſinne the common
conſequent of mans nature inſeperable from it, no wonder if parents, who are the
children of God by grace, beget children of wrath by nature.</hi> Hence</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The third Propoſition is,</hi> That if any Infants ſhould be converted even in the
womb, yet we may truely ſay of them, that they are by nature polluted with ſinne,
and deſerve the wrath of God, for what they have by meer grace, doth not take away,
but ſuppoſe they have ſinne by nature: <hi>There are two inſtances in Scripture of
Infants, that might be thought to be freed from original ſinne; The firſt is of</hi>
Jeremiah cap 1. 5. <hi>where the Lord ſaith to</hi> Jeremiah, Before I formed thee in the
belly I knew thee, and before then cameſt forth out of the womb I ſanctified thee, and I
ordained thee a Prophet to the Nations. <hi>But</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, Every one may eaſily ſee this is nothing to the Prophets conception or
birth in ſinne, for what is ſaid here in the Text, is attributed to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> before
any of theſe; ſo that all that could be prooved from hence would be, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi>
had no original ſinne, either before he was conceived or born, and who
ſaith a man hath original inherent ſinne before he hath a being? But</p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is a two-fold ſanctification, the one by ſetting a part to an
office, and the other by making internally holy through renovation: now the
Context is clear, that this Verſe ſpeaketh of the former ſanctification, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That God had from his very beginning, while in the womb, purpoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that he ſhould in time be a Prophet to preach to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
for that is expreſly added, to ſhew what kind of ſanctification he meaneth, <hi>I
ordained thee to be a Prophet to the Nations;</hi> we have two expreſſions like this,
one to the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 1, 5. which though in an eminent manner is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Chriſt, yet was in ſome ſenſe alſo true of the Prophet, <hi>The Lord hath
called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my
name:</hi> And again, <hi>The Lord formed me from the womb to be his ſervant:</hi> This is
ſpoken of the office he was ſet apart unto; The other inſtance is, <hi>Gal. 1. 15.
Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>That God had ſeperated him from his mothers womb,</hi> that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57719:214"/>
was not ſurely from original ſinne, for he ſpeaketh immediately before of the
ſinfulneſs he had once been guilty of; but his meaning is, he was ſeparated from
the womb in Gods Decree to be an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, though for a long
while he was a perſecutor of his Church; Thus you ſee it is the former ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, and not the latter, and if we do ſuppoſe that
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> even in his mothers womb was then alſo ſanctified in the later way
(for none can deny, but that even then God might renew his nature by grace)
yet that will not exclude him from ſinne but neceſſarily ſuppoſe it, for he that
needed to be made holy in the womb, it is plain he was ſinfull in the womb;
<hi>Ludovicus de Tena.</hi> who handleth this Queſtion about <hi>Jeremiah (lib. 2. Iſa. ſcrip.
diffic.</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">a</hi>) concludeth, That by this expreſſion is meant the cleanſing of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
from original ſinne in the womb of his mother, and in debating arguments
<hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> doth refuſe that interpretation of the deputation of the Prophet to
his miniſterial office, becauſe otherwiſe here would be no more peculiar thing
promiſed to <hi>Jeremiah:</hi> And making an Objection to himſelf from <hi>Auſtin,
Renaſci per gratiam ſupponit naſci per naturam,</hi> whereas <hi>Jeremiaeh</hi> is thus ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before he was born, therefore we cannot underſtand it of regeneration;
He anſwereth it thus, That their is a nativity in the womb, for the perſon hath
a being before his local egreſs, and ſuch a birth is enough for regeneration;
by which it appeareth, that if this ſhould be interpreted of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s purgation
from original ſinne, (which is not probable) it doth not incommodate us.
And ſo we come to the ſecond example, and that is, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, while in
his mothers womb, of whom we read this admirable thing recorded by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
<hi>Luke,</hi> cap. 1, 41. that when <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was ſaluted by the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
The babe leaped in the womb,</hi> which is repeated again, v. 44. <hi>Aſſoon as the
voice of thy ſalutation ſounded in my eares, the babe leaped in my womb for joy;</hi>
now you muſt know, that this great motion of the child was not in a meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
way, as ſometimes children may do in the womb, when the mother is
greatly affected, but it was in a divine and ſupernatural way, even as <hi>Rebeckah,</hi>
when her twinnes did ſtrive in the womb; this was an extraordinary progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
cauſed in a ſupernatural way by God. And although <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place
ſaith, <q>That it is natural to the fruit of the womb to leap or move, when the
mother is moved with joy, yet he acknowledgeth that <hi>Luke</hi> doth here note
ſome extraordinary thing, and that this leaping was by the ſecret motion of
the Spirit of God;</q> which doth detect the horrible impudence and ſlander of
<hi>Maldonate,</hi> who is not aſhamed to ſay, <q>That <hi>Calvin</hi> doth own nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what is natural in this,</q> for which (in deriſion) he calleth him <hi>pius autor,</hi>
we ſee by this, how little we may truſt ſuch men. We muſt then conclude even
the babe at that time was affected with joy upon the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s coming to
his mother; and this ſuppoſeth, that the child alſo was filled with the Holy
Ghoſt; yea v. 15. it is expreſly ſaid of <hi>John, That he ſhould be filled with the
holy Ghoſt from the womb:</hi> But if this be granted, then it is greatly controverted,
Whether the babe did this with ſenſe and knowledge that Chriſt was preſent;
or whether it was by the motion of the Spirit of God in the child, that knowing
nothing at all? There are probable arguments on both ſides; The <hi>Lutherans</hi>
they do greedily imbrace that opinion, that maketh the child, while in the
womb to have actual faith and knowledge of Chriſt, and from thence they do
peremptorily conclude, That Infants have actual ſinnes, and that they may
have actual faith and other graces; but this is againſt experience, and if we do
grant, that <hi>John</hi> had ſuch actual knowledge of Chriſt, yet this was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and miraculous, and muſt no more be attributed to all children, then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all Aſſes, becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi>'s once did. Many Authors conclude that
<hi>John</hi> did rejoyce with ſome ſenſe and apprehenſion, and for this reaſon he is
ſaid <hi>to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and joy muſt ariſe from ſome knowledge and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57719:215"/>
apprehenſion: neither (ſay they) will it follow from hence that he did
not looſe this actual knowledge afterwards, but had it alwayes while an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
for we ſee the Prophets (though men grown up) yet had not the ſpirit
of prophecy at all times. But come we to our buſineſs, Let it be granted,
that <hi>John</hi> had actual faith, that he was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, that
doth not hinder, but that by nature he was a child of wrath and full of
ſinne; for this grace is beſtowed upon him when by nature ſinfull, and
doth no more argue he had no ſinne in him before, then perſons grown
up have not, when the Holy Ghoſt was poured on them: And although
it be ſaid, <hi>He was filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that doth not imply, that
all ſinne was wholly taken out of him, no more then the Apoſtles and all
others were quite purged from ſinne, when they are ſaid to be filled
with the Holy Ghoſt. Beſides the Scripture (as <hi>Calvin</hi> conſidereth well)
doth not ſay, <hi>John</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghoſt in the womb, but
from his mothers womb, which he thus expounds, <q>That <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt
did betimes, even from his Infancy manifeſt what an excellent Prophet
he was like to be, becauſe the Spirit of God did even then give many
Demonſtrations thereof,</q> and thus (though not ſo extraordinarily) God
ſometimes doth give to ſome his ſanctifying Spirit even from the cradle
almoſt, they begin betimes to put forth many excellent ſigns of that grace,
which will flouriſh more in their elder yeares. <hi>Timothy</hi> from a child is ſaid to
have <hi>the knowledg of the Scriptures from a Child,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. And ſome
have the fear of God planted ſo early in their hearts, that they cannot
know any remarkable time of their converſion, yea they cannot remember
but that alwayes they had ſuch a tenderneſs about ſinne, and love to
good things, yet we muſt not think for all this, they were not born in
ſinne; we muſt not ſay of them, as was ſaid of <hi>Bonaventure</hi> for his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs
in his youth, <hi>In hoc homine non peccavit Adam;</hi> No, theſe have
by nature the ſame ſeed of all impiety, and their younger yeares would
have demonſtrated this poiſon, as well as it doth in others, but the
grace of God doth prevent: Oh let ſuch <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s that can ſay, <hi>They feared
God from the youth,</hi> admire the goodneſs of God to them! he might have
ſuffered that original ſinne in thee, to make thee wallow in ſuch mire and
filthy luſts, as other young perſons do: Oh take heed of thinking thou
haſt a better nature then they, that thou haſt not ſo much original ſinne
in thee as others! but walk humbly, leſt God ſometime or other leave
thee to let thee ſee what is in thy heart, that all the ſparkes of original
ſinne are not put out, and then, though to thy great grief thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
there is a ſuch a thing in thee.</p>

Heathen, Noble or ignoble, civil or prophane, male or female, but all are
one in original ſinne, becauſe all are of <hi>Adam</hi> by natural generation, and thereby
original ſin is propagated to all, which Doctrine is to be explicated in more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.

Firſt, <hi>Though our natural generation from corrupted Parents, be the means
by which we all are born polluted and depraved, yet this doth not exclude the
juſtice of God, and his righteous Decree, that from a ſinfull fountain ſhall
ariſe ſuch polluted ſtreams, from ſuch a bitter root alſo bitter fruit, but doth
neceſſarily preſuppoſe it.</hi> So that the juſt judgement of God in puniſhing of all
mankind, for <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt tranſgreſſion muſt alwayes be acknowledged, and
we muſt not ſeparate the natural propagation of ſinne from the ſentence and
Decree of God; For if this were the only reaſon, that we became guilty of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, becauſe in his lions, then all <hi>Adam</hi>'s other ſinnes ſhould be made
ours, as well as that firſt act of diſobedience in eating of the foridden fruit,
and the ſinnes of our immediate parents in whoſe loines we were, ſhould be
tranſmitted to us, as well as <hi>Adam</hi>'s; yea happily, if this were ſo, then the
longer original ſinne hath been propagated, it would ſtill grow more evil, and
thereby men in the later age of the world become more polluted with original
ſinne, then men in the former age; but <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> who were the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> were as deeply plunged in this native defilement, as
any are now. Therefore ſome learned men, though in this Controverſie they
do allow the phraſe of the <hi>Propagation of original ſinne,</hi> becauſe commonly
uſed, yet would gladly have a more commodious and fit expreſſion; Hence
they do more willingly uſe the word <hi>Traduction,</hi> or happily tranſmitting and
transfuſing; for the ſinne is not properly propagated, but the humane nature
to which original corruption adhereth, becauſe we have not that ſo properly
from our parents, though by them, as of <hi>Adam;</hi> for the reaſon why upon
the conjunction of ſoul and body an Infant is immediately defiled with ſinne, is
not becauſe born of ſuch parents, but becauſe of <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore though
they be the cauſe of being a man, yet <hi>Adam</hi> is of being a ſinfull man; So that
as all the lines from the circumference do equally meet in the center; Thus do
all mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> and he that is now born, doth as immediately partake of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as <hi>Cain</hi> did, though ſo many thouſand years ago born immediately
of <hi>Adam;</hi> Original ſin then doth not in length of time either increaſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
but we all have our polluted natures, as polluted, directly from <hi>Adam,</hi>
and immediately, though as nature from our parents, and ſo adminiſter the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to which original is applied, and ſo in a remote diſtance from our common
parent; Let not then any man think, what ſhould we trouble our ſelves
with <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, and complain of him, who lived ſo many years ago?
What is his tranſgreſſion to us, who live ſo many generations after him?
For thou haſt this natural pollution, as immediately from him, as if thou
hadſt been his immediate ſon, neither is thy parents ſinfulneſs communicated to
thee, ſimply becauſe thy parents, but becauſe <hi>Adams,</hi> who was the common pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
This rightly conſidered would affect us as much as if we had lived immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, neither would the ſpace of ſo many years ſince his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
at all abate our ſad and aggravating thoughts of it.</p>

it is very abſurd, either from a prepoſterous admiration, or ſome
other reſpect to exempt any born in a natural way from this birth ſinne.</hi> In
this way we find the Papiſts greatly offending concerning the Virgin, out of a
ſinfull admiration of her, thinking thereby to honour Chriſt: Some of them
do peremptorily conclude, That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was born without original
ſinne, and thereupon they keep the feaſt of her Immaculate and undefiled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception:
Yea ſome have gone ſo farre as to ſay the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s mother, was
alſo without original ſinne; And if we proceed upon their principles. Why
ſhould they not affirm ſo? For as they ſay, It is for the honour of Chriſt to
have a Mother without original ſinne, ſo it would be for the honour of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
to have her Mother without ſinne likewiſe. Now (I ſay) ſome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
determine, That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceived without ſinne. <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
his great zeal and devotion in this point, is abundantly declared by him in
his Tractate of the praiſes of S. <hi>Anna,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. yea he is ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in his aſſertion of the immaculate Conception of the Mother of Chriſt,
that he ſaith, <hi>Si erramus pietas (imo Deus ipſe) eſt in causâ;</hi> Piety, yea
God himſelf is the cauſe of it. It hath been a very hot Diſpute between the
<hi>Deminicans</hi> and the <hi>Franciſcans. Bellarmine</hi> goeth a middle way, he will not have
it an Article of Faith to believe ſhe was thus pure, but yet he ſaith, It is a moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
opinion, and therefore, he giveth ſeveral Arguments for it: But <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſaith
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the Scriptures and ancient Fathers ſpeak excluſively, that none but
Chriſt was freed from original ſinne; as if it would be an high offence in him to
depart from them, though he doth not judge others. The late heretical Writer
<hi>D. J. T.</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> would call him if alive, for he maketh every one that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not all mankind, except Chriſt, to be born in original ſinne, ſo as the fleſh

never be ended upon their accounts, that he <hi>Alexander</hi>-like hath cut in pieces
this Gordian-knot, Therefore he affirmeth, not only her, but all her family
(and why not all mankind?) were free from it: but it is a <hi>Thraſonical</hi> boaſt, and
withall full of falſhood, for hereby original ſin is wholly removed, made to be a
meer <hi>Non ens;</hi> The Subject of the Queſtion is quite taken away, ſo that by
his principles, all the Diſputations about original ſin will be <hi>de non ente,</hi> as he
acknowledgeth in ſome ſenſe, a ſtriving about a ſhadow; yea, and which is the
moſt horrible, every one ſhall now be born as pure as Chriſt, in reſpect of his
humane nature; There is no difference between Chriſt and all the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as in reſpect of their natural immunity from ſinne. His <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi>
would have informed him better, when he ſaith, <hi>Stromatum lib.</hi> 1,
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, The Word
(that is, Chriſt) is only without ſinne, for in all men it is imbred to ſinne,
whatſoever <hi>Clemens</hi> at other times may deliver about this original ſinne, here
he acknowledgeth it, and indeed it is eaſie out of the Ancients to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
paſſages that ſeem to ſavour oppoſite Doctrines; But concerning this
poiſonous opinion, we ſhall have conſtant occaſion to treat of. As for the
<hi>Franciſcans</hi> and other Popiſh Writers, that plead for the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s purity,
they can bring no Scripture, but urge ſome plauſible reaſons, as thinking
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:57719:216"/>
thereby to give her the more honour, eſpecially revelations and miracles are
ſtrongly urged in this point; But the Scripture is to be our Rule in this matter,
and there we ſee none exempted. Beſides the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> cals Chriſt her Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
which implieth neceſſarily, that ſhe had ſinne, yea ſhe had alſo actual
ſins, as might be proved, although the Papiſts will not endure to hear of it;
Neither doth this make to the diſhonour of Chriſt, to be born of a mother that
had ſinne in her, for ſeeing he is ſeparated from it, it is his greater glory that he
alone is exempted: And beſides, we ſee that the more Chriſt was debaſed and
made low (but without ſinne) hereby is he the more honoured as a Mediator:
Hence it was that he was born of one that was very poor and mean, not of a rich
and great perſon, as appeareth by the Sacrifice offered of two pigeons for her
purification, he was alſo born in a ſtable, laid in a manger, all which demonſtrate
the lowlineſs of Chriſts humane being; Hence the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
the Genealogy of Chriſt, doth name <hi>Thamar</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba</hi> whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
was famous, and yet hereby there is no diſhonour to Chriſt, becauſe
the lower he humbled himſelf for our ſake, the greater is his love demonſtrated;
and ſo his glory of a Saviour more exalted: This opinion of honouring Chriſt
in an humane way, hath brought in ſeveral errours into the Church; for it was
becauſe of this in part, that the <hi>Marcioniſts</hi> denied Chriſt to have a true real
body, they thought it ignominious to him to be born as other children are, and
ſo in Popery there are marvellous legends, and wonderfull miracles feigned about
Chriſt while an Infant; The ſureſt way then to honour Chriſt is to keep cloſe to
his Word, and we ſee how one error begetteth another; for from the opinion
that ſhe was without original ſinne, they have proceeded to horrible Idolatry,
attributing that which is proper to Chriſt unto her, ſhe is called the <hi>Mediatrix,</hi>
ſhe is called their hope; There is a <hi>Roman</hi> Pſaltery full of blaſphemy in this kind,
turning <hi>Dominus</hi> into <hi>Domina,</hi> what is ſaid of the Lordunto her the Lady: It is
true, we do as ſhe fore-told, acknowledge her bleſſed, among women; There
was an high dignity beſtowed upon her in being the mother of Chriſt, but ſhe
was more happy in having Chriſt in her heart by faith, then conceiving him bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
in her womb: It is well obſerved by <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his Harmony, That
whereas the parents of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt are highly commended as righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, <hi>walking in all the Commandments of the Lord,</hi> Luk. 1. 6. there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
recorded of the holineſs of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that hereby ſhe rather then
other women had this priviledge vouchſafed to her, as if thereby the holy Ghoſt
would prevent that horrible Idolatry, which he foreſaw would creep into the
Church concerning her: As the Papiſts, ſo the Turks they do fondly and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly
boaſt of the impeccability of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> inſomuch that one of their
learned men was forced to flie for his life, becauſe he held <hi>Mahomet</hi> might have
ſinned a venial ſinne if he would. (<hi>Vide Hornbeek ſumma. cent. de Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſme.</hi>)
And although they do not ſay, <hi>Mahomet</hi> was born without ſinne, yet
they have a prodigious fable concerning him, <hi>That when he was a child of four
years old, ſome Angels laid hold on him, and carried him into a mountain, where
they diffected him, waſhed his guts clean, took out a black drop, which</hi> (they ſay)
<hi>is in every man, as the ſeed of the Devil, and all this without any grief, and by
this meant he was freed from ſinne.</hi> It is moſt dreadfull to conſider, what impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and impoſtures are in that <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, and yet how greatly the
propugners thereof have prevailed, and that where Chriſtian Churches were

if <hi>Seth, Euceh, Noah,</hi> and ſuch eminent men were free from original ſinne, as
the <hi>Rabbins</hi> of <hi>Beaz,</hi> and others, that they were without evil concupiſcence:
But though theſe had the grace of God regenerating them, yet they were by
nature full of ſinne; and although when it is ſaid, <hi>That the imaginations of mans

and feared God, and ſo found favour with him;</hi> This doth not inferre, that by
nature his imaginations were not as evil as others, but only by the grace of God
he had obtained a mighty change and tranſlation from that natural condition.</p>

<hi>After the manner of men:</hi> This interpretation may be admitted as part; but
2. we are to underſtand it more largely of all thoſe who ſinne without a Law
revealed; for the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>That ſinne is not imputed, viz.</hi> (to a mans
conſcience) where there is no Law, men are apt to be ſecure in ſinne, when
there is no Law expreſly threatning them; Now ſaith the Apoſtle, let none think
ſo, <hi>For as death ſo ſinne was in the world before Moſes his time,</hi> though there was
not ſuch ſevere precepts againſt it; and therefore thoſe who had not ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
command as <hi>Adam</hi> had, yet death and ſinne was imputed to them; So that
by this is underſtood, That all thoſe who live out of the Church, all Heathens
and Pagans, who have not the revealed will of God to walk by, even thoſe who
never heard of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo could not imitate him in ſinning are in this clauſe
comprehended.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, By this alſo is declared, That all Infants, though they cannot actually

Chriſts ſacrificing himſelf in time, by whom alone God becometh propitious;
For Chriſts offering up of himſelf is ſaid to be <hi>Epheſ. 5. 2. A Sacrifice to God
for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> which was chiefly in the <hi>Euchariſtical Sacrifices,</hi>
not that Chriſts death is compared to them only, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have it,
but principally and chiefly to the <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> as appeareth in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> only in Chriſts death, there was that which was in <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical
Offerings,</hi> a <hi>ſweet ſavour unto God,</hi> whereby he became propitious unto
mankind; God being thus graciouſly pleaſed, we have this promiſe of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the Text, wherein is conſiderable,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The Cauſe of it,</hi> and that is Gods Deceree, <hi>The Lord ſaid in his heart,</hi>
that is an expreſſion after the manner of men; For you muſt not conceive of
God as changing his mind, or altering his purpoſes upon better conſiderations,
or as if he took up a contrary reſolution to that, when he intended to deſtroy
the world, but this is wholly ſpoken to our capacity; By this is meant no more
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:57719:218"/>
then Gods purpoſe and ſecret Decree, which yet he manifeſted to the comfort
of <hi>Noah,</hi> and therefore we have <hi>Moſes</hi> recording of it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>There is the object matter of this promiſe,</hi> and that is two-fold, <hi>I
will not curſe the ground, neither will I ſmite any more every living thing, as I have
done;</hi> God curſed the ground at firſt upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, but this is meant of
the Deluge, as appeareth by the other particular, for by that general floud it
is conceived the ground was made worſe then before; The meaning then is,
That God will not bring any more univerſal judgement, not but that particular
Towns or Nations may be conſumed by water or other puniſhments, but there
ſhall not be ſuch a general one by water any more, no, nor any general puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
For what comfort would it have been to <hi>Noah,</hi> if that the world ſhould
be preſerved only from drowing, if it might have been deſtroyed any other
way; Therefore when at the Day of Judgement the whole world ſhall either
be deſtroyed or renewed by fire, that will not be ſo much by way of puniſhment
to the inhabitants, as to change its uſe, and to prepare for the great alteration,
that God is then to make.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is the aggravation of this mercy;</hi> God will do this, <hi>Though
the imagination of mans heart be evil;</hi> This clauſe is to be conſidered, firſt as a
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> then <hi>Abſolutely</hi> in it ſelf. If as a reaſon, then here is the difficulty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of, how it can be made the ground why God will not deſtroy the
world, ſeeing formerly <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5. it is there made the only reaſon why he
would deſtroy it, can it be the motive for two contrary effects? Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do not make it a reaſon at all, but part only of the deſcription of Gods
promiſe, he will not deſtroy the earth again for this ſinfull diſpoſition, but
there muſt neceſſarily be ſome reaſon, either expreſly or tacitly implied, for
God is here declaring his purpoſe to take a more gracious and mercifull way,
now that he had given ſuch a dreadfull demonſtration of his juſtice and anger
againſt ſinne already: Some then make the reaſon to be <hi>ab incommdo,</hi> that if
God ſhould deſtroy the world, becauſe of mans original corruption breaking
forth daily, there would never be an end, we ſhould have flouds upon flouds;
Therefore as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He remembreth that we are but duſt, he knoweth
our frame</hi> (Pſal. 103. 14.) <hi>therefore he will not alwayes pour cut his wrath.</hi> Thus
(ſay they) it is here, and this is probable: Others make it an Argument <hi>ab
aeqno,</hi> to which <hi>Pererius</hi> inclineth, as if God did hereby declare, That being
man is thus originally polluted, and incurably ſinfull, as to his own power,
therefore God would pity him; ſo that though formerly God looked upon it, as
the matter of his wrath; now as the matter of pity being ſinne maketh us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
ſo ſome think <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. urgeth his natural corruption, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to move God to pity him, but this is not ſo probable, becauſe this doth
directly contradict Gods former proceedings, when his wrath was poured out
on the world, becauſe of this ſinne breaking forth into actual rebellions; I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
therefore go with thoſe that take the particle <hi>Ci</hi> adverſatively, <hi>Although,</hi>
God would not again deſtroy the world, <hi>although</hi> mankind was of ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
frame; and thus it is to be taken in many places, the neglect whereof
hath cauſed many Diſputes about ſome Texts of Scripture, whereas the rendring
of this particle adverſatively, would eaſily have cleared it, as might be ſhewed,
if it were to my purpoſe. (<hi>Vide Tarn. Exerc.</hi>)</p>
                        <p>In the next place we are to conſider the words <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and they are very
emphatical, the <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and is <hi>evil.</hi> In the former place, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5.
there is a greater aggravation, <hi>Every Imagination,</hi> and <hi>only evil,</hi> and <hi>all the
day long;</hi> but one ſuppoſeth the other; here in this Text, in ſtead of <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
or <hi>every day,</hi> as in the Original, we have <hi>From the youth,</hi> and therefore
doth more palpably demonſtrate the original filth or all men by nature; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can the Adverſaries to this Doctrine of original ſinne put in the exception
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:57719:219"/>
to this place, as they did to the former, for there they would evade, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it was ſpoken of thoſe evil and wicked men, who had in a more notorious
manner corrupted all their doings; But how can they open their mouth againſt
this place, for God ſpeaketh this as true at that preſent of all mankind by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when yet the great prophane ones were deſtroyed, and <hi>Noah</hi> with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
was preſerved? So that this is a perpetual and inſeparable qualification
from the nature of man, more than actual death; For <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> did
not actually die, yet they were born with original ſinne: As for ſome Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
who would limit to the time of youth, when a man is paſt his <hi>Infantia</hi> and
<hi>Pueritia,</hi> his infancy and childhood, arrived at his <hi>Adoleſcentia,</hi> his youth, that
is not to be admitted, for the word is to be applied to his whole time ſince he
was born; The word <hi>Nagnar</hi> doth ſignifie one <hi>caſt</hi> or <hi>ſhut out,</hi> and properly
belongeth to a new born Infant, and ſo doth ſignifie the tender Infancy of a
child, although we grant that it is ſometimes extended to the youth, as <hi>Geneſ.
37. Joſeph</hi> is called <hi>Nagnar</hi> a youth, when he was ſeventeen years old feeding
the flock. So 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. ſometimes it's applied to a <hi>Diſciple</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were ordinarily young, 2 <hi>King. 9. Iſa.</hi> 37. which the <hi>Septuagint</hi>
render <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and it is applied to Chriſt; and therefore whereas <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 27. it is
rendred <hi>Thy holy child Jeſus;</hi> Some think it better according to the uſe of the
word, by the <hi>Septuagint, Thy holy ſervant,</hi> for ſo Chriſt is ſometimes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his Mediatory Office, called the ſervant of God. But it is plain, that
children are capable of ſinne before their youth, and therefore we are not to
limit it, but to expound if of their very firſt being in original ſinne, which
doth vent it ſelf actually in after years. Some make the Plural number to be
obſervable, they render it <hi>à pueritiis,</hi> as containing the whole age of a man
from his tender years, till he be grown up. Hence <hi>Grotius</hi> will extend it to the
very time from the womb, but then runneth to his <hi>Socinian Hyperbole,</hi> which
hath been ſufficiently confuted. To determine the time indeed, when Infants
begin to be capable of actual ſinnes, is very difficult, but that is not my work
here.</p>
                        <p>Now though it is ſaid to be <hi>evil from the youth,</hi> yet that is ſome limitation:
It is not evil from Gods firſt creation of mans heart, not from its original
being, and therefore the eſſence of a man is not evil: So that it is an horrible
calumny of <hi>Tirinus</hi> the Jeſuite upon this place, to ſay, That from this Text
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> do inferre, <q>That the heart of a man is eſſentially evil;</q> 
                           <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricus</hi>
his dotage is ſufficiently diſowned by them. As then the Leproſie got
into the wals of the houſe, and that could not be ſcraped off, there was no
way to get it out but by demoliſhing the wall, yet was not to be attributed to
the Artificer that made the wall, but to ſome other ſupervenient cauſe; So
likewiſe neither is original ſinne, though now ſo cloſely adhering to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be attributed to God, who firſt created mankind, but to <hi>Adam</hi>'s volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Apoſtaſie from God.</p>
                        <p>The Text thus explained, there are two Doctrines contained in it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Original ſinne is an heavy and grievous ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>That there is a particular original ſinne in every one, which breaketh
out into its actings betimes.</hi> From which we ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe of
the equality and inequality of original ſinne in every man. Let us begin with
the firſt,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Original ſinne is a moſt grievous and heavy ſinne.</hi> In the Text is put an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi>
upon it, God will not deſtroy the world, <hi>although</hi> this ſinne be in man,
implying, the infinite mercy of God, that is not provoked by this utterly
to cut of mankind, <q>
                              <hi>Hic eſt inſiguis locus de peccato originali,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
 on the place. This is a famous place concerning original ſinne, which
whoſoever extenuateth (ſaith he) like blind men in the Sunne they do truly
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57719:219"/>
erre,</q> and do not ſee what they daily doe, and may have experience of.
It is from our ſenſleſneſſe and ſtupidity, or rather from our ſelf-love and pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical
diſpoſition that we do not more afflict our ſelves under the apprehenſion
of it, for this is the higheſt offence, the like whereof (ſaid <hi>Luther</hi>) unleſs in the

actual iranſgreſſion,</hi> which is our original imputed ſinne, or of
that <hi>inherent corruption</hi> which we have from our birth, and both do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of great aggravations, It is true, ſome Orthodox Writers doe deny
the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual diſobedience unto us, as <hi>Joſua Placeus,</hi>
who bringeth many Arguments (<hi>Theſ.</hi> Salm. <hi>Diſ. de ſtatu hominis lapſi ante
gratiam.</hi>) but my work is not to anſwer them, I ſuppoſe it for granted,
as a neceſſary truth. Concerning <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, which is thus ours by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh the Queſtion, <hi>An ſit graviſſimum?</hi> Whether
it was the greateſt of all ſinnes? And he concludeth, following the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that abſolutely it is not, only reſpectively, <hi>Secundum quid,</hi> in ſome
conſiderations, which he mentioneth. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaith, It is the greateſt
ſinne <hi>extenſive</hi> not <hi>intenſive.</hi> But we are to judge of the hainouſneſs of
ſinne, as we ſee God doth, who eſteemeth of ſinne without any errour:
Now it is certain, there was never any ſinne that God puniſheth, as he
doth this; The ſinne indeed againſt the holy Ghoſt, in reſpect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter of it, and the inſeparable concomitant of unpardonableneſſe is
greater, as to a particular perſon, but this being the ſinne of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature of mankind, doth bring all under the curſe of God; So that
we may on the contrary to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay, That it is abſolutely the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſinne againſt God, but in ſome reſpects it is not. I ſhall be brief in
aggravating of that (not at all touching upon the other Queſtion) which
hath more curioſity in it, (Whether <hi>Adam's</hi> ſinne, or <hi>Eve's</hi> was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt?)
then edification: Becauſe our proper work is to ſpeak of original
inherent ſinne, yet it is good to affect our ſouls with the great guilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for ſome have been ready to expoſtulate with God, Why for ſuch a
ſmall ſinne (as they call it) no more then eating the forbidden fruit, ſo
many millions of perſons, even all the poſterity of mankind ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be made children of wrath, and obnoxious to eternal damnation? Doth
not the <hi>Pelagian</hi> opinion, that holdeth, it hurteth none but <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf,
and his poſterity, onely if they willingly imitate him, agree more with the
goodneſſe of God? But if we do ſeriouſly conſider, how much evil was
in this one ſinne, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> maketh to be a breach of the whole
Law of God, we will then humble our ſelves, and acknowledge the juſt hand
of God. For</p>

Firſt, This is hainouſly to be aggravated from the <hi>internal qualification of the
ſubject. Adam</hi> who did thus offend was made <hi>upright,</hi> created in the Image of
God; In his underſtanding he had a large meaſure of light and knowledge; For
though the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have him a meer I deot and innocent, yet it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be evidenced to the contrary: The Image of God conſiſteth in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the mind, as well as in holineſs of the other parts of the ſoul: Neither did
<hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>phaz</hi> in his diſcourſe with <hi>Job,</hi> apprehend ſuch ignorance in <hi>Adam,</hi> when
he ſaith, <hi>Art thou the firſt man was born? Waſt thou made before the hils?—Doſt
thou reſtrain wiſdom to thy ſelf?</hi> Job 15. 7 8. implying, that the firſt man was
made full of knowledge; If then <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch pure light in his mind, this
made his ſinne the greater, yea becauſe of this light ſome have proceeded ſo far
as to make.<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt; but I ſhall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that; Certainly in that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſo great knowledge, this made his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
the more evil; hence becauſe there was no ignorance in his mind, nor no
paſſions in the ſenſitive part at that time to diſturb him, his ſinne was meerly
and totally voluntary, and the more the will is in a ſinne the greater it is:
Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. It is called expreſly <hi>diſobedience, By one mans diſobedience;</hi> Yea
learned men ſay, That this was the proper ſpecifical ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
For although diſobedience be in a large ſenſe in every ſinne, yet this
ſinne of <hi>Adams</hi> was ſpecifically diſobedience, for God gave him a poſitive
command meerly, that thereby <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould teſtifie his obedience to him. The
thing in it ſelf, was not intrinſecally evil to eat of the forbidden fruit, it was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
only becauſe it was forbidden; and by this God would have <hi>Adam</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his homage to him, but in offending, he became guilty in a particular way
of diſobedience.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>If you conſider Adam in his external condition;</hi> His fin is very great,
God placed him in Paradiſe, put him into a moſt happy condition, gave him the
whole world for his portion; Every thing was made for his uſe and delight; now
how intolerable was <hi>Adams</hi> ingratitude for ſo ſmall a matter, to rebell againſt
God? Therefore the ſmalneſs of the matter of the ſinne doth not diminiſh but
aggravate; he might the more eaſily have refuſed the temptation, ſo that this
unthankfulneſs to God muſt highly provoke him.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The ſinne was an aggregate ſinne, <hi>It had many grievous ſins ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
into it;</hi> It was a <hi>Beelzebub</hi> ſin, a big-bellied ſinne, full of many ſins in the
womb of it; his ſinne was not alone in the external eating of the forbidden
fruit, but in the internal cauſes that made him do ſo; There was <hi>unbelief,</hi> which
was the foundation of all the other ſinfulneſs, he believeth the Devil rather
then God; There was <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ambition, He deſired to be like God;</hi> There was
<hi>apoſtaſie</hi> from God, and communion with him; There was the <hi>love of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
more than of God, and thereby there was the <hi>hatred</hi> of God: Thus it was
<hi>unum malum in quo omnia mala,</hi> as God is <hi>unumbonum in quo omnia bona.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Laſtly, (Not to inſiſt on this, becauſe formerly ſpoken to) <hi>There was the
unſpeakable hurt and damage, which hereby he brought to his poſterity.</hi> (Not to
mention the curſe upon the ground, and every creature) The damning of all
his poſterity in ſoul and body, it the grace of God did not interpoſe; It cannot
be rationally conceived, but that <hi>Adam</hi> knew he was a publique perſon, that he
was acquainted upon what terms he ſtood in reference to his poſterity; That the
threatning did belong to all his as well as himſelf, if he did eat of the forbidden
fruit. Now for <hi>Adam</hi> to be a murderer of ſo many ſouls and bodies, to be the
cauſe of temporal, ſpiritual and eternal death to all mankind, who can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

we may not flatter our ſelves in the power of our free-will, but fly

thoſe prophane opinions which do either wholly deny it, or in a great meaſure
extenuate it. Some <hi>Papiſts</hi> make it leſs then a <hi>venial ſinne,</hi> and many of them

this is done in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſeeing in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there are ſuch oppugnators and
extenuators of it; vs if the <hi>Welſh Pelagius</hi> had not been enough, there is now

<hi>original curſe,</hi> rather then <hi>original ſinne, (Anſw. to the Letter of Rom.</hi>) ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it is to be Pigmilions, and to fall in love with our own purity, unwilling to
be <hi>ſhut up under ſinne,</hi> that the gracious mercy of God may be alone exalted:
And as the <hi>Socinians</hi> plead their reverence and zeal of honour to the Father,
while they deny the Deity of the Son; ſo here is pleaded much reverence and
tender regard to the Juſtice, Mercy and Goodneſs of God, much zeal to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and piety, as if the Doctrine of original ſinne did undermine all theſe;
But of theſe cavills in time; for the preſent, let us not judge of ſinne and the
guilt thereof by humane principles, and phyloſophical Arguments, but by the
Word of God. And</p>
                           <p>Firſt, The hainouſneſs of it doth appear (as heretofore hath been hinted)
<hi>In that it is not like any actual ſinne, that hath its proper ſpecifical guilt, and ſo is
oppoſite to one vertue only, and thereby doth contaminate but one power of the ſoul;
but it is the univerſal diſſolution and deordination of all the parts of the ſoul. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs</hi>
hath the guilt of that ſinne only, and is oppoſed to that particular
grace of <hi>chaſtity,</hi> and ſo of every ſinne elſe; but now this hereditary defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is <hi>contrary</hi> to that <hi>original righteouſneſs</hi> God created man in, and as that
was not <hi>one ſingle habit of grace.</hi> but the <hi>ſyſteme of all;</hi> Thus original ſinne is <hi>not
one</hi> particular ſinne, but the <hi>comprehenſion of all;</hi> It is the ſinne of the mind,
of the will, of the affection, of the body, of the whole man; ſo that as when
we would aggravate the goodneſs of God, we ſay, all the particular reſpective
goodneſſes in the creatures are eminently contained in God, ſo we may ſay, all
the particular pollutions, and guilt which is in reſpective ſinnes is eminently
contained in this; ſo that if there could be a <hi>ſummum malum</hi> in man, (though
that is impoſſible, becauſe <hi>malum moris fundatur in bono naturae</hi>) this original
ſinne would be it: Look upon this original ſinne then, as the deordination of
the whole man, as that which maketh every part of thee ſinfull and curſed, as
that which maketh thee to bear the image of a Devil, who once hadſt the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

                           <p>Secondly, This ſinne is greatly to be aggravated, <hi>Becauſe it is the root and
cauſe of all actual ſinnes.</hi> Some queſtion, Whether all our actual ſinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from this fountain or no? And certainly we may conclude, that all kind
of actual ſinne, whether internal or external, ſoul ſinnes, or body-ſinnes, do
either mediately, or immediately flow from it. This is <hi>the evil treaſure of the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:57719:221"/>
heart,</hi> Mat. 12. 35. Hence <hi>one</hi> of the Names that original ſinne hath, is <hi>Fomes
peccati,</hi> becauſe that is the womb in which all ſinnes are conceived: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<hi>James</hi> fully confirmeth this, <hi>Chap. 1. 14. Every man is tempted and drawn
aſide by his own luſt;</hi> neither is it any wonder that many ſinnes being in their
particular nature oppoſite to one another, that yet they ſhould all come from
one common principle, ſeeing they all have the ſame generical nature of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and the particularization of them is according to ſeveral temptations:
Even as out of the ſame dunghill ſeveral kinds of vermine which are produced
out of putrid matter may be brought forth; ſo that all the ſtreames of iniquity
do meet in this ocean, they all come from this root, even as all men do from
<hi>Adam;</hi> Not that the moſt flagitious crimes are inſtantly committed, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
they do at laſt biggen into ſuch enormities; if then that Rule be true,
That there is more in the cauſe then in the effect, and what is <hi>cauſa cauſae, is,
cauſa cauſati,</hi> then certainly may all our iniquities be reduced to this as the
fountain; hence <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. in his humiliation for his murder, doth go
up to the cauſe of all, even that <hi>he was born in iniquity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, It is to be aggravated, <hi>In the incurableneſs of it;</hi> for though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had power to caſt himſelf into this defiled condition, yet he had no power
to recover himſelf out of it; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſſeth it, A living man may kill
himſelf, but when dead he cannot recover himſelf to life; This (you heard)
is made part of the reaſon why God would not proceed to deſtroy the world
again, <hi>although</hi> mans corrupt heart is ſo corrupt, even becauſe there was no
hope that any judgments would cure them; They would proceed ſtill further
in impieties, all that water did not waſh the Blackmore nature of man: hence
it is that the grace of God whereby we are quickened out of this death, is wholly
ſupernatural; It's no wonder that they who are doting to ſet up the <hi>Idol of free-will,</hi>
do begin to lay their foundation in this, that there is no ſuch thing, as
this natural pravity in man; But there was no more in man to recover him out
of this original filth, then is in the Devils to reſtore them to their priſtine fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity:
So that thy actual ſinnes are not alone to be humbled, for were it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for thee to live with this ſinne alone, thou didſt need the grace of Chriſt to
redeem thee from this bondage.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, Herein alſo it is unſpeakably to be aggravated, <hi>That it taketh away
all ſpiritual ſenſe and feeling.</hi> It's the ſpiritual death of the ſoul; we are dead
men by nature in reſpect of ſpiritual things, and therefore though expoſed to
all the curſes in the Law, yet we feel nothing, we do not tremble and cry out
for help; The Phyſitian ſeeketh us, not we him; grace finds us out, not we
grace; and hence it is, that we think we have no ſuch thing as original ſinne in
us: Oh it is an heavy temptation to be given up unto, to think there is no ſuch
thing as original ſinne, that we have no ſuch enmity againſt God naturally in our
hearts! Wo be to that man, who begineth to think this thing little or none at all!
What can we pray for ſuch a man, but that which the Prophet did for the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
when they were brought into the midſt of their enemies, <hi>Lord open their
eyes</hi> (ſaith he?) which when done, they ſaw themſelves in the midſt of their
adverſaries, and ſo looked upon themſelvet but as ſo many dead men; Thus if
the Spirit of God by the Word make thee ſee the dunghill in thy heart, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
pollution of thy ſoul, thou wilt cry out, Oh how blind was I till now!
how ſenſleſs till this time! Oh I am a damned man, an undone man, if God do
not recover by his grace! Therefore that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> (though formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
can never enough be inculcated) That in their controverſie with <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>
there is more need of prayer then ſyllogiſmes; The truth of this Doctrine,
as it is primarily diſcovered by the Scripture, ſo ſecondarily by the experience
of the regenerated, who (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) <hi>were alive once</hi> ſecure and bleſſed,
according to their own thoughts in the ſtate they were in, but when once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:57719:221"/>
of the ſpirituality of the Law, and their own carnality and contrariety ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
then ſinne becometh out of meaſure ſinfull, and they die and are undone in
their own thoughts: Therefore concerning the Writers in this Controverſie,
we are not only to enquire, what acquired learning they have, but what inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
grace; what experimental workings of Gods Spirit in the humbling of
them, and to make them renounce all their own righteouſneſs and fullneſs that
Chriſt may be <hi>all in all:</hi> Thus <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who of all the Fathers hath moſt ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly
propugned this truth, ſo none of them diſcover ſuch an experimental
converſion to God, and a gracious change upon their hearts, as he doth in his
Books of Confeſſions; I do not detract from the piety of the other Ancients;
only it is plain, <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſcovereth a more peculiar and higher degree of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
knowledge of his own unworthineſs, and Gods gracious power in
bringing him out of darkneſs into light; and no queſtion, but the efficacy and
power of this experience made him ſo orthodox, and couragious in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that truth, which political and phyloſophical principles did much gainſay;
but this is the wofull effect of original ſinne, that it taketh away all power to
diſcover it ſelf; and as thoſe deſeaſes are moſt dangerous which take away the
ſenſe of them, ſo is original ſinne to be aggravated in this reſpect, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a man inſenſible of it.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, The aggravation of this ſinne is ſeen, <hi>That it is the habituall averſion
of the ſoul from God, and converſion to the creature.</hi> It is true, original ſinne is
not an habitual acquired ſinne, but yet it is <hi>per modum habitus,</hi> (as <hi>Aquinas</hi>
expreſſeth it) That is, the ſoul of every Infant born into the world cometh
with an innate and habitual averſeneſs to God, and what is holy; as alſo a
concupiſcential converſion to the creature; ſo that the two parts expreſſed
in an actual ſinne of commiſſion, mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Jermiah,</hi> Chap.
2. 13. <hi>My people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me the fountain of
life</hi> (there is the <hi>averſio, à Creatore,) and have hewed to themſelves broken
ciſterns,</hi> there is the (<hi>converſio ad creaturam</hi>) the ſame hath ſome repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in original ſinne; for every man by this hereditary pollution ſtands with
his back upon God, and his face to the creature; Even as the child cometh
bodily into the world, with his face downwards and his back upon the heavens;
ſo it is with the ſoul of a man, and this maketh our ſinne of native pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to be out of meaſure ſinfull, in that a man ſtanding thus at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
yea at enmity againſt God, can never turn his face again towards
God, but by a ſupervenient grace from above.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, The great heightening of this ſinne is, <hi>In the deep radication of it;</hi>
It is ſo intimately and deeply rooted in all the powers of the ſoul, that while
a man is in this life, he can never be freed from it; hence it is that the ordinary
determination of the Proteſtant Writers, concerning original ſinne, even in
regenerate perſons is, That it is taken away, <hi>Quoad reatum,</hi> though not
<hi>Quoad actum;</hi> There is original ſinne in every man living, yea in the moſt
holy, only it is removed from them, <hi>Quoad reatum,</hi> the guilt ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
and <hi>Quoad Dominum,</hi> though it be in them, yet it doth not reign in
them, only it is in ſome degree preſent there, and therefore called by the ſame
Divines, <hi>Reliquiae peccati,</hi> which expreſſion, though ſcorned by <hi>Corvinus,</hi>
yet both Scripture and ſome experience doth juſtly confirme ſuch a phraſe;
And although the late Adverſary againſt original ſinne (<hi>Tayl.</hi> a further Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Doct. of Orig. <hi>pag.</hi> 501.) doth poſitively and magiſterially accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his cuſtome dogmatize, that it is a contradiction to ſay ſinne remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and the guilt is taken away, and that in the juſtified no ſinne can be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
yet herein he betrayeth his ſymbolizing with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for all our learned
Proteſtants have maintained this Poſition againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> Biſhops and others
diſtinguiſhing between <hi>reatus ſimplex,</hi> that is inſeperable from ſinne, or the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57719:222"/>
                              <hi>merit of damnation,</hi> and <hi>Reatus redundans in perſonam,</hi> which is, when this is
imputed; There is therefore alwayes abiding in every man, though juſtified,
original ſinne in ſome meaſure, it is the <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>The ſinne dwelling in us</hi>
(as the Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.) and therefore in regard of the immobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and inſeperability of it from mans nature, while here on the earth, it is more
to be aggravated then all actual and habitual ſins; For though in Regeneration,
there is an infuſion of gracious habits, whereby the habits of ſinne are expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
yet this original depravation is not totally conquered by it. And thus much
may ſuffice for the aggravating of it, becauſe ſomething hath already been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to this Point.</p>

                           <p>THere remaineth one great Objection againſt the hainouſneſs of this ſinne,</p>
                           <p>That it is wholly involuntary, and therefore we are traduced in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that we charge our ſinnes hereby upon <hi>Adam,</hi> or God himſelf, freeing our
ſelves; Thus we accuſe others, and excuſe our ſelves, Is not this to do as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
who put off all to the woman whom God had given him, ſo we to clear
our ſelves put all upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſcore? <hi>Therefore many Papiſts and others
complain of us, as aggravating it too much, whereas one of them ſaith</hi> (Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Tappor, Diſp. de peccato origin.) <hi>that it is</hi> minus minimo peccato veniali, <hi>leſſe
then the moſt leaſt venial ſinne. But to anſwer this:</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, As this Doctrine about original ſinne is wholly by revelation, ſo we
are to judge of the hainouſneſs of it according to Scripture-principles. It is
true, (as hath been ſaid formerly) the Heathens did complain of the effects of
this original ſinne, but they did not know the cauſe; ſo that as by the Word
we come to know that from our deſcendency from <hi>Adam</hi> we do contract this
original pollution, thus alſo by the Word we are to paſſe ſentence about the
greatneſs of the ſinne: If the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are by nature the children of
wrath;</hi> If God in deſtroying of the world, doth not ſimply look to actual ſins,
but as they flow from ſuch a polluted principle; If by this we are in bondage
to Satan, and are under his power, though there were no actual ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by us, then let us not matter the ſpeculations of Philoſophers, nor the
Political ſentences of Civil Magiſtrates, for by theſe nothing is accounted culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but what is voluntary by our own perſonal will: Hence <hi>Auſtin</hi> explained
that aſſertion of his, when dealing againſt the <hi>Manichees, Vſque adeò peccatum
eſt voluntarium,</hi> &amp;c. Voluntarineſs is ſo neceſſary to the being of a ſinne that
it cannot be any ſinne; if this be wanting in this (ſaith he) all Laws, all
Nations, all Governours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do agree: The <hi>Pelagians</hi> commended this of
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> and improved it againſt him; but in his explication of himſelf, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it <hi>Politica ſententia;</hi> This is true according to the political Laws of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and withall agreeth to actual ſins: But the truth about original ſinne
meerly by revelation, we need not then regard, what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
ſay in this matter, who as they knew nothing of the creation of <hi>Adam,</hi>
ſo neither of his fall; and this caution is neceſſary to every one that would not
be deceived in this point.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Although in one particular reſpect this ſinne may not be ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as others, yet in many other reſpects it doth farre exceed, and they are
abundantly compenſative for that one conſideration: It is true, This ſin hath
nothing of our own perſonal voluntarineſs; yea if a man ſhould now conſent
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:57719:222"/>
to this birth-defilement, and even rejoyce, becauſe he was born thus eſtranged
from God, this ſubſequent will would not make original ſin to be a voluntary ſin
unto him, for this is an actual ſinne committed a new by the perſonal will of a
ſinner: But though this be granted, yet there are many other reſpect which
do exceedingly aggravate it, even thoſe we have mentioned before. Hence a
learned Schoolman (<hi>Dela Rua contra Theolog. cont.</hi> 2.) ſpeaking of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons
made by <hi>Aquinas</hi> and others of original ſinne with venial ones, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them, ſaying, <q>They muſt not be underſtood in that reſpect, as original
ſinne is a mortal one, for ſo it doth infinitely exceed any venial one, but in
that reſpect, as original ſinne is not contracted by our own proper action,
but by <hi>Adam</hi> in whoſe will our wils were contained:</q> What then, though in
one particular this ſinne may not be ſo hainous as others, yet look upon
the many other reſpects, wherein it doth exceed all other hainous
ſinnes, and then you will be compelled to acknowledge the weightineſſe
thereof.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The chiefeſt and higheſt aggravation of a ſinne, is from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of it to the Law of God; for ſeeing the Apoſtle doth define ſinne,
1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. to be <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> then the more irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
there is in ſinne, the greater is that ſinne: Now this <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, it is either
habitual or actual, and if habitual ſins are greater then actual, becauſe of the
greater diſſonancy to Gods Law, then muſt original be more then habitual, and
ſo greater then all ſins; if then we compare original ſinne with the Law we ſhall
find it contrary to it in the higheſt manner that can be; For Gods Law doth not
require only actual obedience, but ſuch obedience flowing from a pure and holy
heart; and holineſs in the heart is more anſwerable to the Law then holineſs in
actions: Thus on the contrary, ſinne in the habitual inclination of a man is
more oppoſite to Gods holy Law, then the expreſſion of it in ſeveral actings;
If then the Apoſtle define a ſinne by the contrariety of it to Gods Law, not by
knowledge or voluntarineſs, then where there is the greateſt obliquity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion
from this rule, though there be not ſo much voluntarineſs, there is the
greater evil; So that this reſpect may ſilence all thoſe cavils and diſputes which
are uſually brought in to diminiſh the guilt of this ſinne, ſtill have recourſe to
the Law of God, and there thou wilt find, that whereas actual ſins are reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
againſt reſpective commands, this is againſt every Law; It is againſt the
whole Law, and therefore hath as much evil in it, in ſome ſenſe, as the Law
hath good.</p>
                           <p>So that the Uſe is, To exhort every one who would have his heart deeply
affected in this point, who would be humbled greatly, becauſe his ſinne is
great, to take off his thoughts from all thoſe Philoſophical or humane argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are apt to leſſen it; Becauſe a Magiſtrate will not put a man to
death, unleſs where he is guilty by ſome voluntary perſonal act of his own; do
not thou therefore think it cruel and unjuſt with God, if he condemn for that
ſinne, wherein though we have not own proper will ingredient, yet by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
it is voluntary: But of this more when we are to juſtifie God in theſe
proceedings againſt cavilling Sophiſters.</p>

                        <p>THe ſecond Doctrine offereth it ſelf in the next place to be conſidered of,
which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That every one by nature hath his peculiar proper original ſinne, which doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vent it ſelf into actual evil.</hi> For the Text ſpeaketh univerſally, there is not
any to be exempted. It is made a Queſtion in the Schools, <hi>Whether there be
many, or one original ſinne onely? Aquinas</hi> bringeth two Arguments for more
original ſinnes than one; The one is from the Text according to the Vulgar
Tranſlation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. where it is rendred, <hi>In ſinnes did my mother
conceive me,</hi> in the Plural number; And then the ſecond from Reaſon, becauſe
there being many actual ſinnes, it cannot ſeem rational, that one original
ſinne ſhould incline to them all, ſeeing many times theſe ſinnes flow from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
principle; How may it be thought this one ſinne ſhould carry a man out
concupiſcentially to ſo many contrary luſts? Therefore that this truth may be
fully demonſtrated, let us conſider theſe Propoſitions:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſuch who deny any original inherent corruption, and make</hi> Adam<hi>'s
actual ſinne to be ours onely by imputation,</hi> as <hi>Pighius</hi> and <hi>Catharinus, they
will ſay, That there is but one original ſinne, which is by imputation made
every mans;</hi> Even as by the light of one Sunne, every man ſeeth, or (as ſome
Philoſophers ſay) there is one common <hi>Intelleotus agens,</hi> by which all men are
inabled to underſtand; So that by this opinion every man hath not his peculiar
inherent defilement, but that one actual tranſgreſſion by imputation, is made
the one common ſinne of mankind. Now although this is to be granted, That
<hi>Adam</hi>'s actual ſinne is made ours (which <hi>Chamier,</hi> and ſome <hi>French</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
following him do dangerouſly deny) yet the Texts heretofore brought in
this point, do evidently convince, That every one hath his peculiar native de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement
that he is born in: So that original ſinne, though it may be called one
in <hi>ſpecie</hi> and <hi>proportione,</hi> yet when we come to every particular man, he hath
his numerical and individual original ſinne in him: Although therefore there be
as many original ſinnes in the world, as there are men and women, yet in one
man or one woman, there is but one original ſinne: Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. 5.
confeſſed his particular birth-ſinne, not that it was his caſe alone, not that any
other ought not ſay ſo, as well as <hi>David,</hi> but becauſe this conſideration doth
moſt humble and affect a man, for what is it to hear that in the general there is
ſuch a thing as original ſinne, unleſs a man make particular application to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
unleſs he bring it home to his own heart, unleſs he cry out, Ah wretched
and undone ſinner, I, even I am the man that am thus born in ſinne, even
though there were no other men in the world, yet I ſhould be by nature the
child of wrath! And truly this is one reaſon of our large diſcourſing upon this
point, that you might at laſt bring this coal of fire (as it were) into your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to kindle there, not only to think of the undone eſtate of mankind in the
general, but to think this is true of thee, I am the man of whom all this evil is
ſpoken; Believe thy ſelf to be ſuch a Toad, ſuch a Devil; Hearken to the Word
more then to theſe flattering and ſoothing ſuggeſtions which thy own deluded
heart, or corrupt teachers may obtrude upon thee.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>That although this original ſinne be commonly called the ſinne of the
nature, yet that is not to be ſo underſtood, as if it were not alſo exiſtent in the
perſon, and ſo a perſonal ſinne. Catharinus (Opuſc. caſu hominis.</hi>) confeſſeth
he doth not underſtand how original ſinne can be called the ſinne of the nature,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:57719:223"/>
for the nature is an abſtract, and it is a <hi>Chymerical</hi> ſigment, to ſay, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
nature is capable of ſinne, becauſe <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum;</hi> and the <hi>late
known Enemy</hi> to this truth, doth (as it were) triumph in his Arguments
againſt this expreſſion, when it is called, <hi>The ſinne of our Nature</hi> (Further
Explicat. of the Doctrine of Orig. <hi>pag.</hi> 493.) For while he is wreſting and
wrecking the miſerable 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> adding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
(<hi>Procruſtus</hi>-like) to make it commenſurate to his prepoſſeſſed imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(although he ſhould remember, that according to the Civil Law, no
credit is to be given to confeſſions extorted upon the rack) he poſitively di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates,
<hi>that ſin is an affection of perſons, not of natures;</hi> The humane nature cannot
be ſaid to be drunk or commit adultery, <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum,</hi> and ſin is a
breach of the Law, to which perſons not natures are obliged. This Argument I
remember is urged alſo by ſome againſt Chriſts obedience, that the Law did not
bind his humane nature, becauſe it was not a perſon, and therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
did not reach to him as he was man, to do this or that. But the anſwer
is very obvious, That although the Law doth immediately bind the perſons, yet
mediately it doth alſo the nature, Who can deny, but that the Law to love
God, though immediately it be commanding the perſon, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c? yet thereby the ſoul of a man is alſo reached unto, ſo that hatred of
God in the ſoul, as it is there inherent is forbidden mediately; Otherwiſe there
could be no habitual ſins or graces, becauſe the command or threatning did no
wayes reach to them.</p>
                        <p>In the next place (to our purpoſe in hand concerning original ſinne) it is
ignorantly objected, That <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum;</hi> For we doe not ſay,
Original ſinne is an action, it is in the nature of habits; So that this
ariſeth from a groſs miſtake, That a child doth actually ſinne in partaking of
this nature-defilement; We ſay it doth <hi>contrahere peccatum,</hi> or receive
this pollution with its nature, not that it doth actually ſinne in the reception of
it. But then</p>
                        <p>3. When it's called the ſinne of our nature, it is not meant, as if <hi>this nature
did univerſally exiſt any where,</hi> that indeed would be a meer <hi>Chimera,</hi> or as if
mans nature were any where but in a perſon, <hi>But that whereſoever the nature
of a man is any where ſubſiſtent in</hi> individuums, <hi>there is alſo this corruption;</hi> Even
viſibility and mortality are the univerſal properties of the nature of man:
There is no man but hath theſe affections; So alſo is original ſinne thus inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
annexed to the nature of man, whereſoever it doth particularly ſubſiſt.
To this purpoſe <hi>Julius Sirenius</hi> a Scholaſtical Writer (<hi>Promptu, Theolog. lib.
20. &amp;</hi> 22.) When we ſay, Original ſinne is a ſiane of the humane nature,
<hi>Non ita velim intelligas quaſi naturae per ſe conſiderata actio aliqua convenire
poſſit,</hi> &amp;c. do not underſtand it as if any action could agree to nature, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it ſelf; for not the action (which is of the <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi>) but the <hi>modus
agendi</hi> belongeth the nature exiſtent in the <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> for ſin is not an action, but
the mode, or rather the defect of the mode in an action. The Sum is this, A man is
born thus in ſin, not becauſe he is this or that perſon, but becauſe he is a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
from lapſed <hi>Adam;</hi> So that by this we ſee, that it is the ſin of our nature,
and yet ſo as it is the ſin of every perſon new born, but we are neceſſitated to call
it, the ſin of our corrupt nature, to diſtinguiſh it from all actual and habitual
ſinnes, which are the ſinnes of one perſon, that they are not neceſſarily the
ſinnes of others; Every man is not neceſſarily a proud man, an unclean man,
but every one is thus a defiled man, deſtite of the Image of God; only this
muſt alwayes be remembred, That it is not our nature-ſinne, as we had it from
Creation, but as vitiated by <hi>Adam</hi>'s voluntary tranſgreſſion, and if he would
put it in the definition of man, that he was <hi>animal rationale mortale,</hi> we may
adde <hi>ad peccata prenum,</hi> prone and inclming to ſinne; for we muſt conſider
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57719:224"/>
man otherwiſe in Divinity, and by Scripture-light, then we do in Philoſphy;
Hence to be a man, or to walk as a man in Scripture-phraſe ſometimes, is to
be ſinfull, and to do a thin ſinfully: You ſee then that upon good grounds
original ſinne is called the ſinne of our natures, and that as in actual ſinnes the
perſon doth defile the nature: So on the contrary in original ſinne the nature
defileth the perſon; for the humane <hi>ſpecies</hi> was in <hi>Adam,</hi> as we ſay, the whole
<hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Sunne is in the Sunne, though with ſome diſſimilitude. Hence it
is that according to the Expoſition of ſome learned men, it is called, <hi>The ſinne
of the world,</hi> not my ſinne or thy ſinne, but the ſinne of the world, <hi>John</hi>

Article in the Singular number, as in this place, there we muſt alwayes
underſtand original ſinne; but perhaps that is no more true then another Rule,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) where the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> there alwayes it ſignifieth
the holy Ghoſt, I rather therefore think, that by the ſinne of the world is meant
all ſinne, any ſinne committed and repented of; for Chriſt did not only come
to take away original ſinne, as ſome would have it, but all actual ſinne as well;
So that the expreſſion is here uſed in the Singular number for the greater em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis: Hence Divines have two Rules, firſt, <hi>Nomen terminatione ſingulare
ſaepe ſignificatione eſt plurale,</hi> a word that hath a ſingular termination, may
have a Plural ſignification, as ſinne in the Text ſignifieth all ſinne. The other
Rule is, <hi>Quando Scriptura ſacra ſingulari numere utitur pro plurali, tum ſaepe
plus ſingularitate ſignificat quam pluralitate</hi> when the holy Scripture uſeth a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
number for the plural, then it often ſignifieth more in the ſingular number
then if it had uſed the plural, as <hi>Exod. 15. 22. He hath caſt the horſe and rider into the
ſea,</hi> that is the great company of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s hoaſt; we do not then exclude ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſin from this place, only we ſay, actual ſin is alſo comprehended in this
propitiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Propoſ. 3. By this then it appeareth, That ſeeing every one hath his proper
peculiar original ſinne, that the Infants ſinne is diſtinct from the parents ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
defilement, and ſo our inherent pollution doth differ from</hi> Adam<hi>'s ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
inherent in him;</hi> For you muſt know, that the ſinne, which is original
in us, was perſonal in him, he did by his own voluntary tranſgreſſion offend
God, and ſo deprived himſelf of all that ſpiritual honour and glory God had
crowned him with; Immediately upon the deprivation of Gods Image, there
was an habitual inclination unto all manner of evil, and this pollution is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his poſterity, not that the ſame ſinne numerically in
<hi>Adam</hi> is communicated to every one deſcending from him, but the ſame in kind;
Therefore that Argument which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> gloried in, in their conflict with
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> fetched out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> That <hi>accidens non migrat de ſubjecto in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectem,</hi>
is fooliſh and abſurd; For we grant that the ſame numerical ſinne
which was in <hi>Adam</hi> is not propagated to us no more then the ſame perſonal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſubſiſtency, but as we have an humane being diſtinct from his; ſo alſo an
original pollution is in every man diſtinct from that ſinfulneſs in <hi>Adam.</hi> It's
true, ſome learned men have doubted, whether we are to conceive original
ſinne inherent in us, as having a diſtinct guilt from <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, they
think it more conſonant to truth, if we ſay that his ſinne and our native pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
do make up the formal guilt of it; But as we have heretofore ſhewed,
that cannot be, therefore though we are alwayes to judge of this original pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
with this reſpect to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, that being the original effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſinne, and this the original formal one, yet in it ſelf conſidered there
is a damnable guilt, and therefore by it alone we are ſaid to be children of
wrath.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>Although original ſinne be but one in every man, yet we may call
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57719:224"/>
it many in respect of the efficacy of it, and the innumerable iſſue that cometh
from it:</hi> So that we may ſay it is one and many in ſeveral reſpects, for all the
ſinnes of the world have their riſe mediately and immediately from it, all theſe
ſprings come from that Ocean; Thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the Schoolmen anſwer that
place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. Although the proper anſwer to that place is, that in the
Hebrew it is in the ſingular number, the plural is only according to the Vulgar
Tranſlation; and if you ſay, How can all theſe actual ſins which are of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature come from this one ſpring? How can one ſin diſpoſe to many contrary
ſinnes? We anſwered this before, and ſhall adde one thing more to clear it,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) That though one ſinne may not diſpoſe directly, and <hi>per ſe</hi> to all
ſinne, yet <hi>per accidens,</hi> it may by removing that which did keep off all ſinne;
for original righteouſneſs did incline to all duties, and thereby preſerved from
all ſinne; now original ſinne excluding this, thereby all ſins are committed, as
temptations and occaſions do intervene; Even as if a muſical inſtrument be
marred, every ſtring maketh a different jarre according to the nature of it, or
as when a mixed body is diſſolved, every element goeth to his proper place,
which is <hi>Aquinas</hi> his ſimilitude, of which when we ſhall ſhew how original ſinne
is equal and inequal in all.</p>

                        <p>WE proceed to the ſecond part in the Doctrine, which is, <hi>That this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne which is in every man doth vent it ſelf betimes, his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
is evil from his childhood.</hi> We told you, the Papiſts offer violence to
the Text, when they limit it to a mans youth, excluding his childhood, as if
that were innocent; The <hi>Rabbins</hi> they ſay (as <hi>Mercer</hi> relateth) this evil fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in a mans heart, till he be thirteen year old, and afterwards a good fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cometh into a man. It is greatly diſputed with the Schoolmen, When is
the time that a child cometh to diſcern between good and evil, for till then (they
ſay) the Law of God doth not bind, and ſo he is not capable of actual ſinnes?
Some limit the time of actual ſinnes to four or ſix years of age; But certainly
here cannot be any fixed or uniform Rule given; neither may we deny children
to be guilty of actual ſins, before they come to years of diſcretion: Certainly
<hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh of his obſervation of the envy which one child hath, while
another ſucketh the ſame breaſt; and therefore although we cannot ſay with
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> That Infants have either actual ſinnes, or actual graces, yet no
doubt but actual ſins do very early proceed from them; neither is the time of
their ſinning to be limited to the time of their uſe of reaſon in a formal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
manner. It is true, our Saviour took a little child, ſetting him in the
midſt of the company, ſaying, <hi>Vnleſſe a man become like this child, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 18. 4. not that ſuch a little child had not
both original and actual ſins in him, but becauſe comparatively to grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they are innocent, having not the pride and other ſins as men of age have,
therefore it is, that we are to be converted, and become like little children;
yea there is no parent that deſireth the ſalvation of his children, but he may
obſerve, that from the very childhood there is a great averſneſs to what is holy
and a natural inclination to evil; Inſomuch that all do betimes give a diſcovery
of that imbred and ſinfull pollution that is in them. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That folly
is bound up in the heart of a child,</hi> prov. 22. 15. And in <hi>Job 11. 12, Man is</hi>
                           <pb n="416" facs="tcp:57719:225"/>
ſaid to be <hi>born like a wild Aſſes-Colt,</hi> becauſe of the ſtupidity and unteachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that is in every one by nature to what is good. To conſider this more
throughly, we are to take notice, that original ſinne doth not lye in a man
aſleep, or like a ſluggiſh and muddy pool that doth not ſend forth its noiſome
ſtreames, but by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. is deſcribed as a ſinne that is alwayes
acting and rebelling againſt the Law of God; and therefore as ſoon as ever a
child is capable of ſuch ſinfull actings, this original ſinne doth put forth it ſelf,
it is not to be limited to yeares of diſcretion, but even in the childhood of man
much folly and vanity, many actual motions of ſinne, do put forth themſelves:
It's often ſaid by Divines, that original ſinne is <hi>peccatum actuoſum,</hi> though not
<hi>actuale,</hi> an active ſinne though not an actual; and this ſhould make us look
back to our very childhood, and to mourn for all that folly and vanity we then
committed; How quickly did thy enmity to holy things begin to appear? What
a wild Aſſes Colt? or what a young Serpent waſt thou, plainly manifeſting,
that as thy parts of mind and ſtrength of body ſhould encreaſe, ſo alſo would
thy corruption break forth more powerfully: But of this childhood-ſinfulneſs
more is to be ſpoken.</p>

to be uſed in the Plural number for Emphaſis ſake, and therefore is not to be
limited to ſuch a time, as when one cometh to years of diſcretion, but even to
our childhood, therefore the Hebrew word is uſed of Infants, as <hi>Moſes,</hi>
Exod. 2. 6. and <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Jud. 13. 5. although we deny not but that it is alſo in
Scripture applyed to thoſe that are grown up; Hence Divines have a Rule,
<hi>Secundum Hebraorum idioma, Infans vocatur emnis filius ad comparationem pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi>
according to the Hebrew cuſtome, every ſon is called an Infant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
to his parents, and happily we may adde a Diſciple and ſervant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly
to their Superiours. This word <hi>Obadiah</hi> applyeth to himſelf, 1 <hi>Kings
18. 12. Thy ſervant feareth God from his youth;</hi> This time then of ſinning is to
be extended further, then uſually it is imagined, for commonly we look not
upon the actions of young ones as ſinnes, till they come to ſome diſcretion,
or if we do, we count them very little, and venial, they are matter of delight
more then of humiliation; ſo few are there who do rightly affect themſelves
with the vanity and folly, as alſo enmity to holy things that they were guilty of
even while little children. But becauſe this truth hath ſome difficulty in the
doctrinal part thereof, let us more exactly enquire into the nature of it, which
will be ſeen in ſeveral Propoſitions. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The <hi>Lutherans</hi> have a peculiar opinion, that even Infants, whether
in the mothers womb or new born, are guilty of actual ſinnes: for whereas
they make the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, (<hi>Steg. Photin. diſ. de peccato Orig. Fewrborn. diſput. 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>.</hi>)
to be applyed ſometimes to the Infant in the womb, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 41. ſometimes to
Infants new born, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. They conclude, that even ſuch as theſe, before
they have any uſe of reaſon, are guilty of actual ſinnes, only concerning actual
ſinnes they diſtinguiſh, that ſuch are either taken ſtrictly and preciſely for thoſe
that came from deliberation, and the will, or largely for any motions or ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the ſoul againſt Gods Law, though without the act of will and reaſon,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:57719:225"/>
and in this latter ſenſe (they ſay) Infants partake of actual ſinnes. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
original ſinne is an active quality in a man, and doth begin to work
very early, yet it cannot be thought to produce actual ſinne, till the ſoul by
its powers and faculties is able to produce operatins. It is true, we read of
<hi>Timothy,</hi> that he is ſaid to know the Scriptures from <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, but that doth
ſignifie <hi>Timothy</hi> ſomething grown up, and attaining to ſome underſtanding
(for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are too peremptory, who think, a place cannot be brought;
where <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, doth ſignifie a child ſomething grown up; <hi>Timothy</hi> therefore is
ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim. 35. To know the Scriptures from a child,</hi> becauſe his godly <hi>Mother</hi>
and <hi>Grandmother</hi> did as ſoon as he was able to receive, inſtruct him in the faith,
which could not be, while a meer Infant. Therefore</p>
                        <p>In the next place, A ſecond Propoſition is, <hi>That even in the ſtate of integrity,
had not</hi> Adam <hi>fallen, children new born would have been without actual knowledge,
as well as in corrupted nature, they would not have been born with perfect uſe of their
reaſon, no more then they would have been born with perfect and compleat bodies,
for ſuch could not have been contained in the womb.</hi> We take it for granted,
(though ſome have been for the negative) that in the ſtate of innocency there
would have been multiplication of children by generation, which appeareth in
the Creation of a woman for a man, and if ſo, then that the children at that
time born, though they would have been free from original ſinne, and all the
general effects thereof, yet would not have been born in a perfect ability actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to uſe their reaſon. Indeed the Scripture is wholly ſilent, what would
have been done, if man had not fallen, and therefore nothing can be certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
unleſs we had ſome divine revelation about it, yet there is a good
Rule given, that we muſt think God would then keep to that ordinary way of
nature, which we now find, except where ſinne and the effects thereof have
made a difference; we are not to make miracles and extraordinary workings
of God, unleſs ſome neceſſity of reaſon compell thereunto, and thus it would
be here, if children new born ſhould have had perfect actual knowledge. It is
true, <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth ſeem to incline (<hi>Vide</hi> Auguſtin. <hi>de peccator. Mer. &amp; Rmeiſt.
lib. 1. cap.</hi> 35, 36. eſpecially <hi>cap.</hi> 37. that as ſoon as ever the children were come
forth from the womb, God would have made them great and perfect bodies,
as he did <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s rib immediately, or at leaſt made them fit for all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the body; but this is ſo improbable, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> cannot be excuſed,
unleſs we think he ſpake it doubtingly, and by way of inquiſition, yea not only
concerning the body, but even the ſoul alſo, that a child is ſo long without the
uſe of reaſon, he ſeemeth to make it not from meer nature, but vitiated and
polluted; This (we ſay) hath no probability, for we muſt not think that
God would have alwayes in the ſtate of innocency, wrought miraculouſly in the
conſtant propagation of mankind. It is true, the blindneſs that is habitually
upon the mind of every Infant, whereby it is indiſpoſed to receive the Truths
of God when grown up, would not then have been in Infants; There would
not have been any privation of ſuch light as was neceſſary, but it would have
been meer neſciency and ſo no ſinne, and therefore ſuch a neſciency was in
Chriſts humane nature, while and Infant, <hi>Luk. 2. 52. He encreaſed in wiſdome
and ſtature,</hi> as alſo, <hi>Iſa. 7. 15. Butter and honey ſhall be eat, that he may know
to refuſe the evil, and chooſe the good,</hi> that is, he ſhould eat on childrens uſuall
food, till he did encreaſe in knowledge, but all this was without ſinne. This
Propoſition may ſatisfie that Infants cannot have any actual ſinne, while meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo, becauſe the want of uſe of reaſon in them is no ſinfull imperfection; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they under the commands of God to beleive and know him, as alſo to
love him with all their ſoul: Therefore it is abſurd in the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to ſay,
that theſe commands of actual knowledge, fear, or love do bind them, while
thus under a natural neſciency that floweth from their very nature, as nature
not as vitiated and defiled.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="418" facs="tcp:57719:226"/>
                           <hi>Prop. 3. The reaſon why Infants have not the actual uſe of reaſon, as ſoon as
they are born ariſeth not from their ſoult, but the conſtitution of their bodies;</hi> As
in natural fools, mad men, or men in ſleep, there is no defect in their ſouls,
but in the body, which is the organical inſtrument of the ſoul; Therefore when
Infants die, as ſoon as ever their ſouls are ſeperated from the body, they have
perfect knowledge and reaſon; but the want of the uſe of reaſon ariſeth from
the abundance and overflowing of humours, whereby the ſenſitive powers of
the ſoul are make indiſpoſed for their operations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop. 4. Seeing therefore that the ſoul cometh to work rationally by the ſucceſſive
alteration of the complexion of the body, as the organs are diſpoſed, which in ſome is
ſooner, in ſome later, it is impoſſible to give not only the metaphyſical indiviſible
inſtant, but even the moral time wherein a child doth firſt begin to have an actual
ſinne.</hi> As we cannot obſerve it in our ſelves when we firſt had any uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo neither can we in another; and therefore the limiting of the works of
underſtanding, to the fourth, ſixth or ſeven years, is altogether uncertain,
only we are to conclude, That children ſinne long before they know what ſinne
is, or can underſtand what it is to offend God, for thoſe peeviſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>: And
if you ſay, Why ſhould we think thoſe are ſins, ſeeing they do not flew from
the uſe of reaſon and free-will? Therefore.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Propoſition is, <hi>That contrariety to the Law of God is of the eſſence of
a ſinne, not voluntarineſs</hi> in actu ſecundo (<hi>as they ſay) as if immediately elicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the will;</hi> For habitual ſins are not voluntary in that, but becauſe they are
the effect produced by voluntary acts of ſinning that did precede, therefore they
have as much voluntarineſs, as is required to make an habitual ſinne, and thus
original ſinne with the immediate effects that flow thence, have as much volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarneſs
as is required to make them ſinnes, for as habitual ſinnes are therefore
ſins, becauſe contracted by our own perſonal will, ſo original ſinne is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
becauſe deſcending upon as by his will, who was our Head, both <hi>quoad
eſſe naturale,</hi> and <hi>morale,</hi> as it is in time more to be explained: Therefore that
Poſition of <hi>Socinians</hi> and others, That nothing can be a ſinne which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the voluntary conſent of our own perſonal will, is to be rejected as
that falſe foundation upon which they build ſo many erroneous Doctrines.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth Propoſition is, <hi>That even young children very early have
imperfect workings of underſtanding and will;</hi> So that thoſe obſcure actings of
a rational ſoul begin farre ſooner to put themſelves forth, then many do think;
Hence it is that they know and love thoſe that give them ſuck, we muſt then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,

while he was a child, he was but <hi>tantillus puer,</hi> yet <hi>tantus peccator,</hi> a little boy,
but a great ſinner. This truth is very uſefull, not only to confute <hi>Pelagiant</hi>
and <hi>Socinians,</hi> who make in a child an indifferency to good or evil; or with
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> a blank table to receive any impreſſion, but eſpecially to quicken up
Parents to their duty in diligent admonition and inſtitution of them; For <hi>Sola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
wiſer than any <hi>Pelagian,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov. 22. 15. Folly is bound up in the
heart of a child;</hi> The word ſignifieth, <hi>is cloſe bound to his ſoul,</hi> as if it were with
ropes: Now if beſides this natural folly, there be wicked education and evil
example, this will be ſuch a three-fold cord that will not eaſily be broken: Oh
then do not think it is no matter what children do, their ſins are but ſports and
jeſts, you will not have them diſpleaſed or corrected, for this is contrary alſo
to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s counſel, <hi>Prov. 22. 5. Train up a child in the way he ſhould go,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:57719:226"/>
Some render it <hi>dedicate,</hi> ſome <hi>inſtruct,</hi> it cometh all to one ſenſe, but who
muſt be thus trained? Even a child, in the Hebrew it is <hi>Gnal pene, ſuper es viae,</hi>
which cauſeth divers Interpretations; Some underſtand it of the very firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of a childs courſe, when he <hi>in bivio,</hi> whether he ſhall take to virtue or
vice; Some for the very time that any entrance can be made upon them; for
children are to learn many things by meer memory before they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
neither is that, though in holy things, a taking of Gods name in vain,
but a ſerving of God according to their capacity; Some underſtand it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the capacity of the child, as a veſſel with a narrow mouth muſt have
liquour poured into it by degrees; all theſe ſenſes tend to the ſame purpoſe,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) that Parents ſhould not put off the inſtruction of their children, or to
think, becauſe they are children, therefore their ſins are not to be much regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for you have <hi>Job</hi> ſharply bewailing theſe, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 23. What were thoſe
iniquities for which God did ſo ſeverely chaſtice <hi>Job?</hi> Why did God write ſuch
bitter things againſt him, it was becauſe of the ſins of his youth, the ſame word
in the Text: And <hi>Pſal. 25. 7. David</hi> in great affection prayeth God would not
<hi>remember the ſins of his youth,</hi> the ſame word alſo in the original, as is in my
Text: And certainly, we have a dreadfull example of Gods anger, even againſt
the ſins of little children, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 23. for ſuch came out of the City, and
mocked the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Go up thou bald head, and there preſently came
two ſhe-bears that did tare in pieces two and fourty of them:</hi> They were but little
children, and you would think none would regard what they ſaid, but behold
the heavy judgement of God upon them: Therefore let Parents be more
deeply affected with the lies and ſinfulneſs of their children, then commonly
they are. The wicked man is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 20. 11. to have his bones full of his
puerilities, or as we tranſlate it, the ſinne of his youth, becauſe ſinne acted in
the youth, doth cleave more inſeperably then other ſins, even as he who had
been poſſeſſed with a Devil from his youth, was more difficultly cured, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text addeth, <hi>Thoſe ſins lie down in the duſt with him;</hi> Thy youth-ſins
will go to the grave with thee, if grace make not a powerfull change.</p>

                           <hi>THe laſt thing to be treated on, is to anſwer that Queſtion,</hi> Whether original
ſinne be alike in all? Do we not ſee ſome even from the very womb more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
to iniquities then others? And if it be equal in all, Why ſhould not all be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out to the ſame ſins alike? Why is not every one a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Judas?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this we anſwer theſe things, 1. If we take original ſinne for the privative
part of it (<hi>viz.</hi>) the want of Gods Image, ſo all are alike; Every one hath
equally loſt this glorious Image of God, none hath any more left of it in them
then another: Even as it is concerning thoſe that are damned in hell; They are
all equal in their puniſhment in reſpect of the <hi>poena damni,</hi> they loſe the
preſence of the ſame God, and are all alike caſt out from his preſence, but
there is a difference in reſpect of the <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> ſome have greater torments
then others.</p>
                        <p>2. Original ſinne is alike in all in the poſitive part, if you do reſpect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
power of ſinne, that is, there is in all equally an habitual converſion to
the creature: Even as all have the ſame remote power of dying alike, though
for the proxim power ſome die ſooner, and ſome later; The ſeed then of all evil
is alike in all, all are equal in reſpect of the remote power of ſinning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="420" facs="tcp:57719:227"/>
3. By original depravation, all are alike in reſpect of the neceſſity of ſinning;
There is no man in this loſt eſtate, but he doth neceſſarily ſinne <hi>quoad ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem</hi>
(as they ſay) whatſoever he doth, he ſinneth, though not <hi>quoad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citium,</hi>
this ſinne or that ſinne one is more ingaged unto then another: Neither
is this neceſſity of ſinning like the neceſſity of hunger and thirſt; for theſe are
meer natural and not culpable, but this neceſſity of ſinning is voluntarily
brought upon us, and though it be neceſſary, yet is voluntary and with delight
alſo: As <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſſeth it, The voluntarineſs taketh not off from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
nor the neceſſity from the voluntarineſs and delight.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Original ſinne is equal in all, in reſpect of the merit and deſert; it
deſerveth death, it deſerveth hell; There is none cometh into the world thus
polluted, but he is obnoxious to death, and an heir of Gods wrath; For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome are freed from hell, yea and one or two have been preſerved
from death, yet is wholly by the grace of God; The deſert of original ſin
is equal in all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But then you will ſay,</hi> How cometh it about that ſome are more viciouſly given
then others, ſome more propenſe to one ſinne then another?</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, 1. From the different complexions and conſtitutions of the body,
with their different temptations and external occaſions of ſinne as they meet
with; Though the remote power be equal in all, yet the immediate and proxim
diſpoſition is the bodies complexion, and other concurring circumſtances; For
original righteouſneſs being removed, then a man is carried out to ſinne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently,
according as his particular torrent may drive him; Even as if the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
or ſupporters of an houſe ſhould fall to the ground, every piece of wood
would fall to the ground more heavily or lightly, as the weight is, or as you
heard <hi>Aquinas</hi> his ſimilitude, when the mixt body is diſſolved every element
hath his proper motion, the air aſcends upward, the earth downwards; and
this is the cauſe of the divers ſins in the world, and ſome mens particular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to one ſinne more than another. And then</p>
                        <p>2. The grace of God either ſanctifying or reſtraining doth alſo make a great
difference; It is God that ſaith to the ſea of that corruption within thee, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
thou ſhalt go and no further.</hi> Think not that thou hadſt a better nature, or
leſſe original ſinne than <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Cain,</hi> but God doth either change thy nature,
or elſe he doth ſeveral wayes reſtrain thee, that thou canſt not accompliſh all
that actual wickedneſs thy heart would carry thee unto.</p>

that it is ſubſervient to the Goſpel. Only we muſt diſtinguiſh
of the uſe of the Law, which is <hi>per ſe,</hi> and which is <hi>per accidens;</hi>
The uſe of the Law <hi>per ſe</hi> is to give eternal life to ſuch who have a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

it is a Metaphor from thoſe malefactors that are ſhut up in a priſon, and cannot

all mankind, and partly the impoſſibility to eſcape it; and then whereas it is
ſaid, <hi>under ſinne,</hi> that denoteth both the guilt of it, and the dominion of it,
and that both original ſinne and actual, for both are comprehended herein, elſe
Infants would be excluded from having an intereſt in Chriſt, for whoſoever

are brought to Chriſt are neceſſarily ſuppoſed to be in a ſtate of ſinne.
Hence</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, there is the Univerſality <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which is more emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>All things,</hi> not all men; This expreſſion is uſed, to ſhew, that
not only all men, but all their actions, ſtudies, endeavours, every thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, we have the Cauſe appointing and declaring of this, and
that is the <hi>Scripture.</hi> It is uſual to attribute thoſe things which belong to God
unto the Scripture, becauſe that is the ſentence of God that declareth the will
of God; Thus <hi>Gal. 3. 8. The Scripture fore-ſeeing, that God would juſtifie the
Heathen,</hi> &amp;c. that is, God by his Word fore-telling what he would do: Thus
<hi>Rom. 9. 17. The Scripture ſaith unto Pharaoh, For this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed
thee up,</hi> &amp;c. that is, God by the Scripture manifeſted his will and purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Pharaoh;</hi> So that in this place, we are to conceive of God <hi>wiſely</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly</hi>
ordering this way, that all mankind ſhall fall into a ſtat of ſin &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that ſo a way may be made open for the advancement of the grace of the
Goſpel, <hi>Not that God did neceſſitate</hi> Adam <hi>to ſinne, or did infuſe any evil into
him, but be falling by his own voluntary tranſgreſſion, and thereby plunging all his
poſterity into this wretched eſtate, God who could have prevented this fall of</hi>
Adam, <hi>did not, becauſe not bound to it, give him that grace, which would
actually have confirmed him, although he beſtowed on him grace ſufficient
enough, to inable him to ſtand; God (I ſay) did righteouſly and wiſely permit
this fall of his, thereby to work out a greater good, then the ſinne of</hi> Adam
<hi>could be an evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Thus God may be called the cauſe appointing and ordering
of all this evil of mankind, partly <hi>permiſſivè</hi> by leaving <hi>Adam</hi> to his own will,
and partly <hi>directivè,</hi> and <hi>ordinativè,</hi> being not a bare ſpectator or ſufferer of
this apoſtaſie, but alſo a righteous director and ordainer of it to bleſſed and
heavenly ends. Though therefore God is here ſaid <hi>to ſhut up all mankind</hi> into
this priſon, yet he is no more cauſe of the evil, which brought this deſolation,
then a Magiſtrate is of the wickedneſs of ſuch a Malefactor, whom he throweth
into priſon; Yea Gods ordering of this fall of <hi>Adam</hi> unto ſuch righteous ends,
doth therein demonſtrate his Mercy and his Juſtice: So that although ſinne be
evil, yet the puniſhing of this is good, as alſo the working of a better good,
then the evil is evil, is a demonſtration of the infinite wiſdom of God. As God
doth it thus, as the chief cauſe, ſo the <hi>Scripture is ſaid to ſhut us up under
ſinne inſtrumentally,</hi> becauſe that declareth the curſe of God due unto us: And
that upon a two-fold account, both becauſe of the actual impieties all do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
as alſo becauſe of that original filthineſs and pollution we are born in.</p>
                        <p>Now it is my purpoſe to treat of Gods righteous diſpenſation towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in this particular only, becauſe ſome do riſe up with great zeal, for the
righteouſneſs, honour and glory of God in this point, as if the Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Orthodox herein, were altogether injurious and derogatory to
him: Hence the <hi>late known Adverſary</hi> to this fundamental Truth about original
ſinne, delivers himſelf thus (<hi>Anſwer to a Letter,</hi> pag. 23, 24) <q>To ſay that
for <hi>Adam's</hi> ſinne it is juſt in God to condemn Infants to the eternal flames of
hell; and to ſay, that concupiſcence or natural inclinations, before they paſſe
unto act could bring eternal condemnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are two ſuch horrid propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
that if any Church in the world would expreſly affirme them, I for
my part ſhould think it unlawfull to communicate with her in the defence, or
profeſſion of either, and think it would be the greateſt temptation in the
world to make men not to love God, of whom they ſpeak ſuch horrid
things.</q> Thus he moſt horribly. Now although theſe two Propoſitions are
ſet down by him odiouſly and captiouſly, not fully expreſſing the Doctrine of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:57719:228"/>
the Reformed Churches, yet it is plain, that he ſtriketh at thoſe Poſitions,
which are for the ſubſtance of them maintained by all Proteſtant Churches, and
doth thereby publiquely profeſſe his ſeparation from, and <hi>non</hi>-communion with
all Proteſtant Churches, and particularly with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in that
9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, which he doth ſo cruelly tear and mangle, that it may not appear
to be what indeed it is.</p>
                        <p>Our work therefore ſhall be from this Text, to declare from Scripture-ground
the holineſs, wiſdome and righteouſneſs of God in his proceedings thus
with mankind for <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne: For although all grown perſons are ſhut up
under actual ſins, as well as original, yet here is comprehended both, ſeeing it
doth extend to all that may have ſalvation by Chriſt, out of which number In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
are not to be excluded. Therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth this Text amongſt
others, to prove that there is an original ſinne that all are born in. And ſo we
obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That God for righteous and wiſe ends manifeſted in the Scripture, hath ſhut
up all mankind in a ſtate of ſinne and damnation:</hi> That God who could have
preſerved <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of happineſſe, and continued it to all his poſterity,
ſo that thereby no ſinne or condemnation, would have come upon any one
man (for there would then <hi>none have done evil, no not one</hi>) hath ordered the
contrary way, ſuffering man to fall, and thereby all mankind to be in a ſtate of
condemnation, whereby alſo ſin is ſo predominant, that now there is <hi>none that
doth good, no not one.</hi> The Scripture doth in other places with much exactneſſe
and diligence take notice of the proceeding of God in this way, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9.
The Apoſtle dividing all mankind into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſheweth, that though
there may be many differences in ſeveral reſpects, yet as to a ſtate of ſin by nature
and ſo a neceſſity of juſtification by Chriſt all were alike; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>We
have before proved,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, The word is very emphatical, ſome make it
to <hi>charge, complain,</hi> and in an heavy manner to <hi>accuſe;</hi> So that to be by nature
of our ſelves in a ſtate of wrath, not being able without the grace of Chriſt, to
avoid this condemnation, is the greateſt guilt that we can be charged with: It
ought not to ſeem a light and contemptible thing that we come thus curſed in
the world; But becauſe men may be accuſed falſly, and the <hi>Pelagians</hi> charge
us with laying a falſe curſe upon mankind; hence the Greek word ſignifieth
more (<hi>viz.</hi>) ſo to charge a thing upon a man, as by ſtrong reaſons to prove
it, to ſhew clearly the cauſes and grounds of it. therefore our Tranſlators ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it. <hi>We have before proved;</hi> So that the Apoſtles meaning is, We have not
only ſaid thus, but we have proved; A Metaphor (ſay ſome) from thoſe
who have caſt up their accounts, and upon exact conſideration do conclude,
this is the ſumme: But what is that he hath <hi>proved,</hi> even that <hi>all are under
ſinne,</hi> not only actual, for many were not guilty of thoſe actual ſinnes he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merateth,
but under a ſtate of ſinne, they could not avoid it, becauſe of the
corrupt nature they bring with them into the world. Therefore <hi>Contzer</hi>
the Jeſuite (<hi>Comment in</hi> Rom. <hi>cap. 3. Quaeſt.</hi> 3.) making this Queſtion, How
the Apoſtle could affirm thoſe following ſins reckoned by the Apoſtle of all
men, after he had given ſeveral interpretations, concludeth, that that is the
beſt expoſition, and moſt conſonant to the Text, as alſo the ſcope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and moſt apt to reſell hereſies, which underſtandeth it of all men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their nature and originals, and by their works are made more ſinfull;
for ſeeing all are under original ſinne, and by nature children of wrath, when by
age they can actually ſinne, they ſtirre up this hereditary evil in them, <hi>That
there is none righteous:</hi> neither the <hi>Jew</hi> by the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, nor the <hi>Gentile</hi> by
the <hi>Heathen</hi> Law. Thus even a Jeſuite, which may exceedingly ſhame our
<hi>Britannus Coluber,</hi> as <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old was called, and may be tranſmitted to
ſuch who are guilty of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his errour by imitation. Now that this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:57719:229"/>
given is moſt conſonant to the Apoſtles ſcope, is plain, becauſe if he did
not ſo conclude by his Diſputation, That every one naturally, not one except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was thus under ſinne, then ſuch exempted ones would not need juſtification
by Chriſt: Therefore obſerve at <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. how univerſally he expreſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>That every mouth might be ſtopped;</hi> It is taken from a guilty malefactor,
whoſe faults are ſo evidently proved, that he cannot tell what to ſay, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in his own conſcience; and thus ought every one to be, partly by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and partly by experience ſo fully convinced of his native-pollution and
ſinfulneſs, that he cannot in the leaſt manner boaſt of himſelf, attribute any
thing to his own power, or complain of God; The Metaphor is either from
a beaſt that hath a muzzle or bridle put in his mouth; or as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> from
the torrent and ſtreams of water, which running violently are damned up;
And this denoteth how readily and impetuouſly a man is carried out to juſtifie
himſelf, to deny any ſuch original pollution, to quarrel and expoſtulate with
God: So that this being Gods end in ſuffering mankind to fall into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
eſtate, even to ſtop mens mouths, to convince them to humble them;
How inexcuſable are thoſe, who from this very diſpenſation do take occaſion to
open their mouths, and to plead the more pertinaciouſly for themſelves? The
other general expreſſion is no leſſe obſervable, <hi>That all the world may become
guilty before God:</hi> Oh the impudence of thoſe fore-heads that dare plead, not
guilty, as to a conſiderable part of the world! But this of the Apoſtle is a very
thunderbolt; for the expreſſion is taken from the malefactor who is found

demerits, he can expect nothing but condemnation; How happy were it, if
ſuch who abound in Diſputations for mans innocency by nature, would at laſt

out of themſelves, for if they be any of this world, they muſt acknowledge

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:57719:229"/>
myſtery herein, why God ſhould by his free grace deliver ſome out of this priſon,
and leave others therin, we ſee how pathetically and powerfully he breaketh out
into a divine acclamation, concerning the incomprehenſible judgements and ways
of God, as being that only which may ſilence all our humane reaſonings in theſe
caſes; There being no more certain way to become fooliſh and corrupt in our
imaginations, then when we do preſumptuouſly adventure to judge of Gods
proceedings according to our limited capacities; for as it is with a man that
ſhall fix his eyes too much upon the dazeling Sunne, he is ſo farre from behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of it, that he doth rather loſe that ability to ſee which he had
before: <hi>Thus when men will too arrogantly dive into the reaſons of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations
towards mankind, he is ſo farre from getting a full knowledge thereof,
that many times for his pride he is left by God, and thoſe abilities which he
had before are blaſted.</hi> Let us therefore with the Apoſtle in matters of this
nature, ſay, <hi>How unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out?</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">

concerning original ſinne content thy ſelf with the revelation of the Doctrine,
that it is ſo, and conclude, there is no iniquity or injuſtice with God, though this
tranſcend thy inveſtigation of it; For as it is impoſſible for a man to catch hold
of his own ſhadow, but the more he ſtretchedth out to take it, the farther it flieth
from him; So it's concerning the Nature, Attributes and wayes of God, the
more we think to apprehend them, the higher they ſoar from our reach; But of
this more in the proſecution of the point.</p>

as to the matter of Original Sinne.</head>
                        <p>VVE are to treat on Gods righteous proceedings, as to the matter of
original ſinne, and that we may be the better directed herein, Let us
lay down theſe Propoſitions:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>He that would not dangerouſly erre about this fundamental truth, muſt
take heed of yeelding himſelf up to humane and philoſophical arguments.</hi> A man
that would rightly know the magnitude of the Sunne, muſt not judge by his
ſenſe, but by an artificial inſtrument, for the principles of art will correct ſenſe;
So he that will fully underſtand the wiſdom and righteouſneſs of God in invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all mankind in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne muſt not judge by humane reaſons, but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
demonſtrations, for the principles of faith, will rectifie thoſe of reaſon;
So that if you ask, What is the bitter root of all that bitter fruit (I mean cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
doctrinal opinions about original ſinne?) We may readily anſwer, The
inordinate attending to humane reaſonings; As the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old did firſt
urge Reaſon, and then Authority of Scripture, whereas that Embleme of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi>
is alwayes to be remembred, <hi>Theologia noſtra eſt Pythagorica,</hi> our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
is Pythagorical, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> is in ſtead of all ſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
demonſtrations. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> and their followers are much alike in the
point of original ſinne, as the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> in the matter of the Deity
of Chriſt; As the <hi>Socinians</hi> call the Deity of Chriſt, <hi>Somnium Athanaſii
Athanaſius</hi> his dream, ſo do theſe original ſinne, <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s figment; As they
ſay, The Fathers before <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his time, and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſpake more
temperately about the Trinity, ſo do theſe alſo of the Ancients before <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s
time concerning original ſinne. And as there are one or two philoſophical
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57719:230"/>
principles, which plunged them into thoſe damnable hereſies about the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and Chriſt's Deity (<hi>viz.</hi>) That, <hi>Qua ſunt eadem uni tertio ſunt eadem
inter ſe,</hi> and, <hi>Vna ſubſiſtentia non poteſt terminare duas naturas,</hi> one ſubſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
cannot terminate two natures; So that Rule, <hi>Omne peccatum eſt voluntarium,</hi>
Every ſinne muſt be voluntary is the very foundation, upon which all errours
about original ſinne are ſuperſtructed. If then we would be guided into the
truth, let us become humble Diſciples of Chriſt, hearkning to what the Word
ſaith of our condition by nature, and there be eſtabliſhed, though reaſon like
<hi>Job</hi>'s wife tempt thee to <hi>charge God fooliſhly:</hi> It is true, we may by reaſon
defend the juſtice of God in theſe proceedings, but it muſt be reaſon built
upon faith, not faith upon reaſon; let faith lay the foundation, then reaſon
may confirme and adorne. It is <hi>Stella</hi> his compariſon, <hi>Takes the mould of the
earth from the root of the tree, that is decaying, and put your compoſt and dung to
it, and after that throw in your would again, and then that will be exceedingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
to help the fruitfulneſs of the tree, which was an impediment before:</hi>
Thus reaſon ſuperadded will illuſtrate faith, whereas if laid as a foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
it will indanger all. But that which doth for the moſt part corrupt us, is,
We firſt receive opinions according to humane perſwaſions, and then going
to the Scripture, we think that ſpeaketh according to our prepoſſeſſed imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> were the <hi>Patriarches</hi> of <hi>Heretiques; Placonical Phyloſophy</hi>
in the Fathers, and <hi>Ariſtotelical</hi> in the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> hath wonderfully debaſed
the pure gold of <hi>divine truths.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. <hi>He that would not dangerouſly erre in this neceſſary point, he muſt mortifie ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love,
he muſt above all things take breed of a ſelf-righteouſneſs and ſelf-admiration:</hi>
For our corruption herein, is, that which maketh us to judge every thing unjuſt in
God that is not pleaſing to us; we will rather naturally accuſe God a thouſand
times over, then accuſe or condemne our ſelves; As the love of God had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
dominion in <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart while in the ſtate of integrity, ſo in man
fallen on the contrary, ſelf-love is that which keepeth the principality in our
ſouls; ſo that whatſoever we now love, it is becauſe we love our ſelves; Why
doth the covetous man love wealth, but becauſe he loveth himſelf? Why doth
the ambitious man honours, the voluptuous man pleaſures, but becauſe he
loveth himſelf? yea this extends to God alſo, we love nothing of God, but for
our ſelves, as if God were for us, not we for God; Hence it is that we would
have a god like us; we make an Idol-god in our hearts inſtead of the true God;
That which God chargeth upon ſome ſinners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. is true of all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Thou thoughteſt I was ſuch an one as thy ſelf;</hi> now this is the rotten core
in every mans heart; we think God to be like our ſelves, to do as we would
have him do, and therefore we make that injuſtice in him, which we would not
have him do; No wonder then, if men be generally ſo averſe to this Truth
about original ſinne, for how can a man be naturally willing that this ſhould be
true, I am born in a ſtate of ſinne, I am by nature a child of wrath? Can ſuch
a bitter pill as this be eaſily ſwallowed down? how ſtiffely will men diſpute and
cavil ere they will be convinced of this? Deformed faces are not willing to look
in this glaſs: Therefore it is a good ſimilitude which <hi>Corteſius</hi> the Schooleman
(2. <hi>Sentent. diſtinc. 7. pag.</hi> 48. who affecteth to turn all School-language into a
polite flile,) uſeth concerning <hi>Pelagians</hi> denying original ſinne, he compareth
them to Dogs that cannot endure the halter they are tied by, and therefore
all their endeavour is to gnaw the cord in pieces, that they may runne looſe,
Thus (ſaith he) do theſe corrupt Doctors, they are unwilling to be bound in
this chain: No man can endure this cord, whereby folly is bound up in his heart,
and therefore they ſtrive to teare it in pieces; They would gladly believe
there is no ſuch thing, but the Scripture-truth will abide firme, whether thou
believeſt it or not; Thou art by nature in an undone and a damnable eſtate,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:57719:230"/>
whether thou will be perſwaded of it or no. Therefore</p>
                        <p>In the third place, Seeing this Doctrine of original ſinne and Gods procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
therein are principally made known to us by Scripture-revelation; <hi>It is
our wiſdome to keep cloſe to what is written, and not to give way to ſuch curious
Diſputations that will never have an end:</hi> If ſo be the diſciples of <hi>Plato</hi> would
ſilence themſelves with this, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, here <hi>Plato</hi> doth
command us to ſtay, to reſt and diſpute no further; if (I ſay) this would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſtop their mouthes, how much more ſhould the command of God
and Chriſt, when we can ſay, here Chriſt hath commanded us to enquire no
further? It is not therefore with divine truths, as it is with philoſophical, for
with the latter, though we know <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith ſo, yet we may enquire into
the truth of it, but in Theological things, if it appear God hath ſaid this, then
we muſt not judge but believe; ſo that it is a learned ignorance, when we affect
not to know above what is written. It is a good reſolution of <hi>Luthers, (In
cup. Geneſ. 6.) I follow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>alwayes this rule, that I may avoid thoſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which may draw me up to the throne of Gods ſupreme Majeſty;</hi> Melius &amp; tutius
eſt ad praeſepe Chriſt hominis conſiſtere; <hi>It is better and ſafer to ſtand at the
manager of Chriſt as man;</hi> For this end we have <hi>Elihu</hi> and God himſelf at laſt
humbling <hi>Job,</hi> who had diſputed the righteous proceedings of God too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly,
by the conſideration of Gods tranſcendent greatneſs to mans
capacity, yea by theſe natural things, convincing him of his infirmity which we
ſee very day as the rain and thunder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now certainly if we cannot behold
a ſtarre much leſs the Sunne; if we cannot find out the reaſon of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in natural things, how much more in ſupernatural. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, This is alwayes to be laid down as a foundation, there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
with God, whatſoever he doth is very juſt, though many times
this is ſecret and hidden to us: Even as <hi>David,</hi> while eſtuating in his ſoul, and
perplexed about Gods diſpenſations in this world, thinking that equality of
adminiſtrations to thoſe that were not equall was inequallity; yet leaſt this
ſour leaven ſhould imbitter him too much, he layeth down as a ſure principle
and foundation, and that in the very beginning; <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael,
even to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi> Pſal 73. 1. And the Apoſtle in thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
myſteries about Election and Reprobation, doth check the preſumptuous
Diſputations of men: Who will contend with God in ſuch caſes? <hi>Rom</hi> 9. And
<hi>Elihu</hi> argueth againſt <hi>Job,</hi> Chap 34. 18. Is it fit to ſay to a King, thou art
wicked, and to Princes, ye are ungodly? he meaneth of ſuch whoſe righteouſneſs
and integrity is univerſally approved of; for the Prophets did many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprove
ungodly Kings, and informe them of their impieties, (though we are
to do our duties even to ſuch with acknowlengement of their eminent place)
Then how much more unſufferable is it concerning God, of whom all men have
this inbred notion, that he is <hi>optimus</hi> as well as <hi>maximus,</hi> for any (if God do
thus and thus, when yet the Scripture declareth that he doth ſo) to accuſe it for
unrighteouſneſs? Our work then is to ſhew, that ſuch Truths are revealed in
Scripture, That God taketh ſuch and ſuch wayes in his dealings with mankind,
and when this is eſtabliſhed, then let us ſay, <hi>God is true, and every man is a liar;</hi>
Then let us proclaime the righteouſneſs of God, though we cannot ſatisfie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
curious Objection; yea our duty were to paſs them by with contempt and
ſilence, did not the importunity of the Adverſaries provokens; ſo that we are
<hi>to anſwer a fool in his ſolly, leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> Prov. 26. 5. And
indeed (excepting one particular) there is not any thing ſcarce of any moment,
that may make a man ſo much as doubt about the righteouſneſs of God in this
Doctrine of original ſinne, as it is delivered by Proteſtant Writers, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the <hi>pattern in the Mount,</hi> which that it may appear in its harmony, and not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:57719:231"/>
judge of a piece by it ſelf, but in its compleat proportion. I ſhall proceed to
adde further Propoſitions. Hence</p>
                        <p>In the fourth place obſerve, <hi>God made made man at firſt perfect both in ſoul
and body, as his body was not ſubject to diſeaſes and death, ſo neither his ſoul to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and paſſions: God made him right,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. yea in his own image,
righteouſneſs and true holineſs, not as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, that he was created in
a meer innocency, that is indifferency to good or evil, not being made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
till man ſhould make himſelf: Man with ſimplicity in his underſtanding,
and childiſhneſs, as if he differed but a little from an Ideot; it is wonder they
do not alſo ſay, he was created blind, as <hi>Suarez</hi> reporteth (<hi>Diſput. de ſtatu
innocentiae.</hi>) of ſome who held ſo, becauſe it is ſaid, after his fall, <hi>That their
eyes were opened:</hi> Certainly, the Image of God he was created in, and with
ſuch a peculiar expreſſion, which the Scripture taketh notice of, <hi>Let us make
man after our own Image, Gen.</hi> 1. 26. doth denote nothing but excellency and
perfection in him, both for natural and ſpiritual things, and ſhall we think that
God who made his body perfect and in full ſtature, would not do the like for
his ſoul; The end alſo for which God made him neceſſarily preſuppoſeth him
indued with all wiſdom and holineſs, for he was made the head of mankind, he
was made to be the Governour and Lord of the world, he impoſed names on
the beaſts, which argued both his knowledge and ſuperiority, he was made to
glorifie and praiſe God, to have conſtant communion with him and enjoyment of
him, and who can think God created him for ſuch a ſublime end without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
ability thereunto, and the rather conſidering, how God created
every thing in its kind, as <hi>good, yea very good;</hi> Every creature was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
by its natural operations to attain its natural end, and ſhall man only be
made imperfect? So that we are fully to believe this good and glorious eſtate
that God made <hi>Adam</hi> in; for <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> begin to erre here. This
is the firſt ſtep to all their future abominations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prop. 5. God did not only create man thus with an internal ſufficiency of ability
to perſevere in this holy and bleſſed eſtate, but did alſo vouchſafe all other auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of grace, that might inable him to hold out:</hi> Even <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
could do no good thing without the help of God, and therefore though
whole, yet he needed the Phyſician, not indeed to heal him, or recover him,
but to preſerve him from falling, and no wonder <hi>Adam</hi> needed this grace of
God, ſeeing the very Angels likewiſe did; So that the very difference why
ſome did fall, and the others ſtand, was the grace of God, inſomuch that that
of <hi>Paul</hi> may be applied, even to Angels as well as men, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Who made
thee to differ from another, and what haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> Hence
the Scripture maketh their election the cauſe of their ſtanding, being therefore
called the elect Angels, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 21. Adam</hi> then was created thus ſufficient
within, and wanting nothing without, either of directing or preſerving grace
to continue him in this bleſſed eſtate, and which is the greater aggravation of
that full and ſufficient eſtate God created him in, he had nothing within him that
might concupiſcentially draw away his heart from God. It was not with <hi>Adam</hi>
as with us, who though we have grace by Chriſt to help us, yet there is within
us a repugnant principle thereunto; There is a root of rebellion within us to
this grace of God, but all things in <hi>Adam</hi> were quiet and harmonious when
the Devil did caſt in his fiery darts, there was not ſo much as the leaſt prepared
materials to receive them, as it is with us, when the Devil doth tempt without
we have ſomething within that is treacherous, that is ready like a little thief, to
let in the great one, but in <hi>Adam</hi> every thing was right, all lay in the meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of his will, if he would ſtand, he might, there was nothing within
or without, that was an impediment to him, whereas the great miſery that is
brought upon man, by this original corruption is, that though grace doth many
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:57719:231"/>
times exciſe and ſtirre up the will, yet we cannot do what we would, as <hi>Paul</hi>
doth moſt ſadly complain, <hi>Rom. 7. Adam</hi> while in the ſtate of integrity did
reſemble God, though with infinite diſproportion, in whom <hi>poteſtas</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas</hi>
are all one: Thus in <hi>Adam</hi> his <hi>poſſe</hi> was his <hi>velle,</hi> let him will what was
good, and he did it, there was no innate corruption to make the execution of
it difficult, but (alas) man in his lapſed eſtate doth need that grace, which doth
not only give the <hi>poſſe,</hi> but the <hi>velle</hi> alſo; Hence he is ſaid to work in us both to
<hi>will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. <hi>and that of his good pleaſure,</hi> not of our good will
and pleaſure, as ſome would pervert that Text.</p>

ſtreams.</p>
                        <p>The Propoſition is this, <hi>God who made man thus perfect and exactly qualified
every way to attain that glorious and for which he was made, did not appoint him
as a meer ſingle perſon to ſtand and fall for himſelf, but as a publique perſon, in
whom we were all repreſented, and whoſe will ſhould be as the will of all mankind;</hi> and
therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. we are not only ſaid to be <hi>made ſinners by him,</hi> which deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
our inherent corruption, but alſo to <hi>ſinne in him,</hi> which ſuppoſeth, that
our perſons were repreſented in him, not in this ſenſe, as if we had appointed
<hi>Adam</hi> our delegate (as it were) and ſo had paſſed over our wils to him, for
how could that be, when we had no exiſtency or being at all; Therefore <hi>this
was wholly by the appointment of God,</hi> that it ſhould be ſo, who is the ſupream
Lord over all mankind; Even as Chriſt was <hi>Surety</hi> for all thoſe who were given
him of the Father, not as if believers did delegate him (as ſome have abſurdly
and odiouſly ſtated the Queſtion) <hi>but he was deſigned to that office by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

mankind, though he did prove (as it were) the <hi>Phaeton,</hi> involving all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in utter deſtruction; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> was the head of mankind two wayes,</p>
                        <p>1. He was the <hi>caput naturale,</hi> the natural head from which his off ſpring was

hereby the whole maſs and lump of mankind is ſoured with it; but this is not all,
Therefore</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>He was made</hi> caput morale, <hi>God did appoint him to be our
moral head,</hi> covenanting with him, that if he perſervered, the good promiſed
ſhould redound to him and to all his poſterity, but if he did apoſtatize then he
and all his off-ſpring ſhall be plunged into the evil threatned, and this Covenant
was made known to <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſo he might be the more carefull to look to his
duty; Neither was it requiſite that God ſhould expect <hi>Adam</hi>'s conſent, or ours
to this agreement, ſeeing God is the abſolute Sovereign and Lord of all, and
herein did conſult for our good, better then if he had taken any other way, as
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:57719:232"/>
is more to be inſiſted on. But againſt this Covenant many riſe up with open
mouth; <hi>Soto</hi> the Papiſt he derides it, the <hi>late Writer,</hi> ſo often mentioned, ſaith,
he knoweth of no ſuch thing, and which is the greater pity; <hi>Jauſenius</hi> more
orthodox, though a Papiſt, then many who call themſelves Proteſtants, in the
<hi>Pelagian</hi> Controverſies, he following <hi>Auſtin</hi> too rigidly calleth it, <hi>Novum
pacti myſterium,</hi> &amp;c. the new myſtery of a Covenant founded upon no Scripture,
Tradition, or ſolid Reaſon, but exeogitated by meer humane Authority (<hi>De
Stat. Nat. lap. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 16.) But though this Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> be not
expreſſed, yet evident and inſeparable conſequences from the Scripture will
compel us to believe it, <hi>For was the commination of death only to him as a ſingular
perſon, was he only intereſſed in the puniſhment of death, if he did diſobey;</hi> The
event demonſtrateth the clean contrary, for do not all die upon his voluntary
tranſgreſſion? Is not this then plainly to ſay, that God made a Covenant with
him as a publique perſon? And if <hi>Auſtin</hi> were not of that mind, how could he
ſay, <hi>Omnes homines fuernnt ille unus homo?</hi> We were not all that one man <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically</hi>
and <hi>naturally,</hi> therefore <hi>morally</hi> and by Covenant in Gods eſtimation,
<hi>per jurisfictionem</hi> (as they ſay) though we muſt not think this was a meer ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or imaginary thing, as the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> call it, only a diſpenſative Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
not as if God were really angry with mankind for this tranſgreſſion.
Again, If there were not this Covenant, the Apoſtle could not lay it ſtill upon
<hi>one man,</hi> Rom. 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. but if it were only becauſe the root is defiled,
then our parents ſins would be accounted to us as well as <hi>Adam</hi>'s, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<hi>Auſtin</hi> to incline to that opinion alſo.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, (For I have proved this before) <hi>Adam</hi> is called, <hi>Rom. 5. 14. The
figure of his who was to come,</hi> that is, Chriſt; The <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the Type, that is by
way of contrariety, that as Chriſt was the head of all believers to juſtification
and eternal life; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was the head of all his poſterity to ſinne and eternal
death; Therefore Chriſt is called the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby it is plain, That
God did appoint theſe two as two contrary heads, and publique perſons for two
contrary ends, <hi>which doth neceſſarily imply a Covenant;</hi> and indeed who can
deny, but that as all the Angels did ſtand upon their own perſonal account;
The other Angels did not ſinne in <hi>Lucifer</hi> as a common head, though happily
by imitation, but they all ſtood upon their own bottom, and ſo were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their own perſonal iniquity; ſo God alſo might have ordered about
man, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne ſhould not have hurt his poſterity, what he did ſhould
be imputed to his own perſon only, as it is now with parents in reſpect of their
children: Thus men might not have been ſubordinate to him, but collateral in
reſpect of a moral conſideration, though naturally they deſcended from him,
for the denying of original righteouſneſs, which is the conſequent of <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſinne, was wholly at his free pleaſure, only ſuppoſing the Covenant, it doth
become neceſſary to us to be deprived of it, and it cannot be rationally thought,
how original righteouſneſs upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtanding could have been propagated
to his poſterity without this Covenant of God, that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                        <p>So then if this foundation be ſurely laid, this will abundantly quell all thoſe
calumnies, whereby Gods proceedings are traduced in this point; for whereas
it is thought to be unheard of injuſtice, and intollerable, that we ſhould not
only be made miſerable, both temporally and eternally by another mans ſinne,
but alſo ſinfull by his ſinne, which is thought to be the greateſt cruelty that can
be imagined: We are made ſinners whether we will or no, that we may be
damned whether we will or no. This Propoſition may ſerve to compoſe ſuch
diſtempered apprehenſions, not indeed but that we muſt admire in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
at Gods holy and righteous proceedings, which we are not fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> is affected with the <hi>miris modis,</hi> and <hi>occultis judiciis</hi> of God
in theſe diſpenſations; And he that will not leave to faith, to apprehend where
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:57719:232"/>
reaſon cannot comprehend, doth deſerve both <hi>ex congruo &amp; condigno,</hi> to be
accounted a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> rather than a <hi>Chriſtain,</hi> and his Religion <hi>Reaſon,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>Faith;</hi> For what point is there in thoſe myſteries of faith, which we
believe, wherein we are not to cry out <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Oh the depths!</hi> Our oyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell
cannot empty that Ocean; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> is reported to have a viſion of a
young man attempting to do ſo, while he was writing his book of the Trinity,
thereby informing him of humane incapacity to reach comprehenſively to ſuch
things. Again, There is none ſaith, that this ſinfull condition, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
miſerable is brought upon <hi>Infants neceſſarily;</hi> for although as to
them it's inevitable, yet in <hi>Adam, it was free and voluntary,</hi> God had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
furniſhed him withall abilities to make mankind happy, and none may
preſume of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, that he would have done otherwiſe. Who can
ſay, he would have done otherwiſe then <hi>Adam</hi> did, ſeeing God did on purpoſe
create man at firſt in ſuch a furniſhed and qualified manner, that as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth,
the world might ſee what the free-will of man could do, that now we
may ſee what the grace of Chriſt can do.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, (Which conſideration alone is able to overthrow the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all the calumnies caſt upon this Doctrine) <hi>God when he made</hi> Adam
<hi>thus the common truſtee for mankind, did herein conſult our good;</hi> It was for mans
advantage that all this was done for him, he intended original righteouſneſs,
immortality and happineſſe ſhould deſcend from him to his poſterity, upon his
perſeverance, ſo that no more evil is now inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s off-ſpring
then good was deſigned and provided for him, if he had continued in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
If ſinne and miſery come upon Infants now before actual knowledge,
ſo would original righteouſneſſe and happineſſe have deſcended upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their conſent; and whereas happily many of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, yea all,
if left to themſelves, would have revolted from God; upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
all would have been confirmed: So that we ſee God doth not inflict more
evil then he had provided good for us.</p>
                        <p>Again, <hi>The known Enemy to the Doctrine of original ſinne</hi> doth falſly and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
repreſent this Doctrine, as if Infants were innocents, and yet we hold
them guilty of eternal damnation, and therefore having muſtered many reaſons
together, concludeth upon the account of them, That it is ſafe to affirm, that
God doth not damn any one to hell for the ſinne of another. (<hi>Vnum Neceſſ.
cap. 6. Sect.</hi> 1.) Now this is to make <hi>Chimera's</hi> of his own head, for no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ſaith, That an Infant deſerveth hell, meerly becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, nor is
he obnoxious to the wrath of God meerly for that, but becauſe this corruption
of <hi>Adams</hi> is alſo propagated to the child, and ſo it is obnoxious to the wrath
of God, for that inherent derived pollution, and the Scripture being as plain
and clear in deſcribing of ſuch a natural eſtate of man by his deſcent from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
as may poſſibly be deſired; We muſt not leave ſuch evident Texts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we may ſubtilly diſpute in a cavilling manner about Gods proceedings
herein. It is good Rule among the Schoolmen, That <hi>in Philoſophicis argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum
facit fidem,</hi> but <hi>in Theologicis-fides facit argumentum,</hi> In Philoſophy
the Argument worketh ſaith or aſſent, but in Divinity, ſaith worketh the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
So that we are to believe that one place, if there were no more, of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s confeſſion, <hi>Pſal. 51. 5. Behold I was ſhopen in iniquity, and in ſinne did
my mother conceive me,</hi> then all the curious, preſumptuous ſpeculations of men,
who from reaſon would demoliſh this truth, and as for their evaſions, and
wreſtings of that place, they are ſo forced and irrational, that a man may juſtly
tremble to ſee men no more reverentially ſubmit their thoughts to the Scripture;
Certainly the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> intended, that every one ſhould have a ſpecial regard to
this truth delivered there, becauſe of the (<hi>Behold</hi>) prefixed, which is, as I
may ſo ſay, the <hi>Aſteriſce</hi> of the holy Ghoſt, or the Bibles <hi>nota benè</hi> (as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſaid in this Text.)</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="432" facs="tcp:57719:233"/>
                           <hi>If further it be objected,</hi> That it was not voluntary to <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, their
conſents were to be expected.</p>
                        <p>To this it is eaſily anſwered, That ſeeing God had provided ſuch a way for
mankind, as was for their good, ſeeing the contrary good, and more alſo to
that evil we are now fallen into, was intended for us in caſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
how ſilly is it to ſay, mans conſent ſhould be expected? Not to adde fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the holy wiſdom of God ordering it thus, is enough to make us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to open our mouths more againſt this way; and as for the involuntarineſſe
of this ſinne, we have ſeveral times ſpoken to that, <hi>It was voluntary as farre as
the nature of ſuch a ſinne did require,</hi> even as habitual ſinnes are not voluntary,
as actual are, but are as farre as habitual ones do require. It was voluntary
<hi>effectivè;</hi> This ſinne did not ariſe from the nature or matter of man neceſſarily,
as the <hi>Materiarii</hi> and other Heretiques taught, but by the voluntary tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Adam;</hi> It is alſo voluntary <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> for this corruption is chiefly ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the will, which ruleth the whole man; and it is voluntary <hi>conſecntivè</hi> by
conſequent, for man naturally delighteth in this evil eſtate, and till grace make
a change we are not weary of this condition. It is true, this ſubſequent will
whereby we delight in our original pollution, doth not properly make original
ſinne to be ours, for this is an actual ſinne, and floweth from that better root,
only it ſheweth that this evil eſtate is ſo farre from being contrary to mans will
naturally, that it delighteth in it, and doth contumaciouſly rebell againſt the
grace of Chriſt that would deliver.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Whereas the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is commonly objected againſt
this truth, where God by the Prophet at large declareth, <hi>That the Sonne ſhall
not die for the fathers ſinne</hi> (an innocent for a nocent) <hi>but every one ſhall die in
his own iniquity;</hi> I have ſpoken ſomething to this already, neither am I to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
how that place is to be reconciled with the ſecond Commandment,
wherein God is ſaid, <hi>To viſit the iniquity of fathers upon their children to ſeveral
generations,</hi> Exod. 20. 3. and ſeveral inſtances of Scripture make it good. To
be ſure the Proverb which gave occaſion to this paſſage, was a prophane one,
redounding to Gods diſhonour; <hi>Sanctius (in locum</hi>) the Papiſt thinketh that
the Jews of old had uſed it, and that becauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall imputed to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
but it ſeemeth rather at that time to be taken up, while under the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, eſpecially for <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> his ſins, as appeareth <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 4. where
is obſervable, that though <hi>Manaſſes</hi> had repented, and his ſinnes pardoned to
him, yet God viſited them upon the Nation afterward; So that it may not ſeem
ſtrange: If it be affirmed, That notwithſtanding <hi>Adam</hi> repented, and his ſinne
pardoned, yet it may be viſited upon all his poſterity. There are various
thoughts about the interpretation of the place: Some making it a promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Covenant of grace only, as it ſeemeth probable, if you compare it with
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 29. where the ſame prophane Proverb is mentioned, and this promiſe
to the contrary, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> was under the Covenant of works. Others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
probably ſay, This is not to be extended to all times and places, only God
promiſeth, That in their particular condition at preſent, they ſhall have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to uſe it; for ſuch who did, might be brought back from their captivity.
Thus <hi>Sanctius</hi> and <hi>Maldenate,</hi> becauſe (ſay they) it is plain, That the <hi>Jews</hi>
now are under their grievous calamity for their fathers ſake, who crucified
Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Let his blood be upon us and our children,</hi> Mat. 27. 25. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Expoſition be, it doth not gain-ſay this Doctrine of original ſinne, for
there it ſpeaketh of <hi>children free from their parents ſins;</hi> we ſpeak of children
filled with inherent corruption themſelves, though derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> and
chiefly, becauſe there the Prophet ſpeaketh of particular, private parents,
whereas we ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> was a publique appointed perſon by God himſelf, ſo
that that of <hi>Adam</hi>'s is extraordinary, even as Chriſt, though innocent, yet
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:57719:233"/>
died for our ſins, which yet ſeemeth to contradict this place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and
the <hi>Socinians</hi> bring it to prove it could not ſtand with Gods juſtice to puniſh
Chriſt, being innocent, for our ſins.</p>
                        <p>But in the cloſe of all we may juſtly retort on thoſe who oppoſe this truth,
that they attribute much injuſtice and cruelty to God, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
urge the <hi>Pelagians</hi> with, for they make all the miſery that many times
falleth upon young Infants, yea and that repugnancy and temptation that is
within us againſt good to be <hi>from our primitive conſtitution, that God made us ſo.</hi>
Thoſe that will not acknowledge original ſinne to be the cauſe of this miſery,
muſt make God to be ſo, and therefore, as appeareth by <hi>Baronius (Annal.
Anno</hi> 418.) The Emperors Edict made to baniſh <hi>Pelagians,</hi> containeth this, as
one reaſon, <hi>Proprer trucem inclementiam</hi> &amp;c. for the horrid and cruel incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
they attribute to God, paſſing a ſentence upon man to die before he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;
But I ſhall hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of the Effects of original ſin
make it appear, <q>That the oppoſers of original ſinne do more unjuſtly, yea
and blaſphemouſly attribute many things to God in a farre more tranſcendent
way then their adverſaries are by them ſuppoſed to do; How can it ſtand with
the goodneſs, mercy and love of God, that ſo much evil, and death it ſelf
ſhould be upon mankind from mans Creation, and not rather that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let the Uſe of all this be to humble our ſelves under Gods righteous proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to ſay with <hi>Job</hi> chap. 40. 3 <hi>Behold I am vile, I will lay my hand upon my
mouth;</hi> Yea mayeſt thou not admire at the wiſe ends of God revealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
why this ſhould be? This is to ſtop every mans mouth; This is to make
it appear, <hi>That all the world is guilty before God;</hi> This is to make it appear, that
Chriſt is neceſſary, this is the way to make Chriſt more glorious and precious to
thoſe that do believe.</p>

and ſome particular, as the paines inflicted upon women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in child-bearing; the general are the curſes that are
brought upon the whole world, and every part thereof.
I ſhall limit my ſelf only to thoſe that belong to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and are inſeparably annexed to every <hi>individium</hi>

                           <pb n="438" facs="tcp:57719:236"/>
I ſhall begin with the ſpiritual, and firſt pitch upon that <hi>propenſity and vehement
inclination which is in every one by nature to ſinne:</hi> This plainly demonſtrateth
there is a ſinful and corrupted principle within, elſe all mankind would not be
ſo prone and inclining to evil as they are, and this Text will abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
us of the ready and delightfull propenſity that is in every man (none
exempted) to that which is evil; They are the words of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> one of <hi>Job</hi>'s
friends, who taketh an Argument from this proneneſs in mans nature to ſinne
to humble <hi>Job,</hi> and to make him more patiently ſilent under Gods heavy hand
upon him. <hi>Job</hi> indeed acknowledgeth this very truth, <hi>Chap</hi> 14. 4. and doth
from thence debaſe himſelf under Gods dealings with him, but <hi>Eliphaz</hi> repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
this again, either becauſe the moſt holy that are, though they ſometimes
affect their hearts with divine truths, and do make a bleſſed improvement of
them, yet at other times when the temptation is violent, they need to have the
ſame truths ſuggeſted to them again by others, or elſe though <hi>Job</hi> was convinced,
that man being thus unclean, he might well be moral, and ſubject to diſeaſes,
yet happily he did not ſee the righteouſneſs of God, in inflicting extraordinary
judgements ſuch as his were upon a godly man, delivered from the dominion
of this original pollution, and walking with all integrity of heart, as <hi>Job</hi> was
perſwaded he did. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> therefore maketh uſe of this Truth about mans ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
ſtill to bring <hi>Job</hi> lower in his own eyes, and to make him exalt God,
and indeed there is no truth ſo greatly accommodated to bring a man off, yea
though godly in an high degree from all ſelf-confidence, as alſo all repinings
and murmuring under the ſeverity of God, as this about original ſinne. Now
<hi>Eliphaz</hi> to aggravate this the more, doth at the 14. Verſe ſpeak interrogatively:
<hi>What is man that he ſhould be clean?</hi> and then exegetically explaining this he
addeth, <hi>and he that is born of a woman that he ſhould be righteous:</hi> So that by
cleanneſs is meant righteouſneſs, and there is alſo the reaſon given why none
is righteous, even becauſe born of a woman; So that it is plain all this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
cometh by natural deſcendency from our parents. The firſt Hebrew
word ſignifieth, that a man hath no innocency, ſo that he hath not any cauſe
to complain or murmure under Gods judgments be they never ſo heavy, and
the other denoteth that he hath no righteouſneſs whereby he is able to anſwer
God, if called to his Tribunal; and the word for <hi>man</hi> ſignifieth him a miſerable
wretched man incurably wretched. This propoſition is aggravated <hi>à majori,
Behold he putteth no truſt in his Saints, yea the heavens are not clean in his ſight.</hi>
By Saints ſome have underſtood the godly Patriarches of old, but if we compare
this with <hi>Job</hi> 4. 18. It is plain he meaneth Angels, and if we underſtand it of
evil Angels, it is plain they proved Apoſtates, there was no truſt in them,
they forſook their habitation as if they did contemne it and were weary of it;
or if of good Angels, then it is plain that God neither did put any truſt in them

them, ſo that of themſelves they would have apoſtatized as well as the reſt;
<hi>Eliphaz</hi> addeth for amplification ſake, <hi>The heavens are not clean in his ſight.</hi>
By heavens we are to underſtand metonymically the Angels who dwell therein,
and theſe are ſaid to be not clean in his ſight, comparatively to the purity and
holineſs of God, for as the being of the moſt noble creature is even nothing at all
to his infinite Eſſence, ſo alſo is their righteouſneſs; ſome underſtand the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
without any Trope, as if they were ſaid to be not clean, becauſe they are
ſubject to vaniſh away, <hi>becauſe they ſhall wax old as a garment,</hi> Pſa. 102. 27.
<hi>and there ſhall be made new heavens.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 7. <hi>Cajetan</hi> as <hi>Pineda (in loc.</hi>) obſerveth
from this place, and many others, alwayes taketh occaſion to broach his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That the heavens are animated and ſubject to ſinne, but that opinion is
rejected as abſurd, though it ſeemeth to be <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s opinion that <hi>caelum eſt
animatum.</hi> If then it be thus with Angels, who are ſuch glorious ſpirits, and
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:57719:236"/>
and have not the leaſt blemiſh in their natures comparatively to God; no
wonder that my Text is brought in with an <hi>how much more abominable is man,</hi>
&amp;c. wherein we have man deſcribed from his property and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ition be is in
by nature. And ſecondly the effect, as a ſign demonſtrating of this: The
property is two-fold, <hi>abominable,</hi> even as a carkaſs is abominable that hath
loſt the ſoul which did animate it, ſo is man being made carnal and natural, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
loſt the Spirit of God and his image; <hi>Abhominable,</hi> that denoteth ſuch
loathſomeneſs that we cannot endure to behold or come near the object loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
that we cannot endure the ſight of it; ſuch a thing is man naturally in the
eyes of God, the Hebrew word for man is the ſtrongeſt man, or the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and beſt of men naturally; and indeed this is to be applyed even to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
men alſo, ſo farre as original corruption hath ſtill any vigorous actings in
them, (for ſo ſome think,) <hi>Job</hi> was not ſenſible enough, though otherwiſe
godly, of the contaminating power of original ſinne in him, whereby his beſt
duties had ſome impurity, and ſo God might juſtly bring all that evil upon
him he did; Thus man is abominable and loathſome in the eyes of God, and
he ought to be ſo in his own eyes, to his own ſelf, a natural man ſhould not
be able to bear or endure himſelf, becauſe of that loathſome ſinfulneſs that doth
adhere to him: how much are <hi>Pelagian</hi>-Doctrines that cry up a purity in mans
nature, contrary to this Text? Oh that God would mercifully do that to ſuch
corrupt Doctors, which God threatens in anger to the prophane ſecure ſinner,
<hi>Pſal 50. 21. I will reprove thee, and ſet in order before thy eyes,</hi> the original doth
not name what, the tranſlator addeth his ſinnes, ſome adde thy own ſelf,
which cometh all to one, I will ſet thy ſelf before thy ſelf, and all thy ſinnes,
in the ſeveral kinds and grievous aggravations of then; The Hebrew word is
military and taken from ſetting a battell in aray againſt another; Thus God
ſaid he would do, and what a mercy is it to a man, when all our ſelf-love, ſelf-flattery,
and ſelf-fullneſs ſhall be removed, and God ſhall ſet our ſelves in all
our loathſomeneſs and deformity before our ſelves; What burdens would we
be to our own ſelves? but this is Gods work, humane ſpeculations and moral
inſtructions have no efficacy herein. The ſecond propercy attributed to man
is <hi>filthy:</hi> The Hebrew word is only uſed here, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53. 3.
concerning the root of it, there is no certainty, only it is generally tranſlated
that which is <hi>putrid rotten</hi> and <hi>ſtinking,</hi> and becauſe rotten and putrifying things
are unuſefull and unprofitable: Hence it is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. the word out of
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is rendered unprofitable; Thus man having loſt the Image of God
is become like unſavoury ſalt as he is noiſome in Gods eyes, ſo he is unfit for
any good thing, he is in a ſtate of ſinne, and ſo hath no ability to what is good,
neither can he by any power abiding in him ever recover out of this loſt eſtate,
ſo that man is now become like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vine, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. 2, 3, 4. It will not
ſerve for any work, not ſo much as to make a pin of it to hang a veſſel upon it,
but is only ſuel for fire. Thus unuſefull and unſerviceable a man is become in
reſpect of the leaſt good, whereby the glory of God may be exalted. Thus we
have the properties deſcribing man by his natural principles.</p>
                        <p>In the next place he is deſcribed, by the immediate effect from this curſed
cauſe being thus abominable and filthy, what doth neceſſarily flow from hence?
<hi>even to drink iniquity like water.</hi> This expreſſion ſheweth the vehement inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in man to ſinne, and that with delight; as a man who is greatly thirſty
doth earneſtly deſire to drink, that the heat within may be refrigerated; Of
this expreſſion more in the Doctrine; This is enough to ſhew, how it is with
man relatively to ſinne, even as with a feavouriſh, or hydropical perſon that
is continually calling for ſome drink to cool the heat within.</p>
                        <p>Thus this Text ſheweth us, what is one immediate and inſeperable effect of
mans nature through original corruption, that it doth propend and incline
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:57719:237"/>
with all greedineſs to evil, and <hi>only evil continually;</hi> Yet although this be ſo preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and clear a place, <hi>Socinians</hi> have laboured to obſcure it. And</p>
                        <p>1. (They ſay) It is an <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> This is their conſtant refuge, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Scripture ſaith any thing to exalt Chriſt, or deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e man, they make it
an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> but how can that be accounted an <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> which experience
doth confirme? And the Adverſaries to original ſinne grant, that mankind is
very prone to ſinne, and all are very ready to offend, though they attribute
this to other cauſes rather then original ſinne. This Anſwer of theirs hath
been fully conſuted, when we treated on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
                        <p>2. (They ſay) Such an impurity is noted to be in man, as is in the Angels
and the Heavens, but they have no original ſinne: The Anſwer is, That there
is more attributed to man, <hi>how much more abominable is man?</hi> So that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is taken from the leſs to the greater.</p>
                        <p>3. (They ſay) Theſe words are not to be taken univerſally, or underſtood
of every man; but the expreſſion is univerſal, it excludeth or exempteth <hi>no
man:</hi> man, and born of a woman, are univerſals not particulars.</p>
                        <p>4. (They ſay) Theſe are the words of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> one of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, and
they did not alwayes ſpeak right. It is true, they did not alwayes rightly apply
the Doctrine they ſpake, they miſtook about <hi>Job,</hi> but the Doctrine it ſelf in
the general was true, and therefore we ſee that quoted in the new Teſtament,
as the word of God which <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpake, as that paſſage, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 13. He
taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs,</hi> is <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his ſpeech, <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 13. but for
this particular truth; you have heard <hi>Job</hi> alſo as well as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> confirming
of it, <hi>Job. 14. 3. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one;</hi> Which
is not to be underſtood of bodily filthineſs, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
uncleanneſs, as appeareth by the oppoſite to it in other places, which is
unrighteouſneſs, for it is worth our obſerving that this natural pollution and
ſinfulneſs of man is mentioned four times in this Book of <hi>Job,</hi> with the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of it.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, <hi>Chap. 4. 18, 19. Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>how
much leſs on them that dwell in houſes of clay? whoſe foundation is in the duſt,</hi> &amp;c.
This ſpecial truth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſaith he had in a Viſion, and by ſpecial revelation
from God, and therefore it was the more to be attended unto; if Angels are
not able to ſtand in the preſence of God, but cover even their very faces, the
nobleſt part as conſcious of their imperfection comparatively to God, then no
wonder if ſinful mortal man be affected with his diſtance from, yea and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
to God.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, We have this truth witneſſed unto by <hi>Job,</hi> and that on
purpoſe to debaſe himſelf under God, that if God do ſearch into him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find any thing but what is filthy and unclean, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 4. of which we have
largely treated.</p>
                        <p>The third time we meet with, is here in my Text, where <hi>Eliphaz</hi> repeateth
it again, making uſe thereof to <hi>Job,</hi> that he ſhould acknowledge impurity and
uncleanneſs adhering unto every thing he doth, though never ſo holy.
And</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The fourth or laſt time, is</hi> Chap 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 45, 6. <hi>Where</hi> Bildad <hi>agreeth both with</hi>

The ſtarres are not pure in his ſight—how much leſs man that is a worme,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus you ſee in the mouth of three witneſſes we have this Doctrine aſſured
to us, that man of himſelf is very abominable and filthy: we might think ſuch
clear Texts might for ever convince men, that they ſhould not ſpeak of ſuch a
thing, as <hi>natural is quaedem ſanctitas,</hi> and <hi>probitas,</hi> a natural kind of holineſs
and probity, no though it were among deaf men, the matter is ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:57719:237"/>
and groſſely repugnant to Scripture-light.</p>
                        <p>The laſt exception put in againſt this place by the pure Naturaliſts is, That
<hi>this Text ſpeaketh of actual ſinne, and therefore it maketh nothing for original</hi>
To drink down iniquity like water, <hi>is</hi> (ſay they) <hi>nothing but the</hi>

                           <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
of impiety.</hi> But this is readily granted, for we bring this Text to declare
the <hi>immediate iſſue of original ſinne,</hi> becauſe man is thus abominable by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
therefore <hi>he drinketh down iniquity like water;</hi> he doth not ſpeak here
of men, who by cuſtom have habituated themſelves in an evil way, which is
become like a ſecond nature to them, but of man originally and nakedly in
himſelf, till the grace of God make a change upon him; So that as to drink,
though an action, doth denote thirſt, a natural appetite within; Thus
the acting of iniquity with delight and content, doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe
a corrupted and perverted principle within, from whence all actual evil doth
flow.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Text being fully explained and vindicated from all exceptions, we
may obſerve.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That man being originally corrupted, is therefore prone to all ſinne with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi>
Becauſe he is abominable and filthy, therefore <hi>he ſwalloweth down
iniquity like water;</hi> As in every mans body there is a mortal and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
principle within, which expoſeth to diſeaſes, and at laſt death it ſelf;
So in the ſoul there is a vehement inclination unto every thing that is evil, it's
moſt ſutable and connatural to him; As the feavouriſh man with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and delight doth ſwallow down cold liquour, thinking he never hath
enough: Thus it is with man by nature. That there is in all mankind a
propenſity to ſinne, not onely the Adverſaries to original ſinne, but even
Heathens have acknowledged and bewailed, and we have the Scripture,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. at large deſcribing of it. Now if it were not by original ſinne,
How and whence ſhould a ſinfull inclination be in all men, if there were
an innocency and neutrality meerly in man to good or evil, yea an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
rather to good, becauſe (as they ſay) the ſeeds of vertue are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
in all? How cometh it about that the greater part of mankind is
not good rather than evil? Why ſhould it not be, that to ſinne is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
but to do good is eaſie? But beſides experience, and many Texts of
Scripture, that may confound this preſumptuous opinion, I may inſiſt upon
one for all, <hi>Pſal. 14. 2. The Lord locked down from Heaven upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 3. There
is none that doth good, no not one;</hi> Think not that this is ſpoken of the <hi>Jews</hi>
only, it is ſpoken of all mankind, God looked down upon the children of men,
and not on <hi>Judea</hi> only; So that this ſext is too true, and all ages can give in
their witneſs to it.</p>
                        <p>The Doctrinal Truth we are treating of, is, <hi>That man being by nature filthy
and ſinfull, is thereby carried out with all inclination and delight to ſinne.</hi> Sinne
is as ſweet and as pleaſant to a man by nature, as <hi>water</hi> to a man ſcorched with
thirſt. This expreſſion is very emphatical, it is uſual with the Scripture to apply
the Metaphor from corporeal hunger and thirſt to the ſoul; Hence Chriſt is
compared both to <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> and ſaith in the workings thereof
is compared to <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> of him, yea the graces of the ſoul, whereby
we are carried out intenſively to holy things, is compared to <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirſt,
Matth.</hi> 5. 6 Hence our Saviour to expreſſe his delight in doing of Gods will,
ſaith, <hi>It is his meat to do the will of him that ſent him,</hi> John 4. 34. Thus
then as the godly have a principle of grace within them, whereby they hunger
and thirſt after more enjoyment of God, ſo there is in a natural man a conſtant,
vehement appetite to ſinne, never being ſatisfied, but in obeying the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
This propenſity to ſinne is here expreſſed by <hi>thirſt,</hi> provoking a man to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:57719:238"/>
drink with delight; and abundantly you have the like expreſſion uſed, <hi>Job

                        <p>TO illuſtrate this, Let us conſider, firſt, how much is implied in the
Metaphor that the Text here uſeth, <hi>Man drinketh iniquity like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, Here is denoted a <hi>vehement and violent appetite to ſinne;</hi> Thirſt if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
is intollerable ſome ſay, worſe then hunger; Hence <hi>Samſon</hi> cried out of
his thirſt, though ſo ſtrong a man, he was not able to bear it; and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while upon the Croſſe, complained of no pain, only ſaid, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> which
denoteth the impetuouſneſs of this appetite; It is uſually defined to be <hi>appetitus humidi &amp; frigidi,</hi> an appetite of that which is moiſt and cold, as hunger is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidi
&amp; ſicci,</hi> of that which is hot and dry. But the learned <hi>Voſſius (De Theol.
Genili lib. 3. pag.</hi> 104.) thinketh this definition, though given by <hi>Ariſtrotle,</hi>
ought to be corrected, becauſe hungry men ſometimes deſire cold things to eat,
and thirſtly ſometimes hot things to drink; Therefore he thinketh it more exact
to define hunger an appetite, <hi>humidi pinguis,</hi> of that which is moiſt, but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
and thirſt <hi>humids aquei,</hi> of that which is moiſt, but meerly ſo. For by
ſatisfying of our thirſt, we are not properly nouriſhed, only thereby the meat
we eat, is diſpoſed better to nouriſhment, ſo that thereby the parts of the body,
which were dried, are watered, and the food more eaſily conveyed to its proper
places: yea he will not have hunger or thirſt to be an appetite, but a grief or dolor,
ariſing from the ſenſe of feeling, which is in the ſtomack, though he granteth
an appetite to follow this grief. Howſoever this be in Philoſophy, yet we ſee
thirſt is an appetite, or hath it neceſſarily following it; There is alſo a kind of
pain and grief, whereby every part that is needy calleth for relief, and thus it
is in man by nature, he being deſtitute of the Image of God, and finding no
happineſs in him, doth earneſtly crave for ſome relief from the creatures: he
thirſteth after the pleaſures and profits which are for bidden by Gods Words,
and thereupon his whole endeavour and ſtudy is to fulfill the luſts of this ſinfull
inclination within him; That which is ſaid of ſome particular ſinners, as to ſome
luſts only, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 19. They have given themſelves to work at uncleaneſſe with
greedineſſe;</hi>
As alſo <hi>Jer. 8. 6. Every one turneth to his courſe</hi> (viz. <hi>of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe)
as the horſe ruſheth into the battel,</hi> is true of all men naturally, in reſpect
of ſome ſinne or other. It is true, thoſe mentioned in theſe Texts, had beſides
their natural inclination, ſuperadded inveterate and habituated cuſtoms in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
and ſo they had their firſt and ſecond nature alſo hurrying them away:
but yet the pollution of our nature alone, is enough thus to precipitate us head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

there is a thirſt within, a ſcorching heat after it, and therefore cannot
endure to be hinred from the ſatisfying of it: Thus by this means a man is put

he doth ſinne he is miſerable and undone; As one in a Dropſie, if he doth not
drink, he cannot bear it, and if he doth, he thereby increaſeth his danger:
Thus every man is a miſerable, reſtleſſe creature by nature, wretched if he
doth not ſinne, and wretched much more if he doth ſinne; what miſery it is

they are called ſo, becauſe upon the ſtinging of a man, he hath immediately
ſuch an inflammation and heat upon him, that he doth thirſt inordinately, and
yet if he do drink, he dieth irrecoverably; ſo that a man then bitten was in a
miſerable condition; for if he did not drink the heat within him did burn him
up, and if he did drink, he was ſure to die; Original ſinne is like this fiery
Serpent, it hath poiſoned mankind with its ſting, ſo that a man hath an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
thirſt to ſinne; if he do not ſinne, he finds no reſt, no comfort; if he
do ſinne, he damneth himſelf, and there is no way to cure this, till ſpiritual
thirſt put out this natural thirſt, till our hearts be carried out with delight and
complacency in heavenly things, then this ſinfull tormenting drought that is
upon the ſoul, will quickly be abated; As the diſeaſe called <hi>Bulimy,</hi> or Dogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunger

impetuous propenſity unto evil, till it be accompliſhed; It is like the wolf in

ſweetneſſe and delight that is in ſinning;</hi> For although water, as ſuch hath no
ſavourneſſe, and therefore is not like wine or beer, yet becauſe it is cooling,
it doth with much delight refreſh and refrigerate the hot thirſty appetite within:
Hence <hi>Solomen</hi> expreſſeth deſirable news by this ſimilitude, <hi>As cold waters to a
thirſty ſoul, ſo is good news from a farre Countrey,</hi> Prov. 25. 25. So that by this
expreſſion is denoted, the great delight and content that naturally is found in
any evil way, when a man is ſinning it is as he would have it: This is ſutable
and agreeable with that corrupt inclination that is within; <hi>David</hi> cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
greater joy, and delight in the Law of God, and in fulfilling of his will,
then they do in obeying the luſts of the fleſh, and this is that which maketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
ſo difficult; This is that which doth ſo ſtrongly hold men in their ſinful
wayes; Neither the words of God or the works of God are able to ſeparate
a man and his ſinnes, till God put forth his conquering, and all ſubduing grace,
becauſe ſinne is thus ſweet to a man; <hi>Zophar</hi> the <hi>Naamathite,</hi> doth excellently
inform us, how ſweet ſinne is to an evil man, and how much he delighte in
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57719:239"/>
the ſweetneſſe of it, <hi>Job 20. 12, 13. Though wickedneſſe be ſweet in his mouth,
though he hide it under his tongue, though he ſpirit, and for ſake not, but keep it

                              </gap>outh,</hi> &amp;c. By this we ſee, that ſine to a natural man, is like
ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> the mouth, which we roll up and down, being unwilling to
ſwallow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that ſo we may the longer enjoy the ſweetneſſe thereof. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it would be an high degree of blaſphemy to ſay, God made man with
ſuch a corrupt inclination at firſt, that ſinne ſhould be ſo connatural and ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him: It was therefore by <hi>Adam</hi>'s apoſtaſie, when we loſt the Image of
God; then no wonder if every part and power of the ſoul were carried out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately
and violently to what is evil. By this alſo we ſee, that a neceſſity in
ſinning, and a delight and voluntarineſs in ſinning may very well conſiſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
one doth not deſtroy another: A corrupt man like a corrupt tree, cannot
but bring forth corrupt fruit, yet all this is done with inward delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
as he cannot, ſo he will not do otherwiſe: This is much to be obſerved,
becauſe many do tragically exclaim againſt this Doctrine of original ſinne, as
that whereby we are neceſſitated and captivated unto evil, not at all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
that this is a delightſome captivity, a pleaſant neceſſity, inſomuch that
when converting grace doth make a change upon a man, it doth not only ſubdue
the power of ſinne, but taketh away the ſweetneſs of it, putting a contrary
delight and ſweetneſs in the ſoul: Now they delight in God, in holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
now their ſouls break with longing after thoſe heavenly object, which
once they did ſo much abhorre; That which was honey to them is now
gall; The very thoughts of their former luſts are bitter, and full of
wormwood to them. Thus <hi>David</hi> being made heavenly, profeſſeth
often, <hi>His ſoul thirſteth after God,</hi> Pſalm 46. 2. Pſalm 63. 1. Pſalm
143. 6</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, This expreſſion of <hi>drinking iniquity like water, doth ſuppoſe, as
the delight, ſo the eaſineſſe and facility thereof. Pineda</hi> obſerveth he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it not to eating of pleaſant meet, though that be ſweet, becauſe there is
ſome labour in the chewing of it, but that is too argute onely the eaſineſſe
and facility in ſinning may be declared herein; and truly if we apply it to the
manner of a natural mans ſinning, it will be very well accommodated; For
doth a man by nature find any difficulty in ſinning? Doth he find checks and
gripes within him? Doth he find it an hard thing to obey the loſts of ſinne,
yea they ſwallow down a Camel as eaſily as water? It is true, when a natural
mans conſcience is awakened and enlightned, when under conviction by Gods
Word, then fear and guilt poſſeſſeth his ſoul, then he ſinneth indeed, but
horrible pangs and throbs of conſcience do many times accompany their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
they bring forth in ſorrow and pain; but we are now ſpeaking of a
natural man meerly as ſo, left in that eſtate he was born in, and ſuch a man fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the luſts of his ſoul without any pain or trouble at all; There are no
conflict and combats within, crying out, How can I do this and ſinne againſt
God? Do we not ſee this peaceable ſecure diſpoſition upon moſt men?
Though they have the Word of God to awaken their conſcience, and ſo
throughly to convince them, that you would think they ſhould be as much
afraid of ſinne, as of hell it ſelf. But as the Rule is, <hi>Elementa non gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in ſuo loca,</hi> the elements are not heavy in their proper place; So a
man in ſinning being in his proper way findeth no moleſtation, no grief
at all, but ſuch are to be more pitied, by how much they cannot pity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, This ſimilitude doth inform us <hi>of the frequency and plenty alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinning.</hi>
It is not one vain thought, one evil action that will ſatisfie this corrupt
principle within, but it emptieth it ſelf into abundance; <hi>To drink iniquity like
water,</hi> denoteth, <hi>abundance and plenty,</hi> be doth not ſip of it, or taſt of it, as
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:57719:239"/>
ſome are ſaid <hi>to taſt of the good Word of God,</hi> Heb. 6. or as <hi>Jonathan</hi> taſted

                           </hi> 15. hath
two daughters crying, <hi>Give, give which are never ſatiſfied,</hi> theſe are <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis</hi>
and <hi>concupiſcentia,</hi> Ignorance and Concupiſcence; Ignorance, by that
we know not God the true and chiefeſt good, but every creature, yea every luſt
is repreſented as good and lovely; as in the dark night a white rotten poſt, or
a glow-worm will ſhine and appear ſomething: It is the not knowing of God,
as revealed in the Scripture, which maketh us ſet up ſo many Idols in our hearts.
The other daughter is <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> and this may be called <hi>Sheol,</hi> becauſe it is
alwayes asking and craving, inſomuch that a man is inſatibly carried out all his
life long to one ſinne or other, he ſtill cryeth <hi>Give, give;</hi> Now what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creature is man, that is thus greedy of that which is deſtructive of him? If
you ſhould hear a man calling importunately for poiſon, he will eat nothing but
poiſon, Is not ſuch an one deſperate ſet to ruine himſelf? Thus is with every
natural man, he can never ſinne enough, as if he thought he could never damn
himſelf enough; How happy are the creatures comparatively herein to man?
Their appetites are moderated, and they deſire nothing that is hurtfull, but man
never ſtayeth himſelf in his luſts, and withall he is wholly carried out to ſuch
things as will inevitably damn him.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>A thirſty man drinking down water, doth it to refreſh himſelf, never
attending whether it be wholſom or deſtructive to him.</hi> How many have got their
mortal bane by drinking to quench their raging heat within? The Hydropical
man will call for his drink, though thereby he is ruined, and this doth fitly
reſemble that curſed appetite in us to ſinne, though it damnus: We look onely
to the bait, not to the hook, to the pleaſures of ſinne, the ſweetneſs of ſinne,
not at all conſidering what buterneſs thus will bring at the later end: Is not this
the miſerable eſtate of man by nature? Doth he look any further then to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
this corrupt thirſt within him? Doth he think, will thus be for my good,
will this be in ſtead of God and Heaven to me? Hence alſo it is, that he is
carried out to ſinne from a voluntary principle within; Even as a thirſtly man
needeth not to be hired or compelled to drink, he hath that within him which
will inſtigate him: Thus it is in every man by nature, though there ſhould be
no Devil to tempt him, yet that corrupt frame within would provoke him to
all evil. It is from this, that though hell and damnation be threatned, though
this ſword of Gods anger hang over his head, yet he will drink of this
water.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, There is denoted in this ſimilitude, <hi>That a man by committing of
ſinne, is thereby inclined to ſinne the more.</hi> It doth not ſatisfie, but increaſe the
luſt more; As a man in diſtempered heat doth not allay it by drinking, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtameth
it the more; as a little water thrown on the fire intendeth the heat
thereof: Thus by drinking in of the water of ſinne, a man becomes more
thirſtly after it, and ſo to his corrupt inclination there is added alſo a corrupt
cuſtom, and theſe two cords are not eaſily broken, it muſt be the grace of
God alone, that can ſet us at liberty; Hence we have that expreſſion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſtubborn, obſtinate man in his way of ſinning, <hi>Deut. 29. 19. That he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
drunkenneſſe to thirſt;</hi> And ſo again, <hi>Thirſt to drunkenneſſe;</hi> thus he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in vehement motions after ſinne, and the more he ſwalloweth it down,
and is inebriated with it, the thirſtier ſtill he groweth, according to that known
Rule,

doth ſufficiently atteſt the general pollution of all men by their evil doings.</hi> Not to
bring in that fore-mentioned place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 2, 3. where God is ſaid to look
from <hi>Heaven upon the children of men,</hi> and he could not <hi>behold one that did
good, no not one.</hi> It was not upon <hi>Judea</hi> only, but upon the children of men,
and he could not find one good. We may take in many other places to confirm
this, How quickly had all mankind corrupted it ſelf? as appeareth, <hi>Gen. 6. 12.
God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his way before God.</hi> Here we ſee, not long after the Creation, how all the
world was quickly become abominable in his eyes; <hi>All fleſh had corrupted his
way every man had defiled himſelf;</hi> Yea ſo great it was, that <hi>verſ. 5. Every
imagination of man, was only evil, and that continually.</hi> Now whence ſhould
all this evil ariſe? Muſt not the fountain needs be bitter, from which ſo many
bitter ſtreams flow? Could ſo many thorns grow from men if they were grapes?
If ſo be there were the ſeeds of virtue in men by nature (as they ſay) or at
leaſt man is by nature indifferent either to good or evil, yea more inclining to
good; How cometh it about that alwayes evil ſhould prevail? How is it that
good doth not ſometimes take place? Why is there not an age to be recorded,
wherein we may ſay, all fleſh had made their wayes holy, and <hi>that every ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the thoughts of mans heart was onely good continually?</hi> Why ſhould
not there be ſome ages, wherein God might look from Heaven, and ſee none
that did evil, no not one? The pure Naturaliſts are never able to anſwer this
ſatisfactorily; for if man be by nature as well without vice or virtue, ready and
capable to receive either, as his will ſhall carry him; Why is it, that this will of
man doth never prevail univerſally in ſome age, to make all good? Why
ſhould ſinne alwayes get the upper hand, and ſupplant virtue (as it were) ſo as
to come out firſt? Neither can that be a refuge in this Text, which ſometimes

but tares ſhould come up every where in ſtead thereof. But let us take notice
of another place of Scripture confirming the univerſal overſlowing of iniquity,
and that is <hi>David</hi>'s complaint, which he ſo ſadly poureth forth, calling upon
God to help and to redreſs it, <hi>Pſal. 12. 1. Help Lord, for the godlyman ceaſeth,
the faithfull fail from among the children of man; They ſpeak vanity every one
with his neighbour;</hi> It is true, here are ſome ſuppoſed to be godly and faithfull,
but they are few comparatively to the ungodly, as flowers to the weeds, as
jewels to the ſand on the ſeaſhore, and thoſe that were ſo, it was not from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but the grace of God that ſanctified and prepared them: But if you do
regard the general, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is ſo affectionately moved with the overflowing
of evil, that he ſeeth no help but in God himſelf, and this is the more to be
aggravated, becauſe the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were the Church of God, they had
the Prophets of God, they had Gods wonderfull preſence amongſt them, and
yet for all that, this garden ſo planted and dreſſed by God, did become a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
If then where there are many external and powerfull means to ſubdue
and conquer that innate corruption, yet it break out ſo violently; What if man
were left to himſelf? How abominable and vile would he prove? And was not
this the perpetual complaint of all the Prophets ſucceſſively, that every one
did <hi>turn aſide to their evil wayes, that they did preach in vain. that there was no
ſoundneſſe amongst them; a ſinfull Nation, a ſeed of evil-doers;</hi> The more they
were ſtricken, the more they revolted; <hi>The whole head was ſick, and the whole
heart faint, as Iſaiah</hi> moſt affectionately bewalleth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 4, 5. What a
ſtrong demonſtration then is this of the imbred corruption of mankind, that
under all the means of grace doth yet overflow in impicties? I ſhall not mention
any more Texts for this purpoſe; The whole ſcope of the Scripture being to
declare mans ſinfulneſs, and extoll Gods grace.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>This univerſal propenſity to ſinne in all mankind, is likewiſe atteſted
unto, even by the very Heathens.</hi> It's true, they knew nothing of <hi>Adams</hi> tall,
nor of the propagation of this hereditary pollution, yet the ſinfulneſs it ſelf
they perceived and groaned under it. Even <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, who would elude
the pregnant Texts of Scripture for original ſinne, by the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> trope of
<hi>Hyperbole,</hi> yet doth bring in many paſſages out of the Heathens, acknowledging

be ſuch jealouſies, ſuch fears of man, <hi>Homo homini lupus?</hi> Why are there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
ſuch ſevere puniſhments to awe wicked men, but that mans nature is out
of credit, it is ſuppoſed to do all the evil it can, if it have any impunity? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is not for good that Maſtives are tied up, that Bears and Lions are kept
up in grates; This argueth how cruel they would be if let looſe; Thus alſo it is
with mankind all the ſevere Laws and puniſhments which are in all eſtates
eſtabliſhed, do demonſtrate how wild and outragious man is, if left alone to
himſelf; In his younger yeares he hath the rod, when growne up, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and gallows, and in his old age, death and hell to awe him againſt
ſinne.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>The neceſſary of Education and Chaſtiſement to young children,
doth alſo declare, that they are prone to vice.</hi> It cannot be denied, but ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>Adam</hi> had continued in integrity and procreated children, they would
have needed inſtruction and information, but then withall it muſt be granted,
that this was a meer innocent neſciency in them, and therefore as the body had
been prepared, ſo the ſoul without any difficulty would with all aptneſſe and
readineſſe have received all the good ſeed ſown into it, whereas now in young
ones there is a difficulty to underſtand holy things, they are unteachable and
untractable, yea there is alſo a contrariety and an averſneſſe to that which is
good. Now if they were in a meer purity of nature, as the Adverſaries ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
it, they were in ſuch an equal indifferency and capacity of virtue or vice;
Why ſhould not they need education and Maſters to teach them evil, as well as
good? Yea, why ſhould they not be more ready to good then evil, ſeeing they
ſay there are <hi>igniculi virtutum,</hi> ſparks of virtue lying hid in the ſoul, which by
education and inſtruction are blown up into a flame? So that the Schools which
are generally provided for youth, do declare, That the nature of man of it
ſelf, will bring forth weeds, but there muſt be much plowing and ſowing, much
coſt and labour ere any good ſeed will grow up. That known Text of Scripture
will for ever bear record againſt theſe patrons of nature, <hi>Folly is bound up in the
heart of a child, but the rod of correction will drive it away,</hi> Prov. 22. 15. No
leſſe powerfull is that counſel, <hi>Prov. 23. 13. With-hold not correction from the
child, if thou beat him with the rod, he ſhall not die; if thou beat him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou
ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell.</hi> Doth not this proclaim, that every child is ſet to
damn it ſelf, if left alone? It is not more prone to runne into the fire, then it
is to fall into hell, and this maketh chaſtiſement ſo neceſſary. How neceſſary is
it for parents to conſider this, either education or hell, either chaſtiſement or
damnation? And whence is all this, but becauſe of the impetuous nature in
every child unto evil? As the horſe and mule need the bridle, being carried out
only by ſenſe; Thus doth the child need admonition, being unteachable and
untamable of himſelf, even like the <hi>wild Aſſes colt,</hi> Job 11. 12. Let parents
then take heed of remiſneſs, leſt their children roaring in hell do continually
curſe them for their negligence. It's a known example of a young man carried
to the place of execution, that cried out, <hi>Non Praetor, ſed Mater, mea duxit
ad furcam;</hi> It was not the Judge, but his mother brought him to that ſhamefull
death. There was in the Tabernacle <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, and the Manna, which
ſome would have allegorically to ſignifie the ſweetneſs and benefit of Diſcipline,
Iniquity then breedeth within us, all the wiſeſt and ſevereſt education can no
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57719:241"/>
more free a child from its inherent filthineſs, then <hi>Paracelſus</hi> could make himſelf
immortal, as he fondly boaſted, if he had had the firſt ordering and dieting of
his body. Hence the duty of parents is ſet down, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 4. To bring up their
children in the nature and admonition of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was ſo
tender, <hi>and onely beloved in the ſight of his mother,</hi> yet his parents were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
diſtilling wholſome precepts into him, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, implying
thereby, that none is without ignorance, without a proneneſs to evil; therefore
is godly inſtruction ſo neceſſary. So that the Doctrine of original ſinne ſhould
greatly provoke fathers and mothers to their duties; Every mother ſhould
be a <hi>Monica</hi> to her <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that we may ſay, It is not poſſible, that
<hi>Filius tot lachrymarum pereat,</hi> a ſonne of ſo many prayers and tears ſhould
periſh.</p>
                        <p>Fifthy, <hi>The difficulty that is acknowledged by ali, to do that which is good
and holy, doth alſo manifeſt our propenſity to what is evil.</hi> We cannot apply
the Text to that which is good, and ſay, <hi>Man drinketh down that like water.</hi>
The very Heathens could ſay, <hi>Facilis diſcenſus averni,</hi> and <hi>Virtus in arduo ſita
eſt.</hi> Virtue was placed upon an high mountain, it was hard climbing up unto it,
but it was eaſie to tumble down; it is eaſie to fall down the hill. Sinne then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo eaſily committed, and that which is good ſo hardly performed, Doth
not this ſpeak plainly, that we are corrupted by nature? For certainly, if the
word of God, neither in the threatnings or in the promiſes of it, can make us
decline from evil, and do good, when neither hell can terrifie us, nor the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
joyes of Heaven invite us; This argueth we are immovably fixed in a
way of ſinning. Is there any command for holy duties? Is there any Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
us to leave our luſts, of which we do not ſay, <hi>It is an hard ſaying, who
can bear it?</hi> Hence it is that the wiſdome of the fleſh is ſaid to be enmity in the
very abſtract againſt God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, whatſoever is either in mind
or affections, is wholly oppoſite to the pure Law of God. So that this is an
evident demonſtration of mans vehement inclination to ſinne, that though God
hath ſet ſo many fiery flaming ſwords in the way to ſtop us from ſinne; Though
Heaven in the glory of it be on one ſide diſcovered, and hell in all the horrible
and dreadfull torments of it on the other ſide; Though many Miniſters of God
meet thee at the Angel did <hi>Balaam,</hi> to ſtop thee in the way to ſinne; yet for all
this thou doeſt deſpirately and obſtinately proceed. This maketh it appear, that
there is a more flagrant appetite to ſinne, then to any thing elſe: like <hi>Rachel,</hi>
crying, <hi>Give me children, elſe I die:</hi> ſo let me have my luſts ſatisfied, elſe no life,
no condition is comfortable.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>The neceſſity of Gods grace both for the beginnings, progreſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
in every good work, doth evidently prove our polluted nature.</hi> We
need grace to make us new creatures, of ſpiritually dead to quicken us and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven
us; we need grace to breath in the very firſt deſires, and groans after any
thing that is good. Now why is there ſuch a neceſſity of a Phyſician? if we be
not ſick, Chriſt is in vain, grace is in vain: if original ſinne with the effects
thereof be denied. And therefore <hi>Auſtia</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pelagians</hi> were but <hi>nomine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Chriſtiani,</hi> Chriſtians only in name: for they do in effect exclude Chriſt,
and evacuate grace. Indeed the pure Naturaliſt (<hi>Vnam Neceſſarium, Chap 6.
pag.</hi> 413.) affirmeth, <q>That the neceſſity of grace doth not ſuppoſe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be originally corrupted, for beyond <hi>Adam</hi>'s meer nature, ſomething
elſe was neceſſary: and ſo it is in us.</q> This Poſition is bottomed upon that
falſe and abſurd Doctrine invented at firſt by ſome Philoſophers, brought into
the Church by <hi>Pelagions,</hi> much inſiſted upon by Papiſts; That there is a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſtate, a ſtate of pure nature between ſinne and grace; That <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in ſuch a condition, God ſuperadding the glorious ornaments of grace,
which upon his fall, he was deprived of, and ſo fell into his ſtate of pure nature
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57719:242"/>
again, and in this middle eſtate, every Infant is now born; a ſtate indeed (they
ſay) of imperfection, but not of ſinne; we need grace to carry us to thoſe

<hi>Moſes</hi> face did remain with its naturals, though it had not the ſuper-added lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre:
Thus (ſay they) man is in his ſtate of nature not ſinfull, neither godly.
But this is a monſtrous figment; and he that ſaith, Thoſe who diſpute of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne, do diſpute, <hi>De non ente;</hi> How much rather may we ſay, that all
thoſe voluminous diſputations of this ſtate of pure nature is wholly <hi>De non ente,</hi>
there being not the leaſt title in Scripture to eſtabliſh any ſuch opinion upon
it? It is true, the <hi>Author</hi> mentioned is often affirming and dictating Magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
concerning ſuch an eſtate, but never yet hath any Scripture-proof been
brought for it; ſome philoſophical arguments happily may be. Now being this
is the foundation, upon which many of the Adverſaries to original ſinne do
build, I ſhall in its time and order (God aſſiſting) raze up this foundation,
and lay the Axe againſt the root of the Tree, proving that it is both againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
and ſolid reaſon.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, That there is ſuch an inclination naturally in a man to ſinne,
and repugnant to what is good, a mans own experience may teach him;
were there no Bible, no Orthodox Teachers, a mans own heart may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of ſuch a perverſneſſe within him, though by natural light he could
never diſcover the ſpring of it. Doth not <hi>Paul,</hi> even while regenerated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of this Law of ſinne within him? <hi>Rom. 7. Nazianzen</hi> maketh ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining

The conflict with the fleſh and ſpirit, which in a moſt excellent and affectionate

find not ſuch a proneneſſe in them, it is becauſe they are blinded,
they are benummed within, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old bragged, That a man might

others of the like nature, do evidently proclaim it to be that corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:57719:242"/>
come to the particular cauſes ſpecified by them, let us in the general conſider,
<hi>How many wayes this propenſity in mankind may be imagined to proceed,</hi> for ſome
gave one head or ſpring to it; Others, another; ſo that there is not more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
in Philoſophy about the cauſe of the ebbing and flowing of the ſea, or
about the riſe and ſpring of <hi>Nilus</hi> that famous river in <hi>Egypt,</hi> then there is

                        <p>In the firſt place therefore, <hi>Some do aſſign this inclination to ſinne, to the ſouls

                        <p>A ſecond opinion of the <hi>Manichees, who feigned two principles of good and
evil, and this evil principle they made the cauſe of man, whereupon they condemned
marriage as unlawfull, and made man to be</hi> opus Diaboli, <hi>the work of the Devil.</hi>
This <hi>Manicheiſm</hi> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> have alwayes endeavoured to faſten upon ſuch
as do affirme original ſinne, but it is done maliciouſly and ignorantly; for we
ſay, this evil came not into man at firſt by nature, but by the free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
conſent of <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſince man is fallen, we <hi>do not ſay,</hi> ſinne <hi>is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or his <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> but that it is <hi>a vitious quality adhering thereunto,</hi> as lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
to the body.</p>
                        <p>3. There are others, who may be reduced to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and they were <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques</hi>
called <hi>Materiaris, who feigned an eternall matter, that was ſo evil, that
the wiſdome and power of God could not ſubdue it, but that this malignancy did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to it, whether God will or no.</hi> And this they make the cauſe of that vicious
inclination in man: It is (ſay they) from the evil matter man is made off,
which is inſeperable from it; but this doth groſly contradict the Hiſtory of the
Creation, as recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Wherein it is ſaid, <hi>God made every thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
good,</hi> Gen. 1. 31.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Pelagian,</hi> many <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the late Socinian Writers, all
theſe attribute it to mans Creation and conſtitution at firſt, at leaſt in part: for they
tell us of a ſtate of pure naturals, that man hath, whereby the appetite doth rebell
againſt the mind, for man confiſting of a ſoul and a body; hereby (ſay they) do
neceſſarily ariſe contrary inclinations; The ſoul enclineth one way, and the body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
way; and this conflict they are not afraid to ſay was in <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf,
and therefore God gave him grace as a ſupernatural and ſuperadded ornament,
yea and as a remedy to keep the inferior appetite in its order: now man being
fallen, he hath loſt thoſe ſuperadditionals, but continueth in his meer naturals,
and theſe being weak and imperfect are eaſily carried out to ſinne, wanting the
grace of God to elevate them. This is the myſtery of their iniquity. This is
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:57719:243"/>
the fountain of all their poiſonous impieties, and therefore (God aſſiſting) is
to be confuted moſt properly, when we come to ſpeak <hi>of that immediate effect
of original ſinne,</hi> which is to make a conflict and rebellion in man between the
mind and ſenſitive appetite in natural men, and between the fleſh and ſpirit in
regenerate men.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>That which the Orthodox, following the light of the Scripture aſſign as a
cauſe of that deluge of impiety amongſt mankind, is the original depravation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans nature through</hi> Adam<hi>'s tranſgreſſion.</hi> From this unclean principle none
can bring forth that which is clean; and truly the Scripture is ſo evident, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes to this head, making the luſt within a man, a cauſe of all impiety
flowing from us, that they ſeem to deny the Sunne at noon-day, who will not
acknowledge this.</p>
                        <p>But let us in the next place examine, <hi>What cauſes ef this univerſall propenſity
in mankind, to ſinne, are given by the late Heterodox Writer; for the weight of this
Objection preſſeth him,</hi> and therefore he doth induſtriouſly ſet himſelf to anſwer
it. (<hi>Vnum Neceſſar. Chap. 6. Sect.</hi> 4. It is certain (ſaith he) that there are
many common principles, from which ſinne deriveth it ſelf into the manners
of all men.</p>
                        <p>The firſt mentioned is, <q>
                              <hi>That at firſt God made no promiſes of heaven,</hi> he had
propounded not glorious rewards, to be as an Argument to ſupport the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
faculty againſt the inferiour, becauſe there was no ſuch thing in that
period of the world: therefore almoſt all fleſh had corrupted themſelves:
for want of this <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and all the world followed his example, and moſt
upon this account; till it pleaſed God, after he had tryed the world with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
promiſes, and found them alſo inſufficient to finiſh the work of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs,
and to cauſe us to be born anew by the revelations and promiſes of
Jeſus Chriſt.</q> Thus he; but I had almoſt ſaid,
<q>Oh monſtrum horrendum, cui lumen ademptum!</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Socinian</hi> appeareth in his own ugly and deformed colours, let us ſee
whether there be any validity in this reaſon or no. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It is very frivolous, ridiculous and abſurd; for we are asking for a
reaſon of <hi>the general inclination of all men in all ages to evil,</hi> and he would aſſign
<hi>one for that ſpeciall age</hi> of the world before Chriſt. Is it not ſtill true, even ſince
Chriſts coming, that the heart of a man is deſperately and incurably ſet upon
evil, till the grace of God doth ſanctifie it? So that though in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the glory of heaven, and the torments of hell, are evidently and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
demonſtrated, yet ſtill there is the ſame torrent of impiety in the manners
of men.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This reaſon cannot be acquitted from <hi>blasphemy</hi> (in ſome ſenſe)
againſt God, for the cauſe of overflowing impiety in the Old Teſtament times,
is reduced <hi>hereby to God himſelf.</hi> May not all the prophane ones in that age of
the world take up this mans Argument to defend themſelves? O Lord it is from
thee we are thus univerſally wicked! Had the joyes of heaven been promiſed
to us in wel-doing: had the torments of hell been manifeſted unto us; we had then
been awakened; ſo that we are now wicked, becauſe we wanted ſuch efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meanes to prevent our impiety, that afterwards were vouchſafed to the
world; ſo that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might have replyed to the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap.
13. 9. that he ſpake falſly: their deſtruction is not of themſelves, but of God,
who did not give them ſufficient incouragements. Had the Aſſerters of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne affirmed any ſuch thing, that might ſo hainouſly have redounded to
the diſhonour of Gods juſtice, his mercy and goodneſs, what tragical exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would have been raiſed up immediately? But thus it falleth out alwayes,
that thoſe who out of a prepoſterous fear ſometimes to hold ſuch things, that
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:57719:243"/>
have but an apparent tendency to diſhonour God, do fall into ſuch abominable
poſitions, that do really reproach God, and his wayes, as may more be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this point.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The <hi>very inward</hi> part of this reaſon: is <hi>very wickedneſs and falſhood
it ſelf,</hi> for this Propoſition, <hi>That heaven and hell were not uſed as Arguments
in the Old Teſtament, but that temporall mercies and jugements were the only
spurres and curbes in their converſation, is being reſerved as the peculiar and proper
glory of Chriſt, to reveal the promiſes of eternal life,</hi> is that notorious pure impure
<hi>Socinianiſns</hi> which our learned Writers do ſo evidently profligate. <q>This ſaith
<hi>Smalcius (De Div Jeſ. Chriſti c.</hi> 7.) is ſo clear a truth, that they want no little
thing to the true knowledge of Chriſt and his Office, who are ignorant of it, or
doubt of it; yea he addeth <hi>Vnde appareat,</hi> &amp;c. from whence it may appear,
that our Congregations, though they are ſaid to blaſpheme Chriſt, yet do more
rightly acknowledge Chriſt in this particular, <hi>Quam omnes alios Chriſtiani
nominis profeſſores,</hi>
                           </q> then all other profeſſors of Chriſts name. Thus they
tryumph in this enormious error, as their greateſt glory, becauſe they make
it peculiar to Chriſt to reveal and promiſe eternal glory. It is not my intent to
enlarge on this point, <hi>That eternal life was promiſed to</hi> Adam, <hi>as alſo to thoſe
who lived in the Old Teſtamentary dispenſation.</hi> That the tree of life, was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
ſymbole of eternal life, appeareth by that expreſſion, <hi>Rev</hi> 2. 7. And
certainly if the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not diſcover the reſurrection of the dead, and eternal
life, it was becauſe they did not <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, as our Saviour telleth them,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 29, 30. and that is remarkable which is ſaid, <hi>Joh. 5. 39. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

ſpoken, as if it were a falſe perſwaſion to look for eternal life out of thoſe
Scriptures, but becauſe they boaſted in their own interpretation of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
Chriſt thereby: It is therefore a deteſtable poſition which <hi>Smalcius</hi> in
the ſame place hath, <q>That the promiſe of eternal life was wholly hidden from
men for thoſe ages which were before Chriſt, neither did it clearly appear
to any one that ſuch a thing would be beſtowed upon mortal men;</q> for doth
not <hi>Job</hi> proclaim the clean contrary, <hi>Job. 19. 25. I know that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,—
he ſhall ſtand at the later day upon the earth,</hi> &amp;. It is true, the learned
<hi>Mercer</hi> would apply this to that temporal and bleſſed reſtitution of his external
happineſs, which God vouchſafed to him, but the Context doth neceſſitate us
to underſtand it of a more glorious condition. We read alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 14,
15. That the Patriarchs acknowledged themſelves <hi>pilgrims in this earth,</hi> and did
declare plainly, <hi>they ſought an heavenly country.</hi> It is not worth the while to
examine the ſuggeſtions of <hi>Schlitingius</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> on thoſe Texts, who would
ſo miſerably wreſt them to his own purpoſe, and that the day of judgement was
uſed as an Argument to bridle men from ſinne, appeareth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. 9. as alſo
<hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 14. The Book concludeth with this, as a truth to ſtick in our mind
alwayes, <hi>That God will bring every work unto judgement,</hi> and thus much for his
firſt reaſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>His ſecond reaſon is no leſs nocent,</hi> The cauſe of iniquity is not, becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is originally corrupted, but becauſe Gods Lawes command ſuch things, which
are a reſtraint to the indifferent, and otherwiſe lawfull inclinations of nature (<hi>Idem
ibidem pag.</hi> 415) ſo that our unwillingneſs and averſeneſs cometh by occaſion of the
law coming croſs upon our nature, not becauſe our nature is contrary to God, but
becauſe God was pleaſed to ſuperinduce ſome Commandments contrary to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if God had commanded as to eat the beſt meats, and drink the richeſt wines,
as long as they could pleaſe us, I ſuppoſe original ſinne would not be thought to have
hindered us from obedience. <hi>Thus he in a moſt prophane and unſavoury manner.
For</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, Here again God is made the occaſion of all the univerſal impiety in
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:57719:244"/>
mankind: man may plead, my nature is good, my inclinations are lawfull, but
God hath ſuperinduced auſtere commands, he maketh thoſe things ſinnes,
which would not have been ſinnes; <hi>Thus this man doth directly teach the world
to lay all their wickedneſs upon God,</hi> he is an hard maſter, he is too ſevere, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>our natures would do well enough.</hi> But</p>
                        <p>Secondly, He betrayeth much ignorance, or concealeth his knowledge,
that he will not diſtinguiſh between <hi>moral precepts,</hi> and <hi>meer poſitive ones;</hi> or as
<hi>Whitaker</hi> out of <hi>Hugo, Pracepta Naturae,</hi> and <hi>Praecepta Diſciplinae (De pecato
orig. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 14.) commands of <hi>Natural Duties,</hi> and prohibitions of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
evils;</hi> or ſuch as are <hi>meerly Poſitive,</hi> and for <hi>Diſcipline-ſake.</hi> Some
things we grant are indeed <hi>meerly evil,</hi> becauſe <hi>prohibited;</hi> ſome things are <hi>evil,</hi>
and therefore <hi>prohibited.</hi> Although this muſt be remembred, <hi>That a man doth never
break a poſitive command, but thereby alſo he doth a moral command likewiſe.</hi>
Now let this Patron of Nature anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>Why is there in man-kind
ſuch inclinations to thoſe ſins, that are morally and intrinſically evil?</hi> Is he
of that opinion, that nothing is good or evil internally? But as <hi>Mayro</hi> the
Schoolman ſaith, <hi>God might have made a Law, that whoſoever ſhould praiſe him
ſhould be damned, and whoſoever ſhould diſhonour him, ſhould be ſaved.</hi> On mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
Divinity, that maketh virtue and vice nothing in it ſelf! If God had
pleaſed, vices might have been virtues, and virtues vices; It is from God that
maketh ſuch things to be ſins, that otherwiſe would be lawfull. This ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
with <hi>Diagoras</hi> the Atheiſt, firſt called <gap reason="foreign">

for none of ſuch things, were in their nature filthy, if you take away popular
opinions. But I will not charge this opinion on the Author, only he ſhould not
have ſpoken ſo confuſedly. If this be true, it is not a vain wiſh with him, who
addicted to a ſinne, cryed out, <hi>Vtinam hoc non eſſet peccare!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Even thoſe inclinations that are in men to lawfull things, are vitiated
and corrupted. No man deſireth to eat, to drink; no man deſireth health, or
wealth naturally, as he ought to do: I doubt this Author, as all the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
formerly, do not attend to the exactneſſe of a good work. They forget
<hi>Auſtin</hi>'s old Rule grounded upon Scripture, <hi>That duties are to be eſteemed
not by the acts, but by their ends.</hi> Is there any man eateth or drinketh, or
inclineth to do theſe things for the glory of God? as we are commanded,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 31.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>He runneth to evil examples, the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion</hi> (as
if that moved thoſe to ſinne, who happily never heard of him) <hi>errour, falſe
principles,</hi> &amp;c. And from the enumeration of many particulars, applieth that
of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 14. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> which
Text might juſtly have affrighted him, in what he delivereth; for there <hi>Job</hi>
ſpeaks of one in his very firſt birth, and as is added, <hi>Ne infans unius diei,</hi> not
an Infant a day old is free from this uncleanneſſe. What can evil examples and
wicked cuſtoms do to pollute a child new born? It is true, the <hi>Socinians</hi> grant,
<q>That where parents are habituated in evil cuſtoms, the children may derive
from them an inclination alſo unto ſinne.</q> But if ſo, then this very thing will
puzzle them as much as they endeavour to perplex the Orthodox, with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about the tranſmiſſion of original ſinne: For, <hi>How do Parents accuſtomed
to ſinne convey this evil dispoſition? either by the ſoul, or by the body.</hi> And
what they would anſwer themſelves in ſuch an aſſerted propagation, the ſame we
may for all mankind in general. But</p>
                        <p>2. This is no ſufficient anſwer, for ſtill the Queſtion is not ſatisfied; <q>Men
(ſay they) are thus inclinded to evil, becauſe of <hi>wicked cuſtoms</hi> and examples;</q>
But how came theſe cuſtoms? <hi>Cain</hi> had no example before him of <hi>murder,</hi> yet
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:57719:244"/>
he committeth it. Theſe evill examples then, and wicked cuſtoms, ſeeing they
muſt have an original to come from it, cannot be any thing elſe but the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nature of mankind. And certainly the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth attribute all evil
committed to that luſt which is within a man, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14. So that if there were
no other occaſion or temptation, this is enough to ſet the whole courſe of the
ſoul on fire; And this is the next particular to be conſidered, which I ſhall
handle as a ſecond Immediate Effect of original ſinne.</p>

under conſideration, is, <hi>The Cauſality that it hath in reſpect
of all other ſins.</hi> This is the dunghill in which the whole ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
brood of all actual ſinnes is conveived, and brought
forth: Inſomuch that when you ſee all the abominable impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that fill the whole world with irreligion to God and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to man: If you ask, whence ariſeth this monſter? How
cometh all this wickedneſs to be committed? The Anſwer is eaſie: from that
original concupiſcence, that hot <hi>Aetna</hi> which is in a man, that never ceaſeth
from ſending forth ſuch continual flames of iniquity. Now this truth will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
be diſcovered from the Text in hand; for it is the Apoſtles ſcope in this
and the adjacent verſes, to take off all men from that wicked way, they are ſo
prone unto (<hi>viz.</hi>) to lay the blame of their iniquities, and to aſcribe the cauſe of
them to any, yea to God, rather than to themſelves; They will rather make
God then themſelves the Author of all that evil they do commit. We have
this from <hi>Adam,</hi> who at the beginning endeavoured to clear himſelf, and to
charge his ſinne upon God, <hi>The woman thou gaveſt me.</hi> And happily ſome even
in the primitive times, by miſ-underſtanding ſome places of Scripture, wherein
God is ſaid to <hi>give men up to their luſts to harden and blind men in their ſinnes,</hi>
                           <pb n="456" facs="tcp:57719:245"/>
might occaſion ſuch a deteſtable Poſition, And although the Papiſts do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
charge this damnable Doctrine upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> yet there needeth no
more to juſtifie <hi>Calvin</hi> in this particular, then what he doth moſt excellently
and ſolidly deliver upon this very Text. The truth is, our learned men ſhew expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from the Papiſts; yea, from <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, more harſh and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
then I believe can be found in any Proteſtant Writer. But this by the way.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle being to inform us of the true cauſe of all the ſinne we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and that not God, no nor Devils, or wicked men are to be blamed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,
but our own ſelves; ſheweth, that all this evil cometh from that
concupiſcential frame of heart we have within us. And as for God, the Apoſtle
expreſly inſtanceth concerning him, prohibiting any one to think or ſay, it is
from God that they do ſinne, <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of
God:</hi> and he giveth two reaſons, whereof one is the cauſe of the other.</p>
                        <p>If you ask, How is it that God is ſaid to tempt no man, ſeeing he tempted
<hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s diſtinction is made uſe of, that there is a temptation <hi>probationis</hi> and
<hi>ſeductionis,</hi> of <hi>probation</hi> or <hi>tryal;</hi> or of <hi>deceiving</hi> and <hi>enticing</hi> to ſin. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
doth often tempt his people, the former way, not but that he knoweth what
is in the heart of every man; but that hereby a godly mans graces may be the
more quickned, as alſo a man have more experimental knowledge of himſelf.
As for the other temptation of <hi>ſeduction;</hi> God doth not thus tempt, that is, he
doth not encline or enrice to ſinne. It is true, we read the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>O Lord, I am deceived, and thou haſt deceived me,</hi> Jer. 20. 7. But that
is ſpoken unadviſedly and raſhly by the Prophet, who thought, becauſe what
he had propheſied, was not as yet fulfilled, and therefore his adverſaries derided
and ſcorned him, that therefore it would not at all be fulfilled, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that God had deceived him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Divines diſtinguiſh temptation into <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
are afflictions and troubles, called often ſo in Scripture, and theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
are from God. 2. <hi>Internal,</hi> which do immediately incline to ſinne,
and with theſe God doth not tempt. Now although the Apoſtle had in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part ſpoken of external temptations, yet now he ſpeaks of internal ones;
though ſome think he continueth his diſcourſe of externals, becauſe theſe many
times draw out hearts to ſinne; but this ariſeth not from God.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon why God cannot tempt to ſinne, is from the infinite perfection
of holineſs, which is in God: he is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>He cannot be tempted by evil.</hi>
It is true, men are ſaid to tempt God many times, and ſo <hi>ex parte hominu,</hi> there
is done what man could do, even to make God deviate from his own holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Law: but the Apoſtle meaneth <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> that God is of ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
purity and tranſcendent holineſs, that there cannot ariſe any motion in his
nature to make him ſinne. For ſo we expound the Greek word in a paſſive ſenſe,
<hi>Eſtius</hi> himſelf granting, that the uſe of it in an active ſignification, can hardly
be found, though Popiſh Interpreters plead for the active ſenſe; but then there
would be no diſtinction of this from the following words, <hi>Neither tempteth he
any man.</hi> The original word is uſed only here in the New Teſtament. The
ſtrength then of the Argument lieth in this, God doth not tempt any man to ſin,
becauſe he hath no inward temptation, or motion in his own nature to ſin: for
that is the reaſon why the Devil is ſo impetuous and forward in tempting us to
ſin, becauſe his nature is firſt carried out to all evil &amp; ſo there is no man that doth
draw on another to ſin, but becauſe he in his own heart, is drawn aſide with it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Apoſtle having thus juſtified God, and removed all cauſe of evil from
him; In my Text he directeth us to the true internal and proper cauſe of all the
ſinne that we do commit; and therein doth moſt excellently ſhew the ſeveral
ſteps and degrees of ſinne, whereby of an <hi>Embryo</hi> (as it were) at firſt,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57719:245"/>
it cometh to be a compleated and perfected ſinne. This Text is much vexed by
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> and Popiſh Authors to eſtabliſh their diſtinction of a <hi>venial</hi> and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
ſinne, though they cannot find any true aid from the Text.</p>
                        <p>Let us conſider the particulars of this noble Text: The Cauſe of a mans
ſinne is ſaid to be <hi>luſt</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, this is the ſame with <hi>original ſinne,</hi> the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the powers of the ſoul, whereby it is inordinately carried out to all
things. Of which more in the Doctrine. This is deſcribed from the note of
<hi>propriety,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>His own luſt;</hi> This expreſſion is uſed that we may not lay all
upon the Devil, or other men, for this is ordinarily brought by men to excuſe
themſelves. It is true, I was in ſuch a fault, I have ſinned, but the Devil
moved me, or ſuch wicked companions they enticed me, or I did it, becauſe
men compelled me, and terrified me: all this will not ſerve thy turn; It is thy
own luſt within, not men without that hath made thee thus to ſinne. And this
ſheweth, That every man hath his own proper original ſinne, by way of a luſt
within him.</p>
                        <p>3. This is further amplified from the <hi>Vniverſality</hi> of the Subject, wherein
this luſt is ſeated, <hi>Every man;</hi> ſo that no man but Chriſt, who was God and
man, is freed from this incentive to evil.</p>
                        <p>4. There is the <hi>Manner How, this luſt doth tempt us to ſinne,</hi> and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in, two words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Drawn away,</hi> that is, as ſome, <hi>from God,</hi>
from <hi>heavenly objects;</hi> becauſe in all ſinne there is an averſion from God, and a
converſion to the creature: or elſe (as others) <hi>Drawn aſide</hi> form the <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of hell,</hi> of the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> of <hi>eternal death and damnation.</hi> For we ſinne
continually, as <hi>Eve</hi> did at firſt; The Devil perſwaded her ſhe ſhould not die,
and then when this fear was removed, ſhe preſently falleth into the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and thus before men fall into the pit of any ſinne, they are drawn aſide
from thoſe ſerious thoughts; This will offend God, this will damn me. The
other word is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a Metaphor either from birds or fiſhes, which have
baits to allure them, and thereby are deſtroyed: Thus luſt appeareth with a
bait, but the hook doth not appear.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, This original ſinne is illuſtrated in the <hi>iſſue of it:</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſheweth, how ſinne <hi>à primo ad ultimum</hi> cometh to be accompliſhed. So
that as in other places, we read of the generations of men, the generations of
<hi>Adam,</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> ſo here is the generation of ſinne deſcribed. Now it
is good to obſerve, that in this whole diſcourſe the Apoſtle doth proceed meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,
comparing original ſinne to a woman, like that whore in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi>
alluring and enticing man to ſinne; or as <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt tempted to
ſinne by <hi>Eve;</hi> ſo ſtill we are drawn aſide to ſinne by this original corruption,
which is like an <hi>Eve,</hi> or like a <hi>Daeliah,</hi> and a <hi>Joſeph's</hi> miſtreſs, importunately
ſolliciting of us to what is evil: and as with the woman there is pleaſure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
but pangs and ſorrows in bringing forth, ſo it is with ſinne: while we
do at firſt entertain it, there is pleaſure and delight, but afterwards it leaveth a
terrible ſting in a man, depriving him of all comfort day and night; We may
therefore obſerve the ſeveral ſteps and degrees of ſinne before it cometh to be
conſummated.</p>
                        <p>1. There is the <hi>mother, or root of all,</hi> and that is called <hi>luſt,</hi> which muſt not only be
extended to the carnal ſenſual appetite of a man, but principally to the rational
part: for there original ſinne hath its chiefeſt dominion; that is the metropolis,
as afterwards is to be ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>2. There are the <hi>motions</hi> to ſinne, and titillations or delectations about it:
this is implied in the word <hi>enticed,</hi> taken from the bird, who is allured by the
bait; the meat it leeth, but obſerveth not the ſnare. Thus in man, there are
ſudden motions and delights ariſing in the ſoul towards ſinfull objects, which

ſinne, and ſecret titillations of the ſoul, before the will doth give its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and full conſent. I ſay perfect conſent; for it may be in all the tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
motions to ſinne, though never ſo ſudden, there may be ſome imperfect
conſent.</p>
                        <p>The third ſtep or degree to the compleating of ſinne, is expreſſed <hi>verſ. 15,
When lust hath conceived,</hi>

                           </gap>: This is applied to women conceiving, <hi>Luke
1. 24. Luke</hi> 1. 31. and by this is meant that <hi>conſent</hi> and imbracement, which the
ſoul giveth to ſinne. For as it was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though his miſtreſs did ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
ſollicit him, yet he not conſenting fled away from her: So it falleth out
ſometimes with the godly, that though original ſinne in the immediate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof, may tempt, may delight and ſecretly pleaſe; yet grace being
ſtrong may refuſe to conſent, and then theſe <hi>Babylons</hi> brats are immediately
killed before they grow up. Thus many ſinnes to the godly prove abortive;
original ſinne hath a miſcarrying womb, for by grace they are inabled to reſiſt
thoſe temptations, and ſo ſinne is killed as ſoon as ever it hath any life. <hi>Not but
that theſe motions to ſinne, though not conſented unto, are truly and properly ſins;
but being withſtood by grace, they are not imputed.</hi> And thus farre we admit that
ſaying of <hi>Bernard, Non nocet ſenſus, ubi deeſt conſenſus.</hi> Theſe motions and
ſtirrings of luſt within us, if reſiſted and refuſed, ſhall not be able to condemn
us, but in all natural men for the moſt part, <hi>luſt doth conceive;</hi> no ſooner doth
it entice, but preſently there is conſent given to it; No ſooner doth it knock at
the door, but preſently it is opened to receive this luſt in; and now when this
conſent is given, then as to the eyes of God, the iniquity is fully committed;
then a man is a murderer and an adulterer before God, as appeareth <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28.
Yet the Apoſtle addeth,</p>
                        <p>The fourth ſtep, and that is, Luſt thus conſented unto, <hi>bringeth forth ſinne,</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſtill continuing in the metaphor. By ſinne is meant <hi>actual ſinne,</hi> expreſſed
in <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> ſo that ſinne is firſt in the heart, in motions, in ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
and imbracements, before it cometh to be expreſſed actually. But why
doth not the Apoſtle give it the name of ſinne, till it be compleated in action?
The Papiſts greedily lay hold on this, and would therefore conclude from
hence, that the motions of the heart to ſinne, if not conſented unto, that
the luſts which riſe up in us to our grief and trouble, are not truly and properly
ſins. But</p>
                        <p>1. They themſelves do acknowledge, that ſinne conſented unto, luſts yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto, though in the heart only, are truly and properly ſinnes; that thoſe
are damnable, though never actually committed; whereas this Text, if they
rigidly urge it, would prove as well, that ſuch luſts are not ſin.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, Though the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth not here call ſuch motions ſinnes,
yet <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. doth very often give them that name, and accounteth
himſelf miſerable, in reſpect of his captivity to them, though he doth utterly
diſallow them. Therefore the Anſwer is, That the Apoſtle taketh ſinne here
ſtrictly, for only actual ſinne, becauſe this is onely viſible to the eyes of the
world: and becauſe though motions conſented unto, yea and unconſented
unto, are truly and proper ſinnes, yet becauſe theſe are in a tendency to actual
ſinnes; actual ſinne is the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> as it were; they are not fully
compleated in the utmoſt of their iniquity, till actually committed. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if that be called only ſinne, not by way of excluſion to the motions within,
but by way of aggravation; to ſhew that then ſinne when its actuated hath gone
to its utmoſt.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Here is the laſt ſtep, and utmoſt end of ſinne: and that is ſinne thus
finiſhed, <hi>Bringeth forth death,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Now all the pleaſure is turned into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
in death: in the torments of hell, all the delights of ſinne will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
as the whoriſh woman in her pangs and troubles, when ſhe labours to
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:57719:246"/>
bring forth, and cannot, doth then forget all her former wanton luſts. The
damned in hell will cry out then: Oh if they had remembred into what doom
the ſhort pleaſures of ſinne have brought them; how that all their honey is
now turned into bitter gall, they would never have given way to theſe evil luſts!
So that we may metaphorically apply that to ſuch ſinners at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which our Saviour did to ſome, becauſe of the day of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<hi>Woe be to thoſe that are with child, and give ſuck</hi> (that thus conceive)
<hi>and bring forth in thoſe dayes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And here again you may ask,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Why is it ſaid, that <hi>ſinne thus finiſhed
bringeth forth death,</hi> if ſin be entertained in the heart, though it go no further?
It is not mortal and damnable?</p>
                        <p>The Papiſts therefore they would from hence alſo eſtabliſh their diſtinction
of venial and mortal ſinne.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> But this Text will not help them; for as was ſaid,
they acknowledge that adultery in the heart is a mortal ſinne, though not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
committed; and if theſe motions be truly and properly a ſinne, as we
ſhewed; then eternal death muſt needs be the wages of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.
Therefore death is attributed to ſinne finiſhed, becauſe therein the evil of ſinne
doth moſt palpably demonſtrate it ſelf. It is true, <hi>Calvin</hi> doth by <hi>ſinne finiſhed,</hi>
or <hi>perfected,</hi> mean not ſo much the acting of any groſſe ſinne, as the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
continuance and perſeverance in it; and no doubt this ſenſe is not
to be excluded: but the Text may very well be interpreted of any ſinne,
though but once committed, though it be not frequently iterated. And
thus we have this full and excellent Text largely explained. From which we
obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That original ſinne is that luſt within a man, from whence all actual ſinnes
do flow.</hi> That is, as there is not a man or woman, but he doth come from <hi>Adam:</hi>
(Hence the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> have a ſaying, <hi>That if</hi> Adam <hi>were alive, he could not
have a wiſe among all the women in the world, becauſe of their diſcent from
him</hi>) So it is true of every vain thought, every idle word, every ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
action: they all come from this original luſt within a man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Devil with all his fiery darts could do us no hurt, did not our
luſts betray us, <hi>Nemo ſe palpet de ſuo. Satanas eſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Let no man
flatter himſelf, he is a Devil to himſelf from his own luſt, he is a tempter
to himſelf. This truth is of ſpecial uſe to humble us, this will make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
our ſelves, crying out, O Lord, I, even I alone am to be blamed;
it is from my own vile ſelf, that all this corruption doth thus overflow.
This our Saviour confirmed, when he ſaid, <hi>Matth. 15. 19. One of the heart
proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. So that whoſoever would be
kept free and unſpotted from ſinne, he muſt watch over his heart more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there is the neſt, there is the ſpawn of all thoſe noiſome ſins, that may be
ſeen in thy life.</p>

Point. And</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>By luſt here in the Text, we are not to underſtand that particular
libidinous dispoſition in men, whereby they are carried out in a wanton or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
manner, as we in our Engliſh phraſe do for the moſt part limit it.</hi> For
the Apoſtle doth comprehend farre more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. in that command, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not luſt,</hi> or <hi>covet;</hi> neither is this luſt to be reſtrained only to the ſenſitive
and carnal part of a man; as if luſt were not chiefly in the reaſon, and the will
of a man, according to Scripture-language. Luſt doth comprehend the deor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of the ſublime and rational part in a man. Therefore thoſe Papiſts
who do limit luſt only to the ſenſual part, are wholly ignorant of the extenſion
of original ſinne, and the diffuſion of it ſelf through the chiefeſt parts of a
man. Hence it is juſtly to be cenſured, that the late Annotator on this Text,
doth in his paraphraſe joyn with the moſt erroneous of the Popiſh party: for
by <hi>luſt</hi> he underſtands <hi>our treacherous ſenſual appetite,</hi> which being impatient
of ſufferings, ſuggeſts ſome ſenſitive carnal baits, and ſo by them enticeth him.
And in the verſe following, he agin paraphraſeth, <q>When conſent is joyned
to the invitation of the ſenſual part, againſt the contrary dictates of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the Spirit, then that, and not the affliction or temptation, begetteth
ſinne.—Thus he.</q> But we may meet with a more ſound and orthodox ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
I ſay not in <hi>Whitaker</hi> and other Proteſtant Authors, who conflict
with the Papiſts in this point; but even in <hi>Eſtius</hi> the Papiſt, who doth ingenuouſly
acknowledge, <q>That becauſe the Apoſtle is here ſpeaking of the original of all
ſinne, ſpiritual ſinnes as well as carnal; it cannot be limited to the ſenſitive
appetite. Do not the ſins of the mind ariſe from our luſts within us?</q> Do not the
Devils ſinne from the luſt within them, and yet they have no ſenſitive appetite?
And when the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. ſpeaketh of that remarkable luſting which
is between the fleſh and the Spirit; he cannot mean the ſenſual inferiour part
of a man only, for the works of this fleſh are ſome of them ſaid to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Hereſies; which muſt needs proceed from the rational part of a man. It is
therefore too evident, that this luſt which doth ſo greatly entice us, is not only
in the inferiour part of the ſoul, but moſt predominantly in the ſuperiour, and
hence the underſtanding hath its peculiar enmity to the holy truths of God, and
the will its proper obſtinacy to the good duties, which God hath commanded.
Therefore we read of that expreſſion, <hi>Col. 2. 18. Puft up with a fleſhly mind.</hi>
So that hereſie is a luſt of the mind, envy a luſt of the mind; for the Devil is
full of envy, (though Philoſophers referre envy to one of their mixed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
paſſions;) unbelief, ambition, vain-glory, theſe are luſts of the rational
part. Think not then that thy affections only do luſt againſt the Spirit of God,
but thy reaſon, thy will alſo doth; and theſe have the greateſt evil in them,
they are the greateſt enemies to the wayes and truths of Chriſt. As the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
ſinnes were from the luſt of the fleſh, ſo the <hi>Phariſes</hi> ſinnes were from
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57719:247"/>
the luſts of the mind. And thus the more ſuperſtitious, erroneous and devout
any are in falſe wayes of Religion, the more dangerous are their luſts, becauſe
the more ſpiritual and immaterial. This kind of luſting followeth us in our
prayers, in our preachings, in all ſpiritual performances; So that whereas
carnal and bodily luſts are eaſily diſcerned, and are accounted very loathſome
in the eyes of the world. Theſe ſpiritual luſts are very difficulty diſcovered,
and may then moſt reign over a man, when he thinketh himſelf moſt free from
them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Propoſ. 2. When we ſay, original ſinne is the cauſe of all the actual evil that
is committed, this is not to be underſtood, as if it did proximly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
produce every actual impiety; onely this is the mediate cauſe, and the
root of all.</hi> It is true, the learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> will not allow it to be called the
remote cauſe of death, and other miſeries, which Infants are obnoxious unto.
As the root cannot be ſaid to be the remote cauſe of fruit, becauſe it doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
it, though under ground, and at a diſtance from it: Or (as he inſtanceth)
a fountain is a cauſe of that ſtream which is carried in a long courſe diſtant from
the ſpring (<hi>De peccat. orig. l. 2. c.</hi> 9.) But we need not ſtrive about words. No doubt
when men through cuſtom have contracted habits of ſin upon them, habits are
the immediate and proxim cauſes of the wicked actions, ſuch perſons do commit;
but original ſinne is the mediate: yet becauſe original ſinne is the <hi>cauſa cauſae,</hi>
it may be called the <hi>cauſa cauſati,</hi> it being the cauſe of the cuſtoms and habits
of ſins, it may be alſo the cauſe of the ſins themſelves. But I ſee not why we
may not call original ſinne the remote cauſe only of ſome ſins, becauſe that is
the ſeed and ſpawn only of all evil; there are many temptations and ſuggeſtions,
which do ripen and quicken this monſter to bring forth. So that although men
have luſt enough within them to make them, ſo many <hi>Cains,</hi> ſo many <hi>Judaſſes;</hi>
to be as abominable in wicked wayes, as the vileſt of men are; yet <hi>Nemo repente
fit turpissimus,</hi> as the Poet ſaid. There is time required to grow up into ſuch
foul abominations. This is like the Prophets <hi>little cloud,</hi> which at firſt, though
<hi>no bigger than an hand,</hi> yet did afterwards biggen, till it covered the whole sky.
The Apoſtle (you heard) compareth the production of ſinne, to the child,
that is firſt conceived in the mothers womb; and ſo through the warmth and
nouriſhment thereof, doth luſt bring forth: As it is with the Acorn, that is at
firſt but little in quantity, yet being great in efficacy, doth in time enlarge it
ſelf into a great Tree. Conclude then all evil, even the moſt enormious impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which for the preſent, it may be, thy heart doth tremble at, yet they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
and radically in thee; there are the ſparks of fire, which if let alone will
quickly ſet all on a flame. Hence</p>
                           <p>The third Propoſition is, <hi>That whoſoever would by the grace of God be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from any actual ſins, the beſt remedy is, to endeavour to quench the luſt
within.</hi> He that would dry up the ſtreams, muſt look to the fountain, to have
that dried up. He that would deſtroy the bad fruit of a Tree, muſt lay the axe
to the root of it. And this is a very neceſſary Rule to be attended unto in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Divinity. Obſerve that the ſame way ſinne comes to live, the ſame way
thou muſt take to kill it. It beginneth at the heart firſt, before it's in the eyes, or
hands; and therefore thou muſt look to crucifie it in the heart firſt. Thus the
Wiſeman adviſeth, <hi>Prov 4. 23. Keep thy heart, for out of it are the iſſues of
life.</hi> After this then he exhorteth to <hi>look to our mouth and lips, to our eyes and
feet;</hi> but the foundation muſt be laid in the heart; if the heart be good, all is
good. And this ſheweth the prepoſterous way of the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> and <hi>Confeſſioniſts</hi>
in Popery, from which the <hi>late Writer,</hi> ſo often mentioned, doth not much
decline in his Treatiſe of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Penance;</hi> for with ſuch Writers, you
have ſcarce one word to the penitent ſinner about Regeneration, whereas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
duties of alms, or reſtitution (which in their way are neceſſary by Gods
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:57719:248"/>
command) muſt flow from a ſpiritual and ſupernatural life within, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all: much leſſe have you one <hi>icta</hi> or <hi>tittle,</hi> about faith, laying hold
on Chriſt, by whom alone our perſons are juſtified, and all our duties are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
This (I ſay) is the great neglect and unskilfulneſs in ſuch writers, that
they deal in externals, but for faith, by which the heart is purified, and whereby
we pleaſe God in Chriſt, that they make no mention of at all. But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is herein different from moral Philoſophy and Ariſtotelical precepts,
which thoſe <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> are wholly captivated unto: for that requireth, yea and
promiſeth firſt a tender and holy heart, a circumciſed heart, and then to walk
in the wayes of God: whereas moral Philoſophers firſt begin with actions, and
then go to acquired habits, <hi>Juſtè agendo ſumus juſts.</hi> This then is a golden
Rule, and of perpetual uſe in Chriſtianity, for a Chriſtian to be mortifying luſt
within, to watch againſt the treacherous adverſary in thy own breaſt, and
then when the foundation is deſtroyed, the ſuperſtruction muſt needs fall to
the ground.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Propoſ. 4. Becauſe man is thus tempted, and enticed by luſt within, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that man fallen, doth ſinne farre otherwiſe, then</hi> Adam <hi>did in the ſtate
of integrity.</hi> We do not ſinne now, as <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt; we have an internal
cauſe and principle within us, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne, wholly from ſuggeſtion
without; neither was it luſt within, but his meer will, that made him conſent to
ſuch ſuggeſtions. This Propoſition is the more to be regarded, becauſe <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
and <hi>Socinian</hi> Writers, they all agree in this, That we at firſt ſinne in the
ſame manner, as <hi>Adam</hi> did at firſt; the ſenſitive part, being enticed by ſenſible
objects, and ſo rebelling againſt the rational part. But this is to be wholly
ignorant of that holy eſtate and glorious Image, wherein God created <hi>Adam</hi> at
firſt. <hi>Adam</hi> had all ſuch external and internal helps, ſo freed from all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
paſſion or luſt, that nothing could deſtroy him, but the liberty and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
of his will. Whereas alas in man deſtitute of Gods Image, there is a
luſting principle within him, carrying him out inordinately unto every object
propoſed. It is therefore a falſe and an abſurd Poſition, which <hi>Molina</hi> the
Jeſuite, one of the meer Naturaliſts affirmeth (<hi>Quaeſt. 14. Disput. 4. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
lib. Arb.</hi>) where he ſaith, <hi>Adam</hi> had, <hi>Innatum appetitum excellentiae ac
laudis quo ad intellectum &amp; voluntatem,</hi> &amp;c. That he had this temptation
within him, <hi>viz.</hi> an innate appetite to his own excellency and praiſe. For how
could this conſiſt with that holineſs and righteouſneſs God created him in? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he ſaith in another place of the ſame book (<hi>Quaeſt. 14. Diſp. 45.) Ex
contemplation rei amabilis,</hi> &amp;c) from the contemplation of any lovely object,
and which is of concernment to be obtained, there doth naturally riſe in the
will a certain motion, whereby the will is affected to it; which motion is not a
volition, but an affection of the will to that object, whoſe goodneſs it is allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with. And this he maketh to be in men, yea in the Angels before they fell:
But what is this but to ſay, that in men and Angels, even before their fall, there
was a concupiſcential inclination to delightſome objects: and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
muſt according to this Text be tempted away, and enticed by their own
luſts? An horrible Poſition, highly derogating from Gods honour, who created
them holy and righteous. Therefore <hi>Adam,</hi> and much more Chriſt, when they
were tempted by Satan, it was not in the ſame way with us. The temptation
was only external, not internal; there was no inward luſt within; yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
external temptation of <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt was different from ours in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſpect. For the Devil had not power by his ſuggeſtions to move or diſturb
their phanſie, as he doth in us. Though the Devil cannot force our wils, yet
he can make bodily commotions of the phantaſie, and ſo thereby man is the
more eaſily carried away to evil. But neither Chriſt or <hi>Adam</hi> had their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
ſo diſturbed. For although they might underſtand by phantaſmes, yet
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:57719:248"/>
all was at the command of deliberate judgement. A mans imagination
was then in his own power: ſo that thoſe inferiour faculties in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
could not hinder the ſuperiour. Whether <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
would have had dreames, is uncertain; but if he had, learned men
conclude, they would alwayes have been good, and not without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
uſe of reaſon, as <hi>Rivet</hi> thinketh (<hi>in cap.</hi> 3. Geneſ.) However this is
enough for our purpoſe, to ſhew, that we are tempted to ſinne in a different
way from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Hence the fifth Propoſition is, <hi>That becauſe there is ſuch an internal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
principle within, a man is carried out to ſinne, though there be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
temptations by Satan or wicked men.</hi> But even as the Devil, who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
firſt, had no tempter, but was carried out by his meer free-will to
evil: So much more muſt man, who hath this corrupt principle within
him, be carried out to ſinne, though there be no Devil to tempt us, or
wicked men. Hence the Apoſtle doth in this Text name <hi>luſt</hi> onely, as the
inward cauſe, not mentioning Devils or wicked men. But yet it is diſputed,
That although the luſt of a man within, be a ſufficient cauſe and principle to carry
a man out to all evil, whether for all that, the Devil alſo doth not help to the
committing of every ſinne, They queſtion: Whether original luſt be the
cauſe only, and that the Devil alſo doth not excite and ſtirre this up? Some
think, becauſe wicked men are ſaid to do, what they ſee their father the Devil
do, and becauſe he is called the <hi>tempter, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 3. 4. That therefore, though
we ſinne alwayes of our ſelves, yet it is by the inſtigation of the Devil; but
becauſe the Scripture maketh the <hi>imagination of mans heart to be only evil,</hi> Gen.
8. 21. And becauſe our corruption within, is generally ſaid to be the cauſe of a
mans ſinne; therefore we cannot ſay, that the Devil tempteth to every evil
action that we do commit, although in ſome particular hainous ſins, as in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
and <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> he entered into their hearts, and filled them with
his temptations; but at that very time, obſerve how <hi>Peter</hi> doth reprove <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>
for letting Satan have ſuch admiſſion into his heart, <hi>Acts 5 3. Why hath
Satan filled thy heart?</hi> So that the Devil doth not compell any man to ſinne; it
will be no excuſe to ſay, Satan tempted me; for this could not be, if thy luſt
did not conſent to him, and entetain him; he throweth his fiery darts, and thy
heart is like thatch or ſtraw, that quickly is inflamed.</p>
                           <p>The laſt Propoſition is, <hi>That the effects of this inhere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of two ſorts, immediate and mediate. Immediate</hi> are thoſe firſt motions and
workings of ſoul to any evil object, though not conſented unto; yea it may be
abhorred and humbled for. The <hi>mediate</hi> effects are luſts conſented unto in the
heart, and many times externally committed in our lives. For that original
ſinne hath an influence into groſſe ſinnes, appeareth by <hi>David</hi>'s confeſſion,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51 when he bewails his birth-pollution in his penitential humiliation, for
thoſe foul ſins committed by him. But I ſhall enlarge my ſelf only concerning
thoſe ſinfull motions and ſtirrings of the heart unto evil, which though the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
man taketh no notice of, yet the conſtant and perpetual work of a godly
man is to conflict with, as appeareth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. They are thoſe perpetual reſtleſſe
workings of his heart inordinately, one way or other, that make his condition ſo
bitter; and therefore it is good to conſider what may be ſaid for our informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Effect of Original Sin.</head>
                           <p>THe laſt Propoſition we mentioned, contained a diviſion of the effects of
original ſinne within us, which were either <hi>immediate,</hi> ſuch as <hi>the motions</hi>
of the heart to ſinne with the pleaſures therof, not conſented unto. Or <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi>
which are <hi>luſts conſented unto, and the external actings of ſinne thus
imbraced.</hi> I ſhall only enlarge my ſelf upon the former, and for your informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein, take theſe conſiderations.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>That theſe motions to ſinne may be divided according to the ſubject
they are in.</hi> Now the powers of the ſoul are uſually divided into the <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
and <hi>appetitive;</hi> the <hi>cognitive</hi> and <hi>affective;</hi> that is, either ſuch as <hi>know</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
or ſuch as are carried out by <hi>love</hi> and <hi>deſire.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Jachin</hi> and
<hi>Beaz</hi> (as it were) the two pillars of the temple of the ſoul; and reſpectively
to theſe two, ſo are the ſtirrings of ſinne within us. <hi>In the mind, or knowing
part of the ſoul,</hi> the workings of ſinne are by <hi>apprehenſions</hi> and <hi>thoughts;</hi> In
the <hi>affective part,</hi> by way of <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> And in both theſe the heart of a
godly man is many times ſadly exerciſed. For <hi>thoughts,</hi> How many vain, idle,
fooliſh ones do ariſe in his ſoul, like the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore? The flies and
Locuſts in <hi>Aegypt</hi> did not more annoy then theſe do moleſt and trouble a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart. Theſe thoughts come like ſo many ſwarms upon thee before thou
haſt time to recollect thy ſelf. They are got into the ſouls cloſet, before they
were ever perceived knocking at the door. Nay theſe thoughts are not only
roving, wandring and reſtleſſe, but ſometimes horrid black ones, blaſphemous,
atheiſtical, diabolical; which put the ſoul into an holy trembling, and they
know not what to do; they think none like them, no ſuch vile wretches in the
world, as they are. Indeed there are blaſphemous <hi>injections</hi> of Satan, ſuch as
are ſuggeſted to the ſoul importunately by him, to which the ſoul giveth no
conſent, but like the maid in the judicial Law, that was ready to be raviſhed, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out againſt them; or as the people, when they heard <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> rail and
blaſpheme the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo horribly, <hi>They anſwered him not a word.</hi>
Thus the people of God in ſuch temptations give no conſent or approbation to
them; now theſe are <hi>afflictions not ſinnes;</hi> they are ſad exerciſes, but not our
corruptions, becauſe they are wholly external, and caſt in upon us; as if we
were in a room, where we could not get out, hearing men curſe and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme;
this would torment our ſouls, but they do not make us guilty. They
are compared to the Cup in <hi>Benjamen</hi>'s ſack; it was found there, but it was not
his fault, it came there without his knowledge and conſent. And although they
be foul and loathſom to a gracious heart, yet God uſually keepeth his people
hereby humble and lowly; yea he maketh them more ſpiritual and fruitfull,
as the black and noiſom dung maketh the field more fertile and fruitfull; but I
ſpeak not of theſe. The thoughts we are treating of, are ſuch as ariſe from our
own hearts: for ſeeing original ſinne is the ſeed of all evil, the moſt erroneous
and flagitious that can be; therefore atheiſtical, blaſphemous, laſcivious, and
other evil thoughts may come out of our own hearts. It is indeed a ſpecial part
of heavenly skill and wiſdom, experimentally to make a difference between
what thoughts are our own, and what are meerly of diabolical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>jections, to
diſcover when our own corrupt nature worketh, and when the Devil doth only
aſſault and annoy us: But that is not my buſineſs now. It is enough to know,
That even from thy own unſanctified heart may ariſe vain thoughts, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:57719:249"/>
thoughts. So that thy ſoul ſeemeth unto thee, to be not only like a
dunghill, but an hell it ſelf. To theſe evil ſtirrings of ſinne, in the <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
part,</hi> we may referre our ſinful dreames: even for them God might damn
us. <hi>Auſtin</hi> bewaileth and confeſſeth his dreames; and yet our underſtanding
and will do not ſo properly work at that time. <hi>The other ſort of workings of
ſoul, are ſuch as are by way of love, and deſire, when there ariſe in the heart ſome
motions, and affections to ſuch an object.</hi> Our hearts being now wholly deſtitute
of the Image of God, and ſinne having full dominion over us; no ſooner doth
any ſinful object preſent it ſelf, but immediately the heart maketh towards it;
there is a propenſity to embrace it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe motions that do thus ſtirre in the heart, are either ſuch as they
call</hi> motus primo primi, <hi>or</hi> ſecundo primi, <hi>the abſolute meer firſt, or firſt in a
ſecondary order.</hi> There may be difference in the explaining of theſe; but the
ſumme is this, Theſe motions are either ſuch, which do riſe up in our hearts,
<hi>antecedently</hi> to any actings of the <hi>reaſon,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> at all. It was not in our power
to repreſs them, or to prevent them: for original ſin in a man doth not lie ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh
and bound up, it is alwayes acting and moving; and the immediate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or firſt born of the ſoul are theſe firſt ſtirrings of heart, preventing all
deliberation and conſultation. Such a ſtate indeed <hi>Adam</hi> was not created in;
nothing did riſe up in him before his will, and conſent: and ſo it was alſo with
Chriſt. But ſince we are plunged into this corrupt condition, ſinne hath got
the whole maſtery over us, we are in a <hi>Babel</hi> and ſpiritual confuſion. Every
ſinful luſt riſeth in us before we have time to withſtand it; although (if we had
time) ſuch is our impotency and corruption now, that we neither can, or
will gainſay the torrent of theſe motions: It is true, the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſay, they are
<hi>no ſinnes,</hi> they are matter of exerciſe to us, but they are not ſinnes if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto. But the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. doth often call them ſo, and they are
ſuch as are <hi>contrary to the Law of God;</hi> they are ſuch as make a godly man
groan under them, and judge himſelf miſerable thereby; they are ſuch as are
to be crucified and mortified, all which ſhew they have the true and proper
nature of ſinne. So that it is a wonder thoſe ſhould deny theſe indeliberate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be ſinne, who hold original ſinne to be properly and not equivocally a
ſinne. For, as it is enough to make original ſinne voluntary, becauſe it is <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarium
voluntate ejus à quo,</hi> not <hi>in quo eſt,</hi> with the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> from
whence it deſcendeth, though not with the will of him in which it inhereth;
Thus alſo it may be ſaid of theſe involuntary motions, they are of the ſame
nature with original ſinne. For though they be actual, yet flowing neceſſarily
from the mother ſinne, and being withall a privation of that righteouſneſs,
which ought to be in us, they muſt be called ſinnes, as well as original. And
thus farre <hi>Henricus</hi> the Schooleman proceedeth, as <hi>Vaſquez</hi> alledgeth him,
(<hi>Tom. 10. diſput.</hi> 106.) to ſay, That theſe firſt motions in perſons, not baptized
are ſinnes, and that they want not ſuch a voluntarineſs, as is requiſite to the
nature of ſinne; partly becauſe of the will of the firſt parents, and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the proper will of the man who hath them; not becauſe he doth not
hinder theſe motions, becauſe he cannot alwayes do this; but becauſe he will
not by baptiſme be expiated from original ſinne, and conſequently from the
guilt of theſe ſinnes. This later reaſon we matter not; the former hath good
ſtrength, and is the ſame in effect with what we ſay. Oh then that we were
rightly conſidering of theſe things! Thoſe millions of thoughts and ſtirrings
of heart, which ariſe before reaſon and will are able to do any thing, theſe
are all ſinnes: theſe are contrary to the holy Law of God: <hi>Adam</hi> had them not,
neither ſhall the glorified Saints in heaven be in the leaſt manner moleſted with
them. How low and debaſed muſt thou be in thy own eyes? For this it is that
the godly go bowed down; for this they mourn and pray: theſe afflict them
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:57719:250"/>
more then groſs loathſome ſinnes do prophane men; the meer civil and formal
man, the ſelf-righteous and confident man, he knoweth none of theſe things;
he feeleth not this evil impure frame of his heart: this maketh the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
to be ſuch a myſtery, ſuch an unknown thing, but to thoſe that are belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
indeed, as they have other joyes, other comforts then the world knoweth
of; ſo they have other motives of ſorrow and humiliation, then the natural
man can underſtand. But as for the firſt motions of the ſecond ſort, they have ſome
imperfect conſent and complacency; and therefore acknowledged by <hi>Gerſon,
(Compend. Theol.</hi>) to be ſinnes; yea the former kind of motions, though ſo
ſuddain, are affirmed to be ſinnes (by ſeveral Schoolemn upon different rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
but venial, as they call them. For <hi>Henricus</hi> held they were mortal; now
to us all ſinnes in their own nature are mortal. Therefore all theſe motions,
which ariſe in the ſoul, whether firſt or ſecond, being contrary to the holy Law
of God, which requireth pure ſtreames, and alſo a pure fountain; and alſo
being oppoſite to the Image of God we were created in, muſt needs be truly
ſinnes: for which we are to humble our ſelves, and to pray continually for
the mortification of them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe motions though they flow from original ſinne, as the univerſal
cauſe, yet there are particular cauſes that do excite and draw them forth. <hi>And it is
good to obſerve, how many wayes original ſinne, being awakened doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
theſe ſinful motions thereof. And</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>1. <hi>Sometimes they ariſe from the preſent ſenſible object that doth affect us.</hi> Every
object either of the eye, or ear, or touching, doth preſently work upon the
ſoul, <hi>not</hi> indeed <hi>efficiently</hi> (as ſome have thought) but only by way of <hi>alluring</hi>
and <hi>enticing:</hi> ſo that it is almoſt impoſſible for us, either to hear or ſee any
object, and not have the firſt motions of the ſoul, as ſuddain, ſo ſinful, about
them. Oh the miſerable depravation of mankind, who hath ſinne and hell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the ſoul by evey ſenſe it hath! there is not any ſenſible object,
but it is a ſnare to thee, it ſtirreth up ſome ſinful motion or other, either <hi>love,</hi>
or <hi>anger, joy,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> and all this before grace can work: Hence the great
work of Chriſtianity is inward and ſpiritual; it is ſoul-work, to ſet a watch <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eyes, eares, tongue,</hi> and all the outward parts of the body, that the ſoul be
not ſinfully diſquieted. For every object is to our corrupt hearts one way or
other, as the forbidden fruit was to <hi>Eve:</hi> not that God doth forbid us to ſee or
hear ſuch things, but becauſe the ſoul cannot be excited by thoſe objects and
affected with them, but it is in a ſinful manner. If then thy head were a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of teares, it could not weep enough for the deſolation that is upon thee:
Thy eye maketh thee ſinne; thy ear maketh thee ſinne. Thus thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
about with ſinne, from evening and morning.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>Theſe ſuddain motions of ſinne, ſometimes ariſe from the imagination and
fancy of a man.</hi> And truly, how often do diſpleaſing and ſinful imaginations
diſturb the peace and quiet of thy ſoul? Is it not thy fancy thou complaineſt
of? how volatique and roving is that? It ſtayeth no where, it is not fixed in
holy duties. It is like a market place, where there is a croud of people, ſo that
the imagination doth very often help this original luſt and ſinne to bring forth.
What a quiet, ſrene and bleſſed life ſhould a man live, if his imagination could
be kept in an holy fixed frame, if he could bid it go, and it goeth, do this, and it
did it?</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>The perturbation of the body by diſtempers, that many times cauſeth this ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne to be working in us:</hi> Though the body be corporeal, and the ſoul a
ſpirit, and ſo cannot act phyſically upon it; yet becauſe they are both the
eſſential parts of a man immediately united together, there is by ſympathy an
acting and affecting of one another, eſpecially the body being inſtrumental to
the ſoul in many operations: Hence it is when that is diſturbed and indiſpoſed,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:57719:250"/>
the ſoul alſo is hindred in its operations, and therefore from the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the body we are eaſily moved to anger, to ſorrow, to fear, to
luſts: So that the motions of the ſoul are many times according to the
motions of the body, as <hi>Gerſon</hi> inſtanceth (<hi>Compend. Theol.</hi>) in a <hi>ſimile,</hi>
which he ſaith ſome uſe concerning the water, when the Sunne-beams are
upon it, as the water moveth or danceth up and down, ſo do the Sunne-beams
which are upon the water. Thus as the body is in any commotion, ſo the
ſoul which is more immediately united to the body, then the beams of the
Sunne are to the water, doth work according as it finds this inſtrument diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>This original luſt is often ſtirred up to entice us by the ſenſitive
appetite, by the paſſions and affections that are in us.</hi> This we told you ſome
did limit luſt to in the Text, but very unſoundly, yet it cannot be denied,
but becauſe the affectionate part of a man is ſo prevalent and operative,
that very often ſinne is committed here, even without the conſent of the
will. Theſe affections doe ſuddenly tranſport us, and we can no more
command them to be quiet, then we are able to compoſe the waves of the
Sea. Now though we would withſtand and gain-ſay them, yet they
are our ſinnes for all that, as we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> ſadly complaining herein,
<hi>Rom. 7. Auſtin</hi> delighteth (<hi>De Trinit. lib.</hi> 13.) to expreſſe our manner
of ſinning by alluſion to the firſt ſinne, <hi>When any object doth preſent it
ſelf, to allure and affect us, then the Serpent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſheweth us the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit: When the ſenſitive appetite of a man is drawn out to conſent
unto it, then</hi> Eve <hi>doth eat of this forbidden fruit; when the rational part
of the ſoul is enticed likewiſe to conſent to this ſinne, then</hi> Eve <hi>giveth of this
fruit to</hi> Adam, <hi>and he eateth.</hi> Thus Reaſon is like <hi>Adam, Eve</hi> like the
ſenſitive part; and as <hi>Eve,</hi> when ſhe did eat the forbidden fruit alone,
did thereby grow mortal, and would have died, though <hi>Adam</hi> had not
conſented to eat: Thus the affectionate part of a man carrying us away
to ſinne, though the ſuperiour part of the ſoul will not agree thereunto,
yet this maketh us to be in a ſtate of damnation. This maketh the action to be
damnable.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>When none of theſe wayes doe ſtirre up original ſinne, then the
thoughts and apprehenſions of a man in the intellectual part they may.</hi> And
indeed the former provoking cauſes were moſt conſpicuous in groſſe and
carnal ſinnes; but this is influential in ſpiritual ſinnes; from the minde
come vain thoughts, ambitious, proud, malicious thoughts; from the mind
ariſe blaſphemous, atheiſtical, and unbelieving thoughts. Thus you ſee
how poor and wretched man is become in his ſoul, as <hi>Laezarus</hi> was in his
body, all over with ulcers and ſores, no place is free from ſinne: Oh
that God would deliver us from our blindneſſe of minde, from our ſelf-fulneſſe,
whereby we are ſo apt to fall in love with our ſelves, ſo as to
think we want nothing, when we are without God, without Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Image of God, without all holineſſe and peace within, either of
ſoul or body! How ſhould it pity thee to ſee this glorious building thus
lying in its own ruines and rubbidge? Now from all theſe particulars thus
joyned together, you may obſerve how ſinne carrieth us away in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
enticing manner. So that although we cannot but ſinne, yet this is
very delightſome and ſatisfactory; inſomuch that man is drawn aſide to
ſinne, as he ſaid,
<q>—Trahit ſua quemque voluptas.</q>
And this is more to be obſerved, becauſe the adverſaries do ſo tragically
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:57719:251"/>
exclaim againſt us, in affirming, that we lie under a neceſſity of ſinning,
we cannot but ſin. Why then ſay they, <hi>Why ſhould God damn us for ſinning,
any more than for being thirſty or hungry, which do neceſſarily affect us?</hi> But
the Anſwer is two-fold:</p>
                           <p>1. This neceſſity of ſinning is <hi>voluntarily contracted, and brought upon
us;</hi> it is not as hunger or thirſt, which were neceſſary properties of man
at his Creation, though without that grief and pain, which now we feel.
And</p>
                           <p>2. This neceſſity is alſo voluntary and pleaſing, it ſeizeth upon the
mind, will, affections, and the whole man; and therefore as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help it, ſo neither will we help it. We love and delight to eat this
poiſon.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, There are theſe three degrees, whereby it's ſaid, <hi>Luſt cometh to
be accompliſhed:</hi> Though ſome differ in their expreſſions herein.</p>
                           <p>The firſt is <hi>Suggeſtion,</hi> and that is when any luſt doth begin to ariſe in
the ſoul: This is very imperceptible and undiſcerned, but by thoſe who
are exact in the ſpiritual exerciſes of thier ſoul. It is true, ſome ſay this
word <hi>Suggeſtion</hi> is not proper, becauſe that doth properly come from without,
the Devil, or the world; but this is internal, ariſing of our ſelves. But we need
not ſtrive about words.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond is <hi>Delight,</hi> From this motion the ſoul preſently findeth ſome
ſecret pleaſure, and accordingly thinketh of it with delight, receiveth it with
delight.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, There is the conſent unto theſe, to will them, to be joyned to
them. And thus when ſinne hath made this progreſſe, a man is an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
a murderer before God, though not actually done in the eyes of
men, as our Saviour witneſſeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28. for many do conſent to
ſinne within their heart, which yet do not conſent to the outward acting
of it; ſometimes becauſe of the ſhame that it will bring; ſometimes becauſe
of the puniſhment that it doth deſerve, or for ſome unworthy reſpect, or
other not becauſe they fear and love God, not becauſe they deſire a pure,
holy heart, as well as an unſpotted life. And truly this is a good diſcovery of
uprightneſſe of our hearts, when we dare not own ſin in our thoughts, when the
we dare not reſpect iniquity in our hearts, when we labour to keep a pure ſoul,
as well as a pure body.</p>

the very twinkling of an eye, if we do not watchfully attend thereunto, we
may deſtroy our own ſouls over and over again. That is a prophane ſpeech to
ſay, <hi>Thoughts are free;</hi> no, God hath laid an holy command upon our very
thoughts, and the firſt motions and ſtirrings of our hearts, that nothing ſhould
ariſe there, but what is agreeable to Gods holy Word. When water is in a
pure glaſs, though it be moved and ſhaken often, yet no noiſom thing ariſeth
thereby; but if in a ſoul one, then the more it is ſtirred, the more filthy are
the bubbles thereof. Thus in man, while enjoying the Image of God, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
did move or ſtir his heart, it was altogether holy and pure; but ſince man
is thus corrupted, there cannot be any motions of his ſoul, but they are wholly
defiled and ſinfull one way or other.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe manſory thoughts, which the Schoolmen call</hi> moroſae, <hi>becauſe
they do</hi> morari <hi>abide ſome time in the ſoul, they are likewiſe</hi> divided, <hi>for they are
ſo continning in us, either</hi> morâ temporis, <hi>or</hi> morâ conſenſus, <hi>as they expreſſe it.</hi>
(Gerſon <hi>Compend. Theol.</hi>) The continuance of <hi>time</hi> is, when they may for
a long while infect, ſollicit and annoy us, but yet we ſtrive and <hi>gainſay;</hi> We
do by no means give our conſent thereunto, as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs did often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
him, yet all that while, he kept up the fear of God, and would not
ſinne in that way againſt him. So that although the people of God may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
from week to week with loathſom and perplexing thoughts; yet becauſe
they cry unto God, they go and pray to him, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did upon <hi>Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh</hi>'s
railing and blaſpheming of God, they are not to be diſcouraged: Thou
haſt not betrayed thy ſtrength to theſe <hi>Dalilahs</hi> all the while: Yea, from theſe
ſpiritual exerciſes and conflicts, thou wilt increaſe thy glory. <hi>Hereby thou haſt
an opportunity to diſcover thy faith, thy ſelf emptineſs, and to get heavenly skill and
compaſſion, whereby thou art able to ſuccour thoſe that are in the like manner tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
But then</p>
                           <p>2. There are thoughts that are continuing <hi>morâ conſenſus,</hi> and theſe are farre
more dangerous and damnable then the former; for if ſinfull thoughts and
motions ariſe in thy ſoul, though they are but for a very ſhort time; yet if
thou haſt yeelded to them, then thy ſoul hath committed fornication. <hi>Conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſti,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Auſtin, concubuiſti in corde tuo;</hi> ſo that the <hi>conſent</hi> to them is farre
more dangerous then the <hi>length</hi> of time, they may afflict thee in. Any ſinfull
motion conſented unto, though it be but for a moment, is more deſtructive,
then ſuch as follow thee from day to day, yea it may be from year to year, but
thou giveſt no entertainment to them. This is good for the <hi>practical Chriſtian</hi>
to obſerve, it is the long time that troubleth them: Oh (ſay they) ever ſince
God hath firſt wrought upon my ſoul, I have been exerciſed with theſe
thoughts, ſuch dreadfull ſuggeſtions, and to this day I am not yet delivered
from them! Be of good comfort, though it be grievous to thee to feel
ſuch things in thy ſoul, yet becauſe withſtood, they ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to thee. Thoſe that have the like temptations, but for an hour, and
imbracing of them, have more offended God, and endangered their own
ſouls.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="470" facs="tcp:57719:252"/>
                              <hi>Propoſ. 3. It is good to take notice, how many wayes the ſoul may become
guilty of ſinne about theſe thoughts and motions within us.</hi> A truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                                 <desc>•••</desc>
                              </gap>deed
it is) that no natural man, no civil or formal man doth underſtand, or can be
affected with: Can a blind man that doth not behold the Sunne, ſee the atoms
in the Sun-beams? They who are not affected or grieved about great and actual
ſins, will they find theſe inward motions to be burden? If they can ſwallow a
Camel, will they not a mote?</p>
                           <p>1. Therefore we come to ſinne by theſe motions and thoughts of ſoul, <hi>by the
very being of them there.</hi> The very having of them there is contrary to the
Image of God we were firſt created in: As in Heaven there is no unclean thing
that can enter; ſo where the Image of God is full and compleat, the leaſt vain
thought, the leaſt ſinfull ſtirring can no more conſiſt with it, then darkneſs
with light: or as at the firſt creation we could not have found one weed or
thiſtle on the ground, but theſe came by the curſe for ſinne; ſo at firſt in mans
ſoul there would not have appeared the leaſt irregular and inordinate motion of
the heart, not one thought would have been out of its place: <hi>Adam</hi> was Gods
book coming immediately from him, wherein no <hi>errata</hi> could be found; but
now in ſtead of wheat come up cockles. Now what ever we think, we imagine,
we move to all, doth become ſinne unto us. Oh then let the godly ſoul mourn
and humble it ſelf, becauſe ſuch motions are there, as you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> doth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Let it not be thought that thou art freed from all ſinne, becauſe thou
doeſt withſtand them, thou doeſt not own them: For although this will keep
them from being imputed unto thee, yet in themſelves they are ſinnes, they are
damnable; God might throw thee into hell for the meer having of them;
God might juſtly ſay, I ſowed good ſeed in thy ſoul, but how come theſe tares
there? Theſe thoughts, theſe motions are none of my planting, I created
them not: Therefore the very having of them in thy ſoul, is a ſinne againſt
God, though never expreſſed in action; and the reaſon hereof is from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
ſpirituality of the Law of God: There is this great difference between
God and all political Law-giver; theſe later forbid only the external action,
they do not prohibit the inward will or deſire: What Law-giver amongſt men
was ever ſo abſurd as to ſay, you ſhall not cover or deſire ſuch a thing? But if
men do outwardly offend, then they are obnoxious to puniſhment. But it is
otherwiſe with God in his Laws, who is <hi>the Father of Spirits, and ſearcheth our
hearts,</hi> therefore his Law doth principally reach to the heart, to make that a
good treaſure, to have the tree firſt good, and then to make the fruit anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereunto.</p>
                           <p>2. We offend againſt God not only by <hi>having</hi> of theſe motions ſtirring in
us, but much more <hi>when they delight us, when we find a complacency and
ſweetneſs in the thinking of them, when they affect us ſo, that we roll them
like honey under the tongue.</hi> And truly in this reſpect the godly ſoul is even
amazed and aſtoniſhed to ſee how vile it is, and how abominable: For what
innumerable, pleaſing, delightſome motions do ariſe in thy ſoul all the day
long, either about <hi>unlawfull</hi> objects, or if lawfull in an <hi>inordinate</hi> and ſinfull
manner? Are not theſe more then the hairs of thy head in number? Now
concerning theſe delightfull pleaſing motions of the ſoul in a ſinfull way, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Rules,</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>That a man may be carried out in theſe delightfull objects, either by a meer
affection of complacency and pleaſure, or by an efficacious act, and purpoſe of
the will to accompliſh ſuch a ſinne, as in uncleanneſſe.</hi> The corrupt heart may
delight it ſelf in laſcivious apprehenſions, and defile it ſelf exceedingly in that
way, but yet have no efficacious will to commit the ſinne; yea (as we told
you) would not for a world commit it, either for ſhame, or for puniſhment,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:57719:252"/>
or ſome other reſpects: For ſinne hath then got ſtrong power over us; and
we are left by God, when we are boldly carried on to commit ſuch leudneſs. It
is therefore neceſſary for the ſpiritual and heart-Chriſtian, to obſerve the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as well as the later. Do there not ariſe contemplative delightſome thoughts
about ſinfull objects? Are they not rolled up and down in thy heart, though
thou haſt no purpoſe to effect them? <hi>Oh be aſhamed and bluſh to have ſuch
an impure ſoul!</hi> Is this ſoul fit for communion with God? Is this the temple
of the holy Ghoſt?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Rule</hi> 2. The <hi>object</hi> of theſe delighting, pleaſing motions, may either be the
<hi>ſinnes themſelves deſired and inclined after;</hi> or, <hi>They may be the meer thoughts
and apprehenſions of them.</hi> For the ſoul being a ſpiritual ſubſtance, hath power to
reflect upon its own acts and operations, to know it knoweth, to think what it
thinketh: And therupon, becauſe as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, <hi>Delectatio ſequitur operationem,</hi>
Delight followeth operation; we may take great pleaſure in our thoughts, and
even be drunken with delight therein. This is eſpecially to be ſeen in <hi>heretical</hi>
and erroneous perſons: Men who are proud of their opinions, their notions,
their own conceptions and inventions; What infinite pleaſure and content do
ſuch men take in the thoughts, about their, own thoughts, and apprehenſions?
More ſometimes then the greateſt Monarchs can do in their earthly greatneſs.
It behoveth therefore men of parts and gifts, men of learning and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
activity of wit to take heed of luſt within, carrying them out to pride and
delight in their own ſelves.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Rule</hi> 3. Theſe motions of delight and pleaſure in the ſoul, are of a <hi>large
extent.</hi> We are not to limit them only to <hi>bodily luſts,</hi> or <hi>ambitious deſires, for
as large as the command of God is, ſo large is this way of delightſome motions
in the ſoul by contrariety thereunto.</hi> As the Law of God is divided into two
Tables, and therein are required all the duties we own to God and man: So
likewiſe hereby are forbidden all the pleaſing luſts and thoughts of the ſoul
which oppoſe theſe duties. And if a man be a ſearcher of his own heart, he
cannot but take notice, how often theſe ſinfull motions of his ſoul, ſometimes
empty themſelves in reference to God, and ſometimes towards our neighbour.
Towards God, and thus we have delightfull motions in our own ſelf-truſting and
confidence in the <hi>creature; we love</hi> and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in <hi>humane comforts</hi> to the <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and ſhutting out of God himſelf,</hi> eſpecially in holy duties, in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his own day and Ordinances; How many pleaſing diſtracting and
wandring motions do then ſeize upon us, ſo that commonly we never find our
ſelves more moleſted by them, then when we are in a moſt heavenly and holy
manner to approach unto him? And for the duties towards our <hi>Neighbour,</hi>
there ariſe many pleaſing evil motions of ſoul, to envy at his good, to be glad
at the evil which befalleth him, to have uncharitable and ſuſpitious thoughts
towards him. Thus where ever any actual ſin may be committed either againſt
God or man, there may and do pleaſing and delightfull thoughts ariſe before, and
prepare the way for them.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>Cajetan</hi> giveth a good Rule (<hi>Summula Tit. Delectatio.</hi>) concerning
theſe motions of delight within us, that in them we are to conſider the <hi>Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
the <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the <hi>Intention</hi> about them. The <hi>occaſion:</hi> Thus if we do
put our ſelves into ſuch companies, go to ſee ſuch ſights, read ſuch books, hear
ſuch unſavoury diſcourſe, as may ſtirre up our hearts to theſe ſinfull motions,
then our ſinne is the greater, and we ſhall be found the more guilty before God.
Such is our corrupt nature, that we need not adde oil to that fire within us:
Even in lawfull and juſt duties, yea in our moſt holy and heavenly performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
theſe ſinfull motions ariſe to diſturb and diſtract our ſouls, as if <hi>mens</hi> did
come of <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, the Moon, as ſome affirm, becauſe of the divers ſhapes and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:57719:253"/>
it is often put into. We ought therefore to be farre from adding fuel
to this fire, by going to unlawfull ſights, to wicked companions, thereby to
provoke that corruption within us.</p>
                           <p>Again, We are to conſider what <hi>Liberty</hi> and power we have to ſubdue them
and repreſſe them; ſome riſe more ſuddenly then others, and ſome again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
ſo, that we have time to conſider of the danger of them, the damnable
nature of them. Now the more time we have to deliberate and to conſider about
the ſinfulneſs and wickedneſs of them, how much God is offended, how loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
and abominable they are in his eyes, and yet we ſuffer them to lodge there,
the greater is our condemnation.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Intention and end of ſuch thoughts</hi> is to be conſidered; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>cogitatio mali,</hi> is not <hi>mala cogitatio,</hi> the thought of evil is not an evil
thought. When men think of ſinne to repent of it, to deteſt it, to reform it,
ſinne is in their mind then; but becauſe there are no delightfull motions to it,
therefore it is not evil: So if a Miniſter preach againſt adultery, or any other
ſinne, he cannot but think of the nature of it, and what it is; yet becauſe his
intention in thinking of it is to make men abhorre and leave it, therefore it is
good and lawfull: So that <hi>meer thoughts about ſinne are not alwayes ſinne, but
when accompanied with ſome affections and inclinations thereunto.</hi> Onely it is
good to inform you, That ſuch is our deceitfulneſs of heart, that many times
we think it lawfull to rejoyce and delight in ſome profit and emolument that
may come by another mans ſinne, or ſome evil upon him, when indeed we are
glad of the ſin, or evil it ſelf. If a man by telling a lie ſhould ſave thy eſtate, or
life, How hard is it not to delight in the ſinne, becauſe thou haſt profit by it?
Thus unnatural children may rejoyce in the death of their parents, whereby
they come to inherit their eſtates, and yet pleaſe themſelves that they not
rejoyce in their death, but the profit that cometh thereby to them. There are
many practical inſtances in this caſe, and therefore we muſt look our hearts do
not deceive us therein. For it is very difficult to have any advantage by another
mans ſinne or evil, and not to have a ſecret and tacit will thereof. And thus much
for the Rules about delightfull motions to ſin.</p>
                           <p>We proceed to a third particular, whereby we may ſinne againſt God by
theſe motions of ſinne within us, and that is, <hi>When we are careleſſe and negligent
about them, they trouble us not, they grieve us not.</hi> How many are there that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the thoughts and motions of their ſoul, no more then the fowls that flie
over their heads? It argueth an unregenerate heart, an heart not acquainted
with the power of godlineſs, that doth not mourn and grieve under them.
How greatly was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. afflicted by them? This made
him long for Chriſt and Heaven, where he ſhould be annoyed with them no
more. This negligence about them, is that which maketh thee alſo careleſs to
repreſs and conquer them. They may lodge whole dayes and nights in thy ſoul,
and thou never ſeekeſt to expel them out. Thus thy heart is like the ſluggards
field full of bryars and thorns. Oh that God would give you ſeeing eyes and
tender hearts! then you would find that even an hair hath its ſhadow, even the
leaſt motion to ſinne hath its ſting and bitterneſs with it; and above all ſinfull
motions, look to thoſe that ariſe in thee, becauſe good things are urged and
commanded to thee. For this is the deſperate incurable evil our ſouls, that
good things ſtirre up ſinfull luſts within us, not indeed properly and directly,
but occaſionally and by accident. Thus the Apoſtle bewaileth the motions of
luſts within him from this account, <hi>Rom. 7. 8. Sinne taking occaſion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
wrought all manner of concupiſcence within him.</hi> Thus the good and
ſpiritual Law made him more carnal and ſinfull. And what is more often then
to have powerfull preaching, godly and wholſome reproofs ſtirre up the evil
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:57719:253"/>
motions of men againſt them. Thus the more remedies are applied to us, the
more corrupt we grow. We might be voluminous in this ſoul-ſearching point,
but we muſt conclude.</p>
                           <p>Let the Uſe be, Seeing that a man is thus tempted from his own luſt within
him, we cannot lay the cauſe on the Devil himſelf, though he be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter;
then it's our duty to look to what is within: Thoſe embers within us
will quickly ſet all on fire. Say not, this or that moved me, blame not this
or that eſtate, but thy corrupt luſt within. This is as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid (<hi>in</hi> Geneſ.
<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.) to be like the fool that ſtood in the Sunne bowed down, and then
complained his ſhadow was crooked. It is not thy riches, nor thy poverty,
not thy health or ſickneſs, no condition or temptation whatſoever; but the true
proper cauſe is this maternal luſt, which lieth in our boſoms. How little is this
truth attendeth unto? with the Phariſees, <hi>we more regard to cleanſe the outſide,
than the inſide,</hi> Mat. 23. 25. The miſtake herein brought thoſe many rigid and
auſiere diſciplinary wayes in Popery, as if from the externals we muſt cure the
heart, and not by curing the heart thereby cleanſe the outwards. The <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
will not ſo much as touch ſilver. The <hi>Carthuſians</hi> will not eat a bit of fleſh,
though their lives depend upon it: What folly is this? Meat and money are the
good creatures of God; if we do abuſe them, they are not to be blamed, but
our corrupt luſts within. If a whoriſh woman wear gold and precious ſtones to
allure others, they are in themſelves good, though ſhe abuſe them to an ill end:
And thus all the comforts and mercies we enjoy are Gods good gifts, and it is
not the actual abdication of the uſe of them, but the mortifying of our luſt within
that will make us pleaſe God.</p>

                        <p>As a remedy therefore to refrain from all exceſs therein, he giveth us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

that is, This is the ſumme, the main, the all in all in theſe caſes.</p>
                        <p>Then you have the Antidote it ſelf, <hi>Walk in the Spirit.</hi> The only way to

not <hi>fulfill them,</hi> which is the ſame as to walk in the fleſh, and to mind the
things of the fleſh, which thoſe that live in the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit
cannot do.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, The Apoſtle giveth a reaſon, why they are thus to give

the contrary nature and inclinations of theſe two, expreſſed in that Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> By

                        <p>Laſtly, Neither are we to underſtand this of <hi>perſons,</hi> as if the Apoſtle meant
the <hi>carnal</hi> man, and the <hi>spiritual</hi> man, as <hi>Iſaacl</hi> did <hi>Iſaac,</hi> will alwayes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
one another: For it is clear, he ſpeaketh of two principles within us, the
one whereof is <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, <hi>our whole man ſo farre as it is unregenerate,</hi> the
mind and the will as well as the affections; (for by ſinne <hi>incarnavimus animas
noſtras,</hi> as the Ancient ſaid, our ſouls are become fleſh,) <hi>and the whole man ſo
farre as he is regenerate:</hi> For this in ſeveral reſpects, a godly man is both fleſh
and Spirit.</p>
                        <p>This contrariety in their nature is declared by the effect thereof, <hi>They luſt
one againſt another:</hi> He doth not ſay, they work one againſt another, though
that be true; but the Apoſtle would direct us to the head and ſpring of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
evil or good, and that is the <hi>deſire within.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the next place, the Apoſtle amplifieth this contrary motion between the
fleſh and the Spirit from the nature of them; They are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, immediately
ſet one againſt another, even as darkneſs and light, as fire and water. Now
although it be a Rule, That contraries do expell each other; yet it is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rule, That contraries while they are <hi>in pugnâ,</hi> in fighting with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they may be together, as alſo in remiſſe degrees: And thus it is with the
godly, the fleſh and the Spirit are alwayes in conflict; Theſe are the twins in
the womb, that by their oppoſition make the godly mourn, and long for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where the fleſh ſhall be wholly overcome.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Here is the conſequent and iſſue of this Combate, <hi>So that the things
ye would not, thoſe ye do;</hi> which words are ſubject to many interpretations:
Some ſay, they are only to be interpreted as the end to which theſe contrary
principles do encline, not that they do denote the event. By the fleſh we are
carried out to this end, not to do the good things we would do; yet this event
doth not alwayes at leaſt follow, becauſe Gods Spirit worketh in us <hi>both to will
and to do;</hi> This expoſition they are the more confirmed in, becauſe in the
Greek it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which would denote the event, but <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>: This ſeemeth to

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="476" facs="tcp:57719:255"/>
ſtill there is a difference among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Interpreters: Some underſtand it of the good
will only, as if the meaning were thoſe good things you would do, the fleſh
doth hinder and retard you therein. <hi>Grotius</hi> with others that follow him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it of the <hi>evil will,</hi> in this manner, <hi>The Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi>
ſo that thoſe evil things, which otherwiſe you would doe, if the fleſh
did prevail in you, now ye cannot do. And the <hi>late Writer (Vnum Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,
cap. 7. pag.</hi> 482.) is ſo peremptory for this Expoſition, <q>That (he
ſaith) we cannot make it ſenſe elſe with what had gone before: (being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to <hi>Arminius</hi> for this Argument) For the Apoſtle bid us, <hi>Walk in the
Spirit, ſo we ſhould not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> and this is the reaſon,
<hi>Becauſe the Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi> and ſo we cannot do what that
would have us; whereas if by the fleſh we were hindred from what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
would have us do, this would directly contradict what he had ſaid before.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to anſwer this, Some read all the former verſe by a parentheſis, and make
this clauſe to belong to the precept, <hi>verſ. 16. Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall
not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh, ſo that ye cannot do thoſe things, which the
fleſh would incline you unto:</hi> But this ſeemeth too much forced. Though
therefore we underſtand it of the <hi>good will,</hi> as well as the <hi>bad,</hi> yet the ſenſe
runneth ſmoothly; neither is this brought as a reaſon of the later part, <hi>You
ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> for ſo it would have ſome apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
but of the duty commanded, why they ſhould walk in the Spirit.
For if they do not, ſuch is the contrariety of the fleſh to every thing that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
that if yeelded unto, it will carry you away to act thoſe luſts, which
otherwiſe you would not do, and ſo the connexion is very harmonious. But
for my part, I think this muſt be underſtood generally, both of the good will, and bad alſo. For the Apoſtle having named two contrary principles, and
their luſtings one to another, there is no reaſon to limit it to one; but that we
underſtand it thus, That even in had things a godly man is not carried out with
the full command of the fleſh, but the Spirit of God doth in a great meaſure
check and prohibit it. And alſo in good things, though the Spirit of God doth
enlighten and enlarge the ſoul, yet the fleſh doth ſomething retard, and by its
oppoſition, cauſeth that we cannot do holy things with that fulneſs, purity and
perfection as we would do.</p>
                        <p>Thus you have this noble Text explained, which will afford excellent practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
matter, concerning that property of original ſinne, that it remaineth in
ſome meaſure even in the moſt holy, and that therefore there is no perfection
in this life. None is all ſpirit without any fleſh at all in them. Therefore the
<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> in the Text may have its emphaſis, <hi>The ſame things ye cannot do, that
ye would.</hi> For what godly man doth not feel, that it is not the ſame prayer, the
ſame faith, the ſame repentance he deſired? The duty like <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s veſſel
cometh to be marred upon the wheel in the very doing; ſo much deadneſs, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,
lukewarmneſs and ſenſleſneſs of ſpirit appeareth, that he wondereth
to ſee how different the duty exerciſed is from the deſire and purpoſe in his ſoul.
From the words thus declared obſerve,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That original ſinne remaineth in every man, though never ſo godly in ſome
meaſure, whereby there is a combate between the fleſh and the Spirit, ſo that
we cannot do any holy duty perfectly in this life.</hi> I limit my Diſcourſe only to
the good will in the Text, not the bad, becauſe that is moſt homogeneous with
my ſubject. And beſides, The <hi>Pelagians</hi> calumniated this Doctrine of original
ſinne, as a diſcouragement unto holineſs, and that hereby perfection could
never be attained, becauſe this ſinne is ſaid to have ſome being and working in
the moſt holy, though it have not dominion. It is from original ſinne, that the
moſt holy men find a combat within them more or leſſe; that alwayes in this
life they find a need both of pardon of ſinne, and of the righteouſneſs of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:57719:255"/>
Chriſt, which if any deny, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did, we will not believe them with
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> in that they ſay, but attribute it to their arrogancy and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
pretending more holineſs to the world then they have, for their ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
or elſe to their ſtupidity and ſenſleſneſs, not feeling what doth indeed
annoy and oppoſe the Spirit of God; and truly they who have not the Spirit of
God abiding in them, How can they diſcern of ſuch a combate? That moral
conflict which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh of in the incontinent perſon, he may perceive
within himſelf, but this of the Spirit and the fleſh, <hi>He cannot know, becauſe it is
ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>

                           <p>THe only way to comprehend the latitude of this excellent truth about the
<hi>Conflict between fleſh and spirit in the true believer, becauſe of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne ſtill adhering to him,</hi> is to lay down ſeveral Propoſitions, wherein we
may at the ſame time aſſert truth, and obviate ſome error.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Original ſinne doth greatly differ from actual ſinne in this particular, that
when an actual ſinne is committed, there remaineth no more but the guilt of it,
which upon repentance by juſtification is wholly removed away, and thus an actual
ſinne is as if it had never been; but in original ſinne, although the guilt of it be
taken away, yet the nature of it abideth ſtill, though not with ſuch dominion as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it did.</hi> It is true the Schoolmen, except <hi>Biel</hi> and ſome others, ſay, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſinnes leave a <hi>macula,</hi> a blot or defilement upon the ſoul, as well as a <hi>reatus,</hi>
or guilt; and what this <hi>macula</hi> is, they are different in their explication of:
but we muſt neceſſarily grant, that every actual ſinne doth defile the ſoul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
it either of the beauty it hath, or ought to have, but yet ſtill the act of
ſin is paſſed away, whereas in original ſin, the ſin it ſelf doth ſtill continue, by
which it is, that though to thoſe who are in Chriſt, there is no actual condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet there is that which is damnable in them; inſomuch as without Chriſt there
is a wo to their moſt holy and praiſe-worthy actions. It is true, the Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
look upon this as <hi>non</hi>-ſenſe, or a contradiction, that ſin ſhould be in a man,
and not make him guilty; as if actual condemnation might not be ſeparated
from ſinne, though indeed the deſert of condemnation cannot. It cannot be
but whereſoever ſinne is it doth deſerve hell, it hath enough in it to provoke
God to wrath, but yet when humbled for and withſtood, then through the
bloud of Chriſt, this actual guilt, though not the potential one, is taken away.
Yea original ſinne doth not only differ from actual ſinne, but alſo habitual, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
though habitual ſinnes do abide in a man, yet when a man is regenerated,
and made a new creature, all the habits of ſinne are expelled; for if the habits
of ſinne and grace ſhould abide together, then a man might at the ſame time
be holy and unholy, the ſonne of God, and the ſonne of the Devil, ſeeing
our denomination is from the habits that are within us; therefore that cannot
be. But though in our Regeneration the habits of ſinne are removed, yet it is
not ſo with original corruption, that is not an acquired, but an innate habit of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:57719:256"/>
ſinning within us. Thus our original corruption is farre more pertinaciouſly
cleaving unto us, then any habits or cuſtoms of ſinne can be, though of never
ſo long continuance.</p>

                           <p>IN the ſecond place, <hi>That is a falſe poſition which the Remonſtrants have</hi> (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.
Cenſurae cap. 11. pag. 128.) <hi>that the difficulty which new converts have
to leave their former luſts, doth ariſe chiefly from their former cuſtome and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
in wayes of impiety, not from original ſinne.</hi> For they diſtinguiſh of godly
men ſuch as are incipients, new beginners, that are but newly converted unto
Chriſt, and theſe they ſay have a great conflict within them, they have much
ado to leave their former luſts and impieties they have been accuſtomed unto:
and then there are the <hi>Adulti,</hi> ſuch who are proficients, and grown up; now
theſe they ſay may ariſe to ſuch a meaſure of holineſs, as to be without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
at all between fleſh and ſpirit, or to feel it very rarely: but that is directly
to contradict this Text, which ſpeaketh it univerſally of all that have the Spirit
of God in them while in this life, they do meet with oppoſition not only from the
devil without, but the fleſh within: Therefore they would elude this Text, as if it
did not mean an actual reluctancy or luſting againſt one another, but only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential,
that it is the nature of the fleſh and Spirit thus to oppoſe one another,
for this is ſay they againſt the nature of habits, ſeeing it is the property of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
to make the will readily and willingly will and do thoſe things, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
were grievous and troubleſome, but the Scripture ſpeaketh of the actual
reluctancy; it doth not ſay it may or it can, but <hi>it doth luſt;</hi> and as for habits,
though we grant when theſe ſupernatural habits of grace are infuſed into the
ſoul, we are carried out with readineſs, delight, and willingneſs in thoſe holy
duties which formerly were tedious and grievous unto us; yet becauſe neither
the habits of grace are perfect within us, nor the acts that flow from them,
therefore it is that there is a mixture of our droſs with the ſpirits gold. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the habits of grace are immediately inſpired or infuſed from God, and
ſo as they come from him are perfect; yet becauſe that is a true rule, <hi>Quicquid
recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis;</hi> whatſoever is received, is received
according to the capacity and qualification of the ſubject: Hence it is, that
theſe habits of grace are <hi>imperfect as received and ſeated in us;</hi> and whereas
again they reply, that ſuppoſe this Text be underſtood of actual reluctancy,
yet it is not generally to be extended to all, but limited to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who
were but new converts, but beginners, and therefore had this fight within them;
that is alſo falſe: The Apoſtle ſaith the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the
Spirit againſt the fleſh in the general: <hi>It is an univerſal Propoſition,</hi> neither is
it any more to be limited to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> then the duty enjoyned, which is
to walk in the Spirit; ſo that as the duty belongeth to every godly man, the
reaſon likewiſe muſt, and therefore the Apoſtle doth not ſay, the fleſh luſteth
againſt the Spirit in you, (they put (<hi>in vobis</hi>) into the Text) but ſpeaketh uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
of all that have the Spirit of God: Beſides this Text oppoſeth them,
for grant theſe <hi>Galathians</hi> were new converts, yet the cauſe of the combate
within them, is not attributed to their former cuſtome of impiety as they would
have it, but to the fleſh, which is original ſinne within them, when therefore
a man is truly converted, that difficulty to leave his former luſts doth not ariſe
becauſe the habits of ſinne do ſtill abide in him, but becauſe original ſinne is
ſtill living in us; and therefore according to the greater or leſſer meaſure of
grace healing and ſanctifying of us, ſo we find the greater oppoſition in parting
with the ſinnes we formerly committed.</p>

                           <p>WE are to lay it down for a certain foundation to build upon (as hath
formerly been delivered) <hi>That this spiritual conflict was not in the
ſtate of integrity. Adam</hi> before his fall could not find ſuch a rebellion in him;
for if ſo, this would greatly have interrupted all his bleſſedneſs; and withall
ſuch a duell within him, and that neceſſarily flowing from his creation, would
have redounded <hi>to the great diſhonour of God his Maker.</hi> Now the Adverſaries
of original ſinne, whether <hi>Papiſts, Remonſtrants</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> who do uſually
traduce the orthodox Doctrine about it, as if horribly injurious to God, do in
this particular <hi>farre tranſcend all ſuch ſuppoſed reflections, either upon the juſtice
or mercy of God.</hi> For they do boldly affirm, That by the very natural conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of man, there is a neceſſary conflict between the rational and ſenſitive
part; only ſay the Papiſts, original righteouſneſs (which the <hi>Socinian</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
as much as original ſinne) did keep down this repugnancy, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi>
had not any actual rebellion within, <hi>though it was there potentially and radically.</hi>
Thus <hi>Soto</hi> (though <hi>Stapleton</hi> fluctuateth, and ſeemeth to be his Adverſary therin)
expreſly affirmeth (<hi>Lib. de Naturâ &amp; Gratiâ, c.</hi> 3.) that the conflict mentioned
by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. is <hi>Homini â naturâ ingenita,</hi> inbred in the very nature of
a man, which he would prove from a philoſophical Diſcourſe out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
who divideth man into two parts: his rational and ſenſitive, adding that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
part obeyeth the rational, not deſpotically, as ſervants who have no right
of their own do to their maſters (for ſo the members of the body only do
ſerve the mind) but politically and civilly, as a Citizen doth his Prince, in
whoſe power it is to diſobey. But as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew nothing of mans creation,
or the Image of God put upon him, nor of his fall, and the utter depravation
of mans ſoul thereby, ſo it would be abſurd to runne to his darkneſs to fetch
light about theſe things. Hence alſo it is, that the ſame Author (<hi>Cap.</hi> 13.) in
another place, compareth man fallen with man ſtanding to ſome weighty piece,
that hangeth on high, but is hindred that it cannot fall; and the ſame piece,
when the impediment is removed. For as ſuch a piece of timber had the ſame
proneneſs to fall to the ground, while it was hindred, as when the obſtacle was
removed, only it did not actually fall: Thus man abiding in his ſtate of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
had this principle within, to carry him more affectionately to ſenſible
things then ſpiritual; only original righteouſneſs did ſtop and hinder the actual
motions thereof. It is true, that all Papiſts do not aſſert this repugnancy from
our primitive conſtitution: For <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the place doth note truly, <hi>Sermo
eſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith he. The ſpeech is of the fleſh, as infected with original ſinne, for
thence the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, not from the primary Creation. Yea
their admired <hi>Thomas a Kempis, (Pag.</hi> 77.) for his practical devotion, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency had not this conflict. And no wonder
that Papiſts thus dogmatize, when <hi>Arminius,</hi> who uſeth to be very wary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was the firſt that was to broach thoſe dangerous errours, the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
to uſe a Serpent, not an Aſs, becauſe he was more ſubtil then other
beaſts of the field, yet aſſerteth that the inclination to ſinne was in <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his fall, <hi>Licet non ita vehemens &amp; inordinata ut nunc eſt,</hi> although not ſo
vehement and inordinate as now it is. It is true, the whole Paragraph is put by
way of queſtion, but in the procedure thereof, this is ſpoken affirmatively,
(<hi>Articul. perpendendi, cap. de peccato originis.</hi>) And with the <hi>Socinians</hi> nothing
is more ordinary then to affirm ſuch a rebellion in man, and that ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
that from this they conclude, <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne, it was from his concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
that he did break the Law of God; Yea ſome are not afraid to attribute
this repugnancy and conflict to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if when he prayed, <hi>Father, if it be
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:57719:257"/>
poſſible let this Cup paſſe away,</hi> that this came from the Agony between the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
and ſenſitive part within him. It is wonder that theſe do not alſo hold,
that it will continue in <hi>Heaven</hi> alſo: ſo that as long as man hath a ſoul and a
body, this oppoſition cannot be removed; but ſurely the naming of this to
tender hearts and ears is confutation enough. For is not this <hi>truly and properly
to make God the Author of ſinne,</hi> that he put a rebellious thorn in our ſides at
firſt, and that becauſe we are his creatures, made of a ſoul and a body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt neceſſarily be divided within our ſelves. Thus thoſe who charge
original ſinne with <hi>Manichiſm</hi> do herein exceed the <hi>Manichees</hi> themſelves;
for they attribute this evil in a man to an <hi>evil principle;</hi> but theſe make the good
and holy God to be the <hi>Author</hi> of this rebellion. Neither is it any evaſion to
ſay, This rebellion of the ſenſitive part is <hi>no ſinne,</hi> unleſs it be conſented unto;
for it is ſuch which is <hi>contrary to the Law of God,</hi> it is to be <hi>reſiſted</hi> and <hi>fought
againſt.</hi> And certainly that demonſtrateth the evil nature thereof. <hi>Luther</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſpeaks of a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> which maketh this concupiſcence to be a natural
good in a man, as it is in the fire to burn, or the Sunne to ſhine: But certainly
ſuch qualities or actions are not to be reſiſted, or fought againſt, as theſe are;
How can that be good, which is confeſſed to be a ſinne, if conſented
unto?</p>

                           <p>FIfthly, <hi>In natural and corrupt men, there is no ſenſe or feeling of any ſuch
conflict.</hi> They never groan and mourn under ſuch wreſtlings and agonies
within them, and the reaſon is, becauſe they are altogether fleſh, and fleſh doth
not oppoſe fleſh; neither is Satan ſet againſt Satan. It is true, there is in ſome
natural vicious men, ſometimes a combate between their conſcience and their
appetite; their hearts carry them on violently to ſinne, but their conſciences
do check them, and they feel a remorſe within them, but this is farre different
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:57719:257"/>
from that ſpiritual conflict, which the Apoſtle doth here deſcribe, and is to be
found only in ſuch men, who have the Spirit of God: No wonderthen if there
be ſo many who look upon this as a figment, if ſo many even learned men
write and ſpeak ſo ignorantly and adviſedly about it; for this truth is beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by experience: It's not the <hi>Theologia ratiocinativa,</hi> but <hi>experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis,</hi>
as <hi>Gerſon</hi> divideth Divinity, that will bring us to a full knowledge of this,
It cannot then but be expected that you ſhould ſee men live at eaſe, and have
much quietneſs and ſecurity in their own breaſts, thanking God, as if their
ſouls, hearts, and all were good within them, all were as they deſire it;
for the ſtrong man the Devil keepeth all quiet; fleſh would not oppoſe fleſh:
It is true, one ſinne may oppoſe another, covetoufneſs; drunkenneſs; and ſo
a man who would commit them both be divided within himſelf; one ſinne
draweth one way, and another ſinne the other way: but ſtill in the general
here is an agreement; all is ſinne, all tendeth one way ſtill, and therefore is
not like this combate in the Text; but of this more in its time.</p>

                           <p>SIxthly, <hi>In all regenerate perſons though never ſo highly ſanctified, there is a

which this may be one; <q>That making <hi>four</hi> ranks, or claſſes of Chriſtians, he
apprehendeth the firſt, to be ſuch who have attained to ſo high a degree of
ſanctification, that they conſult, and deliberate of nothing, but from the
habit of grace that is within them; and that this conflict within a man, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be referred to the legal work upon a man, then the Evangelical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
we are put into: hence he underſtands this Text not univerſally, but
particularly of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who were then in that ſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> a legal
one, not Evangelical, which he thinketh the next Verſe will confirme, where
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law:</hi> now of

that in this life, he ſhould attain to that perfection, which other believers
have only in heaven, none might find fault herein. The general rules he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon (and others though diſclaimed by him,) is, becauſe there are many
places of Scripture, which ſhew that ſome godly perſons are victorious and
tryumphing above this conflict; as when this Apoſtle ſaith afterwards, <hi>ver.
24. They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts
thereof,</hi> and Rom. 8. 2. <hi>The law of the Spirit of life in Jeſus Chriſt, hath made
me free from the law of ſin and death:</hi> So that they conclude it injurious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious
to <hi>Paul,</hi> reproachfull to the grace of the Goſpel, and a palpable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to ſinne and wickedneſs, to interpret the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Rom.</hi> of a
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:57719:258"/>
regenerate perſon:</q> But becauſe this is a truth of ſo ſpecial concernement, we
ſhall take theſe things in a more particular conſideration; for it would be found
an heavy ſinne lying upon moſt orthodox Teachers in the Reformed Church,
if they have conſtantly preached ſuch a Doctrine, as is injurious to Gods grace,
and an incentive to ſinne, as alſo ſlothfulneſs and negligence in holy duties:
for the preſent this Text will bear us out ſufficiently, that where ever the Spirit
of God is in perſons while in the way to heaven, they have a contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of the fleſh within them, whereby they are more humbled in themſelves,
and do the more earneſtly make their applications to the throne of grace; and
that all have ſuch a conflict within them, may appear by theſe following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
yea we may with <hi>Luther</hi> ſay, ſo farre is it that any do attain to ſuch a
meaſure of grace, as to be without this combate, that the more holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
any are, the more <hi>ſenſible</hi> they are of it; for they have <hi>more</hi> illumination,
and ſo diſcover the <hi>exactneſs</hi> and ſpiritual latitude of the law, more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they did, and alſo their hearts are more <hi>tender,</hi> whereby they grow
more ſenſible even of the leaſt weight of any ſinful motion, though never ſo
tranſient. It is true the godly do grow in grace, they get more maſtery and
power over the luſtings of ſinne within, yet withall they grow in light and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
about holineſs, they ſee it a more exact and perfect thing then they
thought of, they find the Law of God to be more comprehenſive then they were
aware of; and therefore they are ready to cry out, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> when ready to
ſuffer, <hi>Nunc incipio eſſe Chriſtians:</hi> Oh me never godly, but beginning to
be godly; I believe, but how great is my unbelief! This <hi>Paul</hi> declareth,
<hi>Phil. 3. 12. Not as if I had already attained, either were already perfect, but I
follow after,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> is farre from owning ſuch commendations which
happily others may put upon him. It is true indeed <hi>Amyraldus</hi> denyeth, that any
are abſolutely perfect; but yet he goeth beyond the bounds of truth, in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
too much to <hi>Paul,</hi> or other Apoſtles, which will appear,</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the moſt holy that are, have uſed all. meanes to mortifie and keep
down the cauſe of theſe ſinful motions;</hi> If they did not continually throw water
as it were upon thoſe ſparks within, the moſt holy man would quickly be in a
flame. Even this Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> doth not he confeſs this of himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor. 9.
27. I keep down my body, and bring it into ſubjection,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not mean
the body, as it is a meer natural ſubſtance; for the glorified Saints will not keep
down their bodyes. but as it is corrupted, and made a ready inſtrument to ſin:
for though the Apoſtle call it not <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

but ſuppoſe one another, as <hi>Rom. 6. 12. Let not ſinne reign in your mortal body,</hi>
and it is a very frigid and forced Expoſition of <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> as <hi>if the Apoſtle

                                 </gap>s for the Goſpels ſake.</hi> For this was not <hi>Paul</hi>'s voluntary keeping
down of his body; thoſe perſecutions and hardſhips to his body, were againſt
his will, though he ſubmitted to them, when by Gods providence he was
called thereunto; but he ſpeaketh here of that, which he did <hi>readily</hi> and <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily,</hi>
leſt from within ſhould ariſe ſuch motions to ſinne, as might deſtroy
him; yea it is plain that even in <hi>Paul</hi> there was a danger of the breakings forth
of ſuch luſts, becauſe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. God did in a ſpecial manner ſuffer him <hi>to be
buffetted and exerciſed by Satan, that he might not be lifted up through pride:</hi>
neither is this any excuſe to ſay with <hi>Amyraldus, That ſuch ſinnes are apt to
breed in the moſt excellent dispoſitions;</hi> for it is acknowledged by all, that ſuch
ſinnes have <hi>more</hi> guilt in them then bodily ſinnes, though not ſuch infamy and
diſgrace amongſt men; <hi>Luther</hi> calleth them the <hi>ſublimia peccat;</hi> the ſublime and
high ſins, ſuch the Devil was guilty of, and they were the cauſe of his final
overthrow and damnation: If then the moſt godly have uſed all means to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
ſinne within them; it is plain they found a combate; and that if ſinne
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:57719:258"/>
were let alone, it would quickly get the upper hand.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>That there is a conflict of ſinne appeareth in thoſe duties enjoyned to
all the godly, that they watch and pray, that they put on the whole armour of
Chriſt.</hi> Yea the Diſciples are commanded <hi>to take heed of drunkenneſs and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting,
and the cares of this world,</hi> Luke 21. 34. and generally <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles
are full of admonitions and exhortations to <hi>give all diligence in the wayes of
holineſſe:</hi> eſpecially that command is very obſervable, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1. Having
theſe promiſes, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirits, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
holineſſe in the fear of God.</hi> Here you ſee both fleſh and ſpirit, that is the
rational and ſenſitive part, have filthineſs; and that thoſe who are truly godly
are to be continually cleanſing away this filthineſs, and to perfect what is out
of order. What godly man is there, that can ſay, This command doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to me, I am above it, I need it not? No leſſe conſiderable is that command
of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. <hi>Dearly beloved, I beſeech you as pilgrims and ſtrangers,
abſtain from fleſhly luſts, which warre againſt the ſoul.</hi> Not as if this were wholly
parallel with my Text, as <hi>Carthuſian</hi> is ſaid to bring it in, thereby proving that
by <hi>fleſh</hi> is meant the <hi>body,</hi> and by <hi>spirit</hi> the <hi>ſoul;</hi> but onely it ſheweth, that no
godly man in this life is freed from a militant condition, and that with his own
fleſh, his own ſelf, which maketh the combate to be the more dangerous. For
this cauſe <hi>David,</hi> though a man after Gods own heart, though Gods ſervant
in a ſpecial conſideration, yet prayeth <hi>Pſal. 19. 13. Keep back thy ſervant from
preſumptuous ſins;</hi> which expreſſion denoteth, that even a godly man hath luſt
within him, that would carry him out like an untamed horſe to preſumptuous
ſins, did not the Lord keep him back. But we need not bring more reaſons to
confirm that which experience doth ſo ſadly teſtifie.</p>

                           <p>THe next Propoſition that may give light to the weighty truth about the
ſpiritual conflict that is in the moſt regenerate perſons is this, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the reaſons formerly produced, and many others which might be named,
there are two famous places of Scripture, which do moſt ſignally and eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declare ſuch a combate in the moſt holy men. The firſt is this of my Text,
which hath ſufficiently been explained and vindicated from corrupt Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And truly the light of this Text ſhineth ſo clearly, that there are very
few who are not convinced that this ſpeaketh of the fight which regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
find in themſelves between thoſe two contrary principles of the Spirit and
fleſh which are within them. The ſecond place, which doth ſo firmly eſtabliſh
ſuch a conflict in thoſe who by grace are made new creatures, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. from <hi>v.</hi>
14. to the end of the Chapter, where we have a moſt palpable delineation of this
duel that is fought in the inwards of a godly man; but that place is not ſo freely
conſented unto, as this Text I am upon.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="484" facs="tcp:57719:259"/>
Now becauſe the clearing of that is of ſpecial uſe, and becauſe it is of ſuch
affinity with my Text, I ſhall inlarge my ſelf (for I will not call it a digreſſion)
in the full explication of that part of the Chapter, ſhewing, <hi>How that it muſt
be a regenerate perſon, and him only of whom thoſe things are there ſpoken.</hi> And
you will find that the diſtinct opening of that portion of Scripture will afford
us many neceſſary things both for Inſtruction, Conſolation and Admonition,
and all immediately adhering to this point I am now upon. This I intend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
in ſeveral particulars, which will be as ſo many branches growing from
the flock of that Propoſition I have already named. And</p>
                           <p>Firſt, You are to know, that the Diſcourſe which <hi>Paul</hi> there uſeth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the combate within himſelf, is by ſome interpreted, as if <hi>Paul,</hi> though he
name himſelf, Yet <hi>doth not mean himſelf,</hi> while <hi>regenerated, but while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi>
So that (ſay they) <hi>Paul</hi> doth therein take upon himſelf the perſon of
one that is not yet in the ſtate of grace. This they conceive muſt neceſſarily be
ſo, becauſe ſuch a perſon is ſaid to be <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ſold under ſinne.</hi> The fleſh is
<hi>alwayes</hi> ſaid to have the better, whereas regenerate perſons they have crucified
the fleſh and the Spirit; <hi>And the Law of the Spirit of life hath freed them from
the Law of ſinne and death,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. Onely when they expound it of an
unregenerate perſon, they diſtinguiſh of ſuch,</p>
                           <p>1. One who is <hi>groſly ignorant and prophane, wallowing in his ſinnes in a moſt
ſenſleſſe and ſtupid manner, whoſe conſcience are wholly dead within them;</hi> and
ſuch are carried out to ſinne with all impetuouſneſs, having no check or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
of conſcience within them, of ſuch the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak.
But</p>
                           <p>2. There are others who are in a <hi>Legal ſtate, under the powerfull convictions
and operations of the Law,</hi> as <hi>Amyraldus</hi> expreſſeth it: Men who beſides the
meer knowledge of the Law have by the efficacy of Gods Spirit the convincing
power of it ſo ſet home, that now their inlightned minds do greatly incline
them to that which is good; but becauſe their hearts are not ſanctified, their
affections are not mortified, therefore theſe luſts do hurry them away againſt
thoſe legal convictions that are upon them; or as <hi>Arminius</hi> expreſſeth it (<hi>in
cap. 7. ad Rom.</hi>) not in a much different way, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of one,
who is in ſome preparatory way to converſion. By the Law he is ſo farre
wrought upon, that he is afraid becauſe of his ſinnes, he cryeth out of them,
mourneth becauſe of them, hath many wiſhes and deſires: Oh that I could
leave theſe luſts, I do not like or conſent to ſuch evil things that I do! Thus
this perſon is ſuppoſed to have a ſervile fear, which is initial to the work of
converſion. And this frame of ſpirit, although it be not regeneration, yet is
to be reckoned among the good and ſpiritual gifts of God. <q>This (ſay they)
is the direct caſe of that perſon, who is here deſcribed by <hi>Paul;</hi> and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but that many of the Ancients, and ſome later Writers have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it of a man under ſuch legal convictions.</q> And although the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
boaſted, <q>That all Eccleſiaſtical Writers did interpret it of ſuch a perſon,
yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> oppoſeth them therein, inſtancing in ſome, who did underſtand it
of a perſon regenerated.</q> It is true, <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, while younger, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it of an unregenerate perſon; <q>I underſtood it (ſaith he) in that
manner, or rather I did not underſtand it.</q> But when he came to be elder and
more exerciſed in the Scripture &amp; other Writers, then he was compelled to yeeld
to the truth, and to interpret it of a perſon regenerate; ſo that they caluminate
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> who make him flie to this Interpretation out of the heat of his Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with <hi>Pelagians,</hi> taking this ſenſe (though formerly he had done the other) as
being more ſubſervient to his preſent intereſt; for he attributeth his change of
mind to the truth of God in other Scriptures, as alſo to the light he had from
the tractates of other learned men. Eſpecially thoſe places compelled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:57719:259"/>
him, as he ſaith, (<hi>viz) Now I no longer do it, but ſinne within me, and I
delight in the Law of God in the inward man.</hi> He that delighteth doth it not for
fear of puniſhment, but love of righteouſneſs. <hi>Vide</hi> Auguſt. <hi>lib. 1. Retract.

We grant indeed that there is ſuch a legal ſtate in which ſome men are, that
there are ſome who are miſerably divided between their enlightned conſciences,
and their corrupt luſts, ſo <hi>that they do the they would not do.</hi> Yea the
godly themſelves, though they have a ſuperiour and more ſubline combate;
yet becauſe they have an unregenerate part within them, therefore they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have even this conflict between their conſciences, and ſome importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
corruptions; but this is not remarkable in them comparatively to the
other.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond place, There are others who do zealouſly contend, that that
diſcourſe cannot be applied to any, but a regenerate perſon; and to underſtand
it otherwiſe would be to plunge the godly in a deep gulph of diſcouragements,
and to attribute ſuch things to unregenerate perſons, which thoſe that are truly
ſanctified cannot go beyond; And this way <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and others of old do, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
go. Yea moſt of the Popiſh Interpreters, <hi>Eſtius, Contzen, Pererius,

alſo generally, and the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> yea moſt Proteſtant Writers. Even
<hi>Muſculus,</hi> whom the adverſaries of this Interpretation do ſo much alledge in
this point, and labour to decline all ſuſpicion by his name, yet doth clearly and
fully expound it of a man truly regenerated and converted, but in the loweſt
degree and initials of grace; although in the loweſt form, yet ſanctified and
regenerated he confeſſeth him to be. <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Amyraldus</hi> have indeed in
a peculiar manner ſet themſelves againſt this Expoſition. Yea there is an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Writer,</hi> who goeth ſo high, as to call the explication of this portion of
Scripture, as ſpoken in the perſon of a regenerate man, <hi>An encouragement
of an evil life, and a ſcorn caſt upon the holy Ghoſt;</hi> yea that it is <hi>verbum dictum
contra Spiritum ſanctum. (Vnum Neceſſarium,</hi> chap. 7. pag. 456.) But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he followeth <hi>Arminius,</hi> out of whom alſo he ſeemeth to borrow all that he
hath in this point of any appearing ſtrength and validity. <hi>In cap. 7. ad Rom.</hi>
where he would have it conſidered, whether this fight deſcribed here in the
Text, can be attributed to the Spirit of God, <hi>Citra apertam gratiae Chriſti, &amp;

But concerning this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againſt knowledge in a regenerate perſon, as alſo the collation of him with
an incontinent perſon more hereafter. Only by the way we may wonder, why
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:57719:260"/>
the above mentioned <hi>Annotatour</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> on this place, is ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to prove this paſſage cannot be meant of a regenerate perſon, from <hi>verſe</hi>
the eighth and the ninth in this Chapter, where it's ſaid, <hi>Sinne wrought all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of concupiſcence in him, that ſinne revived and he died.</hi> For ſurely he cannot
but know, That none of the Diſſenters from him in this Expoſition, do apply
thoſe verſes to a regenerate man; <hi>but that the application to ſuch a perſon begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at the fourteenth verſe,</hi> or elſe as <hi>Calvin, at the fifteenth verſe;</hi> But it is not
ſo material to know what men ſay, as what may be evinced out of the Chapter
it ſelf. Only we may adde, That the <hi>Socinian</hi> is likewiſe very ſtiff and zealous
in the Interpretation of this Chapter concerning a <hi>non</hi>-regenerate perſon. Yea
the <hi>Polonian</hi> Knight, that writeth the life of <hi>Socinus,</hi> would have us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a wonderfull work of God, convincing an eminent man of this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for thus he relateth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. <q>That <hi>anno</hi> 1585. in the Synod of <hi>Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
the opinion of <hi>Socinus</hi> concerning the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
agitated; and that one <hi>Nicolaus Zitinius,</hi> being one of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
who oppoſed the <hi>Socinian</hi> Expoſition, was deſired to explain that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
contrary to the mind of <hi>Socinus;</hi> which he ſtoutly managed, till he came
to thoſe words, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and then ſtanding like a
man amazed; What is that benefit (ſaith he) which drew from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſo great thanks? Was it that he was of neceſſity detained in ſuch a ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of ſinne? Certainly, I cannot believe ſuch a thing; and thereupon gave
thanks to God, for the light ſhining upon him, and freeing him from his
errour, and afterwards entred upon a contrary way of explaining it to the
amazement of his own party.</q> But it had been well, if this writer had ſet down
the reaſons which made ſuch a change in that man.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>We cannot ſay it is hereſie and an errour in fundamentals, to expound
this place of an unregenerate perſon; yet as the grounds and reaſons may be, ſuch an
expoſition may be either heretical, or bordering thereupon.</hi> For there are <hi>two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
which may be ſuppoſed, upon which the Expoſition of this Diſcourſe
concerning an unregenerate perſon may be built; for either ſome will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it of a regenerate perſon, <hi>Becauſe they think it oppoſeth perfection in
this life,</hi> whereas they think a man may and ought to be altogether pure and
without ſinne in this life; or elſe they do acknowledge the imperfection of out
regeneration, and the reliques of original ſinne abiding in us, whereby we are
not able to anſwer the purity and holineſs of the Law: <hi>Only they think this is not
a proper place to prove ſuch a truth, but is rather injurious to the grace of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in believers.</hi> And in the number of theſe later <hi>Arminius</hi> doth acknowledge
himſelf: Now if ſuch men be real in what they ſay, and do not ſecretly nouriſh
ſome monſter within, till they have a fit time to bring it forth, they are not
much to be blamed. For as long as they agree in the true Doctrine, though
they differ in the Texts, that do prove it, that is not ſo material. Certainly <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
was moſt unjuſtly traduced by <hi>Hunnius</hi> the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> for <hi>Judaizing</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Trinity; yet he did not think that Doctrine was to be proved out of
every Text, that the Ancients did make uſe of. But then to deny the expoſition
of this place concerning a regenerate perſon, <hi>Becauſe they hold perfection in this
life, and an immunity from ſinne, for which end the</hi> Pelagians <hi>of old did ſeem to
oppoſe it; yea and that this perfection was to be obtained by our own free-will, this
may juſtly be looked upon as heretical,</hi> Upon which account <hi>Caſtalio</hi> is inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for he interpreteth it of an unregenerate man, only ſubject to the Law,
meerly to eſtabliſh <hi>perfection;</hi> affirming, that the old man is <hi>wholly</hi> crucified in
this life, denying Chriſts imputed righteouſneſs, and affirming men may be
without ſinne. (<hi>De Juſtific.</hi> pag. 67. <hi>&amp; frequenter alibi.</hi>) This is certain that
the true Expoſition of this place doth powerfully overthrow the Doctrine of
perfection in this life: For if a <hi>Paul</hi> doth find this civil warre within himſelf; if
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57719:260"/>
                              <hi>Paul</hi> creep thus upon the ground comparatively to the admirable holineſs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Law, who then may not have cauſe to be humbled for that ſpiritual
agony he feeleth within himſelf?</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>Although we affirm this later part of the Chapter is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of a regenerate perſon, yet we alſo acknowledge, that a Miniſter is to
manage this truth with much wiſdom and dexterity, that ſo the Doctrine of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in regenerate perſons, may not be an occaſion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ull men a ſleep in their
lazineſſe, that hereby they do not content themſelves with incompleat and ſluggiſh
wiſhes in the wayes of holineſſe.</hi> If any do abuſe this Doctrine to lukewarmneſs
or indulgence in ſinfull wayes, ſaying, their eſtate is like <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>the evil they
would not do, they do:</hi> This is not the fault of the Doctrine, but either of the
Miniſter, who doth not wiſely diſpenſe it; or of the hearer, who doth wilfully
ſuck poiſon out of the ſweet herb: Even as the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel,
and Gods grace, may be abuſed to licentiouſneſs. It is true, that the proper
character of Chriſtianity is, <hi>That it is an acknowledgement of the truth, which is
after godlineſſe,</hi> Tit. 1. 1. And certainly there is no point may more quicken
up to godlineſs, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ur on the moſt holy to greater growth in piety, then this
truth about the <hi>imperfection</hi> of the graces, that are in the beſt; and alſo that we
have a treacherous enemy within us (the reliques of original ſinne) which
without daily watching and praying, will quickly plunge us into confuſion,
Now the Miniſter of Chriſt will ſo handle this Expoſition, though of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
perſon, very profitably and advantagiouſly to the increaſe of godlineſs, if
he adde theſe qualifications to his Interpretation:</p>
                           <p>1. That the evil which this perſon is ſaid to do, is not to be underſtood of
<hi>groſſe and enormieus crimes, but partly of the very motions to ſinne within us, and
ſometimes a conſent thereunto, and (it may fall out ſo, as to be) an acting of them
in our lives; but this is not of groſſe ſinnes, or if of a foul ſinne, yet not continued
in, but with repentance and greater hatred recovered out of it.</hi> Unleſſe the
Preacher do thus limit his Expoſition, he leaveth the battlements without rails,
he doth not fence againſt the pit wherein ſome may fall. Let no man therefore
think that this paſſage of <hi>Pauls</hi> is to be extended to <hi>groſſe</hi> ſinnes, as if many
prophane ſinners, who <hi>ſinne,</hi> and their conſciences <hi>check</hi> them, and then they
ſinne again and have <hi>remorſe</hi> again, could take any comfort from theſe places,
as if they might ſay with <hi>Paul, It is not I, but ſinne that dwelleth in me; The evil
that I would not, that I grieve for,</hi> in the temptation, I do: Oh take heed of
abuſing the holy Word of God to ſuch corrupt ends! <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſome where
ſpeaketh to this occaſion, when this part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle was read, <hi>I fear</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>left this may be ill underſtood, but let none think, as if</hi> Paul<hi>'s meaning
was, he would be chaſte, but he was an adulterer, he would be mercifull, but he
was cruel,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it would be very dangerous to interpret this paſſage of
<hi>groſſe ſinnes,</hi> and yet it <hi>cannot be denied,</hi> but that men who ſinne <hi>groſly,</hi> yet with
ſome <hi>remorſe</hi> and grief of conſcience are apt to cover themſelves with theſe fig-leaves,
and think this is ſanctuary ſafe enough to runne unto, that though they
do ſinne, yet it is not with full conſent and delight. <hi>Arminius</hi> affirmeth (<hi>in
cap. 7. ad</hi> Rom. <hi>pag.</hi> 753. as he ſaith, <hi>Verè &amp; ſanctè</hi>) <q>That he had ſometimes
the experience of this, that when ſome have been admoniſhed, that they
would take heed of committing ſuch a ſin, which they knew was forbidden by
the Law; They would anſwer with the Apoſtle. <hi>To will was preſent with them,
but they knew not how to perform what they willed:</hi> Yea he addeth, He had this
anſwer from one, not when the ſinne was committed, but when he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
that he ſhould not commit it. But the ſame Author goeth on, and
ſaith, he knew both men and women, young and old, who when he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
this Chapter in the ſenſe he defendeth, did plainly confeſs to him, that
they hitherto had been in this opinion, that if they committed any ſinne with
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:57719:261"/>
reluctancy of their mind, or omitted any duty, the ſame regreeting of them,
they were not greatly to trouble themſelves, or grieve in this matter, ſeeing
they thought themſelves like <hi>Paul</hi> therein, and therefore gave him hearty
thanks that he delivered him from that errour by his interpretation.</q> But what
needeth all this, if any read <hi>Calvins,</hi> or other Expoſitions upon this place,
might they not have been fully ſatisfied, that ſuch perſons offending in that
manner (<hi>viz.) ſinning,</hi> having <hi>only terrour and contradiction from their conſcience
againſt the ſinne they commit, but their hearts otherwiſe carry them out to it,</hi>
do no wayes agree with the perſon here deſcribed, whoſe <hi>heare</hi> and <hi>will</hi> is ſaid
to be <hi>againſt ſinne,</hi> as well as his <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>conſcience?</hi> We muſt not therefore
underſtand it of <hi>groſs ſins,</hi> eſpecially of a <hi>continual cuſtom therein.</hi> No doubt
but <hi>David</hi> did commit the adultery and murder, <hi>he would not have done.</hi> No
doubt when <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, he could ſay, the evil that he would not do,
that he did; but this was <hi>in ſuddain temptations.</hi> This was not <hi>often</hi> or <hi>cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
therefore they did recover out of them with bitter tears and ſorrow. We
muſt therefore underſtand it <hi>chiefly</hi> of the <hi>motions</hi> and <hi>luſtings</hi> of the heart to
ſinne, and <hi>oftentimes</hi> a <hi>conſenting thereunto;</hi> yea and in <hi>leſſer</hi> ſinnes <hi>an acting</hi>
thereupon; ſo that it is no more in ſenſe then what the Apoſtle <hi>Jam's</hi> ſaith, <hi>In
many things we offend all,</hi> Chap. 3. 2. So that howſoever the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
would make <hi>Auſtins,</hi> and the later Expoſitions to differ, as if <hi>Auſtins</hi>
were more innocent, becauſe he underſtood it only of <hi>motions</hi> to ſinne, which
the godly man did ſuffer againſt his will within him; but the later apply it even
to <hi>actions;</hi> yet who ſo diligently compareth them together, cannot find any
real difference; for the ſumme of their Expoſition is, That the Law requiring
ſuch a perfect and pure holineſs, that is doth not allow of the leaſt ſpot, or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
the moſt godly do find themſelves ſo depreſſed and weighed down with
that remainder of corruption that is within them, that they come exceeding
ſhort of that excellent and perfect holineſs, and therefore do abhorre and loath
themſelves, and judge themſelves miſerable, while they carry about with them
ſuch a body of ſinne.</p>
                           <p>Secondly and laſtly, This Expoſition will be advantagiouſly managed for
godlineſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                              </gap> alſo inform, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>doth not here ſpeak of every particular
temptation, as if in every conflict he had the worſe, and the fleſh had the better; but
he ſpeaks of good and evil in the general, and that in the whole courſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi>
In the general his heart was ſet upon the good commanded, and
againſt the evil forbidden, but yet he could never attain to his fulneſs of deſire,
though in ſeveral combars, the ſpirit might and did conquer the fleſh. And
certainly the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who will hold us to the <hi>rigid letter,</hi> as if this perſon
<hi>never</hi> had he better, no not <hi>at any</hi> time in <hi>any</hi> ſinne, muſt take heed of that
fault they charge upon us (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they be not injurious to the grace of
God, even according to their own Expoſition; for <hi>they acknowledge</hi> thoſe
workings of the Law in this perſon againſt ſinne, <hi>are from the Spirit of God:</hi>
Theſe are the good gift of God, and although they come not from the Spirit,
as regenerating, yet as moving and preparing the heart for Regeneration.
<hi>Now will it not be derogatory to ſay, that in this conflict the Spirit of God is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in every conflict, that at no time he cannot do the good he would?</hi> This is to
make the conflict of a man in this legal eſtate inferiour to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>incontinent
perſon,</hi> who hath only the meer light of natural reaſon to help him; for he
compareth (<hi>Lib. 7. Ethic. cap.</hi> 9.) intemperance to the diſeaſe of a <hi>Dropſie</hi>
or <hi>Conſumption,</hi> becauſe incurable, but incontinency to the falling-ſickneſs,
becauſe curable. And then becauſe the former is continual, the later ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
only. If then in very Heathens, whoſe conflict is only between a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conſcience, and their luſts, conſcience doth ſometimes prevail, their luſts
do not alwayes overcome; Shall we think leſſe is done by the Spirit of God in
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:57719:261"/>
them, who are in this legal conflict? It is true, if we ſpeak of perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Law of God: ſo at all times in all things, the Law of ſinne within a
godly man doth retard and make him to come ſhort; but then in particular
combates, there the fleſh doth not alwayes prevail; only the Apoſtle inſtanceth
in the tyranny of ſinne, and not the dominion of grace, becauſe hereby he
would inform the Jews how much they were to ſigh and groan under this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and thereupon to have higher thoughts of Chriſt. For ſeeing there were
two things that did keep them off from Chriſt, The ignorance of the power of
original ſinne, and a deſire to find out a righteouſneſs by the works of the Law:
The Apoſtle doth take an excellent way to cure them of theſe two evils, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what deep root original ſinne hath in the moſt holy, and how oppoſite and
fighting it is againſt the grace of God within us, inſomuch that we cannot have
our full comfort but in Chriſt alone.</p>

heard was to be underſtood of no other then a regenerate perſon. But becauſe
ſuch an Expoſition, as alſo the Doctrine of the imperfection of Regeneration
may be abuſed; You heard with what limitations that Chapter was to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
though of a godly man.</p>
                           <p>It is remarkable what <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith in defence of himſelf, expounding this
place of a regenerate perſon, whereas he had interpreted it otherwiſe former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Non ego primus aut ſolus,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Lib. 6. contra</hi> Julianum. <hi>lib.</hi> 11.) He was
not the firſt, or only man that did interpret it ſo. Yea he confeſſeth he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it of unregenerated perſons once himſelf; and his greateſt reaſon was,
becauſe he thought <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſay of himſelf, <hi>That he was carnal and ſold
under ſinne;</hi> but afterwards (ſaith he) <hi>Melioribus &amp; intelligentioribus ceſſi, vel
potius ipſi veritati,</hi> &amp;c. The example of this excellent man might much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
but that prejudice doth blind mens eyes.</p>
                           <p>Let us ſee what Reaſons are cogent for this Expoſition.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, This is very conſiderable, <hi>That the Apoſtle in the former verſes ſpeaking
of himſelf, uſeth the Preterperfect tenſe, ſpeakth of that which was paſt: onely
at the fourteenth verſe, there he changeth the tenſe, and ſpeaketh of the preſent
time; which may perſwade us, that he ſpeaketh of himſelf, what he was once, before
regenerated, and what he hath experience of in himſelf, though ſanctified.</hi> This
<hi>changing of the time, argueth a change alſo in the perſon;</hi> for ſo his Diſcourſe run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
from the ſeventh verſe to the fourteenth, <hi>I had not known luſt, and ſinne
wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence, I was alive without the Law once, and
ſinne deceived me,</hi> &amp;c. All theſe expreſſions are concerning what <hi>was</hi> done in
him. Then at the fourteenth verſe, with the reſt following, he ſpeaketh of the
<hi>preſent time, I am carnal, I do that which I allow not,</hi> &amp;c. This altering of the
time may incline us to think, that it is very probable the Apoſtle doth compare
his former eſtate of unregeneracy with the preſent of ſanctification that he is
now in. It is true indeed, we grant that the Apoſtle doth ſometimes aſſume
the perſon of another man; he ſuppoſeth ſuch a thing in himſelf, which yet we
muſt not conclude to be in him, as <hi>Rom. 3. 7. For if the truth of God hath
abounded more through my life unto his glory, why yet am I judged as a ſinner?</hi>
                              <pb n="490" facs="tcp:57719:262"/>
Here it is certain, he perſonateth a wicked object or and caviller. So 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 2.
If I have all faith, and not charity,</hi> &amp;c. As alſo <hi>Gal. 2. 18. If what I have deſtroyed,
I build the ſame again, I make my ſelf a tranſgreſſor.</hi> But who doth not ſee a vaſt
difference between theſe expreſſions and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe in this Chapter?
For they are ſpoken <hi>hypothetically</hi> by way of ſuppoſition. And therefore every
one may perceive that the Apoſtle doth not intend an abſolute ſpeech of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Had the Apoſtle uſed ſuch conditional expreſſions here, then there had
been ſome colour, <hi>If I do the evil I would not, if I do not the good I would, if I
delight in the Law, if the Law of God,</hi> &amp;c. then we might have doubted whether he
ſpake of himſelf or no. Or had the Apoſtle as abſolutely and peremptorily ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in thoſe places, as he doth here, we ſhould have wondred at it. Should he after
a large Diſcourſe to that purpoſe have concluded, <hi>So then I my ſelf diſtroy what I
have built,</hi> it would have greatly amazed us? As for that place inſiſted upon by
ſo many, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. Theſe things I have in a figure transferred to my ſelf and
Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. and from thence gathering, That it is ordinary with <hi>Paul</hi> by a
figure to aſſume another habit (as it were) then his own. Suppoſe it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Doth it therefore follow he doth here in this place? What, doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
never ſpeak in his own perſon? If we will not take this as ſpoken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
Why do the Diſſentients take the ſecond verſe in the next Chapter, as to
be underſtood of his own perſon? <hi>The Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus,
hath freed me from the Law of ſinne and death.</hi> Beſides this very place maketh
againſt them: for when the Apoſtle doth thus aſſume a perſon, he plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth
he doth ſo; you ſee he doth expreſly ſay, that what he did, he did by
a figure, but here is not the leaſt hint given of any ſuch thing, there is not a
ſyllable by which we may gather any ſuch transfiguration: So that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the Apoſtle ſhould continue in ſuch a long diſcourſe, and that with ſo
much vehemency, and yet give no diſcovery that he doth not mean it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
eſpecially when the Adverſaries to this Expoſition ſay, That to underſtand
it of <hi>Paul,</hi> is ſo contumelious to the Spirit of God, and ſo deſtructive to all
godlineſs. Certainly if ſo, the Apoſtle would have manifeſted ſomething to
remove this ſtumbling block. Although I may adde that even that very Text,
<hi>I have in a figure transferred to my ſelf and Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. doth not neceſſarily
allude, to that mention made of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. where ſpeaking of their
factions, ſome ſaid they were of <hi>Paul,</hi> others of <hi>Apollo;</hi> as if the Apoſtle did
by figure, uſe their names, intending thereby the falſe Apoſtles; for (ſay they)
The <hi>Corinthians</hi> made their diviſions by occaſion of the falſe Apoſtles glorying
in them, and exalting them againſt thoſe that were faithfull. But if ſo, what
argument could there be in <hi>Paul</hi>'s words? <hi>Was Paul crucified for you? Were
you baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> If he did mean falſe Apoſtles, and not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
why ſhould he thank God that he had baptized ſo few? Therefore <hi>Pareus</hi>
acknowledgeth, that the common Interpretation of that Text, as if <hi>Paul</hi> by a
figure uſe his name and <hi>Apollo</hi> for the falſe Apoſtles, is no wayes agreeable
with the ſcope of the place: For how could that be an example to teach them
humility, as he there enlargeth himſelf. <hi>Heinſius</hi> alſo doth not like the
tranſlation of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              </gap>, but enough
of this.</p>
                           <p>2. A ſecond Argument is, In that this perſon is ſaid <hi>to hate evil, not to will
what is evil, not to know or approve of it, and then he is ſaid to will that which is
good.</hi> Now this is the Deſcription of godlineſs, to love good, and to hate
evil. It is true, that in convinced men, who yet retain their luſts, as alſo in
legal men, they would not do the evil that they do, but yet they cannot be
ſaid to hate it: No they love their luſts; therefore when any fear doth abate,
they preſently fall unto thoſe ſinnes again, but this man doth hate ſinne; So that
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:57719:262"/>
in this property two things diſcover a regenerate perſon, 1. That not only his
conſcience and his judgement is againſt ſinne, but his will, his heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
alſo, whereas in all unregenerate men, their judgements, and their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being enlightned and terrified, maketh them afraid to commit ſinne; but
their will, then affections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> not againſt it. And then ſecondly, The Apoſtle
ſpeaketh generally of evil and good, he doth not ſay, I do this evil, I would
not, or I do not this good that I would, but evil and good indefinitely, and
this is only proper to the regenerate, he only hateth all evil, be only loveth all
good, whereas the unregenerate perſon doth hate only ſome evil, and it is ſome
good only that he would do, though if a man truly hate any ſinne, he hateth all
ſin, becauſe <hi>odium</hi> is <hi>circa genus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>This perſon muſt be a regenerate perſon, becauſe there are two diſtinct
principles in him, Sinne</hi> and <hi>He</hi> are made two different things, <hi>verſ. 17. It is
no more I that do it, but ſinne that dwelleth in me:</hi> And <hi>ver. 18. I know that in me</hi>
(that is my fleſh) <hi>dwelleth no good thing;</hi> Here then are (as it were) two diſtinct
perſons; this perſon hath two ſelfs, which doth neceſſarily demonſtrate that
this is a ſanctified perſon. For can a man under legal convictions ſay, <hi>It is not
I, but ſinne within me?</hi> Can he that hath only errors upon his ſoul ſay, <hi>It is
not I, but ſinne within me?</hi> How abſurd and falſe were that, for their hearts
are ſet upon evil, only the terrours of the Law reſtrain them? Now a man is,
what his heart is, not what his conviction is. It is true, the <hi>Libertines</hi> did abuſe
this Doctrine, and would thereby acquit themſelves, it was not they, but the
fleſh: Yea ſome blaſphemouſly would attribute it to God himſelf; but till a
man be regenerated, he hath but one ſelf, and that is the fleſh. But (ſaith <q>
                                 <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>)
thoſe legal preparatory workings by the Law, are the good gift of
God, and are to be reckoned among the works of the Spirit, and therefore
the Apoſtle may oppoſe them and ſinne together.</q> To this it is anſwered,
Though thoſe legal operations are from Gods Spirit, yet becauſe the perſon is
not regenerated, he is ſtill in the ſtate of the fleſh, he is ſtill without Chriſt, and
therefore cannot diſtinguiſh himſelf from the fleſh within him. As long as
thoſe good gifts of God are not in a ſubject regenerated, the ſame perſon and
the fleſh are all one. Yea though thoſe good effects come from Gods Spirit, and
ſo are in themſelves ſpiritual, yet as they are in a perſon unregenerated, they
are improved carnally, they are managed only to ſelf-reſpects; and thus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
believers, though they do enjoy the good and common gifts of Gods
Spirit, yet as they are in them, they are carnally improved, ſpiritual things
being proſtituted to temporal ends. It is plain then, that onely a godly man
may ſay, <hi>It is not I, but ſinne in me;</hi> and thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> on the place ſaith, it
may be eaſily underſtood of a man in the ſtate of grace, and of a ſinner, it can be
only interpreted <hi>extortè,</hi> by violence: His reaſon he goeth upon is, becauſe that
a man is ſaid to do, which his reaſon doth, not which his ſenſitive appetite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
unto, becauſe <hi>homo eſt id quod eſt ſecundum rationem;</hi> By reaſon we muſt
underſtand ſanctified reaſon, otherwiſe a mans reaſon is corrupted, as well as
his ſenſual part. Beſides, there is a further Argument uſed by the Apoſtle in this
diſtinction he maketh, <hi>It is no more I that do it. No more,</hi> that implieth, <hi>once
it was</hi> he that did it, formerly he could not make ſuch a diſtinction as now
he doth.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, The perſon here ſpoken of muſt needs be a regenerate perſon,
<hi>Becauſe it is ſaid, He delighteth in the Law of God after the inward man,</hi> ver. 22.
This is one of the places that compelled <hi>Auſtin</hi> to change his former opinion.
Certainly <hi>to delight in the Law of God,</hi> is an inſeparable property of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
perſon: <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth his holy and heavenly heart thereby; yea the
Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>I delight with. Arminius</hi> doth well obſerve the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis
of the word, for he maketh the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> not redundant, but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant.
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:57719:263"/>
So that the meaning is, he delighteth in the Law of God, that is, he
delighteth in Gods Law, and Gods Law delighteth in him; there is a mutual
ſympathy and delight (as it were) which maketh the reaſon the ſtronger for a
regenerate perſon. For can any but he delight in Gods Law, and Gods Law
(as it were) delight in him again? It is true, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> 
                              <hi>in the inward man,</hi> but
that is not a diminution, but a ſpecification of the cauſe, whereby he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Gods Law. I will not ſay that the inward man doth alwayes ſignifie the
regenerate man, and ſo is the ſame with a new-creature. For although ſome
underſtand that place ſo, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. The outward man periſheth, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man is renewed daily;</hi> yet happily the context may enforce it another way,
yet here it muſt be underſtood of the <hi>mind as regenerated,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>oppoſite to
the fleſh,</hi> and ſo ſignifieth the ſame with the <hi>hidden man of the heart,</hi> in which ſenſe
a Jew is called <hi>one inwardly,</hi> becauſe of the work of grace upon his ſoul.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, <hi>The ſad complaint he maketh concerning his thraldom, doth evidently
ſhew, that it is a regenerate perſon: O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver
me from the body of this death!</hi> If we take body for the material body, which is
mortal, and ſo ſinfull; or elſe for that body of ſinne, which abideth in the
godly, it cometh much to one point. It argueth that the perſon here ſpoken of,
feeling this weight, this burden upon him, is in ſad agonies of ſoul, judgeth
himſelf miſerable and wretched in this reſpect, and thereupon doth earneſtly
groan for a total redemption; he longs to be in heaven, where no longer will
evil be preſent with him, where he ſhall do all the good, and as perfectly as he
would. It is true, a godly man cannot abſolutely be called a wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
man, but <hi>reſpectively quoad hoc,</hi> and <hi>comparatively</hi> to that perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
we ſhall have hereafter. So we may juſtly account our ſelves miſerable,
not ſo much from external evils, as from the motions and ſtirrings of ſinne
within us, that do preſs us down, and thereby make our lives more diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.
Hence it is that <hi>Auſtin</hi> calleth this <hi>Gemitum ſaactorum,</hi> &amp;c. the
ſighs and groans of holy perſons fighting againſt concupiſcence within them.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, <hi>The affectionate rejoycing and aſſured confidence that he hath, about
the full deliverance of him from this bondage expreſſed in thoſe words,</hi> I thank God
through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>doth greatly eſtabliſh this expoſition alſo of a regenerate ate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
It is true, there is variety about reading of this paſſage; however this
plainly cometh from an heart affected with aſſurance of Gods grace to give him
a full redemption, though for the preſent he lie in ſad conflicts and agonies.
This is ſo palpable a conviction, that ſome of the Diſſentients will make <hi>Paul</hi>
here to ſpeak in his own perſon, as if he did give God thanks for that freedome
which the perſon ſpoken before had not obtained. Neither is it any wonder to
ſee ſuch a ſudden change in <hi>Paul</hi> from groaning under miſery, preſently to break
forth into thanks and praiſes of God: For we may often obſerve ſuch ebbings
and flowings in <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, that we would hardly think the ſame Pſalm made
by the ſame man, at the ſame time; one verſe ſpeaking dejection and diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateneſs,
the next it may be ſtrong confidence, and rejoycing in God.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, The concluſion which <hi>Paul</hi> maketh from this excellent experimental
Diſcourſe, is fully to our purpoſe, <hi>So then I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with
the fleſh the law of ſin.</hi> To ſerve God, and to ſerve the Law of God is all one, and
this none but a godly man doth. Yea to ſerve him with the <hi>mind</hi> and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is
a choice expreſſion of our grace. But becauſe this is not perfect and compleat, he
addeth, <hi>He ſerveth alſo the fleſh, and the law of ſin.</hi> It is true, <hi>None can ſerve God
and mammon, Chriſt and ſin,</hi> but yet where there is <hi>not a perfect freedom</hi> from
thraldom to ſin, there, though in the principal and chief manner we are carried
out to ſerve God, yet the fleſh retardeth, and ſo ſnatcheth to it ſome ſervice: you
heard contraries might be together, while they are in fight. Neither is our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
from ſin <hi>full and total.</hi> It is to be done ſucceſſively and by degrees, that ſo
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57719:263"/>
we may be the more humbled and grace exalted. Beſides that expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>,
is emphatical; this is uſed when <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth himſelf in ſome remarkable
manner, <hi>I the ſame,</hi> and no other man, as it is uſed in other places, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 1. Now
I Paul my ſelf beſeech you,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. except it was, <hi>becauſe I my ſelf was not
burdenſom to you.</hi> Rom. 9. 3. <hi>I could wiſh that myſelf were accurſed,</hi> &amp;c. which is
enough to convince ſuch as are not refractory.</p>

                           <head type="sub">Objections Anſwered.</head>
                           <p>I Shall now conſider what is objected againſt this Interpretation, and ſhall not
attend to the general objections, ſuch as that, <hi>That who are Chriſts and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
have higher things attributed to them; They have crucified the fleſh, they have
mortifiedeth old man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As alſo this ſeemeth to be injurious to Gods grace, it will
encourage men in ſlothfulneſs and negligence,</hi> &amp;c. for theſe ſhall be anſwered in the
general. I ſhall therefore only pitch upon two objections, which the Adverſaries
inſiſt upon.</p>
                           <p>The firſt is, <hi>That this perſon here ſpoken of, is ſaid to be once without the Law,
which</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is the deſcription of a Gentile in</hi> Paul<hi>'s</hi> language; therefore he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
ſome other perſon then his own; for Paul <hi>alwayes lived under the Law. Auſtin</hi>
indeed expounds it thus, <hi>I did live once without the Law.</hi> that is, ſaith he, when
he was a child, before he had the uſe of reaſon. This is too harſh. Therefore it is
better anſwered, The perſon here ſpoken of, is not ſaid <hi>to be without the Law,</hi>
which is indeed the deſcription of a <hi>Gentile, but that he was alive without the Law
once,</hi> that is, he, as all the Phariſees underſtood the Law of God, as forbidding
only external ſins, and <hi>Paul</hi> living unblameably as to that reſpect, thought to
have life and righteouſneſs by the Law, but when the commandment came in
power to him, and he was convinced that it did prohibit not only outward ſins,
but inward luſtings of heart, then he began to find himſelf a greater ſinner than
he was aware of; then he found the Law to be death to him, ſo that he lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Law, becauſe he was not affected with the full and exact obligation therof.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond thing much inſiſted upon is, <hi>That the perſon here ſpoken of, is ſaid
to be carnal and ſold under ſinne, which</hi> (they ſay) <hi>is made by the Scripture a
certain property of a wickedman. Thus it is ſaid of</hi> Ahab, <hi>Thou haſt ſold thy ſelf to
do wickedly,</hi> 1 Kin. 21. 10. <hi>yea of all the children of Iſrael,</hi> 2 Kin. 17. 13. <hi>They cauſed
their children to paſs through the fire, and ſold themſelves to do evil in the ſight of
the Lord.</hi> But firſt, <hi>Calvin</hi> doth grant, that this is ſpoken of <hi>Paul,</hi> while unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
and therefore beginneth his Expoſition at the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of a ſanctified
perſon: yet that cannot well be, becauſe there the Apoſtle beginneth to alter the
tenſe; There he ſaith, <hi>I am carnal, I am ſold under ſinne,</hi> whereas before he had
uſed the paſt time. We grant it therefore, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith this of himſelf, though
regenerated, that he was ſold under ſin. But then we ſay, The expreſſions above
named, and this is not <hi>a like;</hi> here it is in a <hi>paſſive</hi> ſenſe, there in an <hi>active</hi> ſenſe;
of thoſe wicked men it is ſaid, <hi>They ſold themſelves,</hi> which denoteth their wilfulnes
and obſtinacy; of this, <hi>he was ſold,</hi> which implieth it to be done againſt his will,
as captives are; there it is <hi>abſolutely,</hi> here it is <hi>limited to the fleſh:</hi> And if this phraſe
did denote a wicked man in an <hi>high degree,</hi> then how can they apply it to a man
<hi>under legal convictions,</hi> and in a preparatory way to converſion? It would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard to ſay of ſuch men, that they ſold themſelves to do evil. Beſides, there is
a two-fold bondage and captivity under ſin, even as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had a two-fold
one they were born in, that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and another they voluntarily by their ſin
ſell into, which was that of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thus there is a bondage unto ſin, we are all
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:57719:264"/>
born in; for in <hi>Adam</hi> we were all ſold to ſinne, and ſo needed a Chriſt, Reder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
And ſecondly there is a bondage unto ſinne, by our own voluntary
tranſgreſſions; It is true a regenerate perſon cannot be ſold under ſinne in
this later ſence, but he is in the former, and ſo it is no more injurious unto
the grace of God, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> noteth, then that he is yet mortal and corruptible.
Thus you have this great and neceſſary truth eſtabliſhed: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh here of
a regenerate perſon, and that not only of him, as he is in the loweſt eſtate, and
initials of grace, as <hi>Muſculus</hi> thinketh; but of every godly perſon while in
this life, even the moſt perfect that is, though this conflict be more applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſome then others; yea if we do regard the exact purity of the law, the
moſt holy do moſt humble themſelves under it.</p>

Religious Progreſs, whereby they are ſinful and imperfect.</head>
                           <p>THe next Propoſition in order is, <hi>That this fleſh, this original ſinne in a man
doth ſeveral wayes hinder the godly in their religious progreſs, whereby they
are ſinful and imperfect,</hi> whereby every one is forced to cry out, as he; <hi>O me nunquam
ſapientem!</hi> ſo, <hi>O me nunquam pium!</hi> Oh me never godly, never believing, never
anſwering the holy Law of God! This treacherous enemy within us is ſo <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,</hi>
putteth it ſelf <hi>Chamelion</hi>-like into ſo many ſhapes, that the moſt holy
men have cauſe to be alwayes on their guard, to keep continual watch, leſt
ſometime or other this <hi>Daliah</hi> betray them into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
How were it poſſible that ſome eminent ſervants of God, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
have fallen ſo grievouſly, and committed ſuch ſinnes which ſome Heathens
by the light of nature would have abhorred? but that there is this fuel and ſpawn
of ſinne abiding in every regenerate perſon. It may well be affirmed, that the
<hi>reliquiae peccati originalis;</hi> the reliques of original ſinne are in the moſt holy:
for as when an houſe hath been for the greateſt part conſumed, but at laſt the
fire is quenched, yet there remains ſome little ſparks and embers, which cauſe
a conſtant watch, leſt they kindle and conſume whatſoever is left yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
Such care and fear ought the godly to have, leſt the remaining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
break out ſuddainly, and ſo deſtroy them.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall inſtance in ſome particulars whereby original ſinne doth thus hinder
and retard the work of grace in us. As</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>This fleſh within the godly maketh us imperfect in this life by its ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;
and contrary thwarting it hath to the grace of God within us.</hi> Theſe two
ſaith the Text are <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, they are two adverſaries daily combating with
one another; Inſomuch that what the Spirit ſaith, do, the fleſh ſaith do it not.
Thus original corruption is like <hi>Solomons</hi> brawling woman, whoſe <hi>contentions
are a continual dropping,</hi> Prov. 19. 13. What reſt can ſuch a man have? no
more then he that lyeth in his bed, and hath conſtant droppings of rain upon
him: Such a diſturber, and farre more troubleſome inmate is original ſinne to
a believer, grace hath no reſt, no quietnes, but the fleſh is alwayes raiſing up oppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſitions
againſt it, alwayes croſſing it, what the Spirit would not, that the fleſh
would. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. the Apoſtle expreſſeth the violent actings
thereof by <hi>military</hi> termes, it <hi>warreth,</hi> and it bringeth into <hi>captivity;</hi> In this
ſence we may ſay, the fleſh is <hi>Satan,</hi> for that is an adverſary in our way, that
riſeth up and ſtoppeth us in our ſpiritual progreſs: It is true, the natural and
carnal man findeth no ſuch oppoſition; he never cryeth out, Oh how hard a
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:57719:264"/>
thing is it to be heavenly minded, to be godly indeed, to live a life of faith?
how difficult to live and die upon Scripture and ſpiritual grounds? for all is
fleſh within, dead men feel no pain, they find no oppoſition; <hi>Mortuus non
belligerat,</hi> is the Proverb, but the godly are in continual exerciſes, no ſooner
doth grace begin to work, but the fleſh preſently beginneth to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The fleſh doth retard and hinder the work of grace <hi>by ſubtil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
and enticements:</hi> Thus as the Devil ſometimes appeareth as a roaring
Lion, and ſometimes again as a gliſtering Serpent, and in this latter way is
moſt dangerous; ſo it is with this fleſh within us; ſometimes it groſly, and
violently <hi>oppoſeth</hi> the grace of God, at other times it craftily <hi>inſinuateth,</hi> It rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
interpoſeth, it propounds many ſweet baits; thus what it cannot do as
a Lion, it accompliſheth as a Fox, ſo that what counſell is given, <hi>Mis. 75.
Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy boſome,</hi> implying there
would be treachery in the neareſt relations: This is much more to be obſerved
againſt original ſinne that lyeth in thy own boſome, yea it is thy own ſelf; and
therefore how eaſily may it perſwade thee, yea no temptations without could
do thee any hurt, did not this fleſh within betray all: Thus it craftily inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and ſurprizeth the ſtrongeſth holds of the ſoul, before we are aware:
ſo you heard from that of <hi>James 1. 17. Every man is tempted and drawen aſide
with his own luſt.</hi> Sweet poiſon doth more eaſily deſtroy, white powder
that giveth no noiſe more certainly kills; and this is the Reaſon, why the godly
may be carried away to ſinne of profit, and pleaſure, and not judge them to
be ſo, their hearts may not condemne them, and all becauſe the fleſh can ſo
bewitch us; it doth caſt ſuch miſts before our eyes, that we are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
between things that differ.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The fleſh within us doth keep off grace from its perfect work, <hi>by
depreſſing it and weighing it down;</hi> that when grace would lift up the ſoul to
heaven, that is like a milſtone about our neck, and pulleth us back again, it
is lime to the birds wings, it is the ſtring to her feet: This made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out
of it as a weight lying upon him, <hi>Rom. 7. O wretched man that I am who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from the body of this death?</hi> yea <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. it is called <hi>a weight;</hi> now as
that muſt needs be an impediment to any who run in a race, no leſs burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
is original ſinne to a godly man in his way to heaven.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, It hinders the perfection of grace, <hi>cooling and remitting the fervour
and zeal thereof;</hi> and herein chiefly the miſchievous effect of original ſinne is
diſcovered, it maketh the ſoul halt in his progreſs, it <hi>allayeth</hi> the heat of grace,
it is like ſmoak to put out the fire. <hi>The adverſaries to this Truth ſay, it is not
intelligible how the Spirit can make us will one thing, and the fleſh another, ſeeing
a man hath but one will, and he cannot velle &amp; nolle, will and nill at the ſame time
about the ſame object;</hi> But they may know that by ſuch expreſſions are chiefly
meant, That the <hi>hearrt</hi> of a man through this fleſh within him, <hi>is very faint
and remiſs</hi> in all its actions about that which is good; when he doth will it, it's
ſo <hi>inefficaciouſly,</hi> ſo <hi>ſlluggiſhly,</hi> ſo <hi>imperfectly, that it may be called a nilling as
well as a willing;</hi> and this is the ſad iſſue of original ſinne, it maketh us go hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the grave, it abateth that activity and zeal of ſpirit, which ought to be in
holy things.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, The fleſh hindereth abſolute compleatneſs of grace, <hi>by ſoiling, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing,
and infecting our holy duties;</hi> It is as ſome mud caſt into a pure ſtream,
it is as ſome poiſon mingled with wine; and for this it is, that the moſt holy
have prayed, <hi>God would not enter into judgement with them, becauſe in his ſight
no fleſh could be juſtified,</hi> Pſal. 143. 2. For this, the Scripture compareth even
<hi>our righteous actions to a menſtruous cloath,</hi> Iſa. 30. 22. This is the frog that
is drawen up with the pure water out of the well; though our godly duties

                           <p>Laſtly, The fleſh is an hindrance in the way of grace, <hi>by dividing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting

though grace hath for the main ſetled our hearts upon God, yet the fleſh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth,
that propoundeth other objects, and thus becauſe the pool runneth
into divers ſtreams, it is not ſo full and plentifull, ſo that it is impoſſible there
ſhould be any perfection, where there is any diſtraction or diviſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may juſtly expoſtulate with all thoſe, who plead they are without ſin,
<hi>Whether they never have ſo much, as one wandring thought in any holy duty they go

not, or feel not what they are, or do: Such are like thoſe diſtracted perſons,
that conceit themſelves Kings and Emperours, when at the ſame time they are
miſerable and indigent. Now by theſe ſeveral actings of the fleſh within us,
the godly man may perceive what little cauſe he hath to truſt in himſelf: thou
canſt not be ſecure, while in this mortal body; the wound original ſinne hath
given thee is not wholly cured; ſometime or other this cloſe ſecret enemy may

                           <p>In the next place, I ſhall proceed to a ſecond Propoſition, and therein ſhall
anſwer ſuch general Objections that may plauſibly be urged againſt the actings
of original ſinne within us, and thereby againſt the imperfection of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for ſome have thought it no dangerous errour to plead for a perfection
even in this life: Therefore <hi>Arminius</hi> his heires (<hi>Epiſtola dedecati. ad cap. 7. ad
Rom.</hi>) ſay that the unſeaſonable and exceſſive urging of the conſtant imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of regenerate perſons, and the impoſſibility of keeping the Law in this life,
without adding what the godly might do by faith and the Spirit of Chriſt, ſuch
a thought as this might eaſily enter into the hearts of the hearers, that they
can do no good at all; and they adde, the ancient Church thought not the
queſtion about the impoſſibility of the law, to be reckoned among capital
ones, which is apparent (ſay they) from <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which wiſheth the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
would acknowledge it might be performed by the grace of Chriſt, and then
there would be peace between them. But certainly <hi>Auſtin</hi> may beſt explain
himſelf, (<hi>De perfectione juſtitiae ad Caeleſtiam, ad finem</hi>) where he ſaith, he
knoweth ſome who hold there either have been, or are ſome, that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſinne: <hi>Quorum ſententiam de bâc re non audeo reprehendere, quanquam nec
defendere valeam;</hi> as he dared not reprove it, ſo he could not defend it. This
is his modeſt expreſſion, but if <hi>Auſtin</hi> could not defend it, I do not know
who in that age could, ſeeing <hi>Auſtin</hi> by the gloſs in the Canon law, hath juſtly
the preheminence above all the Ancients for Diſputations, as <hi>Hierom</hi> for the
Tongues, and <hi>Gregory</hi> for Morals; and certainly the places brought to prove
this point, do argue that no man is without ſinne, that none can be juſtified,
if God enter into judgement: It was alſo <hi>Pelagins</hi> boaſt in that Epiſtle <hi>ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriadem,</hi>
(for it's taken to be his) That in the firſt place he doth enquire
what men are able to do, how farre their own power extendeth as if this
foundation were not laid, there could be no exhortation to godlineſs. Hence
the <hi>Pelagians</hi> charged it as a conſequence upon the Doctrine of original ſinne,
that it would work in men a deſpair about perfect righteouſneſs, (<hi>lib ſecundo
coutra Julianum in initio</hi>) But of late Writers ſetting aſide <hi>Papiſts, Caſtellio,</hi>
(for we muſt not call him <hi>Caſtalio,</hi> ſeeing he bewaileth his pride, (<hi>Caſtel. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſ.

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:57719:265"/>
doth with the greateſt earneſtneſs propugn the perfection of regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and immunity from ſinne, underſtanding that prayer for pardoning of
ſinne, like as that duty to forgive our enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> when we have them:
This Writer calleth that queſtion, Whether a man may by the Spirit of God
perfectly obey the law, a very profitable queſtion, but addeth that the errour
on the right hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are able perfectly to fullfill it, is farre leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
then the contrary; for God will never find fault with that man, who
doth endeavour for a perfect obedience, and that by the help of God, (<hi>De obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiâ

                              <q>Firſt, <hi>The command of God</hi> requiring we ſhould not luſt, and that we
ſhould love God with all our heart, and all our ſoul, and might: From hence
they argue, if theſe two commands cannot be perfectly fullfilled, why are they
required of us.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>To this it is anſwered, that it muſt be granted, no man living is able to
anſwer the perfection and exactneſs of this law:</q> who can ſay he loveth God,
as much as the command requireth? that he never faileth in the leaſt degree?
who can ſay that he never finds any ſinful motions? any irregular workings
of heart? though he do not conſent to them; ſuppoſe that were alwayes true,
which is not to be granted, yet ſuch motions being in the heart, the very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of them maketh us to fall ſhort of the exactneſs of the law; <hi>But yet theſe
commands are neceſſary;</hi> for the rule <hi>muſt alwayes be perfect, not wanting or fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any thing.</hi> The command doth repreſent the perfect Idea of compleat
righteouſneſs, as Statues that are erected up in high and eminent places, are
commonly of greater length, then the ordinary ſtature of men is. Thus it is
one thing the righteouſneſs commanded in the law, and the participation of it
in the ſubject, that receiveth it according to its proper capacity; The law then
is perfect, but we are imperfect, true obedience and imperfect muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
as <hi>Caſtellio</hi> moſt ignorantly doth, and therefore abandoneth that
opinion (<hi>De Juſtificat. pag.</hi> 46.) which maketh imperfection a ſinne: but he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniateth
the orthodox, when he ſaith, we hold nothing a vertue, but what
is chiefeſt (<hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 43.) neither do we call that imperfection, which may have
a greater degree; <hi>Adam</hi> was not imperfect, becauſe he had not ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
as the Angles have; In heaven it may be judged, that one Saint ſhall
have more grace then another, yet every one perfected in their meaſure; and
though it be ſo, he that hath not ſo much holineſs as the chiefeſt, ſhall not be
judged ſinfully imperfect; there is a negative imperfection, and a privative;
this later is, when the ſubiect doth not partake of what degrees it ought to do,
and then it is alwayes a ſinne: The ſtarre hath not as much light as the Sunne,
but this is no privative imperfection, becauſe it is not bound to be the Sunne:
Now the command of God requireth of us the chiefeſt love that we can by grace
put forth, not the higheſt degree of love, which is poſſible, but what we are
bound to do, and any defect herein is a ſinne; We admit that all graces are
not alike, no more then all ſinnes, one may be more holy then another; yet
he that is the higheſt attainer doth not reach to the utmoſt of the command;
and therefore whatever falleth ſhort of that, is damnable deſerving wrath of
God.</p>

                              <pb n="498" facs="tcp:57719:266"/>
Secondly, When we ſay no man is able to fullfill the Law of God in this life,
becauſe the fleſh doth ſtill abide in us; We mean not as if this were ſo, becauſe
God could not ſubdue it, or ſinne and the Devil were more potent then Chriſt,
but he hath in his Word declared, that he will not give ſuch a meaſure of grace
in this life, by the righteouſneſs whereof we ſhould be juſtified. So that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellio</hi>'s
exclamations in this caſe are ridiculous; here is no injury done to the
Spirit of God; we do not make Chriſt a <hi>ſemi</hi>-Saviour; for we readily grant,
That the Spirit of God could make us abſolutely free from ſinne in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an eye. In the hour of death we are immediately purged from all evil.
So that it's plain, the Spirit of God could make us thus compleat, but he will
not; neither doth this tend to his diſhonour, no more than that we die, that we are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ck, and carry about with us corruptible bodies. For did not Chriſt die that we
might have glorious bodies, that we might be redeemed from this corruption?
Yet this is not done immediately. Seeing then Chriſt hath aſſured us, that both
ſoul and body ſhall be made perfectly holy and happy in time, though it be not
done as ſoon as we would have it; we are not to cavil herein, but ſatisfie our
ſelves with the wiſdom of God, who doth every thing beautifull in his ſeaſon,
It is true, Chriſt when he cured bodily diſeaſes, he did perfectly cure them; but
doth it therefore follow, that he muſt do ſo in ſoul-diſeaſes, as <hi>Caſtellio</hi> urgeth?
No certainly, but rather as Chriſt, though he healed ſome perfectly of their
diſeaſes, yet he did not take away their mortality from them: So though by the
grace of God, we have ſtrength to overcome groſs ſinnes, yet we are not
made impeccable, as the glorified Saints in Heaven are, but there remaineth
the fuell of ſinne ſtill within us; not but that God could remove it, as he could
have inabled the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to have conquered all the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but becauſe
he will not; God could have made all the world at once, but he proceeded by
degrees; and thus he doth in our ſanctification. So that herein we are daily
taught to be humble in our ſelves, and to depend alone upon the grace of God.
It is true, if all ſinne were removed, and we confirmed in a ſtate of grace, then
there would be no danger of pride, as there is not in thoſe who are made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in Heaven: But were were we made perfect and delivered from all ſinne, yet
abiding ſtill in a mutable condition, we ſhould quickly be drunken with the
thoughts of our own excellencies; ſo that perfection, while we are in the way,
would not be ſo advantagious unto us, unleſs to perfection God ſhould alſo add
confirmation, and this would be to confound Heaven and earth together. And
thus much for the firſt Objection.</p>

                           <p>I Shall onely name a ſecond Objection made in the general againſt the reliques

<hi>That this Doctrine is an enemy to a holy life, it is pernicious to godlineſſe, that

                           <p>To the Objection we anſwer, There is no injury to godlineſſe offered by this

                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe we ſay it is every mans ſinne that he is not perfect, therefore we

that they were not active to deſtroy every <hi>Canaanite;</hi> whatſoever
cometh ſhort of the exact Rule of the Law is <hi>ſinfull,</hi> and thereby damnable:
Hence God is angry, not only with groſs ſinnes, but the imperfect graces of

God.</hi> I here was much emptineſs, much vacuity, the Church wanted ſolidity
and fulneſs in her duties: For this it is that the godly are ſubject to many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and temptations, they are under divers chaſtiſements, becauſe all the
droſſe of corruption is not yet purged from them. So that the godly man is ſo
farre from delighting and contenting himſelf in theſe imperfections that he
mourneth and groaneth under them.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, Here is no impediment to godlineſs, becauſe we preſs it as a duty
upon the godly, <hi>to be preſſing forward every day, to be perfecting holineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,</hi>
and that they are to take heed of ſelf-fulneſs, or to reſt contented in
low principles. Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
very terrible to ſuch as remain in their rudiments (as it were) and are not
carried out to perfection. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. are commanded
<hi>to perfect holineſſe in the fear of God.</hi> It is therefore our duty to endeavour after
perfection, as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth he did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. though he had not attained unto
it; but yet when all is done, <hi>Our perfection will be to bewail our imperfection;</hi>
we ſhall find abſolute purity is <hi>Res voti magis quam eveniûs,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> of old.
Hence the moſt godly have failed in the exerciſe of thoſe graces, which they
have been moſt eminent in; <hi>Abraham is called the father of the faithfull,</hi> whoſe
ſteps we are to follow; yet through fear in his <hi>lying or equivocating,</hi> he manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<hi>unbelief. Sarah</hi> is noted for obedience to her husband, and propounded as

doubt this is in a regenerate perſon ſo farre, as nature ſtill abideth in him; but
ſuch mens diſlike and renitency of conſcience doth not excuſe them, though
they be not ſuch great ſinners, as thoſe that ſinne without any remorſe, yet
their condition is damnable. Though ſuch have many good ſentences, and you
ſhall hear many good ſpeeches come from them, yet they are ſtill under the
bondage of ſinne; for though they have a knowledge condemning their ſinne,
yet it is but univerſal; when they come to the particular, then they are carried
away, or their knowledge is but habitually in them, not actually; as with
drunken men, or men in a ſleep; ſo that the good ſayings they utter, they
have no practical application of them, and therefore compared by <hi>Ariſtotle
(Lib.</hi> 7.) to a City, which was derided by this ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">

The City conſulteth and adviſeth, that yet regardeth not Laws, or
like ſuch who did utter <hi>Empedocles</hi> his grave ſentences. A ſad thing it is: And
oh how often is it for ſome men to ſpeak excellent religious truths in diſcourſe,
of which they have no practical power? <hi>Solomon</hi> hath two excellent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to this purpoſe, <hi>Prov. 26. 7. The legs of the lame are not equal, ſo is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in the mouth of fools.</hi> As the legs of a lame man being not equal, make
the going uncomely; ſo it is when a man hath good ſpeeches, but evil actions.
Again <hi>verſ. 9. As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, ſo is a parable in
the mouth of fools;</hi> As a drunkard feeleth not the ſharpneſs of a thorn running

while ſuch convictions of light are upon man, there is the more hope, and he
may be the more eaſily cured, inſomuch that he is not as evil, as a man habituated
and ſenſleſs in his ſinne. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That though an <hi>incontinent

a long time. <hi>Prudentius</hi> the Chriſtian Poet hath his <hi>Pſycomachia,</hi> wherein
ſome ſins and virtue, as chaſtity and uncleanneſs, covetouſneſs and liberality
are brought in combating with one another. And thus many times ſome godly
perſons in their unregenerate time have been entangled in ſome ſpecial luſt or
other. There are many aſſaults and skirmiſhes ere the work of grace doth
take full poſſeſſion. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth excellently declare this in his own experience

                           <p>IN the third place, <hi>There is the Combate in regenerate perſons between the work
of grace, and the fleſh in them.</hi> The former was only between the natural
conſcience and luſt; The ſecond between the Spirit of God, but moving and
working only in a man, and his corruption; The laſt between the Spirit of God
inhabiting and dwelling in a man, and the fleſh in him. So that if a Chriſtian
ask, <hi>How ſhall I know whether the combate I feel be between the Spirit and the fleſh,
or conſcience, and my luſt?</hi> Though practical Divines give many differences, yet
briefly in theſe three particulars, one conflict may be diſcovered from the
other.</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>From the principle and root.</hi> In the godly this ariſeth from a total renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the Image of God placed in a man: In the other it is only from partial
illumination or natural light.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>In the motive.</hi> This combate in the godly is upon holy grounds, out of
hatred to ſinne, out of love to that which is holy. In the other it is out of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and ſlaviſh fear, it is becauſe they would not be damned, it is becauſe of
horrour upon them, not any delight in God.</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>In the manner.</hi> In the other the fight is between two parts of the ſoul,
only the <hi>mind</hi> againſt the <hi>appetite;</hi> or if there be any work upon the heart, it is
but <hi>tranſitory</hi> and vaniſhing; whereas in the godly man this combate is <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi>
he hath will againſt <hi>will, love</hi> againſt <hi>love,</hi> as well as his mind againſt theſe.
Thus <hi>Auſtin (ibidem.</hi>) ſpeaketh of the two wils he had, his <hi>carnal</hi> will, and
his <hi>ſpiritual will;</hi> his meaning is, that becauſe his will was not ſo full and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as it ſhould, therefore he had two wils, as it were, <hi>Non igitur monſtrum,
&amp;c.</hi> ſaith he: It is not therefore a monſter <hi>partly to will,</hi> and <hi>partly to will;</hi>
but the ſickneſs of the mind that cannot riſe up fully to what is good; and
therefore there are two wils, becauſe one is not wholly and fully carried out to
that which is good. This expreſſion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> fully anſwereth that Objection,
when they demand, <hi>How can the will, will and nill at the ſame time?</hi> It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to ſay ſo. But <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwereth, It's therefore called two wils, or
therefore it is ſaid to will and nill, becauſe it doth will ſickly and faintly, It's
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:57719:268"/>
not ſo throughly and totally carried out to God as it ought to be; and this halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like that of <hi>Jacobs</hi> thigh will go with us to the grave. Thus we are as <hi>weak
men</hi> that are partly well, and partly ſick, as the <hi>twy-light,</hi> when it is partly
light, and partly darkneſs, or as <hi>wine mingled</hi> with water; not that in ſuch a
mixture we are able to ſay, this part is water, and the other part is meer wine:
So we muſt not think that in a regenerate man, one part is meerly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
the other meerly carnal, but the corruption in a man doth adhere to
every part that is ſanctified; and therefore as the principle is mixed, ſo
are the actions which flow from it. But it is time to haſten to the laſt

                           <p>1. The Guilt.</p>
                           <p>2. The Dominion, and both theſe are removed in a regenerate
perſon.</p>
                           <p>3. There is the ſenſe or preſence of it, and that is not taken away but by
death.</p>
                           <p>4. Some adde the Root of it, and that (they ſay) is not deſtroyed till
the body be conſumed to aſhes. For although it be true, that death put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
an end to all ſinne, yet that muſt be underſtood of an ultimate and
final death; otherwiſe if it be a diſpenſatory death, as it was to <hi>Lazarus</hi>
and ſome others; as that did not put a period to their bodily miſeries,
when they lived again, ſo neither did it to ſinfulneſs in their ſouls. But
even <hi>Lazarus</hi> and ſuch like perſons raiſed upon a ſpecial economy were
regenerated but in part; and this conflict of fleſh and Spirit was in them,
and ſo they needed to pray for forgiveneſs of ſinne. But though we muſt
acknowledge, that original ſinne hath not the power in a godly man it
once had. All the difficulty is, Whether it be by ſuppreſſion of it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or aboliſhing part of it; and if original ſinne be in part diminiſhed,
How can the whole of it be propagated to the child? Or why may not
the laſt part of it be conſumed in this life? It may be this Queſtion may
be more ſubtil then profitable. <hi>Scotus,</hi> as <hi>Pererius</hi> alledgeth him (<hi>in</hi>
Rom. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.) thinketh that in a godly man original ſinne is not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
onely grace is every day augmented, and ſo that cannot weigh us
down, as it did before: As (ſaith he) if an Eagle ſhould have any
weight upon her, but the ſtrength of her wings be increaſed, then though
the weight were not diminiſhed, yet becauſe her ſtrength is increaſed, it
would not hinder her in flying. But to anſwer this Queſtion, we muſt
conclude, that in regeneration original ſinne is more then ſuppreſſed,
there is a qualitative change, and ſo a diminiſhing of darkneſſe in the
mind, by light; of evil in the will by holineſſe: So that the encreaſing of
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:57719:269"/>
theſe graces do neceſſarily argue the decreaſing of original ſinn. And
For this purpoſe the Scripture uſeth thoſe termes of <hi>crucifying</hi> and <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying;</hi>
onely when we ſay, original ſinne is diminiſhed: You muſt not
underſtand it hath <hi>quantative</hi> parts, as if they were cut off by degrees, but
<hi>poteſtative,</hi> that is, the power and efficacy of original ſinne is not ſo lively,
ſo vehement as it was once, yet where it is thus weakned, a regenerate
perſon begetteth a ſonne in an unregenerate eſtate, becauſe he is the ſonne
of <hi>Adam</hi> fallen, and is not a father as he is godly, but as he is a man.
Now though it doth thus tenaciouſly adhere unto us, yet death will give
it a final and full blow: not death meerly, as it is a diſſolution in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
way (ſo that <hi>Caſtellio</hi> doth abſurdly endeavour to perplex this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
with curious interrogatories) but as the nature of it is altered
by Chriſt, the Spirit of God putting forth its greateſt efficacy at that
time: Yea though a godly man ſhould be ſo overcome by a diſeaſe, that
he were not able to act faith in Chriſt at that time, for the utter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of ſinne in him, yet his faith formerly put forth on Chriſt for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and the promiſe of God at that time will effectually conquer all. This
being ſo, how ought the godly gladly to ſubmit to death? The terrible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour
of it is now taken away. No vain thoughts, no wordly or diſtempered
affections ſhall ever moleſt thee more. It is not death to thee, but to thy
ſinne. It is not a death to thy graces and comforts, but to thy corruptions,

                           </gap>, <hi>Acts 17. 18. A
trifling babler.</hi> Hence becauſe of the difficulty to receive this
truth, <hi>Syneſius</hi> was ordained Biſhop, though as yet not perſwaded of the
Doctrine, which afterwards by the grace of God towards him, he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.
Yea it's obſerved, That the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> when made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
received this as the laſt Article of their Chriſtian faith, becauſe ſo contrary to
thoſe Philoſophical principles they had been accuſtomed unto. The <hi>Sadduces</hi>
alſo denied this main Article, but they might be ſuppoſed to do it upon corrupt
grounds futable to their luſts; for being (though not ſo numerous, nor ſo
applauded for piety by the people, as the Phariſees were, yet) for the moſt
part the richeſt and moſt wealthy, they imbraced that opinion, which denied
the Reſurrection, as being more convenient for their carnal hearts, and that
they might with more delight and ſecurity give themſelves up to this preſent
world. But the Apoſtle doth here moſt induſtriouſly and powerfully confirm
this Doctrine, which if not true, all our Chriſtian Religion would be in
vain.</p>
                        <p>The principal Argument to prove this Doctrine is from the Reſurrection of
Chriſt: For the riſing as our Head, it neceſſarily followeth his members ſhould
alſo riſe to ſuch glory and immortality. So that Chriſts Reſurrection doth
neceſſarily inferre outs, which made the primitive Chriſtians ſo affected with
it, that in their ordianry ſalutations, whenmeeting with one another, they
did uſe to ſay. <hi>Chriſtus reſurrexit,</hi> Chriſt is riſen. For this end, Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>The firſt fruit of them that ſlept,</hi> verſ. 20. As the firſt fruits did ſanctifie
the whole harveſt of corn that was afterwards to be gathered: So did Chriſt
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:57719:270"/>
riſing, all his members by his Reſurrection, aſſuring them of theirs. Hence
it is that the Apoſtles Arguments are not to prove the Reſurrection of wicked
men (for they ariſe upon another account) but onely of the godly who are his
members, and have an intereſt in his mediation.</p>
                        <p>It is indeed a Diſpute, <hi>Whether even wicked men do not riſe by the virtue of
Chriſts merit, and his Reſurrection. Baldwine</hi> for determining the negative
(<hi>in locum.</hi>) is traduced by another <hi>Lutheran</hi> for <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
that Doctrine of the particularity of Chriſts death. But certainly,
<hi>The wicked mans reſurrection is not to be accounted in the number of any mercies,
and therefore not merited by Chriſt.</hi> Hence it followeth neceſſarily, that they riſe
not by any relation to Chriſt, but by the power and juſtice of God, becauſe of
that immutable and unchangeable Decree, that every ſinner unrepenting
ſhall die both temporally and eternally, which later could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
unleſſe the bodies of wicked men were raiſed up to life again out of
the duſt.</p>
                        <p>Now our Apoſtle to prove Chriſt the cauſe of our Reſurrection, draweth
an Argument from a compariſon between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>him,</hi> making them two
originals and fountains, but of contrary effects, the one of <hi>death,</hi> the other of
<hi>life; For as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive.</hi> Not that all men
univerſally ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt; but the <hi>univerſal particle</hi> muſt be limited
according to the <hi>ſubject matter in hand; All that are in Chriſt, all that are his
members ſhall be made alive by him.</hi> And therefore in the next verſe it is ſo limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Chriſt the firſt-fruits,</hi> and afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming;
So that the ſenſe is, <hi>That as all Adams poſterity die, becauſe of him, ſo all that
are Chriſts ſeed ſhall live by him.</hi> For the expreſſion <hi>in Adam,</hi> and <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> do
denote a <hi>cauſality</hi> in them, the one of death, the other of life. Therefore we
muſt not think, that the Apoſtle doth here only make a bare ſimilitude and
compariſon, ſhewing that as by <hi>Adam</hi> we die, ſo by <hi>Chriſt we ſhall be made
alive,</hi> but it's an Argument from the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>cauſality</hi> that is in one to the
other.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle doth in the fifth of the <hi>Romans</hi> make the like compariſon, only
there is this difference, as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerveth. In that place the Apoſtle maketh
the compariſon chiefly in reſpect of ſpiritual effects, death as it brings condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and life as it is accompanied with juſtification here, and glorification
hereafter. This Text is greatly agitated in the controverſie between <hi>Puccius</hi>
and <hi>Socinus, (Vide Diſput. de ſtatu primi hominis ante lapſum.</hi>) The former
holding truly (though he ſuperaddeth many groſs errors) that <hi>Adam</hi> was not
made mortal, and that death came in only by ſinne: only he goeth abſurdly
beyond his bounds, when he holdeth the beaſts were alſo made immortal. The
<hi>later</hi> on the contrary he holdeth, <hi>That Adam was made mortal, that death
in natural, that though by ſinne we are under a perpetual neceſſity of death,</hi> (which
is an ambiguous phraſe he uſeth) <hi>yet death it ſelf is natural;</hi> He granteth,
<hi>That immature and violent death cometh by ſinne; but death as it is a meer diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a perſon, ſo it is from his primitive creation and conſtitution.</hi> Therefore be
would have this difference between the Text I am upon, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe
in the fifth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> viz. That there indeed he ſpeaketh of the ſinne of
<hi>Adam,</hi> by which we come to die; <hi>But here he would have the Apoſtle conſider</hi>
Adam <hi>as he is by Creation, and that being mortal from the beginning we alſo are
mortal from him.</hi> But who can perſwade himſelf, that theſe paſſages concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the change of the body hereafter to what it is now? <hi>It is ſown in corruption,
it's raiſed in corruption, it is ſowen in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory, it is ſowen in
weakneſſe, it is raiſed in power,</hi> are to be underſtood of our bodies, as at the
firſt Creation, and not as they are now by <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall? Our bodies are made
corruptible and vile bodies by reaſon of ſinne. We muſt then underſtand the
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57719:270"/>
Apoſtle as ſpeaking of <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning, though ſinne be not here named. So
that the fifth of the <hi>Romans</hi> will excellently illuſtrate this place; and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the ſenſe to be, <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>ſinning, by his ſinne death entered upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
ſo that death is not natural, neither doth it ariſe from our firſt conſtitution,
but it cometh in wholly by ſinne.</hi>

                        <p>HAving then heretofore ſpoken of ſome ſpiritual effects of original ſinne,
(and more might be named, ſuch as a <hi>neceſſity</hi> to ſinne, an <hi>impotency</hi> to all
good, <hi>ſenſleſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſtupidity</hi> therein, <hi>the aldom</hi> to Satan; but I ſhall paſs them
by, (as being very proper to the Common-place of Divinity, which is <hi>of the
grace of God,</hi> and <hi>mans free-will</hi>) and ſhall proceed to the effects of original
ſinne that are of another nature, and that is <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal death.</hi> The
former effects did ſo ſlow from original ſinne, as that alſo they are <hi>ſinfull proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in a man, but theſe are meerly <hi>puniſhments.</hi> It is not our ſinne that we are
<hi>ſick,</hi> that we <hi>die,</hi> but it is the effect. From the words then we obſerve this truth

                        <p>
                           <hi>That death cometh upon all mankind, becauſe of our ſinne we have originally
from Adam.</hi> It is true, the <hi>Socinian</hi> will ſay, We put more in the Doctrine,
then is in the Text; but you heard the compariſon uſed by the Apoſtle in the fifth
of the <hi>Romans</hi> compared with this, doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe death to be, becauſe
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, not only as imputed unto us, but becauſe thereby we are
made inherently ſinfull. This truth is of a very vaſt compaſſe, but I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine

                           <p>FIrſt, <hi>This controverſie about mans mortality is very famous in the Church, and
hath been of old ſolliciouſly diſputed.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians</hi> as they denied original
ſinne, ſo conſonantly to that falſhood they affirmed, <hi>That death was not the
puniſhment of ſinne, but did ariſe by the neceſſity of our natural conſtitution;</hi>
Which Aſſertion was condemned by ſome Councils, and the Laws of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
as injurious to God the Creator of men. For this experience, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
new born are ſubject to many miſeries, and death it ſelf, was a thorn in
their ſides, which they could not endure <hi>in,</hi> nor yet poſſibly pull <hi>out.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the <hi>Stocks</hi> they would deny <hi>death to be an evil.</hi> Sometimes they
would ſay, Children <hi>in the womb</hi> are guilty of <hi>actual</hi> ſinnes, for which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
death: but that which they did moſt conſtantly adhere unto, was, <hi>That
Adam was made mortal, and would have died, if he had not ſinned, death being
a neceſſary conſequence</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>from a mans corporal conſtitution.</hi> The
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> eſpecially the Schoolmen of old, and the Jeſuites of late (to whom
<hi>Janſenius</hi> doth vehemently oppoſe in this point, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, as the Greek ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is) ſay, That <hi>Adam</hi> was indeed by <hi>nature mortal,</hi> but by <hi>grace</hi> and
ſuperadded favour, he was immortal. So that both Papiſts and Proteſtants
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:57719:271"/>
agree in this, That <hi>Adam</hi> was made immortal in his Creation: Only the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is, Whether as original righteouſneſs, ſo immortality may be ſaid to
be natural or ſupernatural to <hi>Adam;</hi> We ſay it's natural, they ſay it's ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;
and yet <hi>Bellarmine (De gratiâ primi Hom. lib. cap.</hi> 5.) in his explication
of himſelf in this point cometh very near us, or at leaſt ſpeaketh contradictions
to himſelf: For (he ſaith) if natural be taken for that which was put into man
from his nativity, if natural be taken for that which was to be propagated to
<hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity; if natural be taken for that which is convenient, to perfect
and prepare a man for his end, then they ſay original righteouſneſs, and ſo by
conſequence immortality would have been natural to <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity; but if
we take natural for that which doth internally conſtitute nature, or neceſſarily
flow from the principles of nature, then (they ſay) immortality was ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
even as original righteouſneſſe. But the Proteſtants, when they
call original righteouſneſſe natural, they doe not meane <hi>effectivè,</hi> as
if it were not the gift of God beſtowed upon us, as if it did flow
from the principles of nature; but <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> that is, original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and immortality were not ſupernatural to <hi>Adam,</hi> as they are now
to us, being we are corrupted, but connatural, or <hi>a due perfection to
man, ſuppoſing God created him for ſuch an end, as to enjoy himſelf.</hi> So that it is
due not ſo much to the nature of man, as to Gods Order and Decree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man. Thus as in birds, ſuppoſing God would have them to flie, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
they ſhould have wings, (though they come from a natural principle)
ſo in man, ſuppoſing God made him for communion with, and enjoyment of
himſelf, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be indewed with holineſs (<hi>Though
flowing not from nature, but concreated by God with man.</hi>) Thus that which is
the gift of God, and cometh only from him, may be in reſpect of the ſubject
a due perfection. It was thus with <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of his ſoul, that was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
immediately by God, it did not flow from any natural cauſes; yet ſuppoſing
God would make him a rational creature, then this became a due perfection to
him. <hi>Adam then was immortal by nature in a well-explained ſenſe, as he had a
reaſonable ſoul by nature.</hi> But however it be, Proteſtants and many Papiſts
agree in the thing, that he was made immortal; only they differ in the manner
How. Now the <hi>Socinian</hi> differeth <hi>from all;</hi> for he dogmatizeth, <hi>That</hi> Adam
<hi>was made mortal, that death was natural,</hi> and denieth any <hi>original righteouſneſſe
or immortality that was beſtowed upon</hi> Adam <hi>any way.</hi> It is true, ſometimes he
ſaith, That though <hi>Adam</hi> was made mortal, yet God might have preſerved him
from actual death <hi>by ſome way or other;</hi> only that he was made immortal, that
he <hi>denieth.</hi> So that what the Papiſts dream about their imaginary <hi>pure naturals,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>God might have created man ſo: Socinians</hi> affirm <hi>defacto,</hi> it was ſo. The
late Writer Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is alſo poſitive for <hi>Adam</hi>'s mortality by nature, <hi>That</hi> Adam
<hi>was made mortal by nature</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is infinitely certain, and proved by his
eating and drinking,</hi> &amp;c. (Further Explicat. <hi>pag.</hi> 453.) inſtancing in thoſe
Arguments the <hi>Socinians</hi> uſe to bring. All which Aſſertions do directly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

                           <head type="sub">How many wayes a thing may be ſaid to be Immortal; and in which
of them man is ſo.</head>
                           <p>SEcondly, When we ſay, God made <hi>Adam</hi> immortal, and that upon his
tranſgreſſion both himſelf and his poſterity are ſubjected to a neceſſity of
death, <hi>We muſt rightly underſtand in what ſenſe he is ſaid to be ſo.</hi> For</p>
                           <p>1. A thing may be ſaid to be <hi>immortal abſolutely and eſſentially,</hi> having no
principles of death within, nor cannot be deſtroyed by any cauſe without.
Thus 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 16. God</hi> is ſaid <hi>only to have immortality.</hi> This is that comfortable
attribute which the people of God make uſe of under all changes and viciſſitudes,
God is alwayes the ſame. Though father die, though mother die, yet God
doth not; as one in the Eccleſiaſtical Story ſaid, when word was brought him,
that his father was dead, <hi>Deſine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>blaſphemias loqui, pater enim meus
immortalis eſt,</hi> Ceaſe to ſpeak blaſphemy for my father is immortal.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>That may be ſaid to be immortal, which is ſo by ſome ſingular dispenſation
of God,</hi> either in reſpect of <hi>mercy,</hi> or of <hi>juſtice;</hi> and thus it is with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
bodies of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the damned bodies of <hi>wicked</hi> men; for the Saints
their vile bodies ſhall be made like Chriſts glorious body, they are raiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibility
and glory; and as for the bodies of damned perſons, though
they be raiſed to reproach and diſhonour, yet by Gods juſtice they are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
immortal; ſo that the fire cannot conſume them to aſhes, neither ſhall
length of time ever deſtroy them. For if God could make the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> cloaths
and ſhoes to laſt ſo many years without being conſumed, no wonder if he do a
greater matter upon the bodies of men.</p>
                           <p>3. That may be ſaid to be <hi>immortal, which by the will of the Creator is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
that being ſeparated from all matter, it hath no principles of diſſolution
from within.</hi> And thus the <hi>Angels</hi> are immortal, they have no principle of
corruption within, yet they are annihilable by the power of God; ſhould God
withdraw his preſervation of them they would ceaſe to be, but from within
they have no cauſe of diſſolution. The Devils alſo in this ſenſe are immortal,
and that is the reaſon, though many wicked and bloudy perſecutors of Gods
Church have died, yet the Devil being immortal hath ſtirred up new ones,
which made a good man ſay to one who did greatly rejoyce at the death of a
cruel perſecutor, <hi>At diabolus non moritur,</hi> but the Devil doth not die.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, A thing may be ſaid to be <hi>immortal, Conditionally ſuppoſing ſuch and
ſuch conditions he performed, and in this ſenſe only we ſay, God made</hi> Adam <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal;</hi>

ſtand, and to a power to be freed from death. So that we do not ſay, <hi>Adam</hi>
had ſuch an immortality as the glorified bodies have that cannot die, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
onely. As he had in him power to ſinne, ſo he had a power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
himſelf of all happineſſe and immortality, which fell out alſo to our
utter undoing. <hi>Autin</hi>'s expreſſion of <hi>Poſſe non mori,</hi> and <hi>Non poſſe mori,</hi>

                              <hi>Propoſ. 3. ALthough we ſay that God made man immortal, yet we grant, that
his body being made of the duſt of the earth, and compounded of
contrary element, it had therefore a remote power of death.</hi> It was mortal in a
<hi>remote ſenſe, only God making him in ſuch an eminent manner, and for ſo glorious
an end, there was no proxim and immediate dispoſition to death.</hi> God indeed gave
<hi>Adam</hi> his name (whereas <hi>Adam</hi> impoſed a name upon all other creatures, but
not himſelf) and that from the originals he was made of, to teach him humility
even in that excellent eſtate, <hi>yet he was not in an immediate dispoſition to death,</hi>
When <hi>Adam</hi> had tranſgreſſed Gods Law, though he did not <hi>actually die</hi> upon it,
yet then he was put into a <hi>mortal ſtate,</hi> having the prepared cauſes of death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him; but it was not ſo, while he ſtood in the ſtate of integrity, <hi>then</hi> it was an
immortal ſtate, <hi>now</hi> it is a mortal one; I ſay <hi>ſtate,</hi> becauſe even now, though
<hi>Adam</hi> hath brought ſinne and death upon us, yet in reſpect of the ſoul a man
may be ſaid to be immortal, but then there was immortality in reſpect of ſoul
and body, the <hi>ſtate</hi> he was created in, did require it. So that although <hi>death be
the King of terrors,</hi> yet indeed original ſinne, which is the cauſe of it, ſhould
be more terrible unto us. Now man by ſinne is fallen, the beaſts could they
ſpeak would ſay; Man is become like one of us, yea worſe, for he carrieth
about with him a ſinfull ſoul, and a mortal body.</p>

                           <p>THe fourth Propoſition is, <hi>That from the former premiſſes, it may be deducted,
that in ſeveral reſpects Adam may be ſaid to be created mortal, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi>
yet if we would ſpeak abſolutely to the queſtion, when demanding how
<hi>Adam</hi> was created, we muſt return, <hi>Immortall.</hi> Some indeed, becauſe mans
mortalilty and immortality depended wholy upon his will, as he did will to
ſinne, or not to ſinne; ſo they have ſaid he was <hi>neither made mortal, or immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
but capable of either; but that is not to ſpeak conſonantly to that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of ſtate which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in; for as <hi>Adam</hi> was created <hi>righteous,</hi> not
<hi>indifferent,</hi> (as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay,) neither good or bad, but capacious of
either qualification; ſo he was alſo made <hi>immortal,</hi> not in a neutral or middle
ſtate between mortal and immortal; ſo that he had <hi>inchoate</hi> immortality upon
his creation, but <hi>not conſummate</hi> or confirmed, without reſpect to perſeverance
in his obedience: for the ſtate of integrity was, as it were the beginning of that
future ſtate of glory. Again <hi>Adam</hi> might be called <hi>mortal</hi> in reſpect of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals
of his body being taken out of the duſt of the earth, but that was only
in a <hi>remote power,</hi> ſo God did ſo adorne him with excellent qualifications in

and immediate diſpoſition, much leſs into an actual death, for a thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> may be ſaid
to be mortal, 1. In reſpect of the <hi>matter,</hi> and thus indeed <hi>Adams</hi> body in a
remote ſence was corruptible.</p>
                           <p>2. In reſpect of the <hi>forme.</hi> Thus Philoſophers ſay ſublunary things are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
becauſe the matter of them hath reſpect to divers formes, whereas
they call the heavens incorruptible, becauſe the matter is ſufficiently actuated
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:57719:272"/>
by one forme, and hath no inclination to another; and thus <hi>Adam</hi> might truly
be ſaid to be <hi>immortal,</hi> for it was very congruous that a body ſhould be united
to the ſoul that was ſutable to it; for that being the form of a man, and having
an inclination or appetite to the body, if man had been made mortal at firſt,
the natural appetite would in a great meaſure have been fruſtrated, it being for
a little ſeaſon only united to the body, and perpetually ever afterwards ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from it: Surely as an Artificer doth not uſe to put a precious Diamond or
Pearl into a leaden Ring; ſo neither would God at firſt joyn ſuch a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
body to ſo glorious and an immortal ſoul.</p>
                           <p>3. A thing may be ſaid to be mortal in reſpect of <hi>efficiency:</hi> and thus it is
plain <hi>Adam</hi> was not made mortal: for he might through the grace of God aſſiſting
have procured immortality to himſelf; that threatening to <hi>Adam, In the day he
ſhould eat of that forbidden fruit, he ſhould die the death,</hi> Gen. 2, 17. doth plainly
demonſtrate, that had he not tranſgreſſed Gods command, he ſhould never
have died.</p>
                           <p>4. A thing may be ſaid to be mortal in reſpect of its <hi>end;</hi> Thus all the beaſts
of the field, (whatſoever <hi>Puccius</hi> thought) are <hi>mortal,</hi> becauſe their end was
for man, to ſerve him; ſo that it is a wild poſition to affirm, as he doth, that
there ſhall be a reſurrection of beaſts, as well as of men, for they were made
both in reſpect of matter, form, and end, altogether mortal, whereas <hi>Adam</hi>
was made after the Image of God, to have communion and fellowſhip with
God, and that for ever, which could not be without immortality.</p>

Chriſtians come to know that there are <hi>three principal cauſes of death;</hi> ſo that
had not they been, thoſe intermedious and proxime cauſes of death had never
been: The firſt cauſe is only by <hi>occaſion</hi> and temptation, and that was the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi>
he tempted our firſt parents, and thereby was an occaſion to let death
into the world: for this cauſe the Devil is called, <hi>Joh. 8. 44. a murderer from
the beginning;</hi> it doth not ſo much relate to <hi>Cain,</hi> as to <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion;
yet the Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. doth not attribute death to the <hi>Devil,</hi> but to <hi>one mans</hi>
diſobedience, becauſe <hi>Adams</hi> will was not forced by Satan, he had power to
have reſiſted his temptations, only the Devil was the tempting cauſe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and moſt proper cauſe of death was <hi>Adams diſobedience;</hi> ſo that death is
a puniſhment of that ſinne, not a natural conſequent of mans conſtitution.
The Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> as related by <hi>Moſes</hi> doth evidently confirme this, that
there was no footſtep of death, till he tranſgreſſed Gods Law, and upon that it
was moſt juſt, that he who had deprived himſelf of <hi>Gods Image, which is the
life of the ſoul.</hi> ſhould alſo be deprived of his <hi>ſoul,</hi> which is the life of the <hi>body;</hi>
that as when he rebelled againſt God, he preſently felt an internal rebellion by
luſts within, and an external diſobedience of all creatures, whom he did rule
over before by a pacifical dominion; ſo alſo it was juſt, that he who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
himſelf of ſpiritual life, ſhould alſo be diveſted of his natural life. Hence
it is that the Apoſtle informeth us of that, which all the natural wiſe men of the

unto the ground: for out of it waſt thou taken.</hi> In this ſentence there is matter
enough to humble us; there is not a thiſtle in thy corn, not a weed in thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but it may put thee in mind of original ſinne; yea there is not the leaſt
pain or ach of thy body, but this may witneſs it to thee: ſo that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith
truly, we do <hi>circumferre teſtimonium,</hi> &amp;c. We carry about with us daily full
evidence to confirme this Doctrine of original ſinne: for ſuch evils and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
as do neceſſarily follow our ſpecifical nature, accompanying us as men,
they cannot be attributed unto any other cauſe but original ſin; which conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>viz.</hi> of mankind being univerſally plunged into miſeries, and not knowing the
cauſe thereof, made the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and ſome Heretiques conclude, that the
ſoules of men had ſinned formerly, and by way of puniſhment were therefore
adjudged to theſe mortal and wretched bodyes. Though death be only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
becauſe that is moſt terrible, and all other miſeries tend thereunto;
yet they are neceſſarily included. Some ask the Queſtion, Why God did not
threaten hell, rather then death; but no doubt eternal death is underſtood in
this commination, for temporal and eternal death are the wages of ſinne, only
death is mentioned as being moſt terrible to ſenſe, men being more affected
with that, then with hell which is believed by faith. The Scripture then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
death only, how abſurd and prepoſterous are the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who in
that threatning will comprehend any thing but death; <hi>death they ſay cometh from
the neceſſity of that matter we are conſtituted of,</hi> but ſickneſs, labour, and ſuch
miſeries, as alſo eternal death, theſe are the proper fruit of ſinne: Thus men
delivered up to errour, are hurried from one dangeous precipice to another.
But let Chriſtians in all deſeaſes, miſeries, and death it ſelf, look higher then
the Philoſopher, or the Phyſitian: Let them acquaint themſelves with original
ſinne, and thereupon humble themſelves under Gods hand.</p>

                              <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 7. ALthough it be agreed upon by all, except <hi>Socinians</hi> and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents,
that <hi>Adam</hi> was made immortal at leaſt by grace, and
the favour of his Creator; <hi>yet there is difference among the Popiſh Writers, upon
what to faſten the ground of his immortality:</hi> What was the cauſe of it, therein
they diſagree. Some place it in a certain <hi>vigor</hi> and excellency that was then in
the ſoul, whereby it was able to preſerve the body from death: <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
liketh not this, (<hi>De opere ſex dierum Diſput.</hi> 28.) and therefore he doth affirm,
that the body of <hi>Adam</hi> was made immortal and impaſſible, <hi>by an habitual gift
beſtowed upon it,</hi> which he ſaith was <hi>a corporeal quality extended through the whole
body;</hi> Becauſe, ſaith he, this immortality was not a tranſient thing, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
gift, ſutable to that ſtate; and God is uſed to give permanent gifts, not
immediately, but by ſome inherent principle: Even as the glorified bodies are
made immortal by ſome intrinſecal quality accommodated to that ſtate; yea
and the bodies of the damned alſo, though they are immortal, yet they are not
impaſſible, becauſe they are tormented in the flames of hell fire. But <hi>Suarez
(Lib. 3. de hominis Creatione cap.</hi> 14.) doth upon good grounds reject any ſuch
ſuppoſed corporeal quality, as being without any foundation from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and introducing a miraculous way without neceſſity. For who can think,
that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch an <hi>intrinſecal quality</hi> in his body, that <hi>fire</hi> would not burn
him? that if he went upon the <hi>waters,</hi> his body would not ſink? <hi>Others</hi> they
attribute his immortality to the <hi>tree of life,</hi> that was (ſay they) both <hi>alimentum,
&amp; medicamentum;</hi> as it was both nouriſhment, ſo it preſerved life; and as it was
medicinal, ſo it did repair that partial abating of natural ſtrength in concoction,
which would otherwiſe in time have come upon man: But this opinion taketh
that for granted, which yet is greatly controverted, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was called the
tree of life, as if there had been ſome <hi>active phyſical power</hi> in the fruit thereof
to continue a mans life, either for a long time, as ſome think, or for ever, as
others; whether indeed <hi>once</hi> eating of it, or <hi>conſtant</hi> eating was neceſſary, as
opportunity did require, is alſo debated by curious Authors; for ſome
make it to be called a tree of life, onely <hi>Symbolically,</hi> as being a
ſigne of eternall life, which <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have enjoyed had he continued
in obedience. And truly though it ſhould be granted, that there was ſuch a
virtue in the tree, yet when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, it would no wayes have helped
him, or preſerved him from death, becauſe the <hi>wages of ſinne is death,</hi> and
therefore would not have produced that in him, which it is ſuppoſed that it
might have had in <hi>Adam</hi>'s obedience; yet God would caſt him out from Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
leſt he ſhould eat of that tree: For it was juſt that he who had incurred
the ſentence of death by his tranſgreſſion, ſhould be deprived of all the <hi>ſigns</hi>
of life, and ſymbols of Gods favour. Furthermore this tree of life, was not it
ſelf immortal; Would that alwayes have continued? Was not that ſubject to
alterations as well as other trees? How then can mans immortality be attributed
to that? Seeing then there is ſo much uncertainty amongſt Schoolmen upon
what to place <hi>Adam</hi>'s immortality, the Orthodox do conſonantly to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
put it upon theſe things, concurring as cauſes to preſerve him from
death.</p>
                           <p>The firſt is, <hi>That excellent conſtitution and harmony of his body, whereby there
could not be any humour peccant or exceſſive.</hi> So that from within there would not
have ſprung any diſeaſe. And although in <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating and drinking, being
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:57719:274"/>
nouriſhed thereby, there would neceſſarily have been ſome alteration in him,
by deperdition and reſtauration, which is in all nouriſhment; yet that would
have been in part onely, not ſo as to make any total change upon his
body.</p>
                           <p>2. The ſecond cauſe was, <hi>That original righteouſneſſe which God made him in.</hi>
For ſeeing ſinne only is the meritorious cauſe of death, while <hi>Adam</hi> was thus
holy and abſolutely free from all ſinne, death had no way to enter in upon the
body.</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>There was the providence of God in a ſpecial manner preſerving of him,
ſo that death could not come by any extrinſecal cauſe upon him.</hi> No doubt
but <hi>Adam</hi>'s body was vulnerable: a ſword if thruſt into his heart, would
have taken away his life; but ſuch was the peculiar providence of God
to him in that condition, that no evil or hurtfull thing could befall
him.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, and above all, <hi>Gods appointment and divine ordination, was the main
and chief cauſe of his immortality.</hi> For if the Scripture ſay, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 3.) in
the general, <hi>That man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the mouth of the Lord,</hi> then this was alſo true in <hi>Adam:</hi> And if we
read of <hi>Elias,</hi> that he went fourty dayes in the ſtrength of a little bread that
he did eat, Is it any wonder, that the appointment of God ſhould work ſuch
immunity from death in <hi>Adam?</hi> Whereas then there are three things about
death conſiderable, the <hi>potentia</hi> or power, the <hi>actus,</hi> or death it ſelf, and the
<hi>neceſſity, Adam</hi> was free from all theſe; unleſſe by power we mean a <hi>remote</hi>
power; for if he had not had this power of dying, then he could not have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into the neceſſity of death. Thus you ſee the excellent conſtitution of his
body, original righteouſneſs, a divine providence, and Gods order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
therein did ſufficiently preſerve <hi>Adam,</hi> not only from actual death, or the
neceſſity of death, or death as a puniſhment; but alſo from any diſpoſition,
or habitual principle within him of death and it may be from this ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality

                           <p>LEt us proceed to prove our Doctrine, <hi>That through</hi> Adam <hi>ſinning we are
made ſinners, and ſo mortal,</hi> which neceſſarily ſuppoſeth that <hi>Adam</hi> was
made immortal, and that death had nothing to do with mankind, till ſinne came
into the world.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Argument is, <hi>From that glorious condition</hi> Adam <hi>was made in, and
alſo the excellent end he was created for.</hi> All which would have been horribly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured,
if death or mortality had then been preſent. The fears and thoughts
of death are a bitter herb in the ſweeteſt diſh that is; when of any comfort we
have, we may ſay as the young Prophets to their maſter, there is <hi>mors in ella,</hi>
death in the pot; death in this or that mercy thou enjoyeſt, this doth greatly
abate our delight. Therefore we read of one of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> a <hi>Lewis,</hi>
that forbad all thoſe who attended him, ever to make any mention of death in
his ears; that prophane man thought, ſuch a ſpeech would damp his delights.
Seeing then Gods purpoſe was to make a man ſuch an excellent and bleſſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
can we think he was made mortal, and that it might have been ſaid to
him, <hi>This night thy ſoul ſhall be taken away, and then whoſe ſhall this Paradiſe,
and all theſe goodly enjoyments be?</hi> It is the Scriptures deſigne to aggravate the
goodneſs of God towards man, and to ſhew the excellency and honour God
put upon him. Whereas the <hi>Socinians</hi> directly oppoſe this purpoſe of Gods Spirit,
and would make man as miſerable as may be. Hence they ſay, he was created
like a <hi>meer innocent,</hi> that he had not much more knowledge than an <hi>Infant,</hi>
that he had <hi>no original righteouſneſs,</hi> that he was made <hi>mortal.</hi> Yea <hi>Socinus,
(Resp. ad Puc. cap 14 pag.</hi> 106.) cavils at the explication of that place, <hi>Geneſ.</hi>
2. 8. which is owned by all Interpreters, about the <hi>garden in Eden.</hi> which God
placed <hi>Adam</hi> in; he would not have any ſuch <hi>place of pleaſure or delight</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
thereby. But although the word may be retained as a proper name,
<hi>Eden,</hi> for ſo our Engliſh Tranſlators do, yet becauſe it cometh of a word that
ſignifieth to delight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 12. The Church of God hath alwayes intepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it of a place of delight, yea that Heaven is called <hi>Paradiſe</hi> alluſively there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
and therefore it's horrible impudency in <hi>Socinus</hi> to ſay, that place was
not called <hi>Eden,</hi> when God planted it at firſt, but in following ages it received
that appellation. Thus whereas the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth admire the goodneſs of God,
for the honour put upon man at the Creation. This <hi>Heretique</hi> laboureth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe

                           <p>ANd if <hi>Adam</hi> had been made ſo righteous and glorious, yet ſubject to
death he would have been like that building <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. Whoſe
foundation was of gold and precious ſtones, but the ſuperſtructure hay and ſtubble:</hi>
Or like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, which was partly of <hi>gold,</hi> with other addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:57719:275"/>
and partly of <hi>clay;</hi> all which would have redounded to the diſhonour
of God his maker; neither could it ſo well be ſaid, <hi>By one man,</hi> (or by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)
<hi>death came into the world,</hi> as by God who is ſuppoſed to make man in ſuch
a mortal and frail eſtate.</p>
                           <p>But I proceed to a ſecond Argument, and that may be drawn <hi>from the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
made by God to</hi> Adam <hi>upon his diſobedience, compared with the execution of
this ſentence afterward, which might be enough to convince any, though never ſo
refractory.</hi> The threatning to <hi>Adam</hi> we have recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. where
God prohibiting him to eat of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
this Law with a penalty (viz.) <hi>That in the day he did eat thereof, he
ſhould ſurely die: dying thou ſhalt die;</hi> The gemination is to ſhew the certainty,
as alſo the continuance or it. So that <hi>Socinus</hi> and others, who would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
corporal death in this place, as being from the natural conſtitution of
a man, and ſo would have been, had there not been this commination, doth
joyn too much with the <hi>Devil</hi> in this buſineſs; for his endeavour was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the woman that this threatning was falſe, and that ſhe ſhould not die,
death ſhould not be the puniſhment of her tranſgreſſion: But what need we
any clearer place then this divine commination? Doth not this <hi>neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not tranſgreſſed, he <hi>ſhould not</hi> have died, and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
have been <hi>immortal,</hi> it being not poſſible for death to come in at any
other door, but that of ſinne? To threaten a mortal man with mortality had
been abſurd, or to make his natral condition a puniſhment, for then it would
have been a puniſhment to be made a man, if made mortal. The <hi>Socinians</hi>
therefore to elude this, would not underſtand by death, the ſeparation of the
ſoul and body, but <hi>eternal death;</hi> or as they ſay at other times, a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of
dying; but a <hi>neceſſary</hi> death and <hi>eternal</hi> death are abſurdly made parallel by
them. For beaſts are under a neceſſity of death, yet cannot be ſaid to partake
of eternal death, eſpecially the godly they cannot but die, yet they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
delivered from eternal death. We muſt therefore take death for <hi>corporal
death,</hi> not but that the death of the ſoul by ſinne here, and eternal ſeparation
from God hereafter, is to be <hi>included</hi> herein, yet this temporal death is alſo a
<hi>great part</hi> of the penalty here threatned, which may be evinced by theſe three
reaſons:</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>Moſes</hi> is relating in an hiſtorical manner, what was done to man in the
beginning. Now in an hiſtorical Narration, we are not to go from the literal
meaning, unleſs evident neceſſity compel, much leſſe may we do ſo here, when we
have the Apoſtle acted by the ſame Spirit of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in being Penman
of the Scripture, attributing our corporal death to <hi>Adam;</hi> For no doubt when
<hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Text, <hi>In Adam we all die,</hi> he had this hiſtorical relation made
by <hi>Moſes</hi> in his mind.</p>
                           <p>2. The ſentence and execution of it muſt be underſtood in the ſame manner.
Now it's plain, that in the execution of it, mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 19. corporal
death is meant, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> is thus told, <hi>That duſt he was, and unto duſt he
ſhould return.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. It muſt be meant of temporal death, becauſe this alone, and not eternal
death doth belong to <hi>all</hi> mankind. For although at the day of judgement, it is
ſaid, ſome ſhall not die, yet that ſuddain change made then upon them, will
be equivalent to death. Thus you ſee the threatning made to <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt
doth abundantly confirm this truth. There is one doubt only to be anſwered,
<hi>If death be meant in that ſentence, how then is it that</hi> Adam <hi>did not immediately
die? How is it that he lived many hundred years afterwards?</hi> To this ſome ſay,
That the reſtriction of time, <hi>viz.</hi> the day, is not to be made to the time of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if at that day he ſhould die, but to <hi>death;</hi> as if the ſenſe were, thou
ſhalt die one day or other, thou ſhalt be in daily fear of death. But if this be
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:57719:275"/>
diſliked, then we may underſtand it <hi>of a ſtate of death, that day he did eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he became mortal,</hi> for every day is a diminution of our life. As a man that
hath received a deadly wound, we ſay he is a dead man, becauſe though he
did linger it out, yet all is in a tendency unto death. Now this will appear the
more cogent, if you take notice of the execution of this ſentence mentioned,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19. where the ground is <hi>curſed,</hi> and man alſo adjudged to labour
and wearneſs all the dayes of his life, even till he return to the ground out of
which he was made. But here the <hi>Socinian</hi> thinketh he hath an evaſion, <hi>Death</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>is not here made a curſe, but only it's the term how long mans curſe
ſhall be upon him.</hi> It is not <hi>poena,</hi> but <hi>terminus</hi> (ſaith he) for it is ſaid, he
ſhould be under this labour, <hi>till he did return to the ground;</hi> but if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſentence before-mentioned, it is plain, it is a curſe. So that in this
place it is both a curſe, and a terme putting an end to all the temporal
miſeries of this life, though to the wicked it is the beginning of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

<hi>ſpiritual death</hi> here, as in my Text of <hi>temporal death,</hi> which the coherence alſo
doth confirm; but though that be principally intended, yet not totally.
Even temporal death is likewiſe to be underſtood, as being the beginning and
introduction to eternal death, if the grace of God doth not prevent. We have

as much as all have ſinned,</hi> that is, all ſinned in that one man, for what ſenſe
it is to ſay, That by one man ſinne and death entred upon all, becauſe all ſinned

<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, and upon all mens actual ſinnes likewiſe: Yea, it is wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the Apoſtles ſcope, who is comparing <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt not ſimply

                           <p>Another Text witneſſing this truth is, <hi>Rom. 6. 23. The wages of ſinne is death</hi>
Here death is not taken only for <hi>eternal death</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, becauſe the
oppoſite unto it is made <hi>eternal life,</hi> but for <hi>both kinds</hi> of death eternal and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral;
temporal death being the in-let of eternal, and ſo contrary to eternal
life. Neither is that cavil of their worth any thing, who would make the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

                              </gap> is put to it; but that is no ſure Rule. Sometimes the Article is put to
the <hi>Predicate,</hi> for ſome emphaſis ſake, and not the <hi>Subject,</hi> as <hi>I Cor. 9. 1. Are

ſingular work of mine in the Lord? We ſee then, what it is that ſinne
deſerveth, even temporal and eternal death; it cometh not from mans primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
conſtitution, but <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion. Therefore it is that we deſerve
many thouſand deaths, if it were poſſible; for original ſinne deſerveth death,
every actual ſinne deſerveth death, yea and hell alſo: Oh how miſerable is
man, who thus deſerveth to die, and to be damned over and over again!
Therefore the Apoſtle uſeth the plural number, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, to ſignifie the manifold
evils that are in this death. The word properly ſignifieth that meat, which was
allowed ſouldiers for their ſervice in warre. We ſee then how fearfull we all are
to be of ſinne; What wages wilt thou have for every pleaſant, every profitable
ſinne? even death temporal and eternal.</p>
                           <p>The laſt Text I ſhall mention is, that which <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo much urgeth in this
point, <hi>Rom. 8. 10. The body is dead becauſe of ſinne,</hi> which is chiefly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of our mortal body; now he ſaith it's dead, becauſe of the ſentence
of death paſſed it, ſo that there is no way to eſcape it. It is ſinne then
that maketh the body in a ſtate of death, that deſerveth the whole harmony and
good temperament of the body ſhould be diſſolved, and therby follow a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the whole man. For though ſinne deſerve death, yet there muſt be
thereby ſome <hi>ataxy</hi> or diſorder made in the body of a man, otherwiſe death
would not follow. So that though ſinne be the meritorious cauſe, yet ſeveral
diſeaſes the effect of ſinne, do actually cauſe death. Not that ſinne maketh a
ſubſtantial change in a man, but an accidental only. Thus you ſee the Scripture
conſtantly attributing death, yea and our mortality and corruptibility to ſinne
onely, and not to our natural conſtitution. Therefore thoſe are ſtrange poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we meet with (<hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſſar. cap. 6. Sect. 1. pag.</hi> 371, 372.) <q>That
death came in not by any new ſentence or change of nature, for man was
created mortal, and that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he ſhould have been
immortal by grace, that is by the uſe of the tree of life. That to die is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:57719:276"/>
to ſome, to others not. It was a puniſhment to all that ſinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moſes</hi> and ſince, upon the firſt it fell as a conſequent of Gods anger
upon <hi>Adam,</hi> upon the later it fell as a conſequent of that anger which was
threatned in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; but to thoſe who ſinned not at all, as Infants and
Ideots, it was meerly a condition of their nature, and no more a puniſhment,
then to be a child, is.</q> But ſeeing he profeſſeth himſelf to be of the ſame
judgement with his incomparable <hi>Grotius,</hi> let him conſider how theſe poſitions
agree with him, who doth againſt <hi>Socinus</hi> induſtriouſly and ſolidly prove, (<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſ.
fid. de ſatisfac. cap. 1. pag.</hi> 19, 20, 21.) that death hath alwayes ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of a puniſhment, inſtancing in the Texts I have mentioned, uſing ſuch
words, <hi>Quidclarius? Quis vel verba legens non videat hanc ſententiam,</hi> and
<hi>Corinthians</hi> (the words of my Text) and <hi>an ad anuſſim respondereiſti ad Romanos?</hi>
Yea he concludeth, <q>That it were eaſie to prove, that it was the perpetual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ancient Jews and Chriſtians, that death of whatſoever kind it be,
(viz. whether with violence, or without violence) was the puniſhment of
ſinne, adding, that the Chriſtian Emperors did deſervedly condemn, beſide
other things, this opinion of <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that they held <hi>mortem non ex inſidiis
fluxiſſe peccati, ſed exegiſſe eam legem immutabilis conſtituti.</hi>
                              </q> And indeed, if
death were not the effect of ſinne, but conſequent of mans nature it would be
no evil, whereas the Scripture accounteth it of that nature, as <hi>Deut. 30. 15. See
I have ſet before thee this day, life and good, and death, and evil.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>THe next work to be done, is to conſider thoſe</hi> Arguments <hi>which they bring
to prove, that</hi> Adam <hi>was made</hi> mortal, <hi>and ſo had a</hi> proxim principle of
death in him, <hi>which would have taken effect, if God did not provide ſome way
againſt it, and that which is uſed by all Adverſaries to this truth, is,</hi> Becauſe
<hi>Adam</hi> was created in ſuch a condition, that be muſt neceſſarily eat and drink, yea
and was alſo to propagate children; all which actions do contradict immortality. For
he that eateth and drinketh, muſt by degrees have a decay in nature; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſeemeth to prove immortality from this argument, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35, 36. becauſe in
heaven they ſhall not marry, ſo that to procreate children is not conſiſtent with ſuch a
bleſſed eſtate.</p>
                        <p>But theſe Objections are eaſily anſwered, if we remember the <hi>diſtinction</hi> at
firſt given in this point, that there is an immortality <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>immutable,</hi> or
<hi>conditional</hi> and <hi>changeable</hi> upon ſuppoſition. Now it's true, neither eating or
marrying can conſiſt with unchangeable mortality with immortality of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>But it may very well conſiſt with conditional immortality, that is in tendency to
that which is abſolute.</hi> Eating and drinking in the ſtate of integrity was a means
ſubſerving to keep up the ſtate of immortality, ſo farre was it from repugning
of it, This therefore is the root of his errour, that men apprehend no other
immortality, but what is <hi>compleat;</hi> that unleſs <hi>Adam</hi> had been made in the
ſame eſtate, that the glorified Saints are put into, he could not be ſaid to be
immortal.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They ſay, <hi>Adam is ſaid to be earthly, and of the earth, to have a
natural body, and ſo oppoſite to that immortal body, we ſhall have in heaven,</hi> 1 Cor.
15. 47. But firſt when the Apoſtle giveth thoſe names to our bodies of vile,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:57719:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>
corruptible, and to be in diſhonour, this is to be underſtood of our <hi>bodies after
the fall,</hi> they are made ſo through ſinne. It would be <hi>derogatory</hi> to God, to
ſay they were made ſuch at firſt. It is true, the firſt man is ſaid to be <hi>earthy,</hi> but
that expreſſion denoteth <hi>only</hi> the original of his body, whence it was firſt
made; not the ſtate he was created in, as appeareth by the oppoſite; the
ſecond man is ſaid to be the <hi>Lord from Heaven.</hi> It is one thing then to
ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi>'s body in reſpect of its original, and another to ſpeak of the
whole perſon in reſpect of his condition.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, They ſay, <hi>All the internal cauſes of death were in</hi> Adam, <hi>while
ſtanding, as well as fallen; and therefore he was mortal as well as we.</hi> To this
we anſwer, there were indeed the cauſes of death in him materially, but not
formally, for the bodily humours were not peccant, either in quality, or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
the natural heat would not have conſumed the radical moiſture, ſo that in
that eſtate there would never have been formally exiſtent the proxim cauſes of
death: beſides the adequate and principal cauſes of death, are the Devils ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and mans tranſgreſſion, as you heard.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly, They ask,</hi> If man were not made mortal, why ſhould immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be promiſed as a reward, if he had it already? Why ſhould it be promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him upon his obedience? <hi>The anſwer is eaſie,</hi> Adam<hi>'s immortality was
inchoate onely; the conſummation of it was promiſed as a reward to his
obedience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly, They object,</hi> If death be the puniſhment of ſinne, then Chriſt hath freed
believers from this death, which is againſt experience. <hi>But</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The <hi>Socinians</hi> grant, That a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of death is the <hi>fruit</hi> of ſinne, yet
Chriſt hath not freed us from the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it, no more than the <hi>natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of it.</p>
                        <p>2. We muſt diſtinguiſh between an actual abolition of death, and the right
to do it. Chriſt hath purchaſed for us a right to immortality, yet the actual
inveſting of us into it, is to be done in its time, <hi>Death will be ſwallowed up in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;</hi>
and for the preſent, the nature of death is changed, as to a godly man;
it's no more a curſe to him, the ſting of death is taken away, as when a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
or Waſp have loſt their ſting, they can do no more hurt, Thus to the
godly it cannot do any hurt. It is like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s fiery chariot, to carry them to
Heaven, It's like paſſing through the red Sea into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> thus
as the cloud was full of darkneſs to the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> but light to the <hi>Iſraelite;</hi>
ſo is death full of terrour, and of curſes to an ungodly man, but pleaſant and
lovely to a godly man; it is his gain to die; To live in this world is his loſſe and
diſadvantage.</p>

that are in this point. And</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It may be demanded, <hi>That ſuppoſe it be granted, that by</hi> Adam <hi>we die,
may not this be underſtood any more than occaſionally? God was ſo diſpleaſed with</hi>
Adam <hi>for his tranſgreſſion, that thereupon he inſticts the curſe threatned to him upon
his poſterity.</hi> Even as we read often in Scripture, that God for Magiſtrates ſins,

                           <q>or for parents ſins doth take an <hi>occaſion</hi> to puniſh a people or children for
their own ſinnes. Thus it may be thought, that God by occaſion from
<hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, did impoſe on us for our ſinnes the ſame curſe that
was denounced to <hi>Adam;</hi> not that we were ſinners in him, not that we come
into the world with any inherent ſinne, but becauſe of our actual impieties,
God puniſheth us with <hi>Adam</hi>'s curſe.</q> In this manner the late adverſary to
original ſinne doth explicate himſelf. (<hi>An Anſwer to a Letter,</hi> pag. 30, 31, 32.)
as if this were all the evil by <hi>Adam,</hi> that for his ſake our ſinnes inherit the
curſe. <hi>Inſomuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that it is not ſo properly to be called original ſinne,
as an original curſe upon our ſinne.</hi> That we may not be deceived in his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and as.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, <hi>Pſal. 106. 32, 33. They angred him alſo at the waters of ſtrife, ſo
that it went ill with Moſes for their ſakes. Becauſe they provoked his Spirit, ſo
that he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips. Here was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>plainly a traouction
of evil from the Nation to</hi> Moſes <hi>their relative; for their ſakes he was puniſhed,
but yet foraſmuch as Moſes himſelf had ſinned.</hi> But ſurely we may here ſay,
<hi>Behold a new thing under the Sunne.</hi> This was ſcarce ever heard of before in
the Church of God, ſo that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> too much honour to it, to confute it; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
muſt be ſaid, leſt words prevail, and ſimilitudes, when reaſons cannot.
Not to meddle with any large explication of that paſſage in the <hi>Pſalm;</hi> If we
conſult with <hi>Bellarmize</hi> and <hi>Genebrard,</hi> this place will no wayes ſerve his turn.
For <hi>Bellarmine (inlocum.</hi>) would have the 33. verſe not to contain any ſinne
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips, but referreth that to <hi>Gods
Decree</hi> or <hi>Purpoſe</hi> pronounced by his mouth, which was to deſtroy the Nations,
as it followeth in the next verſe; which they did not do, affirming the Hebrew
word cannot be applied to an unadviſed ſpeaking, or as it is rendred by ſome,
ambiguous and doubtfull: Neither is it in the Text that God puniſhed <hi>Moſes</hi>
for their ſakes, but as our Tranſlators, <hi>It went ill with Moſes for their ſakes;</hi>
And this tranſlation <hi>Genebrard</hi> taketh notice of, as following the Hebrew, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that ſome expound it, not of any puniſhment God inflicted upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
but of that vexation, trouble and grief which he had, becauſe of their
murmurings and rebellings againſt him. And it this be ſo, then here is not ſo
much room for his opinion, as to ſet the ſole of its feet. But let it be granted,
That <hi>Moſes</hi> was occaſionally puniſhed by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> rebellion for his own
ſinne: For who can deny but that God doth ſometimes take an occaſion from
ſome mens ſinnes to puniſh others for their own ſinnes, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have a
ſaying, eſpecially when related to one another, <hi>That in every puniſhment they
undergo, there is an ounce of that Calf, which</hi> Aaron <hi>made,</hi> as if God did from
that, take an occaſion to puniſh the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their other tranſgreſſions; yet
this is no parallel to our caſe in hand; for here the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were an occaſion
to make <hi>Moſes</hi> ſinne, for which God was ſo angry with him, that he was not
ſuffered to enter into the Land of <hi>Canan.</hi> But we are now ſpeaking of men,
who are puniſhed by <hi>death,</hi> that yet never were occaſioned to ſinne by <hi>Adam,</hi>
in the Adverſaries ſenſe. For the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were preſent with <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and by their froward carriages did provoke him to that ſinfull paſſion; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
hath been dead ſome thouſands of years ſince. Who can ſay, It is <hi>Adam</hi>
                           <pb n="522" facs="tcp:57719:278"/>
that ſtirreth me up, it is <hi>Adam</hi> that will not let me alone, but compelleth me
to ſinne? Yea, how can Heathens and Pagans be ſaid to ſinne occaſionally by
<hi>Adam,</hi> when they (happily) never heard that there was ſuch a man in the
world? Beſides, Infants they are ſubject to death, What actual ſinne doth
<hi>Adam</hi> produce the occaſion of to them? If then <hi>Adam</hi> were now alive, and
Infants could be tempted to actual ſinnes, as <hi>Meſes</hi> was by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> then
there had been more probability of his inſtance.</p>
                        <p>But it may be his ſecond example will be more commenſurated to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and that is from 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14 16. where it's ſaid, <hi>God would give Iſrael up,
becauſe of the ſinnes of Jeroboam, who did ſinne, and made Iſrael to ſinne.</hi> Thus
ſaith he, alluding to the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>By one man</hi> (Jeroboam) <hi>ſinne
went out into all</hi> (Iſrael) <hi>and the curſe, captivity or death by ſinne; and ſo death
went upon all men</hi> (of Iſrael) <hi>inaſmuch as all men</hi> (of Iſrael) <hi>have ſinned.</hi> But
this is wholly to give up the cauſe to <hi>Pelagians,</hi> whoſe gloſſe yet of <hi>imitation</hi> he
utterly rejecteth, though much more that which affirmeth, we are made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and formally ſinners by him. (<hi>Anſwer to a Letter,</hi> pag. 54.) For how
did <hi>Jereboam</hi> make all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinne? was not by his example, and in the
fame ſinne of Idolatry, as he did? Now do we follow <hi>Adam</hi> in eating of the
for bidden fruit, and ſo offend God in the ſame ſinne as he did? So that this
was wholly by imitation; and therefore one generation did tranſmit this ſinne
to anotherly example, till at laſt there was no more mention of it. But did
<hi>Adam</hi> thus offend, and then <hi>Cain</hi> and others follow him in the like ſinne? He
cannot then waſh his hands from the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Doctrine of original ſinne from
<hi>Adam, only by imitation,</hi> if he adhere to this inftance. Again <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is ſaid
to make <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinne for ſome time only, while his memory and example had
ſome influence, and it was the ſinne of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> only, for many ſeparated
themſelves from him, and went into the kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> that ſo they might
not be polluted with that worſhip, as appeareth, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 14. 16. whereas
<hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne bringeth death upon all mankind, and this will endure to the end
of the world; for the Apoſtle ſaith in the Text, <hi>In Adam all die.</hi> Beſides,

but till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and then death came upon a new accout. At other
times he makes it a puniſhment of all men, becauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne.</q> And
indeed the Text we are upon doth evidently enforce this.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, <hi>Death is ſaid to reign over all markind, to paſſe on all;</hi> and are
not Infants part of the world? It is true, he ſaith, Children and Ideots that
cannot commit actual ſinnes, death is no puniſhment to them, they die in their
nature; but if there had been no ſinne, how could there have been ideots, and
children that die in their Infancy? Certainly, that muſt be an immature
death. Now although it be ſaid, That death is a conlequent of nature, yet
immature death muſt needs be a puniſhment of ſinne; for ſo this Auther an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth

in his meer naturalls.</head>
                        <p>I Proceed to the ſecond and laſt Queſtion, which is; <hi>May not death be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to mans conſtitution conſidered in his meer naturals? Is there not a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
ſtate to be conceived between a ſtate of grace and ſinne,</hi> viz. <hi>a ſtate of pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;
by which death would have come upon mankind, though there had been no
ſinne at all?</hi> This indeed is the ſigment of ſome <hi>Popiſh Writers,</hi> who make <hi>Adam</hi>
upon his tranſgreſſion to be deprived of his ſupernaturals, and ſo caſt into his
naturals; although generally with the Papiſts, this ſtate of pure naturals is but
in the imagination only; they diſpute of ſuch things as poſſible, but <hi>de facto,</hi>
they ſay man was created in holineſs, and after his fall he was plunged into ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne. Now the <hi>Socinians</hi> they do peremptorily diſpute for this condition
of <hi>meer naturals, de facto,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was created a meer man without either
ſinne or holineſs, but in a middle neutral way, being capable of either as his free
will ſhould determine him. <hi>This ſtate of meer nature is likewiſe a very pleaſing
Doctrine to the late Writer</hi> ſo oftern mentioned, it helpeth him in many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<q>Death paſſed upon all men, that is the generality of mankind, all that
lived in their ſinne: The others that died before, died in their nature, not in
their ſinne, neither <hi>Adam</hi>'s nor their own, ſave only that <hi>Adam</hi> brought it
upon them, or rather leſt it to them, himſelf being diſrobed of all that which
could hinder it.</q> Thus he. (<hi>Anſwer to a Letter pag.</hi> 49.) This is conſonant to
thoſe who ſay (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others) that man fallen and man ſtanding
differ as a cloathed and and naked man; <hi>Adam</hi> was cloathed with grace, and other
ſupernatural endowments, but when ſinning, he was diveſted of all theſe, and
ſo left naked in his meer natural. Thus they hold this ſtate of meer naturals to
be a ſtate of negation, not privation, God taking from man, not that which
was a connatural perfection to him, but what was meerly gratuitous: <hi>The late
Writer uſeth this comperiſon of Moſes his face ſhining, and then afterwards the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of this luſtre.</hi> 
                           <q>Now as <hi>Moſes</hi> his face had the natural perfection of a
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:57719:279"/>
face, though the glorious ſuperadditaments were removed; thus it is with
man, though fallen, he hath his meer naturals ſtill, and ſo is not in a death
of ſinne, or neceſſity of tranſgreſſing the Law of God; but though without
the aid of ſupernaturals he cannot obtain the kingome of heaven, yet by theſe
pure naturals he is free in his birth from any ſinful pollution, ſaith the known
Adverſary to this truth.</q> Thus he that calleth original ſinne a meer <hi>non ens,</hi>
he layeth the foundation of his Diſcourſe upon a meer <hi>non entity;</hi> Now if you
ask what cometh to man by theſe meer naturals, he will anſwer <hi>death,</hi> 
                           <q>Yea
that which is remarkable, is the long <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>many ſad imperfections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
three or four Pages</hi> that is brought in by him, (<hi>Vnum Neceſſar. cap. 6.
Sect.</hi> 7.) a great part whereof he ſaith is our natural impotency, and the other
brought in by our own folly; As for that which is our natural impotency,
man being thereby in body and ſoul ſo imperfect, <hi>it is</hi> (he ſaith) as if a man
ſhould deſcribe the condition of a <hi>Mole,</hi> or a <hi>Bat;</hi>
                           </q> concerning whoſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
no other cauſe is to be enquired of, <hi>but the Will of God,</hi> who giveth his
gifts as he pleaſeth, and is unjuſt to no man, by giving or not giving any certain
proportion of good things. <q>To the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaketh alſo in another
place, (<hi>further explicat. pag.</hi> 475.) Adam's ſinne left us in pure naturals, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed
of ſuch aides extraordinary as <hi>Adam</hi> had:</q> But certainly there are few
Readers, who ſhall conſider what is by him made to be the natural impotency
of man in ſoul and body; but muſt conclude <hi>he is moſt injurious to the goodneſs,
wiſdomè, and juſtice of God, in making man of ſuch miſerable pure naturals;</hi> yea
that it is a poſition worſe then <hi>Manicheiſme;</hi> for the <hi>Manichees</hi> ſeeing ſuch
evils upon mankind, attributed them to ſome evil principle: but this man lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all upon the good and moſt holy God; It is Gods will alone, not mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
corruption, that expoſeth him to ſo many unſpeakable imperfections.
It is well obſerved by <hi>Janſenius,</hi> who hath one Book only <hi>de ſtatu purae nature,</hi>
oppoſing the Jeſuites and old Schoolmen in their ſigment upon a ſtate of meer
naturals, that this opinion was brought into the Church of God, out of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
and that it is the principles of his Philoſophy, which have thus obſcured
the true Doctrine of original ſinne. I ſhall breifly lay down ſome Arguments
againſt any ſuch ſuppoſed condition of meer nature; from whence they ſay we
have ignorance in the mind, rebellion againſt the Spirit, and alſo death it ſelf,
but without ſinne. And</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The firſt is grounded upon a rule in reaſon, <hi>That every ſubject
capable of two immediate contraries, muſt neceſſarily have one, or the other.</hi> A
man muſt either be ſick or well, either alive or dead, there is no middle eſtate
between them; thus it is with man, he muſt either be holy or ſinful, he muſt
either be in a ſtate of grace, or a ſtate of iniquity: The Scripture giveth not the
leaſt hint of any ſuch pure naturals. Indeed a man may in a <hi>metaphyſical</hi> manner
have abſtracted thoughts of man, neither conſidering him as good or evil: in
which ſenſe it is diſputed between <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> whether man in his meer
naturals, or in a common conſideration, as man, neither looked upon as good
or evil, <hi>be the object of predeſtination:</hi> but if we ſpeak of <hi>exiſtency,</hi> then there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was, or will be a man, but either muſt be a good tree or bad: for in ſuch a
ſuſceptive ſubject, one of the immediate contraryes muſt needs inexiſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Scripture ſpeaketh of mans condition ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, as a
ſtate <hi>of privation not negation;</hi> When <hi>David</hi> confeſſed he was born in ſinne,
<hi>Credo</hi> (ſaith learned <hi>Davenant</hi> on <hi>Col. cap. 2. 2.) hac verba non ferent commentum
Jeſuiticum, in pur is naturalibus conceptus ſum,</hi> &amp;c. for the Word of God deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
us as blinded in our mind, that we are dead in ſinne, that we have a ſtony
heart: all which argue that we have only impure naturals.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>To hold death, diſeaſes, and ſoul miſeries, ſuch as grief, ignorance,
difficulty to do good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>conſequentiall of nature is to attribute cruelty and injuſtice
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:57719:279"/>
to God.</hi> This <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old urged the <hi>Pelagians</hi> with, How can an Infant new
born be expoſed to ſuch miſeries, if there be no ſinne deſerving of it?
What God may do to an innocent creature, how farre he may afflict him <hi>per
modum ſimplicis cruciatus,</hi> though not <hi>poenae,</hi> by his ſovereign dominion, is not
here to be diſputed? It is certain all theſe miſeries of mankind are by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
attributed to ſinne; and ſhall we have ſuch hard thoughts of God, that
the world ſhall be full of miſeries before ſinne?</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>Man as he is a man hath an inward deſire to be happy, and God onely can be the
happineſs of a rational ſoul.</hi> There is by nature an imbred deſire to an ultimate
end, and therefore that God at firſt planted in man ſuch an appetite, vouchſafed
him alſo a power to obtain this end. So that as we cannot conceive a man made
at firſt without an inclination to this happineſs, ſo neither without inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
that would diſpoſe him thereunto; and this maketh any ſuch ſtate of
pure naturals to be an impoſſible thing: for then God would not be the ultimate
end of ſuch a man. And whereas the Schoolmen have brought in a diſtinction
of <hi>finis naturalis</hi> and <hi>ſupernaturalis,</hi> of <hi>amor naturalis</hi> and <hi>ſupernaturalis,</hi> that
God is the natural end, but not ſupernatural; that he may be loved with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
love or ſupernatural: Theſe are meer cobwebs and niceties; for God is
the ultimate end of man from his creation; and as the creatures were made for
man, ſo man for God: neither can man love God, but by the help of Gods
Spirit; even <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity was inabled to love God, by his grace aſſiſting
of him, and he that doth not love God upon ſuch motives, as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
ſinneth, and ſo this <hi>amor naturalis</hi> is no more than a ſinne; it is <hi>cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
not <hi>charitas;</hi> it is not a loving of God, as he ought to be loved.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, <hi>This opinion of a third eſtate of meer naturals between holineſs and ſinne,
muſt neceſſarily infer a third place after death, that is neither heaven or hell.</hi> For
I would ask <hi>this Writer,</hi> whether one dying in his nature doth go to Heaven? he
cannot, for he hath no holineſs; to hell he cannot, becauſe he hath no ſin. This
puzzleth him exceedingly (<hi>Furth. Explic. p.</hi> 471.) for though he is favourable
to that opinion of a third place, yet he dare not determine of any ſuch thing.
To be ſure the Scripture is clear enough, that there are only two places after a
mans death, that are our receptacles, either heaven or hell. This may ſuffice to
inform our judgements herein.</p>
                        <p>Let us hear ſomething from this that may affect our hearts; for more is to be
ſpoken to this point in the enſuing Diſcourſe. Is all mankind thus ſentenced to
death? Are we as ſo many dead corpſe? This ſhould humble us, and make us low
in our eyes; though a rich man, though a great man, yet a mortal man. <hi>Xerxes</hi>
that potent King, looking from an high hill upon his numerous Army, fell a
weeping, while he thought that within an hundred years there would not be one
of them left: Oh (ſaith <hi>Hicrom</hi> in alluſion to this) that we could get up into ſome
high Tower, and behold all the Kingdoms and Nations in the world, with every
Inhabitant therin, and then conſider that within a ſhort time, there will not be
one left! Mankind runneth in a torrent, <hi>one generation paſſeth away, and another
ſucceedeth,</hi> yet how do theſe Ants buſie themſelves upon the earth, as if they
were immortal? As men in a ſhip, whether they ſit or ſtand, they are ſtill draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nigh to the haven. Thus it is with us, whether eating, drinking, buying or
ſelling, we are haſtening to the grave. Hence</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond place, prepare and provide for death; happy is that man upon
whom it may be ſaid, he doth <hi>patienter vivere &amp; delectabiliter mori,</hi> live patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but die with delight. Think every day, yea hour, that is ſaid to thee, which
was to <hi>Hezekiah, Set thy houſe</hi> (and much more thy ſoul) <hi>in order, for thou ſhalt
die, and not live;</hi> for though we die, yet our ſins, nor our good and holy works
die not, but will go to the grave with us, will go to hell, or to Heaven with us.</p>

                        <p>For the firſt, no doubt we are to mean <hi>Gods wrath;</hi> Therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s
Expoſition of this place is ſingular and much forced; he underſtands wrath here
<hi>ſubjectively,</hi> as if it were <hi>mans wrath,</hi> making the ſenſe to be. We are all by
nature ſubject to paſſions, eſpecially that of anger is predominant. When it
is ſaid (<hi>Lib. 3. de anima, cap.</hi> 16. ſaith he) that we were by <hi>nature the children

anger we are ſubject to, which is not nature, as it cometh from God, but of
that which the Devil hath brought in. <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirming theſe three parts or
powers of the ſoul, the <hi>rational,</hi> the <hi>iraſcible,</hi> and the <hi>concupiſcible,</hi> which he
calleth <hi>indignativum &amp; concupiſcentivum.</hi> In the <hi>iraſcible,</hi> he ſpeaketh of a
<hi>good</hi> indignation, and an <hi>evil</hi> one, applying this Text to the later. <hi>Cerda</hi> his
Commentator illuſtrating this, ſaith, <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s meaning is, <q>That we are
by nature children to our paſſions, we are not at our own diſpoſing, we are
under their power; adding, That <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth <hi>wrath</hi> rather than any
other affection, becauſe of that anger and fury, by which he once perſecuted
the Church of God. Thus he mentioning alſo another Expoſition, That by
<hi>anger</hi> is to be underſtood the <hi>Devil,</hi> who may ſo be called, becauſe of the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:57719:280"/>
cruelty he exerciſeth upon men:</q> but this is ſo improbable that it needeth no
refutation. The <hi>wrath</hi> then, is <hi>Gods wrath,</hi> which like himſelf is infinite, and
the effects thereof intollerable; So that it is as much as to be <hi>Children of hell,</hi>
children of <hi>everlaſting damnation,</hi> even whatſoever the wrath of God may bring
upon a man in this world, and the world to come.</p>

For nature is taken both for the firſt principles, and alſo the immediate conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

cuſtome is like nature: Here are reſtrictive expreſſions, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh

of God is not naturally due to us, as the creatures have their natural principles
of motion and reſt within them; but that <hi>Suidas</hi> doth not by nature wholly
mean an evil cuſtome, appeareth, in that he ſaith, two things are implied in this

                        <p>The firſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap>, <hi>an in dwelling abiding evil affection</hi>
(by which we may very genuinely underſtand; that innate corruption in us,
<hi>that ſinne which dwelleth in us.</hi>) And</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>A continual and wicked cuſtome.</hi> Theſe
are not to be confounded as the ſame thing, but one is the cauſe of the other.
Original ſinne is that evil, in-dwelling affection; from whence proceedeth
evil cuſtoms in ſin. But it is not worth the while to examine, what the opinion
of <hi>Suidas</hi> was in this particular. <hi>Varinus</hi> doth better diſcourſe upon the word

                        <p>1. There is implied, <hi>That we all by nature have inherent corruption in us, that
we are unclean and filthy in the eyes of God, for Gods wrath is not any where, but
where ſinne is.</hi> Gods anger doth ſuppoſe ſinne, what God indeed may do by
abſolute Sovereignty in afflicting of an innocent creature, is diſputed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
but all agree, <hi>de facto,</hi> that now God doth not make any miſerable, but
who are ſinfull: And if this be true of temporal miſeries, much more doth it
hold of eternal. It doth not ſtand with the goodneſs and juſtice of God to
damn any, but ſinners: If then Infants new born are by nature the children of
wrath, it followeth, there is ſuch an internal defilement in them, whereby
they do deſerve it. Therefore they who hold, God puniſheth man for <hi>Adam</hi>'s
ſinne, though it be but temporally, when we have no ſin by nature inherent in
us, are injurious to the goodneſs and juſtice of God: we muſt be children in ſin
before we can be children of wrath.</p>
                        <p>2. Here is implied, <hi>That for this pollution of nature, we bring with us into the
world, God is greatly offended with us and displeaſed.</hi> Let Infants be accounted
never ſo pretty and innocent babes, yet when we think Scripture-thoughts, we
muſt conclude, they are children of wrath, that they are part of that world,
which is guilty before God. God (I ſay) is offended with them, not ſimply,
becauſe born, or becauſe the children of men, but becauſe <hi>born in ſinne,</hi> and
the children of corrupt ſinfull men. Let not then our humane and carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
argue ſaying, They have no underſtanding or will, they have no actual
conſent to any iniquity, why ſhould ſuch a ſevere curſe be inavoidably laid upon
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:57719:282"/>
them, who know not the right hand from the left? For this is plain, we cannot
be by nature the children of Gods wrath, unleſs he be greatly offended and
diſpleaſed with us; How ſad then is it to conſider, upon what terms every
child cometh into the world? Gods wrath is againſt it, he is offended with it,
as not having his Image, but the Devils; and hereby mans condition is
worſe and more miſerable then the young ones of beaſts, even the vileſt
of them, Toads and Serpents: for though man hateth ſuch, yet God doth
not.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>This wrath is Gods wrath, not mans, which maketh our eſtate to be farre
more dreadfull.</hi> Now Gods wrath is like himſelf <hi>infinite,</hi> and that which a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is never able to ſtand under. Hence it is that we can never ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his wrath; for if the wrath of all the great men of the world were put
together, (and yet <hi>the wrath of a King is</hi> (ſaid to be) <hi>like the roaring of a Lion,
Prov.</hi> 19. 12.) it is but as a ſpark to a great fire in compariſon of Gods anger.
The Scripture repreſenteth it in a more dreadfull manner, then we are able to
think of. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> crieth out, <hi>Who knoweth the power of thy anger?
according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath.</hi> Pſal. 90. 11. where by fear may be meant
Gods word, that teacheth us to fear, as <hi>Pſal. 19. 9. The fear of the Lord is
clean, enduring for ever;</hi> by which we are taught, that no man till he apply
himſelf to the word of God, can rightly apprehend Gods wrath. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
diſputed by the Schoolmen, <hi>Whether anger be properly in God, or no?</hi>
And ſome do conclude, That it is as properly in him, as love; onely we muſt
not underſtand it to be in him, as it is in us, with paſſion and imperfections. It
is an act of Gods holy will, whereby he abhorreth ſinne, and decreeth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
it.</p>
                        <p>4. <hi>This wrath being thus great and unſpeakable, hence there is no evaſion of it,
but by the bloud of Chriſt, for he onely who was God and man could remove this;</hi>
and therefore it is, that Infants do need Chriſt a Saviour, which could not be,
if they were not children of wrath; for if he be a Saviour, it is to ſuch who
are <hi>leſt.</hi> Neither is that any better than <hi>Adam</hi>'s fig-leaves to cover his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, and others of late would runne unto, <q>That
Infants indeed need Chriſt to carry them to Heaven, though they have no
ſinne in them; for this they ſuppoſe without the grace of Chriſt (though
that they diſtinguiſhed into nature at laſt) was not of it ſelf able to bring to
Heaven; though it had no ſinne in it, yet it had imperfection (ſay they)
But this is to make Chriſt, a Chriſt, to whom he was not a Saviour; for he is a
Saviour, <hi>Becauſe he did ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 1. 21.</q> If then
he bringeth Infants to eternal glory, he muſt do it as a Chriſt, not as a Saviour;
which diſtinction can no wayes be founded upon Scripture.</p>
                        <p>5. <hi>From this wrath of God there ariſeth an obligation to eternal damnation.</hi>
For you may ſay, If God be angry with man thus by nature, doth it follow
therefore that man muſt be obliged to eternal death? Will not temporal death,
and the miſeries of this life be enough? No, from Gods wrath thus againſt us,
there is a debt and obligation lying upon us to everlaſting miſery: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, <hi>Becauſe this corruption we are born in, is truly and properly a ſin and to every
ſin there is adhering the merit of utter deſtruction.</hi> So that the Schoolmen and ſome
Papiſts, who diſpute, Whether original ſinne deſerve everlaſting damnation in
hell; and concluding upon the negative, that it hath ſome leſſe puniſhment, is
frivolous and abſurd. For if it have <hi>truly and properly the nature of ſinne</hi> in it,
then it cannot be denied, according to Scripture-grounds, but hell is the proper
reward of it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, This wrath may be conſidered either <hi>immanently, as it is in God,</hi> viz.
<hi>his will abhorring all ſinners, or tranſiently in the effects thereof.</hi> For that it is of
great uſe in Divinity to diſtinguiſh between the Attributes and Effects of them;
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:57719:282"/>
for the Attributes as they are in God, cannot receive any intenſion or remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the effects may and do. Now the godly they were the children of
wrath by nature, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here, but they are not ſo now. For
though original ſinne doth ſtill abide in ſome meaſure, yet it is not imputed
unto a godly man; ſo that they are not for the <hi>preſent</hi> under Gods wrath,
though once they were, not that any change is made in God, but in man, who
is the object. The effects of this wrath are partly in the temporal miſeries of this
life, and partly in thoſe eternal torments which ſhall be in the world to come.
The child cometh weeping into the world, as prognoſticating it's miſery, thus
it is miſerable before it hath any actual ſinne; So that whereas the Infant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without teaching learn to ſpeak or go, of it's own ſelf it inclineth to weep.
<hi>Cerda</hi> upon <hi>Tertullian (De animâ lib. 3. cap.</hi> 19.) ſpeaketh of ſome that
thought Infants by theſe complaints did accuſe our firſt parents, and that the
male children cry <hi>A,</hi> as if they intended <hi>Adam;</hi> and the females <hi>E,</hi> as if they
meant <hi>Eve,</hi> though he ſaith others attribute it to their different ſtrengths of
nature: But this is a fooliſh and ridiculous fancy. It is certain, that theſe
weepings and complaints do argue the miſery of our natures, though but new
born, and ſo by conſequence the ſinfulneſs of them. The other effect is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
damnation in hell, which God might inflict upon every child new born; ſo
that he might go weeping hence, into that place of weeping in hell, of which
we have many more things as yet to ſpeak.</p>

due to all mankind becauſe of Original Sinne.</head>
                        <p>NOw becauſe this curſe ſeemeth cruell and unjuſt to humane reaſon, till by
actual ſinnes men have procured wrath upon their own heads; It is good
to eſtabliſh it upon Scripture-grounds, which is ſo ſure a rock, that though
the ſtormes and tempeſts of mens rage do ariſe againſt it, yet it will abide im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.
But before we do that we are to premiſe ſomething, by way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
tending thereunto. As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>In deciding of the doctrinal truths of Religion, we are not to attend to
our own humane affections, but meerly to the voice of God in the Scriptures.</hi> Gods
diſpenſations are not to be regulated according to our pitifull affections; moſt
of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenents are ſuited to humane compaſſions, rather then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurated
to Scripture-regulations: But if men will give way to that, why
ſhall not <hi>Origen</hi>'s poſition of the ſalvation of all the damned; yea Devils
and all at laſt be received as moſt commending of Gods mercy, and moſt ſuitable
to our pittifull affections? And why ſhould not all embrace the pleaſing and
pitiful Doctrine of one <hi>Georgius Siculus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Crakanthorpt? (Defenſ.
Eccleſ. Anglic. contra Spalat. cap.</hi> 37.) by whoſe Books he ſaith many were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched.
His opinion was, that neither this or that particular man was prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated
to ſalvation, but that God had appointed a time when he would ſave
the whole world, and <hi>quicquid de pradeſtinatione tradimus, philoſophicâ tantum
argutiâ niti;</hi> and what was delivered (by learned orthodox men as we muſt
ſuppoſe) was grounded onely upon philoſophical niceties. Is not this
abſolute ſalvation of all men very agreeable to humane deſires and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
yea and why doth not God vouchſafe not only the immediate offers
of grace to all men, and effectually bleſs the ſame to all, ſo that all men ſhall be
converted and ſaved, for he can as eaſily ſave all men as one if he pleaſe? Nay
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:57719:283"/>
if we do conſult with our own pitifull eſtates, how offenſive would ſeveral paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Gods providence in many outward temporal judgements be unto us: As
in the drowning of the world, where many children had not corrupted their
wayes, as men of the world had; yet they were all miſerably deſtoyed: thus alſo in
the terrible deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> all the little children therin who
could not be guilty of ſuch hainous tranſgreſſions, as the <hi>Sodomiſtes</hi> were, yet did
partake of that dreadful judgment, wheras at another time God in his conviction
of <hi>Jonah,</hi> why he would not deſtroy that great City of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> uſeth this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 11. to ſpare that place, becauſe <hi>there were more then ſixſcore thouſand
perſons, that could not diſcern between their right hand and leſt:</hi> If then a man ſhould
give liberty to his humane affections, to expoſtulate why theſe tender babes that
knew nothing of their fathers ſinnes, ſhould be involved in ſuch ſad calamities,
with their ungodly parents, how hardly would he keep within the bounds of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and modeſty? Thus it is about this Doctrine of original ſinne, whereby
we are all in our very birth expoſed to eternal damnation; Some call it a <hi>rigid</hi>
and cruel Doctrine, and all becauſe they judge of God according to their own
affections: But as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well obſerveth in the diſpute about the ſtate of
Infants dying in their original ſinne without Baptiſme, (<hi>Lib. 6. de Amiſſione,
grat.</hi>) naming five ſeveral opinions, ſome whereof are more rigid, others more
favourable, That our opinions cannot at all alter or change the ſtate of Infants
ſo deceaſed; The rigid opinion doth not hurt them, neither doth a favourable
opinion do them any good, but the Word of God that will ſtand; our favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pitifull opinions will not make the natural eſtate of any man the better;
yea when ſuch Doctrines are found to be contrary to the Word of God, they
may do a great deal of hurt, plunging of them into dangerous conſequences,
that may flow therefrom. Therefore to ſuch Diſputants, we may well reply
that which <hi>Acoſta</hi> the Jeſuite (<hi>Lib. 5. de procur. Indorum ſalute cap.</hi> 3.) ſaith to
ſome of his own Religion, that held even Heathens might be ſaved without the
knowledge of Chriſt; and that the contrary Doctrine was inhumane and ſevere:
<hi>Non hic agitur</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>durumne hoc &amp; ſeverum ſit, an benignum &amp; liberale;
ſed utrum verum necne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>As we are not to attend to humane affections in this point; ſo neither
to humane and natural reaſonings;</hi> Why God ſhould impute <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne to us.
and we all be accounted as ſinners in him, and from him the curſed root we the
curſed branches do ſpring, ariſeth from the juſt proccedings of God, though
happily the cauſes the thereof be unknowen to us: When therefore the Scripture
of God doth plainly affirm ſuch a ſinful, and curſed eſtate, let not philoſophical
Arguments obſtruct our faith, leſt if we do ſo in other myſteries of Religion,
as well as in this, at laſt we fall into plain Atheiſme; Let us be content with
our own meaſure of underſtanding, not invading the ſecrets of God, leſt we
herein betray notoriouſly our original ſinne, while we labour to deny it. For
<hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaking againſt theſe <hi>Curiſlae</hi> and <hi>Quaeriſtae</hi> as he calleth them, (<hi>In Gen.</hi>)
whereby men will demand a reaſon of Gods proceedings, and affect to be like
God in knowledge as <hi>Adam</hi> did, hath this expreſſion, <hi>Fieri Deorum eſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale
peccatum,</hi> original ſinne is the affection of a Deity.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>We are alwayes in this controverſy to diſtinguiſh between the merit of
condemnation, and the actual condemnation it ſelf:</hi> It is unqueſtionably true,
that all by nature do deſerve this eternal damnation; but then concerning the
actual damnation thereby, there are different opinions; Some have delivered
poſitively, that <hi>none</hi> is ever damned for original ſinne <hi>only;</hi> as ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
and the <hi>Remonſtrants;</hi> yea there are many ſay, that this actual condemnation
by original ſinne, <hi>is univerſally taken off all mankind by Chriſt;</hi> ſo that as by
the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> all were put into a ſtate of Gods anger, ſo by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>
all are put into a ſtate of actual reconciliation by Chriſt, till by their actual ſins
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:57719:283"/>
they do refuſe Chriſt, and ſo procure to themſelves damnatation, not upon any
account of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne, but their own voluntary tranſgreſſon; Concerning
<hi>Infants</hi> alſo dying in their infancy, great Diſputes there are; Some concluding
<hi>all</hi> that die ſo, though of Unbelievers and Pagans, that they <hi>are ſaved;</hi> original
ſinne <hi>not</hi> damning any others; they conclude otherwiſe: but then they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into ſeveral opinions amongſt themſelves; of which in time more is to be
ſaid. For we are not as yet come to that point, concerning the actual condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any by original ſinne meerly, but the merit and defect of it, what every
man doth deſerve by it as ſoon as he is born; though every ſinne deſerveth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
yet this obligation to eternal puniſhment may be taken off, yea and that while
the ſinne abideth; as original ſinne doth in ſome meaſure in a godly man.
There are indeed ſome who make the <hi>reatus poenae,</hi> the guilt of puniſhment to be
the forme of a ſinne, and if this were true, then they could not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>:
Others make it a <hi>proprium</hi> to ſinne, but this cannot be underſtood of <hi>actual</hi>
guilt, but <hi>potential</hi> guilt. Every ſinne, and ſo original doth, deſerve that thoſe
who are infected therewith, ſhould periſh in hell torments eternally; but yet
the actual obligation hereunto may be removed by the grace of God, the ſinne
ſtill remaining in ſome degree, as the fire had a power to burn the three Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
though the actual working thereof was hindered.</p>

                           <hi>THis being premiſed, let us now conſider thoſe Arguments, which may
firmly eſtabliſh us in this truth,</hi> That by nature we are all as ſo many damned
men; that of our ſelves we can expect no other; and that though we were free from
actual tranſgreſſion, It is the grace of God only, that delivereth us: All mankind
is like that wretched Infant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. ſpoken of by the Prophet, wallowing in
bloud, filthy and loathſome, neceſſarily periſhing, unleſſe the grace of God ſpeak
unto us, to live; we all lie like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s any bones, of whom we may ſay, Can
theſe live? Can theſe be ſaved? Not one, unleſſe God give life. <hi>And</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, All deſerve eternal damnation by original contagion, <hi>Becauſe it is a
ſtate of ſinne and ſpiritual uncleanneſſe we are born in.</hi> And therefore if once it
be granted to be a ſinne, the wages thereof muſt be hell and damnation: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that ſome Popiſh Writers are very abſurd, who diſputing againſt <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
That our birth-ſinne is properly and univocally ſinne, yet afterwards
queſtion. Whether children dying therein do go to hell or no? Some aſſign
them a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> wherein they have a natural happineſs, as <hi>Catharinus (Opuſc.
de ſtatu pucrorum,</hi> &amp;c.) Others, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that they have <hi>poena damni,</hi> but
not <hi>ſenſus,</hi> as if there were half an hell, or that one might be ſhut out from the
beatifical fruition of God, and yet not be tormented with ſenſible pain. This
is certain, if it be truly and directly a ſinne, as the Scripture ſo often calleth it;
then without the grace of God, there is no poſſibility of eſcaping hell thereby.
why then ſhould damnation becauſe of it be thought ſo horrid, when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be a ſinne? <hi>Job</hi> (you heard) ſaith, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean?</hi> Job 14. 4. here we are all unclean. Now what doth the
Scripture pronounce of ſuch, <hi>Revel. 21. 29. There ſhall not in any wiſe enter into
the heavenly Jeruſalem, any thing that is unclean, or that defileth.</hi> No unclean
thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven; and if they do not enter in there,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:57719:284"/>
they muſt enter into the kingdom of hell; There is no middle place, <hi>Qui in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducis
medium recede de medio,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The Scripture alſo calleth it ſinne,
<hi>Pſal. 51. 5. Behold in ſinne did my mother conceive me;</hi> and what is the <hi>wages of
ſinne</hi> but death? <hi>Rom</hi> 6. 23. not only bodily death, but that eternal death,
which is oppoſite to everlaſting life; and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The ſting of death is
ſinne,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 56. which <hi>Auſtin</hi> expounds in this ſenſe, as that by ſinne
death is cauſed, as that is called <hi>Poculum mortis,</hi> a cup of death, which cauſeth
death; or as ſome ſay, The Tree of life is called ſo, becauſe it was the cauſe of
life. If then original ſinne be a ſinne, it muſt have a ſting, and this ſting is
everlaſting death. So that if we attend to what the Scripture ſpeaketh concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, even in the womb and the cradle, that we are in a ſtate of ſinne; we
muſt conclude, becauſe it is a ſinne, therefore it deſerveth damnation. Hence
you heard the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. expreſly ſaith, <hi>Judgement came by one to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi>
and <hi>Rom. 3. That the whole world is guilty before God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>The Scripture doth not only ſpeak of this birth-pollution as a ſinne,
but as an hainous ſinne in its effects, whereby it doth admis of many terrible aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi>
(as you have heard.) It is the <hi>Law in our members,</hi> it's the <hi>fleſh, tho
body of ſin, the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſet us, the ſin that warreth againſt the mind and
the Spirit of God,</hi> that <hi>captivateth</hi> even a godly man in ſome meaſure, which
maketh <hi>Paul groan under it,</hi> and cry out of his miſerable condition thereby; ſo
that it is not meerly a ſinne, but a ſinne to be aggravated in many reſpects, and
therefore neceſſarily cauſing damnation, unleſſe God in his mercy prevent.
Let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others extenuate it, making it leſſe then the leaſt ſinne, that
is (of which more afterwards) let them talk of venial ſinnes, that do not in their
own nature deſerve hell; yet becauſe all ſinne is a tranſgreſſion of Gods Law,
the curſe of God belongeth thereunto, therefore it hath an infinite guilt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Majeſty of God, againſt whom it is committed; and they who judge
ſinne little, muſt alſo judge the Majeſty of God to be little alſo. What ſhall one
reſpect of involuntarineſs, which is in original ſinne, make it leſſe then others,
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſo many other reſpects (ſome whereof do more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the nature of ſinne, then voluntarineſs can do) farre exceed other
ſinnes?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Original ſinne muſt needs deſerve damnation, becauſe it needeth the
bloud of Chriſt to purge away the guilt of it, as well as actual ſins.</hi> Chriſt is a
Saviours to Infants, as well as to grown men, and if he be a Saviour to them,
then they are ſinners; if he ſave them, then they are loſt. As for that old
evaſion of the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> 
                           <q>Infants need Chriſt, not to ſave them from ſinne,
but to bring them to the Kingdom of Heaven, it's moſt abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
for the whole purpoſe of the Goſpel is to ſhew, That Chriſt came into
the world to bring ſinners to Heaven through his bloud; his death was expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and by way of atonement, therefore it did ſuppoſe ſinne: hence he is
ſad to be <hi>the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſinne of the world,</hi> John 1. 29.
which is both original and actual.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>That eternal damnation belongeth to the ſinne we are born in, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by thoſe remedies of grace, and Ordinances of ſalvation which were appointed
by God both in the Old and New Teſtament, for the taking away of this natural
guilt. Circumciſion</hi> in the Old Teſtament did declare, that by nature the heart
was uncircumciſed and that every one was deſtitute of any inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;
hence circumciſion is called, <hi>The ſeal of the righteouſneſſe, which is by
faith,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. To this Baptiſm doth anſwer in the New Teſtament, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
never whereof with the formal Rite of Adminiſtration doth abundantly
convince us of our ſpiritual uncleanneſs, as alſo the need we have of the bloud
of Chriſt, and alſo of his Spirit for our cleanſing.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe the <hi>known Adverſary to this truth,</hi> affirmly, That he knoweth
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:57719:284"/>
                           <q>of no Church that in her Rituals doth confeſſe and bewail original ſinne:</q> As
alſo that we might ſee the <hi>Judgement of our firſt Reformers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> about
Baptiſm, as relating to original ſinne; It is good to obſerve, what is ſet down
in the <hi>Publique Adminiſtration of Baptiſm,</hi> as by the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> was
formerly to be uſed; there the Miniſter uſeth this Introductory, <hi>Foraſmuch as
all men be conceived and born in ſinne;</hi> adding from hence, <hi>That none can enter
into the kingdom of Heaven, unleſſe he be born again.</hi> It is the ſinne he is born in
(not pure Naturals, as the Doctor ſaith) that inferreth a neceſſity of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p>Again, In the <hi>Prayer for children to be baptized,</hi> there is this paſſage, <hi>That
they coming to thy holy Baptiſm may receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Now what ſinnes
can children have but their original? It is ſpoken in the plural number, becauſe
more than one child is ſuppoſed to be baptized. Again in the ſame Prayer, we
meet with this Petition, <hi>That they being delivered from thy wrath;</hi> What can
more aſhame the Doctors opinion then this? That which he accounteth ſo
horrid, is here plainly aſſerted, <hi>That children are born under Gods wrath;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prayer is made, that they may be delivered from it.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, In another <hi>Prayer after the Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> we have this Petition,
<hi>That the old Adam in theſe children may be ſo buried, that the new man may be
raiſed up in them.</hi> Why doth he not ſeoff at this expreſſion, ſaying, (as he
doth upon another occaſion) <hi>That they change the good old man with theſe things;
that he never thought of?</hi> No doubt but he will force theſe paſſages by ſome
violent Interpretation, as he doth the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article; but certainly it would be
more ingenuity in him to flie to his <hi>principles of liberty of propheſying,</hi> rather
then to wreſt theſe publick profeſſions of original ſinne. It is true, the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and ſo the Papiſts put too much upon <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> For <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought, <hi>every
child dying without Baptiſm; yea and without the participation of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was certainly damned.</hi> But of this extream more afterwards. It is enough
for us, That Chriſts Inſtitution of ſuch a Sacrament, and that for Infants, doth
evidently proclaim our ſinfulneſſe by nature, and therein our deſert of eternal
wrath.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>To original ſinne there muſt needs belong eternal wrath, becauſe of the
nature of it, and inſeperable effects flowing from it.</hi> The nature of it is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
death of the ſoul; by this a man is alienated from all life of grace; and
therefore till the grace of God appear, it's true of all by nature, as followeth
in the Chapter where this Text is, <hi>verſ. 12. Without Chriſt alient from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, having no hope,
and without God in the world.</hi> Thus <hi>Davenant</hi> upon that Text, <hi>Dead in ſinne,
Col.</hi> 2. 13. ſaith, <q>All the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> are accounted dead; firſt, becauſe
they lie in a ſtate of ſpiritual death, having loſt the Image of God: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe they are under the guilt of eternal death, being obnoxious to the
wrath of God, for by nature we are the children of wram.</q> If then original
ſinne put us into a ſpiritual death, if thereby we be deprived of all ſpiritual
life, <hi>How can it be avoided but that eternal damnation muſt fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ow thereupon by the
deſert thereof?</hi> And as for the <hi>inſeparable effects of it,</hi> which are to carry us on
neceſſarily to ſinne in all that we do, to make us utterly impotent and unable
for any thing that is good; <hi>What can this produce but everlaſting miſery to our
ſouls?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Original ſinne is of a damnable nature, becauſe of that ſpiritual
bondage and vaſſalag; we are thereby put into even to the Devil himſelf.</hi> For
not being the children of God, we are neceſſarily the children of the Devil:
And therefore to be children of Gods wrath in the Text, is no more then to
be the children of hell, and of the Devil; for which reaſon he is called, <hi>The
Prince of the World.</hi> Seeing then the Devil hath power over all mankind,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:57719:285"/>
they are in his bondage, and Chriſt came as a Redeemer to deliver us from
him. This doth argue in what a wofull and dreadfull eſtate we are left in by this
original filthineſſe. To have the Devil poſſeſſe our bodies, how terrible is it?
But he poſſeſſeth the ſouls of every one by nature, till Chriſt doth deſtroy
him, and caſt him out. Hence the Apoſtle celebrateth that powerfull
grace of God, whereby we are delivered from the power of darkneſs into
the kingdom of his dear Sonne, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. from which children are not to be
excluded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That original ſinne hath merit of demnation, <hi>is plain,</hi> Becauſe by
it we are in an unregenerate, eſtate, <hi>John</hi> 3. Whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh,
and therefore unleſſe a man be born again of the Spirit, and from above, he cannot

Rom. 8 8. <hi>If then no unregenerate man can be ſaved, and by original ſinne
we come to be in that ſtate of carnality, it is plain, that by nature we are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
fuel for eternal flames in hell.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Eighthly, <hi>That original ſinne deſerveth damnation,</hi> appeareth, <hi>in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of it.</hi> For when <hi>Adam</hi> fell into this ſpiritual death, which is the ſame
with original ſinne in us, (though it could not be called ſo in him, becauſe he
had not it from his firſt being, neither was it derived to him from any other)
we may take notice of <hi>two ſad and terrible effects</hi> thereof, beſides many others.
The firſt whereof was the <hi>terrour and fear upon his conſcience,</hi> when God called
him by name, ſaying, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> He then flieth from God, and
would have hid himſelf from his face: How cometh <hi>Adam</hi> thus to be afraid,
thus to tremble, who had ſuch peaceable enjoyment of God before? Was it
not becauſe he had now loſt the Image of God? And this impreſſion is ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all men by nature. There is an inward terrour and fear of God, knowing
he is an holy, juſt and omnipotent God, who cannot but hate and puniſh ſin,
and therefore we being conſcious of that ſinfulneſs and pollution which is in us,
are afraid of him, dare not think of him, or draw nigh to him, horror is ready
to ſurprize us, when we think of God, while in our natural eſtate. The other
conſequent upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s pollution, was the caſting him out of Paradiſe, and
in him all his poſterity was likewiſe ejected. Now this was a type (as it were)
of our being caſt out of Heaven. This is like that ſolemn curſe at the laſt day,
<hi>Depart from me ye curſed.</hi> So that if all theſe Arguments be duly conſidered,
we cannot any longer reſiſt the light of this truth, That to us belongeth hell
and damnation, as ſoon as ever we are born, even before we have committed
any actual ſinne at all.</p>

being thus eſtabliſhed upon the Scripture rock, which will daſh in peices
all errours that beat upon it: I ſhall proceed to ſome Concluſions deduceable

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That poſition of ſome, though of different principles, is wholly contrariant
to the word of God, that none are damned for original ſinne;</hi> For ſeeing this ſinne
hath the ſame damnable guilt with it as actual ſinne hath, there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the <hi>non</hi>-damnation of perſons in one more then in another, neither can
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:57719:285"/>
we conceive God obliged to forgive one more then another; why then ſhould
it thus univerſally be acknowledged, that for actual ſinnes God may and doth
damn men, but not for original ſinne? It is true, when we ſpeak of perſons
growen up, we cannot ſeperate their actual ſinnes and original, becauſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſinne is alwayes acting and conceiving, putting it ſelf forth into many divers
luſts; and thereupon we cannot ſay of any adult perſon, that he is damned
meerly for original ſinne, becauſe to this original hath been ſuperadded many
actual tranſgreſſions; and thereupon all impenitent perſons dying ſo, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for both; yea their condemnation is inhanced thereby; for the deſert
of damnation by original and actual ſinne both, is greater then by original or
actual ſeverally. Seeing then many die in the guilt of their natural and actual
uncleanneſs, it is an unſavoury Doctrine to affirm, that no man is damned for
original ſinne. It is true, ſome men do dogmatize, that original ſinne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the guilt of it, is univerſally taken off all, and that all mankind is put into
a ſtate of reconciliation by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> as they were into a ſtate of wrath
by the firſt; but this over-throweth the Doctrine of ſpecial election, and doth
confound nature and grace together; yea it maketh Chriſt to have died in vain,
of which more fully in its time. For the preſent, ſeeing that ſo many die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
in their ſtate of unregeneracy, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that many
are damned both for their original, and actual ſinne alſo. For ſhall the root be
leſs damning, then the branches or fruit? actual ſinnes demonſtrate the effect
and power or original ſinne, and the aggravation of the effect doth neceſſarily,
aggravate the cauſe: As they ſaid to <hi>Gideon</hi> deſiring he ſhould ſlay them, <hi>Judg.

Thus as life though an <hi>actus primus,</hi> yet is alwayes expreſſed in ſecond acts, and
the effects thereof: ſo it is with original ſinne; it is by way of a fountain in us,
yet alwayes emptying it ſelf into ſtreames. It is then a ſubtle deviſe of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>
who being unwilling to make damnation, as it comprehends the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

his original ſinne, is not damned by reaſon of his original ſinne, but <hi>ratione

<hi>Thoſe learned men who hold the corrupt Maſs of mankind to be that ſtate, out of
which God chooſeth, ſome to eternal life, leaving others in this wretched and ſinfull
condition they have by</hi> Adam, <hi>do thereby affirm nothing injurious to God, or any thing
that may juſtly be complained of by ſound reaſon.</hi> It is not my intent to launch into
that vaſt Ocean of the diſpute about the object of election and reprobation, no
not as it is confined among the orthodox; they themſelves diſputing whether
it be <hi>Maſſa para,</hi> or <hi>Maſſa corrupta,</hi> from whence ariſeth that diſtinction of

                           <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> and <hi>Sublapſarians.</hi> It is enough at the preſent to affirm, that
if the corrupt Maſs of mankind be made the object of election and reprobation,
the juſtice of God is abundantly cleared againſt all <hi>Papiſts, Arminians,</hi> and
others in this particular, becauſe original ſinne doth deſerve eternal damnation.
This was the opinion of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and many moderate learned men; think this
opinion leſs obnoxious to cavils and more conſonant to Scripture, then that of
thoſe, who hold Gods decrees herein to be, ſuppoſing <hi>Maſſa pura,</hi> or man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as man, meerly in a common ſenſe: Thus God ſpeaketh of hating <hi>Eſau,</hi>

Gods election and reprobation is about Infants, as well as Adult perſons; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may we think it any cruelty or injuſtice of God, if he leave an Infant in his
natural impure eſtate, ſeeing grace is free if it be grace, and God is not bound
to adde a new favour where the former is loſt; and although ſuch an Infant
had no voluntary perſonal acting to this corrupt eſtate he is born in, for which
God eternally paſſeth him by with a negative preterition, as ſome Divines expreſs
it; yet becauſe ſinnes in the Scripture-language are called debts, that which is
juſt between man and man, may be much more between God and man, who
cannot be any wayes obliged to ſhew favour to him, and that is amongſt men;
children are liable to their parents debts, and what their parents did wickedly
and voluntarily contract by their prodigality and luxury, that the children
ſtand engaged to pay, though they had no influence into thoſe ſuppoſed debts.
Thus all mankind ſtands engaged for <hi>Adam</hi>'s debt, (I mean as the conſequent
corruption of his nature by his voluntary diſobedience, doth hereditarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to all his poſterity,) and the rather, becauſe it is both <hi>aliena,</hi> and <hi>nſtra
culpa,</hi> as <hi>Bernard,</hi> both <hi>Adam</hi>'s debt and our own alſo: No wonder then if
mankind lying in this bloud, God ſpake to ſome, to live, and leaveth the reſtin
their undone eſtate; but I muſt not enlarge on this. When that mutable <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
and miſerable <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> (though not crying out afterwards as he did,

                        <p>Firſt, They urge <hi>the love of God to mankind,</hi> ſo often mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
Inſomuch that they ſay, it doth not ſtand with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> and mercy
of God, when man is plunged thus into an undone eſtate, there to leave
him, and not deliver him out of it. But to this many things may be
ſaid. As</p>
                        <p>Firſt, We grant, that notwithſtanding our original ſinne, yet God loveth
mankind, and demonſtrateth much mercy to men, even becauſe they are his
creatures. And it muſt be granted, That the Scripture doth often celebrate
this mercy of God to man, though in a ſinfull condition: But then we muſt
diſtinguiſh between the <hi>general</hi> love of God, and his <hi>ſpecial</hi> love, between his
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:57719:287"/>
love of <hi>benevolence</hi> and love of <hi>complacency,</hi> as ſome expreſs it. God doth
love all mankind with a general love, or love of benevolence, ſo as to do good
in a liberal manner to them. This love of beneficence is demonſtrated both to
the good and the bad; yet this doth not remove the guilt of ſinne, we may be
children of wrath for all this. Therefore there is the other ſpecial love and
grace of God, a love of complacency and acceptance of us in Chriſt; and this
is only to ſome of mankind, as the Scripture in many places doth ſhew: And
yet we muſt adde, that when any are damned, we cannot ſay it is for any defect
of Gods particular love and grace, as if the fault were to be laid there, but upon
the original and actual ſinfulneſs of the perſon ſo condemned; for every mans
perdition is of himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is no injuſtice in God, if he let men alone in their loſt eſtate by
<hi>Adam;</hi> for he did at firſt endow him with all heavenly ability to ſtand in that
glorious eſtate, and thereby to bring happineſs to his poſterity alſo. Now when
<hi>Adam</hi> by his voluntary diſobedience, had deprived himſelf of all this excellency,
was God bound to reſtore him a ſecond time? If a Debtor by his own prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
make himſelf unable to pay his Creditor, is the Creditor bound to beſtow
money upon that man, and to put him into his former condition again? Now if
man own not this to man, much leſſe doth God to man.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The condition of the apoſtate Angels, and Gods diſpenſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, doth abundantly diſcover, what God might do in this caſe; for
there is no reaſon in man, why he ſhould be more kind to him, then an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
Angel, ſeeing all are ſinfull. Now when the Angels fell, was God bound
to recover theme? Did he deliver any one of them out of that wretched eſtate?
No more would God have been unjuſt, if he had not ſaved any one out of
all mankind.</p>
                        <p>Let us therefore admire at the goodneſs of God in chooſing of ſome, and
tremble under his juſtice in paſſing by of others, taking heed of pride and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
in ſearching into theſe myſterious wayes of God, eſpecially of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
and providence in this particular, which heads in Divinity are full of
comfort, as well as excellent in dignity: but to be wiſe in them according to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
is <hi>operae pretium,</hi> to erre <hi>periculum,</hi> to acquieſce <hi>miraculum,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi>
excellently in his cloſe of his diſpute with the foreſaid <hi>Puccius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the next place, let us conflict with their <hi>Goliah,</hi> the chiefeſt ſupport of
their cauſe, and that is from the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> which the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. between the <hi>firſt man Adam,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond man Jeſus Chriſts,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Preheminence</hi> is given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that his <hi>grace</hi> doth
<hi>much more abound</hi> to life and juſtication then <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne can to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Yea the Apoſtle uſeth the ſame note of <hi>Vniverſality</hi> for the ſubject of
either; ſometimes <hi>all,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>many,</hi> plainly declaring hereby, That as
there is by <hi>Adam a Catholical enmity</hi> and <hi>offence</hi> that we are plunged into, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of God towards us, ſo there is alſo as <hi>Catholical</hi> and <hi>Vniverſal Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi>
and <hi>favour</hi> with God, that we are inſtated into, through <hi>Chriſt</hi> our
<hi>Mediater;</hi> otherwiſe it ſeemeth much to derogate from the honour and glory
of Chriſt, that his favour and love ſhould be more ſtraitned and limited than
<hi>Adam</hi>'s efficacy to our condemnation.</p>
                        <p>To this many things are to be conſidered by way of anſwer:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That if they will rigidly and ſeverely urge the collation made between</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>and</hi> Chriſt, <hi>then they muſt conclude of the actual ſalvation of every man, not
one excluded.</hi> For it <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne did <hi>de facto,</hi> put all into a ſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
ſo that if Gods grace had not wrought an evaſion for ſome, all had
actually periſhed. Thus it followeth much more than on Chriſts part, that all
muſt be <hi>de facto</hi> ſaved, and delivered from <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents
thereof. But the Scripture doth clearly evidence this, <hi>That in respect
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:57719:288"/>
of the event, the greater part of mankind will be damned.</hi> The way to hell is a
<hi>broad way, and many enter therein;</hi> So that Chriſt is not <hi>actually</hi> a cauſe of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more than <hi>Adam</hi> is of damning; if you reſpect the event and iſſue, farre
more through <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience go to hell, then through Chriſts obedience
are admitted into Heaven, and yet the Adverſaries themſelves muſt confeſs, here
is no derogation to the honour and glory of Chriſt, And if it be ſaid, That it
is mans actual unbelief and impentency, whereby he doth wilfully and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
refuſe Chriſt the Phyſician of his ſoul: Chriſt hath put him into a ſtate
of favour; but he doth voluntarily caſt himſelf out again, and ſo is made unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the grace, which cometh by Chriſt. It is anſwered, that is true. But</p>
                        <p>1. How cometh it about that men have ſuch an actual rebellion againſt
Chriſt? Whence is it that they have ſuch an inclination within them, to refuſe
him that is a Saviour, though he come for their good? Though their ſinnes and
the Devil will never be that help to them, which Chriſt would be, yet they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the later, and refuſe the former; <hi>Is not all this from the polluted nature
we receive from Adam?</hi> So that hereby <hi>Adam</hi> may be thought <hi>more</hi> univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deſtroy, then Chriſt to heal.</p>
                        <p>Again, In the ſecond place, <hi>Why</hi> is it that through Chriſt they are not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from this rebellion? <hi>Why</hi> is it that he doth not vouchſafe a more tender
and pliable heart? for condemnation cometh by one ſinne, but the Apoſtle
aggrava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eth the free gift by Chriſt, that it is of <hi>many offences unto Juſtification;</hi>
If then of <hi>many,</hi> why is there any ſtint or limit of this free gift? It is plain,
that rebellious diſpoſion by ſome againſt Chriſt, is wholly ſubdued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by him, and the ſame power he could put forth in others alſo, if he
pleaſed, but he will not do it; and therefore the ſtate of reconciliation by
Chriſt, is not as <hi>extenſive,</hi> as of condemnation by <hi>Adam;</hi> if then for the <hi>event</hi>
it is plain, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s condemnation is larger <hi>than</hi> Chriſts reconciliation (all
wicked men being damned in hell both for their original and actual ſinnes and)
<hi>then</hi> the purpoſe or decree about this event, was no wayes tending to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It is to be conſidered more diligently, in <hi>what method</hi> the Apoſtle
doth here ſpeak of the <hi>Vniverſality of the Subject relating to Adam and Chriſt.</hi>
For the Apoſtle twice ſpeaking in the general of our condemnation, doth uſe
the word <hi>all,</hi> verſ. 12 <hi>Death paſſed upon</hi> all <hi>men, in that</hi> all <hi>have ſinned.</hi> And
<hi>verſ. 18. Judgement came upon all men to condemnation;</hi> but to theſe generals, he
doth preſently ſubjoyn a <hi>diſtribution</hi> of this <hi>all,</hi> and then uſeth the word <hi>many:</hi>
By which it is apparent, that the Apoſtle on purpoſe altering his ſpeech, and
diſtributing this <hi>all</hi> afterwards into <hi>many</hi> of two kinds, he doth underſtand the
word <hi>all,</hi> not <hi>univerſally,</hi> but <hi>commonly</hi> and <hi>indifinitely;</hi> e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe why ſhould he
immediately upon the word <hi>all,</hi> preſently interpret it diſtributively? So that if
the Apoſtles expreſſion, and the Coherence of his Diſcourſe be more exactly
ſearched into, it will be found not to patrocinate any ſuch ſuppoſed <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
reconciliation; For the Apoſtle divideth the <hi>all,</hi> into the <hi>many</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by <hi>Adam</hi> eventually, and the <hi>many</hi> juſtified and ſaved by Chriſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, When the Apoſtle maketh this compariſon between the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>
to condemnation and Chriſt to Juſtification, giving the ſuperiority <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                           <hi>This is not to be underſtood in reſpect of the number of men, but of the nature of
theſe gracious effects we hate by Chriſt.</hi> This compariſon is not for expreſſe in
quantity but quality. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>O, how many more</hi> (as the

<hi>Adam) but how much more ſhall the grace of God abound through Chriſt to many?</hi>
The <hi>how much more</hi> lieth not in the <hi>number,</hi> but in the <hi>nature</hi> of theſe gracious
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:57719:288"/>
effect; which come by Chriſt, though to ſome onely; for that the Apoſtle doth
not intend an exceſs of Chriſs grace, in reſpect of the <hi>number,</hi> it is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that had been <hi>impoſſible,</hi> there could have been but an <hi>equality</hi> at moſt:
If it ſhould be granted, That Chriſt hath reconciled all thoſe that <hi>Adam</hi> loſt,
this would be an <hi>equality</hi> only, we could not ſay, Chriſt redeemed more than
<hi>Adam</hi> deſtroyed, for that could not have been; therefore it is plain, that the
<hi>ſuperabundance</hi> attributed by the Apoſtle to Chriſt, in reſpect of Juſtification,
is to be underſtood <hi>intenſively,</hi> not <hi>extenſively,</hi> in reſpect of the nature of thoſe
bleſſed effects we receive by him, and ſo indeed there is a great tranſcendency
in Chriſt in reſpect of <hi>Adam.</hi> For</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>By Chriſt we have vivification and quickning to grace and glory, whereas by</hi>
Adam <hi>we have ſinne and condemnation.</hi> Now it is farre eaſier to occaſion the
damnation of many, then to procure the ſalvation of one. To juſtifie and
ſave one man, is more than to deſtroy all mankind. As we ſee amongſt men,
it's eaſier to deſtroy a thing, then to build it up; one man may kill many men,
but yet the ſame man cannot bring any one of thoſe to life again. If therefore
Chriſt had ſaved but one of all mankind, he was infinitely to be exalted above
<hi>Adam,</hi> by whoſe diſobedience mankind was plunged into a periſhing eſtate. So
that if we do compare Death with Life Heaven with Hell, Damnation with
Salvation, and that the one cometh from a <hi>deficient cauſe,</hi> the other from an
<hi>efficient;</hi> we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that Chriſt hath infinitely the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. There are ſome that diſtinguiſh between the <hi>ſufficiency and worth that is in
Chriſts mediation, and the actual application of it,</hi> 
                           <q>Now (ſay they) the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam</hi> was infinately more able to ſave, then <hi>Adam</hi> to deſtroy, and that
if we reſpect the number of men, for Chriſt is able to ſave a thouſand of
worlds beſides this, if there were ſo many; and therefore if we ſpeak of
Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>ſufficiency, Adam</hi> in a deſtructing way is no more
comparable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a ſaving way, then a drop to the ocean, or a ſinite
to an infinite.</q> For the obedience of Chriſt is the obedience of God and man.
Now though this anſwer may in a good explained ſenſe be received, yet I ſhall
not ſo much avouch it, partly becauſe the diſtinction is made uſe of to a farre
other end, then the Orthodox do intend; and then partly, becauſe the Apoſtle
doth not here attend, in his compariſon, ſo much to what is ſufficient in Chriſt, as
to what is actual; not ſo much to what he is able to do, as what he will do. It's
<hi>efficacy</hi> not <hi>ſufficiency</hi> the Apoſtle aimeth at; therefore we ſtick to the former
anſwer, though in many other reſpects, the excellency of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> to
the firſt, night be declared, which are not here to be repeated; only that <hi>one</hi>
the Apoſtle inſtanceth in, is not to be paſſed over, which is, that it is but <hi>one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to condemnation,</hi> whereas the grace of Chriſt extendeth to the aboliſhing of
<hi>many offences,</hi> that one ſinne is enough to damn, but the grace of Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
not only to the abolition of that, but alſo all offences that do actually flow
from it. Thus every godly ſoul may comfortably improve this truth, that there
is more in Chriſt to ſave, then is in all ſinne, whether original or actual to damn;
Chriſt is more able to juſtifie, then <hi>Adam</hi> is to condemn. Therefore ſome School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
deny, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinne did demerit the death and damnation of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
it deſerved his own damnation, and his own death only. All other mens
deaths, and other mens damnation have for their meritorious cauſe their original
ſin inherent in them. <hi>Adam</hi> did not meritoriouſly deſerve theſe; but when fallen,
then his poſterity deſcending from him, did naturally fall into ſuch a corrupted
eſtate, as he himſelf was plunged into; and the reaſon they give of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                           </hi> or <hi>demereri,</hi> for the whole nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood, all his poſterity would have been holy and happy:
but we cannot ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> would have merited this for all mankind; for that is a
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:57719:289"/>
peculiar thing to Chriſt only, which is incommunicable to a meer man, to merit;
for the whole race of mankind. And although there is a great difference between
merit and demerit; (a man may put himſelf into a demerit of eternal glory, but
not into a merit) yet in this they are alike. This reaſoning of ſome Schoolmen
admitted (which ſeemeth very plauſible) then it neceſſarily followeth, that
Chriſts power to ſave is ſuperlative, more than <hi>Adams</hi> to deſtroy.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, That Chriſt in his efficacy of grace, doth exceed <hi>Adam</hi> in his condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilt, appeareth, <hi>In that at laſt, he will utterly remove original ſin from all, that
are his members; and ſo totally vanquiſh it, that it ſhall not remain in the leaſt ſpot
thereof.</hi> Although <hi>Chriſt came into the world to take away all ſin,</hi> yet ſome School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
conclude, that principally it was to deliver us from original ſin; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Suarez, De Incar. Chriſti) this is the cauſe and the root of all actual iniquities.</hi> It is
not enough for Chriſt to purge us from our actual impieties, but he alſo intends
to heal our natures. Now becauſe original ſin infecteth the nature, chiefly as it is
in perſons, ſo alſo doth Chriſt principally intend the ſanctification of our natures.
And although this be not preſently and immediatly done, yet it wil at laſt be done,
in that good time he hath appointed for that end. Thoſe indeed that limit the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of Chriſts grace to original ſin only, as if actual ſins were to be removed
by our voluntary penances and ſatisfaction, they make <hi>Chriſt but a ſame. Saviour,</hi>
and a <hi>ſemi mediator.</hi> But yet it may well be affirmed, becauſe this original corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
is the pollution of the nature, and is the cauſe of all actual defilements, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the bloud of Chriſt doth in the moſt principal place cleanſe from this. And
therefore this ſhould exceedingly comfort the godly, who groan under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of this defilement upon them, <hi>that Chriſt will never leave them, till he hath
reſtored them perfectly to their primitive integrity; for this end he came into the world,
ſo that he would be but an impefect Saviour, if he ſhould not at laſt cure thee of this
nature-defilement;</hi> for this lieth upon him to do, that he bring al things to their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
yea a <hi>better perfection;</hi> that ſo all may admire the <hi>goodneſs, wiſdom</hi> and <hi>mercy
of God in Chriſt;</hi> and that all cavillers may ſtop their mouths, who uſually demand,
<hi>Why did God ſuffer Adam to fall? Why did he not prevent ſin, when it was in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi>
Now when all the world ſhall ſee, that a greater good is wrought by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam,</hi> than evil was by the firſt; this will make us break out into holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
ſaying, <hi>Oh the wiſdom of God, how unſearchable are his wayes?</hi> And this
may ſuffice for the razing of that foundation they build ſo much upon.</p>
                        <p>In the third place, I find that urged for an <hi>univerſal cleanſing of all mankind,</hi>
and that none is in a <hi>ſtate of wrath</hi> now by nature; <hi>Becauſe in that viſion which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for ſuch a Doctrine. Indeed it is very difficult, and many grammatical and real
doubts there are upon the place; only we muſt take it for granted, that there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the firſt promiſe of a Chriſ: till <hi>Adam</hi> heard this from God, he could have
no more hopes for his ſalvation, than the devils have. Therefore we are to abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrin, who make this to be <hi>only a malediction of the ſerpent, or

alſo, <hi>That Adam and Eve underſtood no more from God then that thing.</hi> But we ſee
other Scriptures plainly alluding to this, as when Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
Gal. 4. 4. and that <hi>he came into the world to deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 8. and in other places we find the devil called <hi>the old ſerpent,</hi> and <hi>the red dragon,
which ſeduced the whole earth,</hi> Rev. 12. 9, 10. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> did allude to this promiſe,
when he uſeth that expreſſion, <hi>Rom. 16. 20. The God of peace ſhall ſhortly tread or
bruiſe Satan under your feet.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Socinian</hi> asketh, <hi>How it can be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
ſeeing it is a curſe? Can cold and hot come out of the ſame month?</hi> The anſwer
is eaſie: therefore there is a promiſe, becauſe of the curſe; for in that the devil
and his ſeed is in a myſtical ſenſe curſed by God, thereby is a promiſe made
concerning Chriſt and his ſeed for victory over the devil; ſo that the promiſe is
of excellent uſe and comfort; no godly man ought to fear either devil or wicked
men, as long as he remembreth this promiſe. If Satans head be not yet bruiſed,
if he have ſome life ſtill, if he ſometimes ſting thee, be not diſcouraged; for
though this promiſe was made long ago, yet God hath not forgotten it. But
although this be ſo, yet we cannot from hence conclude, that God is become
reconciled with all mankind; or that all after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall are received into
equal grace. For we ſee plainly, there are two kinds diſtinguiſhed in the Text,
there is the <hi>Womans ſeed,</hi> and there is the <hi>ſerpents ſeed;</hi> and between theſe there
is an <hi>enmity</hi> placed; The womans ſeed is Chriſt and his members (as we will
here take for granted) The ſerpents ſeed are all wicked men reprobated in their
ſins; for <hi>by nature we are all the ſerpents ſeed;</hi> but here it ſpeaketh of ſuch a ſeed
as ſhall continue in oppoſition to Chriſt and his people: That therefore ſome
are the womans ſeed, ſome the ſerpents ſeed; on one part it cometh from the
meer grace of God, and on the other part from the juſtice of God. So that
this Text, if rightly conſidered, <hi>doth rather overthrow than eſtabliſh ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Reconciliation of all mankind.</hi> It is true, for thoſe who are made Chriſts
by free diſcriminating grace, both this promiſe, and that diſcourſe of <hi>Pauls,
Rom.</hi> 5. do proclaim admirable comfort and conſolation. For that condition
thou wert ſo irrecoverably plunged into; that ſinne and devil thou wert ſo
afraid of, is wholly conquered by Chriſt. Hold up thy head therefore thou
member of Chriſt and be exceeding glad, for the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> hath taken
off that ſinne, that wrath, that vengeance which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had brought
upon thee. And alas! how free was this grace of God to thee? What did God
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:57719:290"/>
ſee in thee more then in the ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Adam?</hi> Waſt not thou in
the ſame filth with them? Waſt not thou wallowing in the ſame blood with
them? Had not <hi>Adam</hi> infected thee, condemned thee, as well as others? Oh

a child of wrath, hath made thee a child of ſuch ſpecial favour and mercy!</p>

                        <head type="sub">Of the ſtate of Infants that die in their Infancy, before they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any Actual Tranſgreſsions, and that die before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</head>
                        <p>THe next particular in order to be treated upon is, <hi>concerning the ſtate of thoſe
Infants, who die in their Infancy, before they are capable of any actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>
Theſe having only original ſinne upon them, what may we conclude
about their final eſtate? for we will take for granted, that the Doctrine of the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> is to be exploded, who hold that Infants have actual ſinnes, and that
ſome do partake of actual grace; this is repugnant to reaſon and experience.
Now to proceed more orderly in this point, we are to take notice of theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
particulars.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That it is one thing to be a child of wrath by nature, and another thing
to be reprobated for ever by God, never to be admitted into his favour. When
the Apoſtle calleth us children of wrath, the meaning is not, as if there were a
final and total rejection from all grace; for then the meaning would be, that all
men are damned, which is manifeſtly contradicted by many places in Scripture.
Though therefore all Infants are by nature the children of wrath, yet all are
not reprobated; though all deſerve to be damned, yet all are not actually dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, We are to know that thoſe, who hold ſome Infants dying in their
original ſinne to be damned, do yet acknowledge that it is (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calleth
it) <hi>mitiſſima omnium poena,</hi> the mildeſt of all puniſhments, becauſe they have
no actual ſinnes joyned with their original, to encreaſe the torments of hell.
It is true, we told you original ſinne in the nature of it is very great and hainous,
even ſo great, that none are able to expreſs the loathſomneſs thereof; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it hath this diminiſhing circumſtance, that it is not voluntary perſonally
in an Infant, therefore we may conclude, that they have leſſer torments in
hell, then Adult perſons. For that there are degrees of torments in hell, ſome
puniſhed more extreamly then others, is acknowledged by all, though ſome
learned men queſtion, whether there be any degrees of glory in heaven.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, As for the Doctrine of the learned about the ſtate of Infants dying
in their Infancy, there are ſeveral opinions; Some hold that all Infants dying
ſo, whether in the Church, or out of the Church, whether of believing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
parents, are ſaved. They think this opinion doth moſt ſuit with the
goodneſs and mercy of God: of this opinion are not only the Heterodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
but even learned <hi>Junius</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Puccius; Zuinglius</hi> alſo is alledged
for this. Others they make a diſtinction of Infants dying in their Infancy. For
either they die without Baptiſme, or with Baptiſme; if without Baptiſme, then
they conclude of their damnation; and in this rigid way <hi>Auſtin</hi> went, and many
follow him; yea <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought, that if they died without the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper alſo: for at that age it was generally held that both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were neceſſary to ſalvation, and therefore both to be applyed to Infants:
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:57719:290"/>
But then for theſe Infants, who die partakers of Baptiſme, they concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
of their ſalvation, this being their Doctrine, that Baptiſme doth waſh
away original ſinne: The <hi>Papiſts</hi> they all agreeing in this likewiſe, that Baptiſm
is neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate medii</hi> to ſalvation, either really, or <hi>in voto,</hi> in deſire; and
becauſe an Infant dying without Baptiſme, cannot have a deſire thereunto;
Hence they conclude of eternal death, as a puniſhment unto ſuch; yet <hi>Eliſius</hi>
a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in his <hi>piorum clypeus,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Queſt. 10. Art.</hi> 3.) is very bold, ſaying that
opinion which many Divines and the Church holdeth, concerning the ſtate of
Infants dying without Baptiſme according to the ordinary law, <hi>eſt ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>dura &amp;
oneroſa,</hi> is very hard and burdenſome, and not conformable to the precepts of
Chriſt, which are ſweet and eaſy; and therefore he alledgeth <hi>Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
for this opinion, which he is ſo farre from judging heretical, that he calls it
<hi>pietati conformis;</hi> but generally the <hi>Papiſts</hi> go otherwiſe: But then they differ
amongſt themſelves. Some of them, as <hi>Catharinus,</hi> place Infants ſo dying, in a
terreſtrial Paradiſe, where they have a natural, though not a ſupernatural hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
(<hi>Opuſ de ſtatu parv</hi>) Others make their condition more miſerable, <hi>viz.</hi>
that they have the privative part of eternal death, though not the poſitive;
they have the <hi>poena damni,</hi> the puniſhment of loſs, though not of ſenſe, they
are ſhut out from enjoying God, but yet they ſay this will not work any ſorrow
in them, becauſe they know, that they were not in a capacity for enjoying the
face of God, as (ſay they) a Country Peaſant is not grieved, becauſe he is not
a King, becauſe he never was in any probability for ſuch a dignity. But, as a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Writer, (<hi>Flor. Conrius Archip. Thuani.</hi>) obſerveth, confuting his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and rigidly following <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in a Tractate joyned to <hi>Janſenius</hi> his Works:
Theſe Infants (ſaith he) knowing that they are ſhut from the face of God, muſt
needs be exceedingly grieved; becauſe in <hi>Adam</hi> they had a capacity to enjoy
God, even as a poor man may mourn that he is not a King, when his anceſtors
had a right to it, but ſinfully loſt it, and this is the caſe of all Infants; ſo that
it is a meer figment that many <hi>Papiſts</hi> have, to make an half hell, and a <hi>ſemi</hi>-damnation,
as if we might be deprived of Gods favour, and not be poſitively
damned. It is true, here alſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are divided; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh five
divers opinions concerning the ſtate of dying Infants, and he joyneth with thoſe
that hold they have inward ſorrow in that eternal death, but yet not ſo great as
to be called hell fire, or the worm of conſcience. For this end they write and
ſpeak ſo much of a <hi>limbus Infantum,</hi> a border or fringe as it were in hell; where
Infants are all diſpoſed, being without the Viſion of God, yet not tormented
with boddy pain; but there is no Scripture for ſuch a place: and therefore we
leave this <hi>limbus</hi> to theſe <hi>limbatis pontificiis,</hi> who love to enlarge their <hi>limbos,</hi>
and <hi>ſimbrias,</hi> as one ſaith. Laſtly, There are others, and they diſtinguiſh of
Infants dying: either they are ſuch as are within the Covenant, and are of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
parents; and of ſuch they conclude their ſalvation: for they look upon
their federation, as an external ſign of their election; but then for all ſuch as
die without the Covenant, the children of Pagans; they ſay, that by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they cannot conclude of any hope of ſalvation for them. Thus you ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
how many divers wayes they go, who handle this Queſtion: I might adde
another opinion mentioned by <hi>Vorſtius, (Anti</hi> Bellar. <hi>in Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ad Theſ. Duodes</hi>) of ſome, who affirm Infants do wholly periſh as beaſts; but
(ſaith he) theſe are not to be accounted <hi>inter Evangelicos,</hi> amongſt the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Churches; yet within a little while after, he reproveth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for not
touching upon all the opinions of others about Infants, ſaying, That there
are not wanting ſome amongſt Chriſtians, who think either ſome or all Infants
are through death wholly aboliſhed, as beaſts; whoſe Arguments (ſaith he)
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould have anſwered, but herein <hi>Vorſtius</hi> ſeemeth to manifeſt his
good will to the <hi>Socinian</hi> party, and though he excludeth them from the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici,</hi>
                           <pb n="548" facs="tcp:57719:291"/>
yet he acknowledgeth them <hi>Chriſtiani.</hi> All that I ſhall ſpeak to it ſhall
be comprehended in theſe particulars:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That concerning Infants, there are many difficulties in Divinity, for
the Scripture ſpeaking for the moſt part of perſons growen up, hence it is that
we cannot ſo clearly diſcover the truth about them, as how Infants are juſtified,
ſeeing they have no actual faith to lay hold upon Chriſt; as alſo how the Spirit
of God doth work in them regeneration, and make them new creatures; for
ſeeing it is plain that of ſuch Infants is the kindome of heaven, and Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is to the believer, and his ſeed; it neceſſarily followeth, that they are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and they are ſanctified, though we know not how the Spirit of God doth
this in them. Thus in the matter of the Reſurrection and the day of Judgment,
we muſt neceſſarily acknowledge, that Infants will then be raiſed with perfect
bodies, all imperfections being then to be removed from glorified bodies, as
alſo that they will be called to Judgement: Though the judicial proceſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the Evangeliſt inſtanceth only in actual ſinnes and duties, we muſt
then be ſober in this inquiſition, ſeeing the Scripture ſpeaketh not ſo expreſly
of Infants, neither is the Queſtion neceſſarily to be known, and therefore if we
be over curious in enquiting what God will them: Let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                        <p>Secondly, We muſt neceſſarily make a diſtinction between ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

it, and therefore with the <hi>Remorſtrants</hi> to conclude, That all Infants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it ſaith of the children of unbelievers that they are unclean, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
they are ſaid to be without; and therefore according to the Rule of the
Scripture, we ſee no more viſible way for the children of Heathens, then for
Heathens themſelves to be ſaved; but yet the Orthodox do adde, that they
leave theſe things to the judgement of God, and content themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> that
which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 12. What have I to do to judge thoſe that are without:</hi>
although the Apoſtle doth not there ſpeak of a Doctrinal Judgement, but a
Judgement of Juriſdiction, which Church Officers cannot exerciſe upon thoſe
that are without the Church, though this be ſo, we muſt alwayes remember to
put a difference between that general love of God to mankind, and that ſpecial
grace of his to his Church, and therefore we muſt needs be injurious to this
grace of God, if we make children without the Covenant to be partakers of the
ſame ſpecial priveledge which others within do receive, then the Goſpel is no
ſuch extrordinary mercy, then the Covenant of grace is no ſuch ſignal favour,
then believing parents have no ſuch cauſe to bleſs God for his mercifull diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
towards them, if Heathens children are in as prepared a way for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with God, as their poſterity is.</p>
                        <p>3. Therfore the fountain and ſpring head of the ſalvation of children dying in
their Infancy, is the election of God as well as in grown perſons, it holdeth in
them, as well as in adult perſons, that election doth obtain, <hi>and he hath mercy
on whom he will have mercy,</hi> election and reprobation is amongſt Infants dying,
ſo as well as of thoſe that are men, though this Doctrine be rejected by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi>
yet believing parents who loſe their children while in the bloſſom,
are greatly to comfort their ſouls concerning their children ſo early deceaſed;
for although they are not able to look into the Book of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> which is in heaven,
and thereby know which childs name is written there, and which not; yet in
that they are externally brought under the Covenant of grace, and ſo in prox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime
capacity to Church-Communion; they may well ſatisfie themſelves in
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:57719:291"/>
this, as an effect of their election, and that becauſe God hath choſen them to
eternal glory, therefore are they in time received into this grace and favour,
as to be of the reputed members of Chriſt, and in this we muſt reſt, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that God doth internally go along with the Ordinance; and that if the
child be taken away in its Infancy, it is done both in mercy to the child, and
to the parents: Of this ſubject it is good to peruſe <hi>Peter Martyr, Comment.</hi>
1 Cor. 7.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, Therefore in this great buſineſs of the ſalvation of children dying in
Infancy, it is election, and the Covenant of greace that maketh the difference,
and not Baptiſme: This was <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s miſtake of old, and the Popiſh errour
in theſe latter dayes, to lay too much upon Baptiſme, as if that by its very work
done, <hi>opere operato,</hi> (as they ſay) did take away original ſinne, and put us into
a ſtate of grace, from which men by actual impietis might afterwards fall away;
ſo that the errours about Baptiſme are extream, either ſuch as think it only a
temporary Ordinance for the initiation of the Church at firſt, as the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
or elſe ſuch as make it to be the efficacious inſtrument of grace, and that from
the meer work done, though there be no good actual motion, or ſtirring of the
heart at the time, though adminiſtred to an adult perſon: Hence it is that by
ſome the Ordinance of Baptiſme is exalted too much, as if the outward waſhing
would ſave a man, not at all looking to the inward grace repreſented thereby,
and by others it is wholly rejected as not being commanded us now in theſe
times, or if it be ſo, is only commemorative of our duty not ſeating and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignative
of any grace of God to us, for which cauſe the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſay,
That the Doctrine of the Sacraments as it is now delivered by Proteſtant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
is vehemently ſuſpected by them, but we are to ſail between theſe two
rocks, neither giving it too much or too little, for we may obſerve that the
Scripture ſpeaketh two wayes of Sacraments. Firſt when men do reſt on them,
never at all attending to that grace they ſignifie, then the Scripture doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
them, attributeth no glory at all to them, making Sacraments to be no
Sacraments, if they be not received in a right manner; Thus the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Circumciſion is become uncircumciſion to him that keepeth not the Law:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.
11. This is not to eat the Lords Supper, yea unworthy receivers eat and drink their
own ſalvation:</hi> Thus the Scripture when it attends to mens either reſting upon
them as if they could ſave, or the ſinful abuſe of them, by not attending to the
grace ſignified doth ſpeak in an undervaluing way of them; But then at other
times, when it doth reſpect the inſtitution of Chriſt, and the effects thereof,
then glorious and great things are ſpoken of them; yet though the Scripture
commends and commandeth them as the inſtitution of Chriſt for ſupernatural
effects, notwithſtanding that old Rule is to be received, that not the privation,
but the contempt of Sacraments doth damn; ſo that the after ages of the
Church which came to idolize Baptiſme, and to put ſo much vertue even in the
very external act done, can no wayes be juſtified, yea ſo greatly did ſuperſtition
grow in this kind, that they thought Baptiſme did alſo work ſome wonderfull
temporal effects; for whereas there is a traditon, (though it be juſtly reckoned
among the vulgar errours) that the <hi>Jewes</hi> have by way of puniſhment an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſmell or ſtink inflicted upon their body, they inſtance in <hi>Jewes</hi> baptized,
that therby were cleanſed from this filthineſs. The Poet <hi>Fortunatus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sanct.
Comment. in</hi> Jer. 31. 29.</p>
                        <q>Abluitur Judeus odor Baptiſmate divo.</q>
                        <p>Thus abſurd did many grow in their thoughts about the efficacy of Baptiſme;
but the truth is, That although Baptiſm be an Ordinance appointed by God for
the ſealing of the remiſſion of original ſinne, yet it hath not this effect in all,
neither is the benefit of Baptiſme to be limited to that time only, but it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:57719:292"/>
it ſelf to our whole life; ſo that we are daily to make an improvement of it
both for duty and comfort. And thus much may ſuffice for the deciding of this
Queſtion with ſobriety and modeſty.</p>
                        <p>Now if any ſhall ſay upon the hearing of this damnable eſtate that we are
plunged into by ſinne, as the Diſciples in another caſe, <hi>It is good not to marry;</hi>
yea that it is good to have no children; it is good to be no Parents, becauſe
our Infants do thus come into the world upon worſe terms then the young ones
of bruit beaſts, becauſe they are the children of Gods wrath, whereas the
creatures are not the creatures of Gods wrath. To ſuch as ſhall thus conclude,
I ſhall propound theſe enſuing particulars:</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is juſt and righteous with God, to continue the propagation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
though man hath thus corrupted his nature. Becauſe</hi> Adam <hi>fell, and ſo all
his poſtcrity would be propagated in a damnable estate, ſhall he therefore deſtroy
the whele</hi> ſpecies <hi>of men, and raze out every</hi> individuum? Seeing then its Gods
will, that men ſhould increaſe and multiply, that there ſhould be parents and
children; for which end he hath inſtituted marriage, we are to regard the will
of God in this way more than the adherent corruption; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this damnable guilt doth adhere to our natures, not from Gods primitive
Inſtitution, but by <hi>Adam</hi>'s voluntary tranſgreſſion. It being then a duty to
ſome to marry, it being by God appointed a remedy againſt ſinne; for thee to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from that way, and to deſire no children under pretence of original ſinne,
is a meer deluſion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>You are to know, That though children be born in this defiled and
curſed eſtate, yet they are in themſelves mercies and comforts,</hi> which mace our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſay, <hi>That a woman, becauſe of the joy that a man child is born, ſhe forgetteth
all her ſorrow and pangs that ſhe was in,</hi> John 16. 21. So that at the ſame time, they
may be by nature children of wrath, and yet in another reſpect comforts and
mercies in themſelves; for which end God promiſeth children as a mercy, and
threatneth it, as a puniſhment, to be barren and childleſs.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thou that art a believing parent, and haſt thy child dying in its infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
thou haſt cauſe to aſſure thy ſelf of the mercy of God to thy child, becauſe he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
parents and children into the ſame promiſe.</hi> Oh but I know not that God
hath elected him; So neither canſt thou thy own, <hi>à priori</hi> I you muſt begin at
the lower round of the ladder, in Gods Election; The effects and fruits thereof;
And now what greater pledge and argument canſt thou have of his ſalvation,
then being born under the Covenant of grace? You cannot expect actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of regeneration and grace from a dying Infant; therefore thou muſt
runne to the Covenant of grace, whereby God doth receive ſuch, as his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
yea thou haſt cauſe to admire the goodneſs of God to thy child, and his
mercy, when ſo many thouſands, and thouſands of <hi>Pagans</hi> children dying, have
no viſible way of ſalvation; we cannot by the Scripture (as you heard) ſee
any Ark provided for them, as God in mercy hath done for thee.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>The conſideration of Gods juſt and ſevere proceedings againſt Pagans
and their children, may make thee the more admire the grace of God in ſaving of thee.</hi>
For how many Heathens periſh in hell, who it may be never committed ſuch
groſs and ſoul ſins in their life time, as thou haſt done? To be ſure their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
never committed ſuch actual inquities, as thou haſt done; yet they appear
according to Gods ordinary way of proceedings, to be left in that loſt eſtate of
nature. And therefore that is a good quickning meditation which <hi>Ved<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

<q>grace, ſeeing by nature we deſerve otherwiſe. <hi>Ah quot ſunt, erunt in inferno
miſelli infantuli,</hi> &amp;c. Ah how many little Infants are, and ſhall be in hell,
who never had the knowledge of good and evil, and might not God have
left thee in the ſame miſery?</q> This (I ſay) is a pious meditation. Though

his Book, as if it were no leſſe then blaſphemy, <hi>Vedel. Rhapſod.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Thou who art a parent exerciſed with this temptation about thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
it grieveth thee to think thou bringeſt them forth to be Gods enemies,
and the Devils children: <hi>Let not this diſcourage thee, but provoke thee the more
earneſtly to be much in prayer for them, and to be more carefull in their education.</hi>
Let them be the children of thy prayers and tears, the children of thy care and
godly diſcipline, and thou mayeſt comfort thy ſelf that ſuch ſhall not periſh;
however thou haſt done thy duty, and ſo art to leave all to the wiſe and righteous
God, who is not accountable to man for any of his proceedings.</p>
                        <p>That the encouragement and hopes of parents are great in the faithfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their duties, notwithſtanding the guilt of original ſinne, may further
appear, as to the woman, in that famous and noble Text, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 14, 15. But
the woman being deceived was in the tranſgreſſion; Notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in child-bearing, if they continue in the faith</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Apoſtle having ſtrictly charged,</hi> That women ſhould not uſurp authority
over the man, <hi>for two reaſons,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. From the primitive Creation, even before ſinne; <hi>Adam was firſt formed,
then Eve:</hi> So that in the ſtate of integrity, the wife was to have been ſubject
to her husband, even as children to parents; but it would have been without that
difficulty and reluctancy which ſinne hath now brought upon mankind.</p>
                        <p>The other reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion,</hi> and
thereby through her original ſinne infected all. Now leſt this ſhould afflict
women too much, and they conceive their eſtate deſperate; the Apoſtle ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
honey with this gall, he informeth them of comfortable conſiderations,
even from that very particular; wherein they ſee the evident diſpleaſure and
wrath of God; and that is the ſorrows and pangs they bring forth children with,
<hi>She ſhall be ſaved in child-bearing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>How this is to be underſtood ſeemeth difficult. For may not maids, or ſuch
married perſons that never have children be ſaved? How ſhall they do that
have no children, if the woman be ſaved in child-bearing?</p>
                        <p>To this it is eaſily anſwered, That the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak of the meritorious
cauſe of ſalvation, which is Chriſt; for in him all believers are one; there is neither
<hi>male</hi> or <hi>female, Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> married or unmarried, that do differ, as to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and ſalvation through him. Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here only of
ſuch women, as are married, and have children. Now becauſe ſuch might be
diſcouraged, becauſe of the curſe laid upon the woman at firſt, in bringing
forth of children, he addeth, <hi>That notwithſtanding this ſhe ſhall be ſaved;</hi> Thoſe
pangs and ſorrows do not exclude her from ſalvation; therefore the Greek
Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 27. compared with 29. it doth not ſignifie,
ſhe is ſaved by that, as a cauſe. For how many women are there, who through
their impenitency in wicked wayes will be damned, though they be the mothers
of many children? It ſignifieth only the way and means wherein ſhe may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſalvation. So that what was at firſt in it ſelf a curſe, may now be ſanctified,
and ſo prove no impediment to their ſalvation. It is true, ſome would have
this <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, to be meant of the Virgins bearing of Chriſt, as if the meaning
were, She ſhall be ſaved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Chriſt born of a woman. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on the
place, ſaith, <hi>Theophilact</hi> mentioneth this, but rejecteth it. The <hi>late Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
mentioneth it with approbation; but the Context doth no wiſe agree with
this; for he ſpeaketh of every woman in the Church bearing her children;
therefore addeth, <hi>If they abide in faith and charity;</hi> neither can any argument
be put upon the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as if the Apoſtle meant that ſignal and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
bearing of a child, when Chriſt was born; for if this were ſo, none but
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and no other woman could take comfort from this palce.

                           </gap> underſtandeth marriage, She ſhall be ſaved in the way of
marriage, which is called ſo (ſaith he) from the end of marriage, which is to
have children; for (as he affirmeth) the <hi>Grecians</hi> have not one word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

                           </gap>; but this hath no probability: We adhere therefore to the former
Expoſition; the ſenſe whereof is, That notwithſtanding <hi>Eve</hi> did through ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
ſinne bring a ſad curſe upon child-bearing, yet to thoſe women that are
godly, the curſe is taken off; yea and doth become a ſanctified meanes of
their ſalvation; not of it ſelf to every one (for then no child-bearing woman
could be damned) but if they do walk in thoſe wayes God hath commanded.
Therefore it followeth, <hi>If they abide,</hi> &amp;c. which denoteth the neceſſity of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and continuing in all holy duties. Some indeed referre this to the children,
If the children continue in what is good. And if it be ſaid, <hi>When a godly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth her duty, ſhe may have notwithſtanding wicked and ungodly children, and
ſhall that prejudice her ſalvation?</hi> To this they anſwer, That for the moſt part
the wickedneſs of children is laid upon the parents neglect; but if it be not, then
God will accept of the mother faithfully diſcharging her duty, though the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
do wickedly miſcarry; but it is farre more probable to referre it to the
woman. And though the number be changed into the plural, <hi>If they abide,</hi> yet
that is ordinary in Scripture, eſpecially when the word is a collective, as in the
5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of this Epiſtle <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. where <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           </gap> in the plural relateth to it. The qualification then that is neceſſary
to all women, that would find the curſe in child-bearing taken away, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
guilt accompanying that ſorrow removed, is to abound in all ſaving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to continue therein; and then that woman who is a wife and a mother
of many children, let her not torment her ſelf about the ſtate of her children,
and the condition they are born in, but quiet her ſoul with this Text of
Scripture.</p>
                        <p>The laſt particular, that may ſatisfie the ſouls of ſuch parents who may be
exerciſed in theſe particulars about original ſinne, is to remind themſelves,
<hi>That the whole matter about original ſinne in reference to</hi> Adam, <hi>and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is not without the wiſe and holy appointment of God, who would never have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
this evil to be, could he not have raiſed out thereby a greater good.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be true, That <hi>Adam</hi> did ſinne from his meer internal liberty, there
being no decrees or execution thereof that did neceſſitate him to do ſo; yet all
this could not be without the Decree of God permitting, as alſo wiſely ordering
all things for his own glory. No doubt but God could have confirmed <hi>Adam</hi>
in his holineſs; yea he might have ſo ordered it, that every man and woman
ſhould ſtand or fall upon their perſonal account, as the Angels did: yet ſuch
was his will and Covenant, that in <hi>Adam</hi> all his poſterity ſhould be involved,
and the ſame iſſue ſhould attend both them and him. This then being the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of a juſt, wiſe and mercifull God, we ought wholly to acquieſce,
knowing that the buſineſs of mans life and death, his ſalvation and damnation,
could not have been ordered better otherwiſe, though all the wiſdome of men
and Angels had been put together. And therefore when thou who art a parent,
but tempted about the ſtate of thy children thou haſt brought forth, art tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiling
thy ſelf in theſe diſputes, ſhake off theſe vipers, and conclude, That
God regardeth his own glory and honor, more then thou canſt do; he hath taken
that way wherein he will magnifie his own glorious Attributes. And truly this
ſhould preſently ſilence all thy diſputations. For wouldſt thou have God loſe
part of his glory? Wouldſt thou have his honour in any degree laid in the duſt,
that thy will and deſires may be accompliſhed? Farre be this from thee. Surely
the great and high thoughts we ought to have of Gods wiſdom, goodneſs and
holineſs ought to keep us from opening our mouths any more in this point, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:57719:293"/>
As I leave my ſelf, ſo my children in the hands of God, who diſpoſeth all
things according to his own will. And as we ſay of the nature of God, he is
that <hi>Bonum quo nihil melius cogitari poteſt;</hi> The ſame muſt we apply to all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
likewiſe.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore we are to remember, <hi>That whatſoever the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>hath
brought upon mankind, the ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>will totally and fully remove in all that are
his members:</hi> Inſomuch that at the laſt, there ſhall not remain (as it were) an
hoof of any of theſe calamities. That original corruption within thee ſhall no
longer tempt thee inceſſantly like <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs, ſaying, <hi>Come, and lie with
me;</hi> we ſhall then in the iſſue of all have more cauſe to rejoyce, becauſe of
Chriſt, and the benefits by him, then ever we were caſt down and dejected,
becauſe of the tranſgreſſion of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the unſpeakable evil that
came by him. So that if theſe particulars be duly conſidered, every believer
may with comfort and quietneſs ſit down under this truth, while men of phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
and ſelf-juſtifying ſpirits rage and revile at theſe things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> Grant that there is ſuch a thing as Original Sinne, and that
we have delivered nothing but Scripture truth in this point, yet may we not be too
tragical in exclamations about it? As there are thoſe who erre in the defect, ſo are
there not many that do offend in the exceſs, that make it more hainous
then it is? <hi>This is the laſt Queſtion, wherewith I ſhall conclude this Subject. And</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, All the <hi>Popiſh, Arminian, Socinian party with their adherents,</hi> look
upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as exceſſive in this point; hence are there ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of them about this matter in all their works. But certainly, if we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the ſcope of the Scripture, it is wholly to debaſe man, and exalt Chriſt;
To diſcover our incurable and ſinfull eſtate, that thereby Chriſt may be the
more magnified, which is done by nothing ſo much, as to make known that
horrid pollution, which is upon all by nature. And certainly that one Text,
<hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. 5. affirming, <hi>The thoughts of the imagination of a mans heart to be only
evil, and that continually,</hi> ſpeaketh more emphatically the deplored and ſinfull
eſtate of man, then ever any <hi>Calviniſt</hi> hath yet expreſt. Yet though this be ſo,
we grant, that ſome may go too farre in their opinions, and expreſſions about
original ſinne, though for the moſt part ſuch is a mans ſelf-fulneſs and ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,

We muſt know therefore that one <hi>Illyricus</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Strigelius</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> alſo, but a <hi>Synergiſt,</hi> holding the will of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
actively with the grace of God to a mans converſion, and thereby exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
original ſinne. This <hi>Illyricus</hi> (I ſay) out of a vehement oppoſition
to that party, and the School-Doctrine about original ſinne, making it to be
an accident in a man, did fall into another extream, ſaying, <q>That original
ſinne was a ſubſtantial evil in a man, and that the very ſubſtantial form of a
man was now made ſinfull.</q> This <hi>Illyricus</hi> was a man of a very turbulent and
unquiet ſpirit, a deſperate enemy to <hi>Melancthon,</hi> whoſe heart it is ſaid he broke.
(<hi>Melch. Adam in vita Illyrici.</hi>) At firſt he was well reputed of by the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
and being ſadly tempted in his ſpirit about ſinne, and the wrath of God,
but afterwards delivered from it; it was judged ſo great a mercy, that thanks
was given to God in the publick Congregation for his behalf; but afterwards
among other erroneous aſſertions, he maintained, <q>That original ſinne was a
ſubſtantial evil in a man.</q> We may read his whole opinion with the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himſelf and his Arguments, in his Tractate on purpoſe concerning this
point (<hi>Clavis Script.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                           <hi>parte Tractat. 6. de originali peccato.</hi>) wherein he hath
many abſurd and monſtrous expreſſions. Although it muſt be acknowledged,
that with that dung and filth he hath, there is alſo ſome gold. Some there are
that wholly excuſe him, ſaying, <q>That his words only were improper, but that
his ſenſe was orthodox; and that out of hatred to that Doctrine, which extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:57719:294"/>
original ſinne; he would, pretending the Scripture for his Rule, uſe
<hi>ſubſtantive expreſſions,</hi>
                           </q> to declare the nature of it. But whatſoever his end
may be, certainly his ſenſe and opinion, as declared in his words, is juſtly to be
condemned and exploded. For by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall he maketh a <hi>ſubſtantial change</hi>
to be made upon a man; That the Image of God is turned into the image of
the Devil, not accidentally, but ſubſtantially; as when wine is made vinegar, or
when the parts of a ſtatue, or houſe that were built in ſome comely harmony,
repreſenting ſome glorious thing, they ſhould be pulled down, and built into
another deformed ſhape. As ſuppoſe the Image of ſome comely perſon ſhould
be pulled in pieces, and made the image of an horrible Dragon or Serpent. He
diſtinguiſheth of the <hi>material ſubſtance</hi> of a man, and his formal; He grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
That the <hi>matrial ſubſtance</hi> of a man, ſtill remaineth our body, and
parts thereof, but the <hi>formal ſubſtance</hi> is altered. As when a veſſel that was
once made a veſſel of honour, is afterwards made a veſſel of diſhonour; the
<hi>material ſubſtance</hi> is the ſame, but not the <hi>formal.</hi> He doth no wayes endure,
that we ſhould call original ſinne an <hi>accident;</hi> for he ſaith, This ſinne is a <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent,</hi>
and is in all predicaments; it's ſometimes a <hi>quality,</hi> ſometimes an
<hi>action,</hi> &amp;c. ſometimes a <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> Neither will he diſtinguiſh between the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi>
of a man, and his ſin <hi>adhering</hi> thereto, between the <hi>ſubject</hi> and the <hi>privation</hi>
in it, between the <hi>abſtract</hi> and <hi>concrete: God</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is angry with concretes,
puniſheth concretes, not abſtracts;</hi> and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſubſtance of a man and his ſinne, do as the Alchimiſts ſeparating from the
oyl, oleity; from a ſtone, lapideity; ſo theſe from Adam, Adameity.</hi> Thus he,
and much more. But certainly herein he betrayeth horrible ignorance in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
and Theology; for both theſe will neceſſitate us to diſtinguiſh between
the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of a man, and the <hi>ſinfull privation</hi> in him; otherwiſe Chriſt could
not have taken the ſame nature with us upon him, ſinne only excepted; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
would be a <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> change, not a <hi>qualitative:</hi> Neither by this
opinion could the ſame <hi>ſubſtantial bodies</hi> be ſaid to be glorified in Heaven. So
that as the Leproſie in the body, is not the body; neither is original ſinne in
man, the nature of man; and therefore when we read, that the fleſh and ſpirit
are oppoſite, that oppoſition muſt be underſtood <hi>in praedicamento qualitatis,</hi> not
<hi>ſubſtantiae.</hi> The greateſt ſupport that this man hath for this errour, is, becauſe
the Scripture uſeth <hi>ſubſtantive</hi> expreſſions, it is called <hi>an evil heart, a ſtony
heart,</hi> &amp;c. But this is becauſe of the corruption adhering to it: As we ſay, a
rotten tree, or a poiſoned fountain; The heart as it is a fleſhly ſubſtance is not
evil, but as it is the principle of our motions and actions, not in a <hi>phyſical,</hi> but
<hi>moral</hi> ſenſe. It is true, we ſay, That through original ſinne man cometh ſhort
of his end: And ſo as the hand when its dead cannot do the works of an band;
or ſalt, when it hath loſt its ſeaſoning is good for nothing: Thus it is with man
in regard of any ſupernatural actions, yet he hath not loſt any thing that was
ſubſtantial and eſſential; Only the power of the ſoul want the primitive recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
they once had; and therefore whenſoever they act, it is with deordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Indeed we will grant, That <hi>Illyricus</hi> his adverſary <hi>Victorinus Strigelius,</hi>
did not fully expreſs original corruption, in the Diſputation between them; who
compared a man to a Loadſtone, of which (they ſay) when rubbed with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
it will not draw iron; but if that be wip'd off by Goats bloud, it will be as
attractive as before. For this ſimilitude is not full enough: becauſe original ſin
doth not only hinder the doing of good actions, but infecteth the very powers
and principles of them. It is true, there are thoſe, (as <hi>Contzen</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.) that
ſay, becauſe the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> hold, That concupiſcence is ſinne, they cannot
avoid <hi>Flaccianiſm</hi> but that is a meer calumny. We alwayes diſtinguiſh between
the nature and ſubſtance of a man; and the ataxy and diſorder that doth now
accompany it. Neither when we call it an accident do we thereby extenuate the
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:57719:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nature of original ſinne; for we do not make it a light ſuperficial one, but which
is inbred with us, and doth diffuſe it ſelf over all the parts and powers of the ſoul.
Neither do we ſay, it is a tranſient, temporary accident, but that which is fixed
and permanent in us. Thus we ſee in what ſenſe, there may be exceſſive expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
about original ſinne; otherwiſe we cannot ſay enough to affect our hearts
with the loathſomneſs of it, provided we keep cloſe to the Scripture directions
herein.</p>
                        <p>Thus at laſt by the good hand of God we are come out of theſe deeps into
the haven; we have waded through all the ſeveral parts of this vaſt Subject,
and are now come to the ſhore. It remaineth as a duty upon every one, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
out of this captivity and bondage, not to ſtay a day or hour in this damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eſtate, and above all things to take heed of ſuch opinions, that do either
leſſen or nullifie this ſinne; for this is to erre in the foundation; Chriſt and
grace, and regeneration can never be built thereupon. This Doctrine hath ſtood

ought to have more mortified and ſanctified hearts; for when we have
watched over our ſouls with the greateſt diligence we can, yet we have
cauſe to pray, that God would forgive us our Book-ſins, and preſerve
us from looſing the comfortable ſenſe and enjoyment of Juſtification,
while we diſpute about it. Not therefore from a ſpirit of contention
or oppoſition to my learned Brother, whom I highly honour, but love to
that precious and antient Truth, as I judge it to be, which through infirmity
is oppoſed by him, happily inclined thereunto by his laudable Zeal againſt

                     <hi>The Meanes or Manner how we are juſtified.</hi>
Indeed, Juſtification being the heart (as it were) of Religion, a little
prick therein is dangerous. It being the eye of Chriſtianity, a little
diſeaſe is dangerous. It is eaſie erring, but dangerous in this point.
Hence this Article did ſo reign in the hearts of thoſe Worthies, that
they uſed all diligence to keep this Fountain pure, greatly fearing the
poſterity to come, would be negligent herein. Now as for the
meanes how we are juſtified; they did not only learn it out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which peculiarly appropriate this to Faith, and not to any other
particular grace; but experimentally and practically out of their own
hearts; God ſuffering them to be greatly exerciſed, and tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his favour, and to be often in the deepes, not ſeeing the Sun for
many daies, that ſo Juſtification by Faith alone, might be the more
confirmed unto them, and they have the witneſs of this Doctrine in
themſelves. And although it be true, that the Proteſtant Writers in
this Controverſie, did chiefly militate againſt the merit and cauſality
of Works in Juſtification then aſſerted by the Papiſts: Yet it is plain,
that thereby alſo they did exclude their Conditionality alſo, as to the
Act of Juſtification.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cathol. Refor.</hi> Controv. 4. Cap. 1.</note> Hence <hi>Perkins (quantus vir?</hi>) ſaith, <hi>Fides eſt
unicum &amp; ſolum illud inſtrumentum,</hi> &amp;c. Faith is the alone and only
inſtrument, wrought by the Spirit of God in the heart of a man,
whereby he layeth hold on Chriſt, applying his righteouſneſs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which neither Hope or Charity, or any other grace can do.
And whereas he had granted, in the enſuing Diſcourſe, that theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were preſent at Jnſtification, but doing nothing to it, but Faith
doth all: As the head is preſent to the eye when it ſeeth, yet it is
the eye alone that ſeeth. <hi>Biſhop</hi> his Adverſary by ſcorn, calleth this
a worthy piece of Philoſophy, and laboureth to invalidate it; but the
learned <hi>Abbot</hi> his Defendant, is large in clearing of this Truth, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
of a ſeparation, Reall and Mental; and that again into Negative
<pb facs="tcp:57719:302"/>
and Privative, declaring that Faith, though not negatively conſidered,
excluding other graces, yet privatively abſtracted from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, is ſaid to juſtifie; I would referre the Reader to thoſe
ſolid and excellent Writers in this point. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Reaſon for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by Faith alone, is very pregnant, from <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. where <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in Chriſt for eternal life,</hi> is compared to <hi>beholding of the
Serpent that Moſes lifted up in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Now as it was <hi>meer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>no working</hi> that did heal the wounded <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> ſo it is meer
believing, and no other grace that maketh us partakers of this Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Priviledge.<note place="margin">Exam. Concil. Trid. de fide Juſtific.</note> 
                     <hi>Chemnitius</hi> alſo giving Reaſons why the Proteſtants uſe
the word <hi>ſolâ,</hi> of Faith in Juſtification, maketh one to be, that merits
and dignity may be excluded from our works, and all attributed to
grace only. But another <hi>ut oſtendatur medium ſeu organon applicationis,</hi>
for not by Works, but Faith alone, is the Promiſe received. It is
clear then, that our former Divines, though they principally aimed at
the excluding of the merit of Works, yet did alſo thereby ſhut out
their conditionality; becauſe they make Faith the only <hi>applicativum
medium,</hi> and becauſe they deny other graces to have any ſuch recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power. For when the Papiſts urge other graces, as Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
they anſwer, that theſe do conſiſt in <hi>extramittendo,</hi> Faith in <hi>intus
recipiendo.</hi> And laſtly, becauſe they make them only qualifications of
the ſubjects, and the effects, or diſcoveries of true Faith; Inſomuch,
that we never read in Scripture, or (as I know of) in any ſound Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
that we are juſtified by repentance, or by love.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this Juſtification by Faith alone,<note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note> excluding the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
of Works, to be applyed to our Juſtification at firſt only, <hi>but as
continued; ſo that from firſt to laſt, we are juſtified all along by Faith.</hi>
Although therefore, the learned Brother doth often fly to this Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
(and if this fall to the ground, all his ſuperſtructure tumbleth with
it) yet it is clear by Scripture, Juſtification begun and continued, is
by Faith alone. Hence the Apoſtle, arguing in this very matter, brings
that text: <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 11. which belongs to the
whole courſe of our life, reſpectively to Juſtification; and when the
Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 5. Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God.</hi>
Would it not be irrationall, to limit it only to our Juſtification at firſt?
Is not <hi>the righteouſneſs of God revealed from Faith to Faith?</hi> Rom. 1. 17.
Not from Faith to Works:<note place="margin">Sex. ſeſſiois. Antidot.</note> See <hi>Calvin</hi> proving <hi>non minus Juſtitiae
complementum, quam initium fidei tribuendum eſſe.</hi> So that our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is by Faith to Faith, not by Faith to Works.</p>
                  <p>If my judgment were for Juſtification by Works,<note place="margin">Prop. 3.</note> as a condition
thereof, as well as Faith, I ſhould think it my duty, both in Preaching
and Printing, as occaſion ſerveth, to perſwade the forbearing of the
word <hi>Sola,</hi> when we ſay Faith Juſtifieth: For if God hath appointed
Works, as well as Faith, how dare any man preſume to ſay Faith <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
And thus we muſt receive the moderating advice of <hi>Caſſander,</hi>
who ſaith; <hi>Multis eruditis, &amp; piis viris ſatius videtur &amp; in conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus
<pb facs="tcp:57719:303"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I can grant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prop. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that we are juſtified by Faith, as it is an inſtrument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, and as it is a condition; provided the conditionality of it
be limited to the receptive Office of Faith, and Gods deſignment thereunto:</hi>
But it cannot be an inſtrument applying, and a condition in the ſenſe,
my Reverend Brother contends for. When we ſay, Faith Juſtifieth
as an <hi>applying</hi> meanes, then Chriſt and his Grace, is conſidered as <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
oblatum;</hi> Faith being the hand that receiveth this Treaſure. But
when it Juſtifieth as a <hi>condition,</hi> in the ſenſe aſſerted, it muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>ut opus praestitum;</hi> whereby the Covenant is made good to us, which
maketh two diſtinct kindes of Juſtification; which latter differeth from
the Popiſh way only, <hi>ut magis &amp; minus.</hi> They make Works merits
and Cauſes: he Conditions, whereas not only cauſality, but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality,
doth overthrow the <hi>alone</hi> Juſtification by Faith, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
another way of Juſtification, then by application <hi>alone.</hi> Or if the
learned Brother, will make Works a condition of Juſtification, when
Faith alone doth begin and continue it, he will be neceſſarily involved
in a contradiction. In what a ſenſe I make Faith a Paſſive Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(but ſupernatural) I have in my former Treatiſe clearly explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſo need not repeat it here again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is no Contradiction to exclude Works form a Conditionality,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prop. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>as to the
Act of Juſtification, and yet to affirm them requiſite neceſsarily in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
Justified.</hi> I wonder at the wilfulneſs in ſome, who accuſe them
as a contradiction, when Proteſtant Writers do a thouſand times over
illuſtrate this, by divers Similitudes. Becauſe Repentance is required
as well as Faith, muſt their office and work be confounded? Muſt all
they be Conditions? Certainly, it's not Repentance, but Faith, that
receiveth the pardon: Yet Repentance <hi>qualifieth the Subject,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth
it capable of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is Sanctification a Condition of Juſtification,
becauſe they are inſeparable one from another?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That diſtinction of Faith juſtifying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prop. 6.</note> quae viva, <hi>but not</hi> quâ viva, <hi>which
IS lively and working, but not AS lively and working; is not trifling
as the Remonstrants ſay, nor is there any cheat in it.</hi> Moſt of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Religion, are diſtinguiſhed from confining errours, by
ſuch diſtinctions. If a man ſay, <hi>Chriſtus qui Deus mortuus eſt,</hi> ſaith
true; but if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Quâ Deus,</hi> would he not ſpeak blaſphemy?
And this I bring in the rather, becauſe there are ſome who affect, and
glory in a moderating way, thinking the Papiſts and Proteſtants do not
ſo Fundamentally differ in the Point of Juſtification, but that they may
be reconciled; whereas our learned Worthies, at firſt declared, that if
the Romaniſts and we differed in no other point but this, this were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have no Communion with them. <hi>Spalatenſis,</hi> one of the

grant to the Reformed, that the diſpoſitions to Juſtification are not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
And again, the Reformed grant to the Romaniſts, that by theſe
diſpoſitions, being joyned with Faith, Juſtification is acquired not from
merit, but Divine mercy alone. It is true, he declareth his own noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how Faith Juſtifieth alone, <hi>viz. Abſque neceſsitate ullius alterius
humanae poſitivae actionis, non tamen abſque negativâ illa diſpoſitione
non faciendi quicquam quod ſit á Deo vetitum.</hi> But in the protract of his
Diſcourſe, he maketh our differences herein to be <hi>pura quaedam meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicalia

                     <hi>ſed Galaticamur planè fratres,</hi> as
<hi>Tertullian</hi> of old. There is a propenſity in all to Galatize, to joyn Faith
and Works under ſome notion or other, as to our Juſtification; whereas
the Apoſtle maketh an immediatie oppoſition between them; not in
the perſon Juſtified, but as to the manner of Juſtification. The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Brother alledgeth a place out of Doctor <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> in the title page,
with a ſignall accent upon it. The words are (<hi>Verum in diverſo genere

ad eandem refertur per modum meriti &amp; condignitatis; noſtra verò
fides ad eandem refertur per modum congruae diſpoſitionis.</hi>) Who would
not think by this paſſage, thus barely quoted, that the Doctor was
ſpeaking of Juſtification, that Chriſts ſatisfaction is meritorious of it,
and our Faith a congruous diſpoſition to it. But my Brothers over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
is very great in this allegation; for the learned <hi>Twiſſe</hi> is there
ſpeaking, of Gods Juſtice and Mercy, tempered together in <hi>Election;</hi>
taken <hi>terminativè,</hi> as it effectually comprehends Salvation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſaid before,<note place="margin">Vindic. Grat. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. pars ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. vol. Mai. <hi>pag.</hi> 218.</note>

that his words oppoſe Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pierce,</hi> with others
who odiouſly charge the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as if they held irreſpective De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
in Election and Reprobation, either to ſinne or holineſs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the excellent Doctor ſheweth, that Salvation, the <hi>terminus</hi> of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is not accompliſhed without the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and our
Faith and Repentance, as fit diſpoſitions to Salvation; he doth not ſay
to Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Doctrine of Juſtification hath been greatly polluted of old,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prop. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>by Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicall
and Ariſtoteticall Philoſophy: and we must take heed we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
it in a new way, by running to the Civil Law, and deductions from it.</hi>
What are <hi>Bartolus</hi> and <hi>Baldus</hi> in this point? As Juſtification is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
wholly revealed in Scripture, and ſupernaturally vouchſafed, ſo the
Words and Phraſes are obſerved by the Learned, to be peculiar;
as, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So that the Scripture expreſſions being
compared together, will beſt diſcover the manner how we are juſtified;
for it is wholly at Gods appointment, what way he will take therein,
and from them we ſhall only diſcover a righteouſneſs of Faith; not of
Love, or any other particular grace. It was the ruine of <hi>Socinus;</hi>
to conclude of the Truths of Divinity, according to principles of the
<pb facs="tcp:57719:304"/>
Civil Law, this made him deny Chriſts ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcourſe of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> concerning Juſtification by
Works,<note place="margin">Prop. 8.</note> doth not at all patrocinate the Reverend Brothers Opinion.
For firſt, It is to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle doth not mention any
particular grace, but <hi>Works</hi> in the generall, as externally and viſibly
practiſed. Had the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Abraham was juſtified not only by
Faith, but</hi> love, then there had been ſome colour for his Aſſertion. And
ſecondly, The expreſſions uſed by the Apoſtle concerning Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by <hi>Works,</hi> comply not with a <hi>conditio ſine quâ non:</hi> For ver. 26.
he ſaith, <hi>As the body without the ſpirit is dead, ſo is faith without Works.</hi>
Is the ſoul a <hi>conditio ſine quâ non</hi> of life? Again, ver. 22. <hi>By Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
Works, his Faith was made perfect;</hi> and his Works did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
with his Faith. Doth a condition <hi>ſine quâ non</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? I urge not this
as owning the Papiſts Expoſitions of Cauſality of Works and Merit,
only they make not for a <hi>conditio ſine quâ non.</hi> We muſt take Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Faith in another ſenſe, then the Papiſts do. When the
learned Brother, explicateth that paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>Faith is dead
being alone,</hi> after this manner: That Faith is dead, as to the uſe and
purpoſe of Juſtifying; for in it ſelf, it hath life according to its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtill.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> of Juſtification pag. 300.</note> Adding afterwards, that (Works make Faith alive, as to
the attainment of its end of Juſtification.) Can this be applyed to
a <hi>conditio ſine quâ non?</hi> But the Diſcourſe ſwelleth too big: I have
done what I thought ſufficient in this matter. The good Spirit of the
Lord ſo lead us into his Truth, that we may <hi>ſerve him with one heart,
and one way;</hi> and wherein we have not yet attained, reveal ſuch
Truths unto us.</p>
