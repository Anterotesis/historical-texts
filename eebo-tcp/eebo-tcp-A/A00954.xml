         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thought it worthy of more

any worth in it, it is in the
dignitie of the matter, and
the fitneſſe of it, for our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and times. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are the Grounds, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
and Reward of the
faithfull, Heauenly Light
Bodily labour, Spirituall
reſt. The firſt of which
brings with it light for our
Soules; the ſecond, Health
for our bodies, and the third
for them both eternall Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.
But in our times
there is three Vertues are
ſo great ſtrangers, in which
there are ſo many euill
heartes of vnbeliefe, all
ſtanding ready to depart
<pb facs="tcp:18185:4"/>
from the liuing God, that
wee had need to offer a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
violence to our nature,
and to fall out with our
times, that fall ſo faſt away
from God, or elſe it is to be
feared leaſt the tide and
ſtreame of them both carry
vs not into the riuers of
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> there to bee lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the mountaines
of our ſaluation, but into the
riuers of Brimſtone, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all are waſted that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from GOD: as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
telleth vs; <hi>Depart from
mee yee curſed into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo much the more
need had wee, that liue in
this laſt Age of the world,
to looke to the infirmitie of
our natures and diſeaſes of
the time: becauſe natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
are alwayes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb facs="tcp:18185:5"/>
Tyrants in our Age,
and it is no otherwiſe in
this old world, then in old
perſons: If we were borne
weake ſighted, it is a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but in age a great dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
if not a totall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
doe not befall vs. If a
lame hand by nature hath
diſabled the actions of our
youth; the hand which in
youth could doe little, will
doe nothing in our age; if
we haue traduced a perſonal
inclination from our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to any vice, it is a
grace if that inclination
grow not to an affection in
our youth, and in our age to
a habite. So faſt grow the
ill weedes of Nature when
Nature it ſelfe decayes in vs.</p>
            <p>Now wee cannot bee
ignorant that in the very
Spring of nature, theſe three
<pb facs="tcp:18185:5"/>
ſtrong infirmities were ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in vs. The firſt vpon
the effacing of Gods Image,
a dimme eye-ſight or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in our ſoule: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
a lame hand or idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the body, which
grew when Mortalitie firſt
broke in vpon vs, and left
our nature conſumed of that
firſt-borne ſtrength it then
flowriſhed with: bringing
in vpon our labour an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
ſweat, vpon our
ſweat, wearineſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
faynting, and
languiſhing the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with vnreſt, and diſeaſe:
The third vpon the loſſe of
our heauenly inheritance,
an inclination and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole man to
ſuch a happineſſe, as wee
cannot build for our ſelues,
out of the beautie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb facs="tcp:18185:6"/>
lights of this world: which
<hi>Salomon</hi> happily alluded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

cannot finde out the worke

<hi>Iſſachars</hi> bleſſing, which
indeed, is but a curſory and

            <p>Theſe then are the three
great diſeaſes of our ſoules,

               <p>OVr Sauiour when he

a hard taſke to make his

Rules, and vnerring

The falſe lights, which
had a fayre ſhine of truth
to varniſh them ouer
with; were theſe, and ſuch
like.</p>
               <p>That hee was a right
honeſt &amp; religious man,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18185:12"/>
that offered no man
wrong. That was kinde,
and louing to thoſe that
deſerued well of him.
That would neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare
himſelfe, eyther to
benefit his owne eſtate,
or to hurt another mans.
That if hee were affected
to a maried woman, kept
himſelfe from Adulterie
with her. If he were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo angry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet brideled
in his rage, that it broke
not out into murder.
That when his Parents
were in want, honoured
them with maintenance:
That made long Praiers;
gaue great Almes; faſted
often; payed the Tythes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18185:13"/>
duely; and ſo farre hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the very aſhes of the
Prophets; that hee built
their Tombs being dead,
to keepe aliue their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
and names. This
was the Phariſies Starre-light.
Al which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People who liued
in the ſhadow of thoſe
ceremonious times, and
night of their owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
held for great
&amp; beautifull lights, truths
moſt credible, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be beleeued and
followed of all: but when
the Sunne aroſe, this ſtar-light
ſoone diſ-appeared;
and our Sauiour makes
it plaine in this, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18185:13"/>
ſequent Chapters. That
al thoſe were but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
of truth, which an
hypocrite might diſguiſe
himſelfe, and face it with,
as well as an honeſt man;
nay that all of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc't
with thoſe times
and places, and done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that manner &amp; forme
they ought, were, for all
their faire lookes, but
<hi>ſhining faults.</hi> Or rather,
as nothing is more defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in the ſight of man,
than ſuch a defectiue
monſter in Nature, who
ſhould want halfe of his
parts, (imagine one abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely
caſt out, with one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18185:14"/>
legge, one eye, halfe a

of God, who lookes to
the inner man, this ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty,
which wants the
better halfe and in-ſide of
it ſelfe, cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
moſt prodigious
and miſ-ſhapen.</p>
               <p>For our Sauior counts
that no Chriſtian vertue,
Not to offer wrong: For
ſo they which returne
wrong for wrong, offer
no wrong, they doe but
<hi>vim vi repellere,</hi> ſtrike
blow for blow; but the
Vertue was, to ſuffer
wrong with patience, &amp;
not only to abſtain from
offering wrong with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18185:14"/>
So to loue thoſe
that are deſertfull, hath
no vertue in it: for not to
doe ſo, were to do them
iniury; but to loue the
ill-deſeruing, to loue our
enemies, to loue our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,
this indeed is
the grace of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>And what if our eſtates
allow our poore Parents
the honour of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?
If our harts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of obedience, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
imitation, of filiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
doe we think we
haue performed a ſonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
part to them, or the
duty of a Childe?</p>
               <p>Againe it is no Vertue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18185:15"/>
to keep a mans ſelfe from
periury; for he that neuer
forſweares himſelfe, may
yet bee a common ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
but to ſet a Watch
before his lips, that they
ſhould neuer vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſweare at all, that was
the Vertue.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what was it to
keepe himſelfe from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
and Murder, if he
had adultery in his eyes,
luſt in his hart, if he were
enraged with anger, and
had dipt and ſtained his
thoughts in bloud? God

thou luſteſt after a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18185:15"/>
thou art before God
guiltie both of adultery,

haue they, if the almes
muſt bee trumpeted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and the faſt muſt
ſet a ſowre face vpon the
matter, and the tithes
muſt bee boaſted of, and
layed as it were in Gods
diſh, when he comes to
pray before him in the
Temple, as though God
who giues him all, were
beholding to him, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
him the tenth
part of his owne? To
conclude long prayers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18185:16"/>
and building the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
of the prophets,
which of all other were
their moſt colourable
virtues, were they not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
crying ſinnes in the
ſight of God, when they
were (I ſay not onely vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
arrogantly in euery
corner of the ſtreet, that
they might bee ſeene of
men, and not cloſeted vp,
for GOD alone to ſee
them) but when vnder
pretence of long prayers,
they deuour'd widowes
houſes, and vnder colour
of building the tombes
of the Prophets which
were dead, they had no
other intent but with the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18185:16"/>
more ſafety, and leſſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
to ſlay the ſonne
of God, who was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
among them, the
Prince of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Looke then as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

ſo was it with theſe

the Phariſees obtruded,
and thruſt vpon the darke
vnderſtandings of the
common people, for moſt
heauenly lights &amp; lamps
full of glory: they were
all but vizards of truth,
rotten opinions, lies with
painted faces.</p>
               <p>And as theſe were the
falſe-lights that dazeled
the eyes of the wiſer ſort
of people, ſo there were,
beſide theſe, certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
errors, which went
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18185:17"/>
abroad as moſt receiued,
and graunted poſitions
&amp; verities, which all men
beleeu'd, as: That they
had good cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
who had euery
mans good word for
them, and many friends
in the world, whom they
might truſt to; That rich
men were happy, For
they liued at hearts eaſe.
That they liued the moſt
comfortable liues in the
world, that were alwayes
merry hearted, and were
euer laughing. To name
no more. That it was a
moſt wretched eſtate not
to haue ſufficient meate
and drinke, but to liue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18185:18"/>
as in a famine, in
hunger and thirſt.</p>
               <p>But our Sauiour, as
before hee extinguiſht
their falſe, and phariſaical
lights, ſo in theſe, hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
himſelfe againſt
their popular, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
errors. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſayes not (as they)
Reioyce becauſe ye haue
many and great friends in
the world, and becauſe
you haue euery mans
good word for you but
the playne contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
and bee exceeding
glad (what? when you
haue many friends that
ſpeake well of you, and do
you good, no but) when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18185:18"/>
you haue many enemies
that ſhall reuile you, and
perſecute you, and ſay all
manner of euill againſt
you falſely for my names
ſake, verſes the 10. 11.
And bleſſed are, who? the
rich in eſtate? no but the
poore in ſpirit, ver. the 3.
And not they who were
merry hearted, &amp; alwaies
laughing had the moſt
comfortable liues: but
bleſſed are they that
mourne verſe the 4. For
they ſhalbe comforted.
In a word to land my ſelf
at home vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

which abounded with all
things, and could ſay to

thou haſt much goods layed
vp for many yeares,</hi> were
bleſſed: but bleſſed are
they that hunger, and
thirſt after righteouſnes:
<hi>For they ſhall bee ſatiſfied.</hi>
For the truth is. It was
a moſt abſurd, &amp; impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſoloeciſme of ſpeech,
when the riche foole (ſo
our Sauiour cals him and
therefore I doe him no
wrong) bid his ſoule eate,
and drinke thoſe goods,
that hee had layed vp for
his body to eat, &amp; drinke.
For the ſoule with ſuch
food could neuer haue
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18185:19"/>
beene ſatisfied, but thoſe
ſoules onely ſhalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed
and filled, that
hunger after the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heauen, and the

For as righteouſnes here,

Much leſſe could chance:

then being either graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or extorted from a
naturall man, what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
hence? Truely this.
That the ſoule of man
doth conſiſt by the word
of God. Secondly, That
the ſoule of man, beeing
onely able of all creatures
viſibly in heauen, or earth
to conceiue, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a diuine beeing,
which our experience
teaches vs, muſt needs
be a ſpirituall ſubſtance
like God himſelfe, and
created after his image.
For this in reaſon and
nature is a ſelfe-credible
truth. <hi>That no Creator
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18185:25"/>
can rayſe the power of his
action beyond the ſphaere of
his owne actiuity.</hi> A ſtone
cannot liue. A plant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee. A beaſt cannot
vnderſtand a diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becauſe it hath no
ſuch receptiuity, no ſuch
actiue, and diuine power
in it, as to take into it an
inſenſible obiect. For
then it ſhould work <hi>extra
ſphaera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> beyond the pitch
of a ſenſible being: man
therfore onely who hath
ſuch an eye of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in him, whereby he
is able to liue (as it is ſayd
of <hi>Moſes</hi> Heb. 11. 27.) as
ſeeing him, who is inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
muſt needs be faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18185:26"/>
and form'd in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of the inuiſible
God. For, what creature
worſhips a diuine power,
ſanctifies holy dayes, and
Sabaoths, obſerues ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
feaſts, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
offers ſacrifices of
prayer, &amp; praiſe to God,
but man onely? Vpon
whoſe ſoule doth the law
of God naturally reflect
it ſelfe in the knowledge
of that which is good,
and the conſcience of
that which is euill, but
onely vpon man's? What
nature in earth obſerues
the different motions of
the heauenly bodies, and
admires the methodicall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18185:26"/>
Wiſedome of God in
them, or thinkes vpon his

he ſees the token of it ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

(ſweetly abuſing the ſame
waters to bee a token of
his mercy, which before

of time, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds

Truth, that our

nouriſhed and preſerued
by the power of our

Gods Eſſentiall Word,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18185:28"/>

               <p>And heere by the way
(but I ſpeake of it onely

as the high dignity ſo the

the reaſonable ſoule of
man, and the liuing ſouls
of bruit beaſts. For doe
but looke into the booke
of the generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and you ſhall ſee
there Mans ſoule was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
breathed into
his body by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and was created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Diuine image: but
the Liuing Soules of
bruit beaſts were educ't
out of their elementarie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18185:29"/>
wombes, &amp; thoſe bodies
which were moſt like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
For ſo ſayes our

which is the reaſon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſouls of beaſts fal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the ſame matter
out of which they were
firſt taken, and of whoſe

God that gaue it, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

ſimilitude and kinde, &amp;
ſo breath'd into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
which is indeede the
true &amp; prime cauſe of the
immortality of our ſouls.
So that they, being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
immediately by the
Word &amp; breath of God,
out of nothing, and not
ariſing from any praeex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent
matter, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be corrupted into any

               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18185:30"/>
I haue now prou'd that
our ſoules all conſiſting
by the word of the Father
which is Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imag'd moſt like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, they muſt needs
(as euery thing elſe is by
their like) be preſerued,
and nouriſht by Chriſt,
whoſe image they are,
and who may therefore
with greater truth, and
reaſon be called, the food
of our ſoules, then our
earthy diet can bee the
food of our bodies: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee is euery way,
both in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and vs, more preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue,
then to bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bodily ſuſtenance can
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18185:30"/>
be. For, that makes vs
continue by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
it ſelfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
vs too, if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in exceſſe, &amp; though
it be neuer ſo often vſed,
yet ſoone after we ſhall
hunger againe, and thirſt
againe: neither can it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
our nature in the
headlong ruines of age,
ſo faſt but that we muſt
euery day forfeite a little
ſpoile to mortality which
it can no way poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer,
and in concluſion,
vnable to hold out any
longer, it muſt yeeld vp
the whole body as a pray
to death. But we cannot
drinke too much of our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18185:31"/>
ſpirituall rocke, nor eate
too much of our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Manna, which after we
haue feaſted our hearts
with, we ſhall find noe
more hunger, or thirſt;
feele noe more iniuries
of age, or time; feare noe
more ſpoiles of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or death. Neither is
the ſoule nouriſhed by
this diuine food, as the
body is, by waſting that
whereby it ſelfe is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and conſuming that
to maintaine it ſelfe,
whereby it ſelfe is kept

whoſe beames can neuer
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18185:31"/>
be exhauſt, ſo our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

the participation of the

<gap reason="foreign">

to all, and not impayred
by any of thoſe repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18185:32"/>
ſoules, that banquet
vpon it.</p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>quaere</hi> be
made how our ſoules are
thus by Chriſt preſerued
from their owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and beyond their
owne natural life, to a life
Celeſtiall &amp; diuine, there
can be no other anſwere
giuen, but by beeing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into the life of
righteouſnes which fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
is in him. As if the
branches of a wild oliue
being cut off from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſtocke where it grew
naturally, ſhould be kept
from withering and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
by ingraſſing it
into the ſtocke of a ſweet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18185:32"/>
and flouriſhing Oliue-tree.
So our ſoules bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
created in naturall
righteouſneſſe and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
by God, and being
ſoone after by our fall
cut off from that life, and
ſo remayning in the ſtate
of corruption and decay,
would ſoone wither and
dye totally, were they not
eftſoons reymbark't and
ſtock't againe into the
Tree of life, from whence
they ſucke a more diuine
life of righteouſnes, then
that they were created, or
now liue in. For the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
righteouſnes thogh
it were in the kind of it
perfect, yet it was of a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18185:33"/>
ſhort continuance, (as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
left to it ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
is) and our habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
righteouſneſſe, though
it continue for euer, yet
it is very imperfect, like
the twilight of an eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or the firſt breake of

of earth, and the light of

therfore the ſoule of man
vnable to liue perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by any of theſe liues
which were defectiue,
could haue no way bene
preſeru'd from his owne
corruption, but by the
participation of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Righteouſneſſe of
Chriſt, which is infinitely
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18185:33"/>

of all the naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of Soule, Body and
Perſon, according to the
vttermoſt receptiuity of
them all, which their
owne proper and moſt
agreeable obiects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
euery deſire reſts it ſelf
wholly acquited, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
For inſtance nothing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18185:36"/>
can arreſt the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of man, but that
which is abſolutely true,
or rather Truth it ſelfe.
For that is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and agreeable obiect
to our vnderſtanding: and
who is that but Chriſt
our Lord? <hi>I am the Truth</hi>
ſaies our Sauiour: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can ſatisfie the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
will of man, but
onely that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
good, or rather
goodneſſe it ſelfe: and
who is that but onely
God? For as our Sauior
ſpeakes, there is none
good but God; nothing
can fill the reſtleſſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of man, but onely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18185:37"/>
thoſe fountaines of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that haue in them
neither defect nor end,
ſuch as can be found no
where heere. And where
are they, but at the right
hand of God only? <hi>Pſalm.
16. 11. In thy preſence is
fulneſſe of ioy, and at thy
right hand are pleaſures
for euermore:</hi> the firſt takes
away all defect. <hi>In thy
preſence is fulneſſe of ioy:</hi>
and the ſecond admits of
no end: <hi>at thy right hand
are pleaſures for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the firſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or ſaturity of the
ſoule: the ſecond is of the
body. And the naturall
deſires of the body are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18185:37"/>
life, health, and beautie.
Now where can we finde
life, but in that Country
which is the land of the
liuing, whether no death
is ſuffered to approach;
or whether ſhould we go
to meet with indeflowri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
and vnattainted
health, but where there is
no ſorrow, no paine, no
ſickneſſe at all? And that
is no where, but onely in
the Holy City, which S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> calls the new Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
<hi>Reuel. 21. 4. There
ſhall be no more death ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſorrow, nor crying, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall there be any more
paine,</hi> but as the two glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Old and New
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18185:38"/>
Teſtaments, <hi>Dauid</hi> and
S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake, <hi>God ſhall
deck his Saints with health
and wee ſhall put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and immortality</hi> in
thoſe Courts of Honour.</p>
               <p>And thus as the ſoule
and body haue their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
deſires: ſo the whole
perſon of man deſires na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
as cloſe an vnion
with the Diuine being, as
it is poſſibly capable of:
ſecondly it deſires glorie
and honour, being one of
the beames of GODS
countenance, which hee
caſts vpon his moſt noble
creatures. For there is a
ſparke of Diuinity in
Glory, which makes all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18185:38"/>
men, I had almoſt ſaid all
creatures naturally appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it, according to
the ſize they haue meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them out by God, to
veſſell it vp in. <hi>Cupido
gloriae nouiſſimè exuitur
etiam a ſapiente,</hi> ſayes the
wiſe Hiſtorian, many to
giue life to their Honor,
hauing loſt their owne.
And this holy Ambition,
as it deriues it ſelfe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world, ſo it is in
man both a naturall and
lawfull deſire, within the
expectation of which, the
whole creature ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the neck of it, (as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ſignificantly
ſpeakes, waites for, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18185:39"/>
ſighes for, and (like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
is in a dolorous tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
for to be deliuered,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
into the free libertie
of glory, granted to the
ſonnes of God. The laſt
hunger both of ſoule and
body as they are vnited,
is of diuine ſocietie and
friendſhip, and therefore
as the Philoſopher calls
man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a ſociable
Creature, ſo the Apoſtle
would haue vs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to aſſociate our
ſelues (at leaſt in our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling
thoughts) with
the Citizens of Heauen,
who as for number they
are infinitely more, ſo for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18185:39"/>
nature are farre more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
and bleſſed, then
our vnder companions
that liue here below, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with our ſelfs in this
little point of earth are.
For God himſelfe being
a Diuine Spirit, and thoſe
Palaces of glory being
farre more extenſiue and
ſpacious, then our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
regions, how can
there but be, as <hi>Dauid</hi> and
<hi>Daniel</hi> both witneſſe, ten
thouſand times ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
and thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
to wait vpon their
high and tranſcendent
Soueraigne, the King of
Spirits Royal: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18185:40"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckoning vp
our heauenly compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Hebr. 12. 22.</hi> begins
with an innumerable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Angels, ſo that
this deſire ſhall aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
be ſatiated and
content.</p>
               <p>But of heauen we that
are on earth cannot ſay
much. For though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
took our Sauiour vp
into a high mountaine,
and thence ſhewed him
all the Kingdomes of the
earth, and the glory of
them in a moment of
time, <hi>Luk. 4. 5.</hi> which
ſhewes of how ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they are, that in one
ſhort inſtant and article
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18185:40"/>
of time could ſodainelie
giue a blaze, and ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh:
yet there is no
mountaine high enough,
nor any time long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but eternity to
vnuaile the glory of the
Kingdome of Heauen,
which God purpoſely (no
doubt) hath concealed,
that he might know who
would loue him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
becauſe all men
could not but loue him
for his glory, if he ſhould
let it fall vpon our eyes,
and diſplay it ſelfe in the
diuine beames of it. Yet
as farre as the eye of right
reaſon, guided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (like the
wiſe men in the ſearch of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18185:41"/>
our Sauiour) by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
ſtarres of light that
ſhine euery where in
Gods word, may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this holy land, let vs
not wrong our ſacred
hunger of knowledge, as
blindely to wrap vp all in
a cloud, and to denye it
this iuſt ſatisfaction:
which eſpecially conſiſts
in a threefold glorious v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
wherewith God
hath promiſed in his
Word to vnite the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Elect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
which cloſe with the
Diuine Being I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before to be the moſt
ardent and naturall deſire
of our whole perſon, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18185:41"/>
that wherwith the whole
man is moſt delighted, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and filled.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore wee are
vnited vnto Chriſt as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Head, and ſo wee
make but one body with
him; and this is a cloſer
vnion then eyther chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
can be vnited to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
for they are diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
parts from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but wee are vnited
parts to Chriſt our Lord;
or married couples can
be vnited each to other.
For they being diuerſe
bodies, are vnited but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one fleſh, but wee to
Chriſt are vnited into
one body, and one fleſh,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18185:42"/>
as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, we
are all ſet into his body,
and are fleſh of his fleſh,
and bone of his bone,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as hee
with a moſt ſignificant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy
ſpeakes in the 4.
and 6. to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
And this is the firſt vnion
of our perſons with God
by his Son Ieſus Chriſt,
which makes vs way and
entrance to the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vnion is
whereby our perſons are
ſpiritually vnited to God
by the very Diuine and
Holy Spirit of God him
ſelfe: ſo that this infinite,
and glorious, and euer-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18185:42"/>
Spirit diffuſing it
ſelfe through euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Chriſts myſticall
body, makes vs of one
ſpirit, and one ſoule, as it
were, with the Diuine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
not by the vnion of
eſſence and information,
but of inhabitance and
participation.</p>
               <p>The laſt vnion is that
whereby the Diuinity of
God dwelling in vs after
an vnſpeakeable gracious
manner, vnites himſelfe
whole, although not
wholly to vs, far beyond
the poſſibility of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creature in the
World. For other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
haue no power of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18185:43"/>
vniting themſelues ſo as
God hath. The reaſon is,
cauſe they are of ſo groſſe
and if not corporeall, yet
materiall being, that it is
impoſſible for them to
make vs partakers of
their Eſſences, which
haue all of them certaine
Characteriſticall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall
differences,
whereby they are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to any other beſide
themſelues. But wee are
made (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells vs)
partakers of the Diuine
Nature after an eminent
manner; which though
it cannot be plenarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
yet it may bee ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18185:43"/>
by ſome weak re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances.</p>
               <p>The Rule whereby we
may conceiue of this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, that <hi>Euery thing the
more ſubtill and pure, and
immateriall it is, the more
cloſelie it may vnite it ſelfe
to another Creature.</hi> So
the water will ſoake tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
another body, and
vnite it ſelfe into euerie
part of it by inſinuating
his ſupple ioynts into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
empty place and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture
of the body, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which it is infus'd,
that it will ſeeme to make
but one body with it: as
in a veſſell full of aſhes;
which earth, being a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18185:44"/>
groſſer body cannot doe.
Againe, the Fire being a
more ſubtill and refined
body then the water will
vnite it ſelfe to the moſt
churliſh and impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
body, after a very
cloſe and peruious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
as to a ſtone, yron,
ſteele, or golde, which the
water, being a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed,
and leſſe fine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
can neuer pierce or
ſoake into. Againe, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ſubſtance will yet
more cloſely vnite it ſelfe
to a body, then this fineſt
and moſt ſubtill of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
beings: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee may remember
that Satan tells our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18185:44"/>
that a Legion of
them, that is ſix thouſand
eight hundred and thirty
(for the <hi>Romane</hi> Legion
conſiſted of 6100. foote,
and 730. horſe, though
heere I thinke not this
preciſe number but a
great multitude is meant)
did all couche and lodge
together in one poore
poſſeſſed man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as wee ſee if a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
candles were ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp in a roome, all the
beames of them would
be in the ſame place vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, at leaſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
though not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
(which thoſe that
are ſkilfull in the Opticks
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18185:45"/>
demonſtrate by the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
irradiations of Light
wherewith each of them
vnconfuſedly paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
one another) ſo it
is with ſpirits, a thouſand
of them may be locally v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
together without
any conſequent abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
becauſe their follows
no penetration of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and therfore filling
no place at all, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exclude one another
from the ſame place they
are in, as bodies doe.</p>
               <p>Againe, it muſt needes
bee confeſt, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Nature of our Lord
God may yet more nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloſe with his creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:18185:45"/>
in a ſtrayter vnion, then
any other, becauſe his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is not onely more
good, &amp; ſo more commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatiue
of it ſelfe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
and pure, then any
creatures (beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)
can be. This being
the prerogatiue royall of
Diuinity, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt not of
Act and Power, or to be
ſomething after, which
before it was not (as lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
liu'd, or wiſer, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or more glorious)
but to be <hi>Actus Purus,</hi> All
Act and Eſſence without
any reference of time, or
difference of qualitie.
That is, God is not as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18185:46"/>
Man or an Angell may
be; good, and true, and
wiſe, and liuing; but hee
is wiſedome it ſelfe, truth
it ſelfe, ſelfe-goodneſſe,
and ſelfe-life. Now wee
know in formall Vnions,
that is alwaies the cloſeſt
that is moſt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it ſelfe, and of
which the ſubiect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
it is vnited, is moſt
capable. And therefore
it muſt needs bee, that
God who is Truth, may
vnite himſelfe to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
then a thing that is
true: becauſe the proper
obiect of the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is Truth, not a true
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18185:46"/>
thing; and ſo to the will,
becauſe hee is goodneſſe
it ſelfe, and life it ſelfe,
&amp; the will is a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſubiect of life and
goodneſſe, then it is of a
thing that is good and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
               <p>This is a retruſe, and
hidden, but in truth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
diuine motion of the
gracious and formal vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby God pleaſes
to impart his Diuinity to
his Creature. For looke
as wee ſee in the eye of a
man the liuely Image &amp;
form of the thing it ſees,
(which makes me cal this
a formall vnion) ſhining
euidently in it, without
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18185:47"/>
which the eye could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſee the thing: ſo it is
in the jntellectuall part
of the ſoule. The thing
which is vnderſtood muſt
haue the jmage of it as
cleerely repreſented, and
vnited to the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the viſible object
is to the eye: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a Truth famous
in the Shooles, <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
eſt omnia. The vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is all things.</hi> Not
all things by the Eſſence
of it, but by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
it hath with it, in the
act of intellection.</p>
               <p>And this is the very
reaſon, why in ſpirituall
things, as long as wee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18185:47"/>
liue in our Bodies, our
vnderſtanding is ſo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh
and Infant-like; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in this blinde and
corporeall world, all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Eſſences are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to it <hi>forma tantum
diſparata,</hi> in ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that is, vnlike and
different forme &amp; ſhape,
to that which indeed and
in truth they are of (as if
a Painter ſhould expreſſe
the Sunne by a ſpot of
guilt, and ſhould draw
the Starres with a little
yellow Oakre, in his
draught of the heauenly
body) we cannot ſee their
owne faces, nor get the
true jmage of themſelues
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18185:48"/>
into the eye of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
It was Gods
ſpeech to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who had
better eyes then any that
euer liued after him. <hi>Thou
canſt not ſee my face, For
there ſhall no man ſee mee,
and liue, Exo. 33. 20. Iſay
64.</hi> And therefore as
when the Angells of the
Lord haue beene ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, they appeared
ſometimes like beautifull
young men, as to <hi>Lot</hi> and
the Sodomites; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like Chariots of
fire, as to <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ſeruant;
ſomtime with countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhooting like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>Mat. 28. 3.</hi> ſo when
God himſelfe pleaſed to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18185:48"/>
deſcend vpon Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
or vpon our Sauiour
his ſonne, his ſpirituall
Eſſence, could neuer be
ſeene, but himſelfe came
riding downe in the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of a Doue, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
came down ſo clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and guarded about
with fire, that neyther the
perſons, nor the eyes of
the Iſraelites could come
neere him. But when the
morning of glory ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
wherein our ſoules
ſhall awaken from the
heauy eye-lid of our fleſh,
and the veyle of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhall firſt be remoued,
and after being depur'd
from his droſſe, be refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18185:49"/>
into a bright and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
body, wee ſhall
then ſee <hi>God as he is, wee
ſhall ſee him face to face, we
ſhall know him, as wee are
knowne of him:</hi> Which
natheleſſe is not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
extenſiuely, as
if we ſhould comprehend
God in the whole extent
of his Diuinity, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
onely and truely:
as when wee ſee the Sea,
we ſee ſo much of it, as
can fall into our ſight
truely, and know it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
from al other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
to be the ſea: but
we cannot ſee all the Sea
at once, becauſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
is of too large a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18185:49"/>
breadth and extenſion.</p>
               <p>This whole diſcourſe
driues only to this iſſue.
There is a vnion of bloud
between Parents &amp; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and this is a remote
and very ſeparable vnion.
And there is an vnion of
one fleſh betweene Man
and Wife, and this vnion
is of a ſhort continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and is ſoone parted by
death. And there is an
vnion of Place, and thus
Spirits may be locally v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
who yet may be at
extreame oddes and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
one with another.
And there is an vnion of
affection, &amp; this Friends
are vnited with, and it is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18185:50"/>
(alas too ſoone) alterable
vpon the change of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And beſide all theſe
there is a myſticall, or
virtuall Vnion of the
members with the head,
and this the Church is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to Chriſt by, from
whom it receiues the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
influences of all
grace and fauour. And
there is a Spirituall Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereby all th' Elect
ſoules and bodies are not
onely inſpired, and I may
ſo ſpeake, Spirited with
the Holy Ghoſt, who
rules and ſwayes all the
thoughts and actions of
the ſoule, as the ſoule
doth all the parts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18185:50"/>
of the body. And
laſt of all, there is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and admirable Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſimilitude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee are made whollie
conformable, and alike to
the Diuine being, which
is the moſt deſireable &amp;
accumulate bleſſedneſſe
of our Nature.</p>
               <p>So that looke as you
ſee the very bright image
of the Sunne ſo reflected
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water ſomtimes,
that the dull Element
ſeemes to haue caught
downe the very glorious
body it ſelfe, to paint her

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18185:51"/>
who in the abſence of the
Sunne, is all fabled with

and ſad obſcurity; but
vpon the firſt beames of
the heauenly body, is gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with a moſt noble &amp;
illuſtrious brightneſſe; ſo
is it with our whole man.
For when God ſhall thus
imprint and ſtrike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into our darke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
O how beautifull
ſhall the feet of Gods
Saints bee? <hi>Eſay 52. 7.</hi>
What a Diadem of ſtars

How ſhall their amiable

Maieſty? <hi>Mat. 13. 4.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18185:51"/>
let it bee thought a
vaine audacity of ſpeech,
to ſay that the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and face of Gods
children ſhall break forth
into beames of more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall
glory, then the
mid-day ſunne euer yet
ſent abroad into the
World. For as S. <hi>Paule</hi>
tells vs, they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
to the Image of
his glorious body; ſo he
tels <hi>Agrippa, Acts 26. 13.
At mid-day. O King, I ſaw
in the way a light from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
aboue the brightnes of
the Sunne, ſhining round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
me:</hi> which was no
other then the Light of
the countenance of our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18185:52"/>
Lord Ieſus, which ſight
as it ſtruck blindneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the face, and thicke
ſcales into the eies of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
<hi>Saul,</hi> ſo it dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the whole counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of ſuffering <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
with a moſt Diuine
and Angelical glory: and
had not the Light in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
beene greater then
the Suns, it would haue
beene like the Moon and
Starres at mid-day, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extinguiſht and inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Neyther let any man
amaze his vnderſtanding
with the manner how a
Spirituall ſubſtance can
ſo ſparkle, and be, as it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18185:52"/>
were viſible in the body.
Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> compariſon
hath life in it, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of that point.
Life in it ſelfe is inuiſible,
and cannot be ſeene, yet
it ſo freſhes the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and beautifies the
eyes, that when the body
wants it, and is dead, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lookes more dreary
and ghaſtly then a Corps
doth: We ſee not life in
it ſelfe (ſayes the Father)
but wee ſee it ſhining in
the brightneſſe of the
eyes, and ſmiling in the
liuelihood and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And ſo it is with
a glorious body. God is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18185:53"/>
Life, and, like Life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ſeene in himſelfe
by any ocular aſpect, but
as Life in a Naturall, ſo
God in a glorious body
is moſt apparant, and
plainely viſible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,
euen vnto our
eyes.</p>
               <p>But ſome perhaps will
thinke this diſcourſe of
ſpirituall ſatiety (I call it
ſpirituall, not excluding
the Body, but becauſe
our Bodies themſelues
ſhall be then ſpirituall, as
now our very ſpirits are
in a manner carnall) to be
fetch'd rather out of the
ſchooles of Reaſon, then
of Gods Word, and to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18185:53"/>
haue more ground in
Philoſophy then Faith.
For where in Scripture
ſhall we read of any ſuch
image of God to ſatiſfie
our Natures with? If we
turne to the 17. Pſalme
and the 15. verſe, we ſhal
there finde the portion of
the righteous excellently
deſcribed by <hi>Dauid:</hi> who
hauing before ſet out the
men of this world (who
haue their portion in this
life) their <hi>dimenſum,</hi>
which is their belly full
of Treaſures, abundance
of Children, and their
happineſſe to leaue their
ſubſtance to their Babes,
<hi>verſe 14.</hi> hee reflects his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18185:54"/>
thoughts into his owne
breſt, and ſings, <hi>As for
me, I will behold thy face
in righteouſneſſe, I ſhall
bee ſatisfied when I awake
with thy Image.</hi> This
made <hi>Dauids</hi> heart pant
after the ſight of Gods
face (for ſo the words o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
ſignifie,) <hi>Pſalm.
42. 1.</hi> This made him
pray, <hi>Lighten mine eyes
that I ſleepe not in death,</hi>
and needes muſt the eyes
of the righteous be ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
and then awaken,
(when the wicked ſhall
haue theirs ſhut vp in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
darkeneſſe) when
they ſhall behold the face
of God, and ſhall ſatisfie
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18185:54"/>
with his Image their eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
ſoules. Wee ſhall
finde in Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this Image of God,
that for aye bleſſes the
ſoules of the righteous,
two other Images of the
wicked world, and of
wicked men, wherewith
the wicked ſtriue to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their ſoules; but as S.

looſe continually his
forme and faſhion: ſo
<hi>Dauid</hi> tells vs, <hi>Pſalme</hi> the
73. the 20. that <hi>when God
awakes, he ſhal deſpiſe their
image.</hi> The image of God
ſatisfies the righteous,
when they awake to their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18185:55"/>
reward; becauſe there is
ſubſtance, and truth, and
goodneſſe in it: but when
God awakes to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the wicked,
their image is ſo far from
bringing with it any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of glory, that
in the iudgment of God
himſelfe (who cannot
but iudge moſt vpright<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly)
it is full of ſhame,
moſt ignoble, and
worthy to be deſpiſed,
hauing no ſubſtance, but
onely ſhadow; no truth,
but onely appearance, no
ground but onely opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to paint it ſelfe with:
and therefore looke what
difference of things there
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18185:55"/>
is in the ſound iudgment
of one waking, and the
ſkipping and dauncing
phanſies of a dreaming
braine, ſo much &amp; more
is there betweene the
ſwelling images of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
glory, and the diuine
image of God, when wee
ſhall awaken from thoſe
dreams, which the world,
as long as ſhee can keepe
vs in the cradle of our
fleſh, rocks, and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſings vs a-ſleep in. And
therefore <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing
ſpoken of the death of the
wicked, in the former
verſe of the fore-cited
Pſalme, <hi>O how ſuddenly
doe they conſume and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18185:56"/>
and come to a fearefull
end!</hi> preſently annexes:
<hi>As a dreame when one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waketh,
ſo, O Lord, when
thou awakeſt, thou ſhalt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
their image.</hi> But let
vs leaue this golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
with all the drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
World (with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar)</hi>
is troubled
with in their ſleepe, and is
angry with all that will
not fall down to worſhip
it; and returne to that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
that deludes not
dreaming, but ſatisfies
our awaking ſpirits.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaks of his
owne, ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes
of all the Elect ſoules of
God, <hi>Rom. 8. 29.</hi> that they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18185:56"/>
were predeſtinated to be
conform'd to this Diuine
image, and therefore in
the 2. to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
the 3. 13. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he makes
his difference betweene
the obſtinate Iew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the
beleeuing Chriſtian, that
their hearts was ſtil veild,
and blinded with their
olde <hi>Moſaicall</hi> ſhadows,
and ceremonies; but <hi>wee
all</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the veyle done away
in Chriſt, with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding,
as in a glaſſe, the
glory of the Lord, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into the ſame Image
from glory to glory, euen as
of the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi>
So that as the Moon and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18185:57"/>
the Starres, that hauing
no in-borne or inherent
Light ſtreaming from
themſelues, and yet ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together into
their burning faces the
beames of the Sun, freely
ſent abroad, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

like ſo many little images
of the great Lampe of
day. So all the Holy
Lamps of Heauen, made
for Gods ſeruice, haue
onely the Light of Gods
countenance to kindle
themſelues with, which
he out of his bounty caſts
abroad amongſt them,
and they according to
their ſeuerall capacities,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18185:57"/>
to fill vp their meaſures
of glory, moſt ambitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
veſſell vp.</p>
               <p>This being the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Diuine Nature,
who is the ſpiritual ſonne
of eternall Eſſences, that
he, beyond all other, is
moſt emiſſiue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatiue
of himſelfe:
For as Light is more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
then any colour, and
ſends out in the eradition
of it, a more full and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<hi>ſpecies</hi> of it ſelfe,
then any other thing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is (as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
calls) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the colour of all colours:
ſo God, who is the Light
of all Lights, muſt needs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18185:58"/>
in himſelfe bee moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though neither it to
the eye of an Owle, nor
God to the ſight of our
vnderſtanding, yet beetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browed,
can ſo appeare.
But when (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſings)
our ſoules ſhall awaken,
and the youth of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhall be renewed as
the Eagles; both they
with the Diuinity, and
theſe with the Diuine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
ſhall be tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into the ſame image
of glory which they ſhall
behold in him. And
though now they blinke
at Sunne-ſhine, yet then
where the body of glory
is, thither ſhall the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18185:58"/>
Eagles be all gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

feede, and fill the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>And this is the fulneſſe
of glory our Sauiour
meanes to ſatisfie them
in heauen with, who on

And it is the obſeruation
of the Philoſpher: That
all Creatures naturally
deſire to draw and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themſelues as cloſe to

they can, which hee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18185:65"/>
makes to bee the Reaſon
why there is in them all,
ſo vehement a deſire
(which hee calls of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

not being able in their

as hee ſayes,
partaker of the Diuine

the reaſon why there

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18185:65"/>
of glory in the
Creature is moſt liuelie
expreſt in the eight to the
Romans, of which I ſpake
in the former ſection. Let
vs therefore if the wicked
deſire the death, endeuor
to obtaine the life of the
righteous: if the whole
creation grone and ſigh,
and trauel to be deliuer'd
from the corruption,
whereunto our ſinne hath
imbondaged it, into the
glorious liberty of the
children of God, at leaſt,
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes in the
ſame chapter, groan with
them, and within our
ſelues, to bee deliuered
from our owne ſinne, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18185:66"/>
to bee made partakers of
that glory which God
diuides among his ſaints.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſet before our
eyes thoſe Noble exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which the Scripture
hath lighted vp for vs to
looke vpon. For this is
that heauenly Countrie
which Gods ſoiourners
and Pilgrims heere on
earth ſeeing a farre off,
ſweetly ſaluted, <hi>Heb. 11.
13.</hi> and trauelling as
ſtrangers thorough the
world, eſteemed onely
worthy of their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> walked
with God before his
death, and therfore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
death was tranſlated
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18185:66"/>
to him: being, as S. <hi>Iude</hi>
ſpeakes, the ſeuenth from
<hi>Adam,</hi> whom God, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
ſanctified to himſelfe
with eternall reſt, becauſe
he was the Sabbaoth of
Men. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
the naked and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
wilderneſſe, before
the delights and treaſures
of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court; and
was not this the cauſe,
becauſe he looked <gap reason="foreign">

to the great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the Reward, by
Faith ſeeing him, who is
inuiſible, <hi>Heb. 11. 27.</hi> This
made <hi>Daniel</hi> eſteeme the
Lions Denne better then
<hi>Darius</hi> Palace, and the
three children aduenture
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18185:67"/>
to meete heauen in hell,
God in the middeſt of a

This made not valiant

<hi>Whether hee had
any thing to giue him more

Now therfore being thou

ſome at home: but labour
will meete a man euery
where, be hee where hee
will. It is our portion
vnder the Sunne, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
tells vs: <hi>Behold that
which I haue ſeene,</hi> ſayes
the wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 18.
It is good for a man to eate,
and to drinke, and to enioy
the good of all his labour,
which he taketh vnder the
Sunne, for it is his portion.</hi>
So that euery one that
would enioy the good
creatures of GOD (this
ſubceleſtiall happineſſe
which flouriſhes vnder
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18185:79"/>
the Sunne) if hee would
eate and drinke, or enioy
any good, it muſt be of
his labour, his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
not another mans;
for that is to ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
mans goods, and
with his ſweate to warme
our own browes. And ſo
ſeuere was the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of Chriſt in this point
(that Golden and Elect
inſtrument of Gods grace
to vs) who in labours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
them all that were
hired into Chriſts vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
to worke, that hee
would haue him ſtarued
to death, that to maintain
his life would not labor:
<hi>Hee that will not labour, let
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18185:79"/>
him not eate, ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
2 Theſ. 3. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were vnneceſſary to
adde more out of the
word of God, to acquaint
vs with our duety of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the places to this
purpoſe, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in this argument is
prodigall. <hi>Thou ſhalt eat
the labour of thy hands, Pſ.
128. 2. Epheſ. 4. 28. Let
him that ſtole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſteale no more
but rather let him labour,
working with his hands the
thing that is good, that hee
may haue to giue to him that
needeth.</hi> Where wee ſee
the Apoſtle ties not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
euerie man to his
worke, but would haue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18185:80"/>
him, though hee labour
with his owne hands to
get his liuing, yet to giue
ſomething to him that
needeth, &amp; wants hands
or feete, or health, or
ſtrength, or liberty, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to labour. Looke then
as we ſee a field, as long as
it hath any heart in it, if it
be manured, and tilled, &amp;
ſowne, and weeded, and
well huſbanded in euery
part, neuer deceiues the
hopes of the greedy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
but paies him
in his own ſeed with the
moſt lawfull vſury of
naturall, and very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
encreaſe: which if it
bee neuer wrought vpon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18185:80"/>

but falls perhaps into the
hands of the ſluggard,
growes preſently full of
nothing but thiſtles and
thornes, ranke hurtfull
weedes, as <hi>Salomon</hi> tels vs
<hi>Prou 24. 30. I went by the
field of the ſluggard, and by
the vineyard of the ſlothfull
man, and loe it was al ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne
with thornes and
nettles had couered the face
thereof:</hi> ſo is it with the
body of man: If it be wel
and faithfully laboured, it
is fruitfull both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
his family, and the
whole Common-wealth:
but if it ſleep away all his
time in idleneſſe. hee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18185:81"/>
growes not onely vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,

               <p>Man himſelfe (which
is worthy our obſeruing)
euen then, when hee was
firſt paradis'd in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of pleaſure, yet had
ſomething to doe in it,
and was not ſuffered to
walke idlely vp &amp; downe
like a Loyterer, or Idleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bye
that had nothing at
all to doe: but was ſet to

Labour hee muſt though
ſweat he ſhould not, and

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18185:83"/>
though ſweat hee ſhould
not, and buſineſſe hee
had to doe, though in
the doing of it he felt no
wearineſſe or toyle.</p>
               <p>And as theſe moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
creatures of God An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and man were not
ſuffered to bee idle, ſo if
wee looke vp to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
themſelues, we ſhall
there ſee there that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
body in continuall
motion, neuer ſtanding
ſtill, but flying about the
world with incredible
ſwiftneſſe, that <hi>Dauids</hi>
great Giant, who euery
morning like a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
comes out of
his Eaſterne chamber, &amp;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18185:83"/>
delights to run the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
races God hath ſet
him, with all the leſſe
ſtarres of the glorious
body, might ſhed their
beames vpon the Earth
in the ſeaſons of it, &amp; ſo
bring foorth hearbes and
fruites for the ſeruice of
man and beaſt.</p>
               <p>It is indeede a naturall
Truth, <hi>Omne Corpus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turale
quieſcit in loco pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio.
Euery naturall body is
quieſcent in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place:</hi> and yet wee ſee
though all gladly reſt in
their owne regions, and
inuade not the confines
of their neighbour Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18185:84"/>
mouing and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
about in their owne
orbes and circuits, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
teaching vs to labour
euery man in the circle
of his owne calling, and
not to buſie-body out
abroad with other newe
workes. The Aire breakes
not into the quarters of
Heauen, and yet, wee ſee,
it is alwayes fann'd from
place to place, and neuer
ſleepes idly in his owne
regions: the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
otherwiſe it would
ſoone putrifie it ſelfe and
poyſon vs all with the
ſtinking breath of it, did
not the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God driue it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18185:84"/>
about the World, with
his Windes, that ſo it
might both preſerue it
ſelfe, and ſerue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
vs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it could neuer
doe.</p>
               <p>And truly whether we
aſcend vp into Heauen,
or deſcend with <hi>Dauid</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deepe, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the whole Ocean,
which is a farre more
ſluggiſh element then
the Ayre, neuer reſt, but
euer moued either by the
Windes, or by a proper
motion, whereby natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
it ebbes and flowes
to preſerue it ſelfe ſweet
and wholeſome for thoſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18185:85"/>
creatures that liue in it,
and withall that it might
by ſuch inter-tides be the
more ſeruiceable to the
vſe of man in the conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of commodities
from ſhoare to ſhoare.
So that in a word, euery
thing moues for man,
&amp; ſhould man only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
be idle &amp; ſtand ſtill.</p>
               <p>Giue mee but one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in the whole
World of ſloath, and
reſtiue idleneſſe, but one,
and I will giue thee leaue
to keepe Holy-day, and
play away all thy life
without ſweat or labour:
only perhaps of a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
poole, and that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18185:85"/>
growes noiſome that no
man can endure it: or of
ſome deformed Toade,
and that is full ſwolne
with rankour and poiſon;
or it may be of an idle
Droane, and that becauſe
it plaies in Summer, dies
in Winter: But if wee
looke vp to Heauen, that
will teach vs to runne the
races God ſets before vs
with ioy and gladneſſe;
if the holy Angels may
inſtruct vs, they will take
vs out a leſſon of faithfull
labour, both in our
thoughts to God, and
actions to men. All the
Creatures of God will
ſet vs a worke by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18185:86"/>
Chuſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whether thou wilt
with thy vitious idleneſſe
be of a corrupted, and
venemous nature, and ſo
die; or exerciſe thy ſelfe
in the holy labours thy
vocation cals thee to,
like the bleſſed Angels,
and all other the more
noble Creatures of God.</p>
               <p>And that we may ſee
reaſon why wee ſhould
labour, wee muſt know
that it is both a Diuine
and naturall Truth, <hi>Deus
&amp; Natura nihil faciunt
fruſtra: God and Nature
made nothing idle.</hi> It is
for vs the heards of the
field, and the fowles of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18185:86"/>
Heauen, and the fiſh in
the Seas labour to bring
forth their young. It is
for vs the wearie Oxe is
yoakt to labour, and the
Horſe takes the bridle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his mouth to eaſe vs
by his trauaile. It is for
vs the poore Silke-worm
ſpinnes her clew, and the
thriftie Bee gathers her
honey to the combe: but
as all theſe labour for vs,
ſo it is our labour that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and guides them,
and ſets them all a worke
firſt. Indeed God hath
of his goodneſſe made
them our ſeruants, and
put our feare vpon them.
<hi>The feare of you ſhall be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18185:87"/>
vpon all Creatures, Gen.
9. 2.</hi> But it is not our
parts to vſe their labours
to make our ſelues idle,
but if wee would haue
them labour for vs, wee
muſt be fellow-labourers
with them for our ſelues.
And indeed two ſpeciall
reaſons would God haue
vs labour for; one to keep
vs from the greene-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Idlenes, which
in truth is the immediate
mother of all Sinne, as
wee may ſee by <hi>Dauids</hi>
Tower-walke; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the more full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
of our life and
health. For as it is labour
that procures all things
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18185:87"/>
neceſſary for our life and
health, as meates and
drink. clothing &amp; hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing:
ſo it is labour that
preſerues our health, by
warming our blood, that
it be not gellied with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
colds into rheums
and diſperſing thoſe ill
humors which with idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
would grow vpon
vs, and by prepuring the
body more delightfully
both to receiue nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without ſurfet, and
without diſquiet, reſt, &amp;
ſleepe.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee therefore there
is both great reaſon for
vs to labour if wee would
enioy our health, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18185:88"/>
if we would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the wants of our own
liues and example, if wee
would follow either the
command of God, or
the patterne of other
the moſt honourable
creatures God hath
made.</p>
               <p>Now let not here the
good huſbandman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(he as <hi>Iſaac)</hi> tills his
ground and ſowes it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſe
all labour into his
owne calling, and ſo
thinking himſelfe onely
the true labourer, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
with all other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
as more idle, and
leſſe neceſſarie. Let the
good huſbandman haue
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18185:88"/>
alwayes his due honour
reſerued him; but let not
the good huſbandman
thinke all other men bad-huſbands
becauſe hee is
good, for hee may bee a
bad man, though hee bee
a good huſbandman, in
ſo thinking. For as man
himſelfe is diuided into
ſeuerall reſpects of body
and ſoule, eſtate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
ſo euery calling that
is lawfully employed in
the prouiding for any of
theſe, hath in it true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
men. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
indeed he ſees
the body, the ſhepheard
cloathes it, the Architect
houſes it, and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18185:89"/>
cures it. It were a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
but to reckon vp the
ſeuerall calling that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
about the body, and
indeede would paſſe my
skill to name them: ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the eſtates of men,
Iudges and Lawyers, and
Notaries and Officers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
and about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of men, Princes and
Magiſtrates labour, to
keepe them in ciuill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and gouernment; and
about the ſoule of man
the Miniſter of God la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
I cannot ſtand to
euidence the labour of
all theſe callings: I will
onely make it plaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the calling of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18185:89"/>

firſt vpon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in the
manner of the benefite,
which is by <hi>Receipt:</hi> hee
does not take it as a due,
but receiues it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he makes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the Lord, but the
Steward of Gods gift:
and then we caſt our eyes
vpon God (as the eyes of
all things looke vpon
thee O Lord) who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
the benefit by his
celeritie in giuing which
was in the ſame yeare.
Secondly, by <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
of receiuing, it
being now a needfull
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18185:94"/>
time of Famine; and laſt
by the meaſure and ſize
of returning his ſeede,
which was not thirty, nor
ſixtie, but a hundred
fold.</p>
               <p>Now if we regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſubſtance or the
circumſtances of the
words, a man would
thinke (as the world now
goes) that <hi>Iſaack</hi> had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, or neede to
ſowe in ſuch a Land and
at ſuch a time, as he did.
For that hee was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
rich, is confeſt of all,
both by the gifts of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi>
the King of the
Philiſtims which he gaue
him, and by the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18185:95"/>
of his Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
which he left him:
and therefore what neede
had he to labour?</p>
               <p>We know it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of many men, if they
haue liued long in the
Countrey and by their
labours haue enriched
themſelues, they forſake
the fields, and betake
themſelues to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and eaſe of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and againe Citizens
when they are well fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by their trades,
they flye abroad ſtraight
to purchaſe ſomething in
the Countrey, that they
may there ſummer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in their bowers
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18185:95"/>
and arbours of pleaſure:
they are all ſoone wearie
of their labour, euen as
ſoone as they are enricht
by it. Which though
it be allowable in men
ancient, as the Poet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes: <q>Solue ſeneſcentem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſanus equum;</q>Eſpecially if not only
Age, but ſome diſeaſe
and weakeneſſe of their
bodies requires it: for
ſo God diſmiſt the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites</hi>
at 50. yeares old
from their ſeruice at his
Altar, yet it is not ſo in
men, either able to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or without labour
vnable to liue. For here
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18185:96"/>
wee ſee <hi>Iſaac</hi> a rich man,
and now paſt threeſcore
yeares old (as wee may
gather from the 25. verſe
of the former Chapter)
yet ſtill labours and ſowes
his ground.</p>
               <p>Againe, let a man be
but indifferently left by
his Friends, though hee
doe liue in the Countrey,
yet he will (as he out of
his young gentilitie will
pleaſe to boaſt) ſcorne to
follow the Plow; he will
keepe perhaps a Caſt of
Hawkes, or a Kennell of
Hounds, and he will call
them and follow them
day by day; but thats all
the calling he will follow.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18185:96"/>
Queſtionleſſe, Hawking
and Hunting are both
lawfull; but only to make
recreations of, not to
make callings of. For he
that makes the following
of ſuch ſports his only
calling, inuerts and turns
the order of God vpſide
downe. For whereas
God made all beaſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
to ſerue man, he
ſpends his life in ſeruing
and following of beaſts,
and ſo makes himſelfe the
ſeruant of thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
of which God hath
made him the Lord:
weakely eſteeming that
the priuiledge of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and his bleſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18185:97"/>
others, which <hi>Noah</hi>
wiſely laied vpon <hi>Canaan</hi>
as of all other the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
curſe. <hi>A ſeruant of
ſeruants ſhall he be:</hi> but
<hi>Iſaack</hi> thinkes it no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
to his Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
to till the Earth: nor
<hi>Iacob</hi> that was his heire to
follow Sheepe, though
perhaps my Lord <hi>Eſau</hi>
goe a hunting euery day
an ende. Yet I thinke
not <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but I thinke he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his ſeruants that
were ſo, and in ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
there is no man, but
ſhall finde as much wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as delight, and
health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:18185:97"/>
Beſides, if a man would
labour vpon the ground,
one would ſuppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rich, the ground
ſhould be his owne, not
anothers: what would
one of our ſmall heires
ſay, ſhould I now turne
Farmour. I thanke God
I haue beene brought vp
after another faſhion, and
haue ground enough of
mine owne to liue vpon
by other mens labours.
Well I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but <hi>Iſaac</hi> was as well
brought vp as ſuch idle,
out of calling Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and yet he plowes,
and ſowes, not only ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans ground, but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18185:98"/>
the ground of ſtraungers,
where hee could exſpect
nothing but hard dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which indeed hee
found.</p>
               <p>The laſt circumſtance
is of the time, which was
a time of Famine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all men are moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to ſowe, both
becauſe of their preſent
want of that ſeede they
caſt into the ground
which might ſerue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and becauſe they
feare the yeare to come
may proue as barren, as
that which was paſt: Yet
for all this, <hi>Iſaac</hi> though
rich, neither thinkes it
too meane a calling for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18185:98"/>
him to till the ground,
neither is diſcouraged
from labouring, though
he ſpent his ſweat vpon
the ground of ſtrangers,
and ſowed in a moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
time, and what
might the reaſon of this
be?</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
perſon, and lookt
aſſuredly for Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing,
which he found and
therefore ſowed. From
whence we gather this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
<hi>Tis good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie
to bee a religious
man, and one of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Abraham,</hi> that is,
<hi>a faithfull man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Iſaac</hi> knew
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18185:99"/>
that hee who meant to
reape the fruit of Gods
bleſſing, muſt ſowe the
ſeede of his owne labour,
in ſome lawfull and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
courſe, and therefore
he ſowed, whence ariſes
this Obſeruation, <hi>That as
euery man muſt vſe the
meanes, that would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
by Gods bleſſings: ſo
that Huſbandry hath beene
an auncient and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meanes of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iſaac</hi> had
Gods promiſe to bleſſe
him in the third verſe of
this Chapter, euen in this
vnlikely place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſowed among ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and from hence we
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18185:99"/>
may borrow this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>A Childe of God makes
Gods will the rule of all his
actions, though it ſeeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo repugnant to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to conclude, <hi>Iſaac</hi>
had learnt by experience,
that God was not ruled
by nature, but was the
Ouer-ruler of it, and
therefore though Famine
ſhould haue eaten vp all
the Land beſides, yet he
was ſure God could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
him, and bleſſe his
ſeede, when the the fields
of other men languiſht
with deſolation, and
waſte, and therefore hee
ſowed then in the time of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18185:100"/>
Famine, from whence we
we will learne this laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
<hi>God alwaies
glorifies himſelfe in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his Children by taking
aduantage of the moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
time that may bee to
preſerue them in.</hi> Let vs
now begin with the firſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <head>IIII. It is good huſbandrie to be

               <p>FOr though the wicked

ſhould loſe much if they
were troubled in their

vice of Religion
(as they thinke it) yet by
their leaues, Godlineſſe is
great gaine, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
tels vs, and is inſtated
in a double portion by
Gods owne promiſe both
of the things of this life,
and of the life to come.
<hi>Hee giueth meat to them
that feare him, and is euer
mindfull of his promiſe,</hi>
ſings <hi>Dauid, Pſal. 111. 5.</hi>
His are no Court-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
prodigally made,
and purpoſely forgotten;
but ſo carefull is God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18185:101"/>
an eſpeciall manner
to be out of debt to thoſe
that rely vpon his word,
that in the times of
dearth and famine, when
all other are lankt, and
ſhrunke vp with the lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Earth; yet
then (as it is in the fifth
of <hi>Iob,</hi> the 20. and 22.)
<hi>God ſhall redeeme thee
from death, ſo as thou ſhalt
laugh at deſtruction and
famine.</hi> What though a
man begin with little, as
<hi>Iacob</hi> did, <hi>Yet if thou ſeeke
to God betimes, and make
thy ſupplication to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
though thy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
be ſmall, yet thy latter
ende ſhall greatly increaſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:18185:101"/>
as one of <hi>Iobs</hi> falſe friends
truly prophecied at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Gods purpoſe
toward <hi>Iobs</hi> eſtate. No
matter therefore how
wicked men are opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of Godlineſſe, who
accompt it a very vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and moſt vnthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vertue: the truth is, it
is farre otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>For Godlineſſe is not
only a gaine without
loſſe, but a great gaine
without the leaſt loſſe:
but wicked gaines are all
like <hi>Samſons</hi> Foxes, they
haue fire brands in their
tailes, that conſume all
their Maſters good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie:
For they gaine
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18185:102"/>
a little part of the world,
and loſe that in the ende
which is more worth then
the whole world, and
ſuch gaines will profit
little. For as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
ſaies, <hi>What will it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
a man if hee gaine the
whole world, and loſe his
owne ſoule?</hi> So that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a wicked man gaines
only for other, but gets
loſſe for himſelfe: for
whileſt he loſes himſelfe,
his heires enter vpon all
his gaines, and ſuch are
but ſilly gaines God
knowes, and I would
they knew ſo to: but the
gettings of a Religious
man brings no ſuch after-claps
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18185:102"/>
of griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
with them, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
tels vs in 10. of the
<hi>Prou. 22. The bleſſing of
the Lord, it maketh rich,
and hee addeth no ſorrow
with it:</hi> but how hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and full of irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſorrow the goods
are of vnrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
deſcribes in the
1. Epiſtle to <hi>Tim.</hi> the 6. 9.
<hi>But they that will be rich</hi>
(ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation, and a ſnare,
and into many fooliſh and
hurtfull luſts, which drown
men in deſtruction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
A man would haue
thought Temptations,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18185:103"/>
and Snares, and Folly,
and hurtfull Luſts, and
Deſtructions, and Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had beene miſerie,
and ſorrow enough for a
Couetous heart, a heart
that will be rich, <hi>Quaſi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente
Deo,</hi> to be drowned
in. But as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaies,
<hi>God addes no ſorrowes to
the riches he giues,</hi> ſo Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> addes more to thoſe
the world giues. <hi>For the
lone of money</hi> (ſaies the
ſame Apoſtle in the ſame
place) <hi>is the root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
which while ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted
after, they haue erred
from the Faith, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
themſelues thorow and
thorow with many ſorrows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:18185:103"/>
All theſe miſchiefes
happen not to rich men,
but to men that will bee
rich, not to men that
haue money, but to men
that loue money, and ſet
their heart vpon it. <hi>If
riches increaſe, ſet not thy

A man may haue riches,
but riches muſt not haue

they ſhould not be
Gods bleſſing, which
they are, <hi>Deut. 28.</hi> they
would not be rewards of

would neuer make vs
friends in Heauen, <hi>Luke
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18185:104"/>
16. 9.</hi> we ſhould neuer ſee

of rich <hi>Abraham, Luc. 16.
22.</hi> Our Sauiour would
neuer haue ſent out his
thunder of imboſſibilitie
againſt them, with this
lightning, <hi>How hard it is
for them that truſt in riches
to enter into the Kingdome
of God,</hi> wee ſhould haue
ſeene <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
Ioſeph, Iob, Dauid, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah,</hi>
the rich <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaean,
&amp;c.</hi> either leſſe
religious, or more poore.</p>
               <p>Looke then as good
ground to the Seedſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
ſo the honeſt heart
when the ſeede of Gods
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18185:104"/>
benefits are committed
to him, puts out all the
grace of God to the
greateſt aduantage of his
glorie that he can, and is
neither idle nor vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in his fruit-ſeaſons.
For he knowes he muſt
giue account of euery idle
word, how much more of
many talents, or a whole
life miſpent in idleneſſe:
but Gods ſeede brings
forth in him either 30. or
60. or 100. fold, and
Gods talents are reſtored
for two, fiue; for fiue,
tenne. Neither can it be
otherwiſe; for he is Gods
owne huſbandrie, and
therefore to be a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18185:105"/>
man, and a childe of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> muſt needs be
good huſbandry, becauſe
it is Gods, who will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
bleſſe his owne
grounds, and be ſure to
let his Sunne ſhine, and
raine fall vpon them, and
water them, except ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
that they may be
more fruitfull after, hee
lets them for a while lye
fallow, and for a yeare or
ſo, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, lye ſpar'd
and broken vp, without
any outward ſhew of
fruite at all.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe all men
are reaſonable, though
ſome be not religious, let
vs ſee whether there bee
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18185:105"/>
not great reaſon for it;
that Religion ſhould bee
thought good huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
and ſhould enrich
the man, that is a faithfull
practiſer of it. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
there is none but
will confes, that he which
is the beſt diſpoſed to get
and to keepe; &amp; the leaſt
inclined to miſ-ſpend
goods well gotten, is
moſt likely to prooue a
rich man: the Poet ioyns
both the wayes of thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in one verſe: <q>Non minor eſt virtus, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
quaerere, parta tueri.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we would know
what are the getting vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
they are agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18185:106"/>
to be Labour and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
<hi>Salomons</hi> little
Ant will tell vs how
much is got by Labour,
if we go to her. <hi>Go to the
Ant thou Sluggard, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her wayes, and be wiſe.
Prou. 6. 6.</hi> And <hi>Salomons</hi>
ſelfe will tell vs what is
the fruite of a diligent
hand. <hi>Prou. 10. 4.</hi> A dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
hand maketh rich:
for as the Ant labours
much and wiſely, (ſo the
Poet moſt elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
it. <q>
                     <l>It nigeum campis agmen,
praedamque per herbas</l>
                     <l>Conuectat calle anguſto,
pars grandia trudunt,</l>
                     <l>Frumenta obnixè humeris,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18185:106"/>
pars agmina cogunt,</l>
                     <l>Caſtigantque. moras: Opere
omnis ſemita ferret.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So the diligent hand
loues to labour, and goes
willingly through all the
vp-hils of thrift, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſpeakes of his good
houſwife. <hi>Shee perceiueth
her merchandiſe is good,
therefore ſhee worketh wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
with her hands:</hi> ſhee
is early vp at it. And is a
wicked man of this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition?
It may bee is labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
by reaſon of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſity
of his eſtate, and
the ſtrength of his body:
but is hee conſtant in his
labour, does hee loue it?
Nay, will he not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18185:107"/>
breake out into ſome
exceſſe or other, and ſo
ſoone ſpend ill, what was
well gotten? O how hard
a thing is it to ſee a good
workman indeed, almoſt
in any calling not to haue
ſome one ſecret or known
vice, that like a wicked
vermine conſumes all his
labours? but an honeſt &amp;
religious hand as it ſets
it ſelfe to worke in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand,
and ſo gaines his bleſſing:
So is it both conſtant in
his labour, and prouident
to auoyde the miſpences
other men fall into. For
as hee is not drowſie in
getting his liuing: ſo is he
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18185:107"/>
neither drunken nor gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to ſpend it. He reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<hi>Salomons</hi> counſell in
the 23. of the <hi>Prouer. 20.
Be not among wine-bibbers
among riotous eaters of
fleſh; for the drunkard and
the glutton ſhall come to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,
and drowſineſſe
ſhall cloath a man with
ragges.</hi> Does not our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
teach vs (as the
French Prouerbes goes)
That more men dig their
graues with their teeth,
then are ſlaine with the
ſword: that is, with their
ouer greedy cramming
themſelues: but a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man is taught to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his body with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18185:108"/>
not to ſurfet his
body with exceſſiiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.
Do not we ſee many
a labouring man boyle
his whole body in ſweat
all the day long, onely to
quench the dropſie of his
throate at night with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
ſwilling in his
day labour turned into
drinke? but a religious
man as his hand are labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
ſo he hath a ſober
throate, drinking onely to
refreſh his body, not ſo,
till the drinke comes vp
where it went down: the
grape of neceſſity he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

poore, and of the perſons

are rich. There is a time
of pouertie, and a time

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:18185:111"/>

as ſparkes from

And it is worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
how ſoone his
name rots, which that it
might flie into eternitie
beyond the names of
poorer men, he ſo feathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelfe with houſes,
and lands, and children,
and called them all by his

our Sauiour in the
Storie of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and
<hi>Diues,</hi> keepes the poore
mans name aliue to the
worldes end, but indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
leaues the rich

with <hi>There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18185:116"/>
rich man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the firſt and
maine difference of the
times, but there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For there are ſome
times of perſecution, and
ſome of peace. When
we therefore ſay that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
man is a Thriuer,
we meane in the time of
peace, when God bleſes
the Land he liues in with
quiet, and lets the beames
of his Goſpell freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
themſelues: but in
the times of perſecution,
when clowds, and ſtorms
ariſe; when the Arke of
God is tempeſted about,
and failes as it were in the
bloud of his Children, it
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18185:116"/>
is contrarie. For as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the poore religious
man growes rich, with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and
<hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo in
the times of bloudy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
the rich man,
that is truly religious,
voluntarily grows poore,
as <hi>Mathew,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
and <hi>Zachaeus</hi> did. But
their riches then left not
them for want of Gods
bleſſing, but they to get
a bleſſing of God, left
their riches to ſupply the
wants of others. There
is a time of Warre, and
a time of Peace, ſaith the
Preacher, <hi>Eccl. 3.</hi> a time
to get, and a time to caſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18185:117"/>
away. Now it pleaſed
God <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould liue in
a time of peace, and ſo
ſhould haue a time to
get: but <hi>Mathew</hi> and
<hi>Zachaeus, &amp;c.</hi> were to
liue in a time, when the
whole world was at war
with God, and that was
a time to caſt away. And
as God gets himſelfe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in enriching his
Children in the times of
peace; ſo it is his good
pleaſure, that his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by being poore
ſometime for his ſake,
ſhould get themſelues
glory from him.</p>
               <p>I but will a poore
Chriſtian ſay. Now are
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18185:117"/>
peaceable times: and yet
there are ſtill many rich
wicked men, and more
godly that are poore. So
queſtionleſſe, there are
many rich godly men,
and more poore that are
wicked. But to ſatisfie
this doubt alſo. I told
you there is a ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
to be vſed of the
perſons of rich, &amp; poore
men. It may be thou art
godly and poore. Tis
well: but canſt thou tell
whether, if thou wert not
poore, thou wouldſt be
godly? Sure God knows
vs better then wee our
ſelues doe, and therefore
can best fit the eſtate to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18185:118"/>
the perſon. Why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou thinke much to
ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> by <hi>Diues</hi> his
gates; God knowes that
was the way he was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to heauen by, and it
may be hee had neuer
been comforted in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
boſome, if God had
not brought him thither
by affection, and by <hi>Diues</hi>
his gate.</p>
               <p>Reſt therefore thy ſelfe
content with that eſtate
God hath ſet thee in, that
is beſt for thee, if thou
beeſt a childe of God,
and it is not Gods order
to giue thee his bleſſings
to hurt thee with.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould ſee my
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18185:118"/>
childe diſſolutely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to gaming, ſhould
I giue him a patrimonie
to dice away, or thinke it
a kindneſſe in me to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
a vice in him? If I
had an vngratious bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whoſe heart I ſhould
perceiue ſo leagued with
ſome harlot, that hee
would loſe his honeſtie,
and ſpend his eſtate vpon
her; ſhould I not rather
keep him honeſtly poore,
then ſend him to periſh
with my benefit, and
make my purſe his bane?
What if he ſhould wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
me with intreatie, and
for the time thinke vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
of me, as fooliſh
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18185:119"/>
children that haue kniues
denied them, will cry; and
a man in a burning fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
thinke much when
he is denied cold drinke?
Might hee not thinke
more hardly of me after,
when he comes to iudge
rightly, If I ſhould haue
helpt him then to haue
deſtroied himſelfe? <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari
in perniciem roganti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ſaeua bonitas eſt.</hi> It is
vnkinde mercie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of any man to his
vndoing. And although
this benefit of God be
ſomething more obſcure
to the by-cauſe, thou ſeeſt
not thine owne future
wickedneſſe, yet it is no
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18185:119"/>
whit the leſſe benefit in it
ſelfe, except thou thinkeſt
it a leſſe benefit for a man
ſleeping to be ſaued from
a wilde Beaſt, that would
deuoure him in the
darke, then it is to be ſo
reſcued in the day, and
when he now ſees it, and
is awake. Certainly God
ſees ſomething more then
thou doſt, either for thy
glorie, or his owne, or for
the example of others,
why he denies thee riches,
which if thou ſhouldeſt
enioy, thou mightſt haue
cauſe after to complaine
of his goodneſſe. For
what a Heathen man in
the like caſe ſaies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18185:120"/>
and his Friend, may
be more truely ſaid of
God, and his children.
<hi>Non committam vt poſſit
quandoque dicere, Ille a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando
me occidit.</hi> I will
neuer giue him cauſe to
ſay one day of me, <hi>Hee
killed me with kindneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet though I be
poore, wilt thou ſay, why
ſhould a wicked man be
rich? why it may be (for
ought wee know) God
may make him a good
man before his death; as
he did <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus,</hi>
the two rich Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,
and great ſinners;
And wilt thou childe with
Gods Prouidence for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18185:120"/>
him his temporall
bleſſings, vpon whom he
meanes to beſtow his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall:
but if not: wee
know not whether by ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,
or miſpence he may
become poore before he
die, and ſo God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
his ſinnes with the
loſſe of his goods.</p>
               <p>But ſay he be not a rich
man only, but a couetous
man, and liues thriuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all his life, and dies in
as great plenty as the
moſt religious thriuer,
why ſhould God ſuffer
him to be rich by raking
to himſelfe other mens
goods? Why doeſt not
thou yet, being a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18185:121"/>
knowne that a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
man, is the pooreſt
man aliue. For muſt not
he needs be poore, whom
God himſelfe doth not
ſatisfie? doe not enuie
him, he puniſhes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with his riches ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
in thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be ſtill and ſtill in
want. Yes, but wee,
thou wilt ſay that iudge
rightly of him by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
thinke him all a
rich man. I, but thou
doeſt him the more
wrong. For that which
God makes his iuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
his riches, thou
thinkeſt to be his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and Gods bleſſing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18185:121"/>
vpon him. Heare not
therefore what we or the
world talke of him, but
what the Wiſeman, and
the Wiſdome of God
himſelfe, ſpeakes <hi>Eccleſ.
6. 1.</hi> for our iudgement is
many times out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the Worlds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
out of opinion, but
God iudges euer out of
truth, and that when all
mens ſhall faile, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth muſt paſſe
away, ſhall, and muſt
ſtand for euer. <hi>There is
an euill which I haue ſeene
vnder the Sunne, and it is
common among men. A
man to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
riches, wealth, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18185:122"/>
ſo that he wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for his ſoule of all that
he deſireth, yet God giueth
him not power to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
but a ſtranger eateth it.</hi>
Does not God now moſt
grieuoſly puniſh this
man with riches? were
it not a lamentable ſight,
and almoſt a cruell part
of a Prince, if he ſhould
make a couetous rich Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
ſpread a large Table
for others, and ſhould
there make him ſit at it,
till he were pined to
death himſelfe? This is
the very ſtate of euery
couetous ſoule.</p>
               <p>But indeed to ſay true.
A couetous man that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18185:122"/>
and ſnatches at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens goods, is no
more properly in Gods
ſight a rich man, then we
would call him that had
ſtollen a great ſumme of
mony from another man,
rich. We ſhall doe him
no wrong if we call him
a rich theefe. For yee
know wee neuer reckon
the goods of theeues
their owne goods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as ſoone as they are
taken notice of, their
goods are all ſeiz'd vpon
to the Kings vſe: And ſo
many times as ſoone as
God ſends out his pale
Purſiuant to attach this
couetous wretch, the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18185:123"/>
goods preſently are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
of all God will
haue them: ſome times
it may be to his honeſt
heire, or perhaps to the
deſtruction of ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
with his ſinne his
ſubſtance, as the rich E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloes
Brothers: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times to the building
of Hoſpitals, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
of Grammar
Schooles, or putting out
of Prentiſes, or redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Priſoners, or
founding of Colledges,
or releeuing of maimed
Soldiers, or making of
good waies, ſuch as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
neuer walkt in (or
which now is a rare point
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18185:123"/>
of pietie) in doing ſome
good to the Church of
God, by reſtoring to the
right vſe, vſurped and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
tithes, or buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from the dead
hands they lie in, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that feedes not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel any mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,
ſuch as were the
hands of the Romane
Clergie; but ſuch as are
more free, and actiue in
the ſeruice of the Prince,
&amp; Common-wealth, then
any in the whole bodie
politique of double their
abilitie, and ſtrength.
And truly the want of
doing good in this one
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18185:124"/>
kinde is the very bluſh of
our profeſſion, moſt rich
men neuer dreaming vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Schollers, or ſetting vp
in their honeſt Trade new
beginners, or ſome other
ſuch good and pious vſes;
and ſo they come all in

               <p>Leaue then to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18185:124"/>
the diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

when in their needy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity,

If God pleaſe to enrich

God will ſaue them, but
if he meanes not to haue

if by them the meanes be

               <p>This argument was
very ancient, and firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
by heathen men,
who thought all things

ſomthing ſtragling from

               <p>Let vs know then that

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18185:129"/>
without the appointed

If the Decree

and ſo he bleſt <hi>Iſaac;</hi>

ordinarily neuer breakes
off the end from the

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18185:130"/>
thou thinke GOD will
bring about the ende,
though thou neuer vſe
the meanes to attaine it,
thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe.
For God, as in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he ordaines the end,
ſo in his wiſedome he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
the meanes to
bring the end to paſſe.
Reaſon not therefore ſo
ſimply as to ſay; Whom
God will enrich, though
hee be neuer ſo careleſſe,
wealth ſhall be caſt vpon
him; for that is a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent
ſpeech, and
ſauours too much of the

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18185:130"/>
reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rightly, ſay; Whom
God will enrich, hee will
make him carefull to vſe
the meanes, whereby hee

although ſometime the

God, it may be, for the

the end cannot bee attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <p>
                  <hi>We may euidepce this

Rom. 8. 29. Whom he did

Rom. 10. <hi>the 14.</hi> How then
ſhall they call vpon him,

him of whom they haue not

heare without a Preacher?
and how ſhall they preach
except they be ſent? <hi>So
then before thou canſt

               </p>
               <p>Indeed Gods loue is

faith in Chriſt, and that
thou mightſt beleeue, he
cauſes thee to heare the

that thou maiſt

thou art called to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

that thou maieſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18185:132"/>

thou art ſure of thy

this glory the loue of
God by all theſe meanes
ſets as it were vppon thy

our glory which is the
end, &amp; Gods loue which
is the beginning and
cauſe of it, many interia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
meanes, you ſee, are

               <p>And ſhall God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that he may beſtow

doing nothing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18185:133"/>
any meanes at all?
Nay certainely, as Chriſt
would haue the treaſures
of heauen, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for vs, coſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſo much labor; being
excruciated with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dolorous agonies, and
ſuch a bloudy ſweat as to
any other Creature in
Heauen or Earth had
beene impoſſible to haue
waded thorough: ſo he
would haue vs purchaſe
our temporal riches with
our perſonall labour.</p>
               <p>No man is ſo ſimple as
to thinke he ſhall make a
good voyage, and haue
his veſſell returne well
fraughted, if he neuer ſet
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18185:133"/>
out at all any ſhip to Sea:
no man lookes for a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
that ſowes no ſeede:
none that keepes not a

Vine, to grow rich by his
vintage, or to encreaſe by
his Lambe and Wooll.
What is the Reaſon? Is it
not becauſe he knows the
meanes that brings about
the end, and if one be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanting,
the other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Why then ſhold

or why ſhould our folly
looke for Gods benefits,
without the meanes vſed,
when Gods wiſdom hath
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18185:134"/>
appointed vs only the vſe
of the meanes to obtaine

thou neyther
aſke Gods bleſſing by

and vſeſt thy owne

Faith receiue them as the

retaine by ſobriety and

bring thee forth a harueſt

thou doſt not know that
it is Hee that giueth thee
Corne and Wine, and

with the groſſe-hearted
Iſraelites offereſt ſacrifice
to thy Yearne, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteſt

I know what God hath

If he will ſaue me, he will

the very diſſolute

then it ſecretly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
him as a cauſe of

it is their idleneſſe,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18185:136"/>
which will not vndergoe

that makes them vnfit, &amp;
in-diſpoſed to receiue

               <p>It becommeth not vs

For this is to

Before our bodies
were only inſtruments to
ſerue our ſoules, and wee
delighted our ſelues in
the ſtudy of heauenly &amp;
diuine knowledge; now
our ſoules drudges onely
vpon the bodies ſeruice,
runnes onely vpon the
fleſhes errands, neyther is
any thing more weariſom
to it ſelfe, or more out of
credit in the world, then a
ſoule walking &amp; climbing
vp the holy mountaines,
from whence commeth
our ſaluation, til it be out
of breath after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of heauenly things:
before our labour for the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18185:150"/>
body was ſoone diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
when wee all went
naked, and the ground
ſeeded it ſelfe, &amp; brought
forth a voluntary harueſt
to feede vs: but now all
our labour is for food &amp;
cloathing (as the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
tells vs in his Prouerbes)
our nakedneſſe was then
our glory, it is now our
ſhame: it was a curſe to
till the earth then, it is
now a bleſſing to haue
earth to till: ſo that wee
haue learnt to turne by
the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our apparell that
ſhould couer our ſhame,
to proclaime our pride:
&amp; our Lands that ſhould
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:18185:151"/>
feede vs by our labour, to
the food of our luxurie:
In a word, Religion was
once the Lord of our
Reaſon, and our Reaſon
the directer of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
and our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
the guider of our

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the affections
(which the Philoſopher
calls <hi>materiall reaſons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by them the ſoule
rules our body) the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of our bodies,
and our bodies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers
of our deſires and
luſts: but now Luſt hath
ſnatched the reynes into
his owne blinde gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:18185:151"/>
and madde with
<hi>Iehu,</hi> driues on the body,
and the body the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and they the wil, and
that the vnderſtanding to
all vnreaſonable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
exceſſes: ſo that
poore Reaſon carried
headlong to the ruine of
it ſelfe, ſits like a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner,
or rather like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<hi>Hupolitus</hi> without

by his wilde horſes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoeuer they pleaſe:
<q>

And from this diſorder
of mans nature comes it
to paſſe, that in the yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fruits of the earth
which wicked men reape,
all the paines of Nature
ſerue them only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Gods honour in ſparing

ſet vp his ſayles for
<hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> thinking moſt
fooliſhly to flie him that

God had ſoone ſent his

him thither, whither hee
denied to goe, and when
they were not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but hee choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to be thought, though

GOD had prouided a

thou the vocation God

               <p>Onely take heed that
it be a lawfull, profitable,

ſome there are, like the
ſmoothe-tongued Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in the Comedie, that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:18185:155"/>
get their liuing by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and lying lips, that
traffique with their tungs
for their belly in ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their whole liues to
finde out merry tales and
beyond-Sea newes to
feede his eares that feeds
them; and theſe with their
Attique dialects doe ſo
fleeke and ſmooth him vp
they liue vpon, that they
make the rich foole halfe
beſides himſelfe with an
opinion of his ſingular
goodneſſe, and rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and ſo continue to
blanch his fowle life ſpent
in riot and gaming, and
prodigious luxury, till
they haue made him as
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18185:156"/>
poore in his eſtate at
length, as before hee was
proud in his expence, and
ſuch harlotrie the young
prodigall in the Goſpell
met with; but ſuch cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
are neither lawfull
for him that liues by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
nor profitable for him
that is fed vpon, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
before God or men.
And therefore theſe <hi>voces
ad placitum,</hi> that were all
borne in the Familie of
<hi>Gnatho</hi> muſt take heede

Others ſpend their liues

before God iuſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Such was the Trade
of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Siluer-Smith,
in the 19. of the

ſhrines for the worſhip
of the goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi>

ſuch are all thoſe curious

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18185:177"/>
here both Gods words
are met together. The
dead word hath met
with the liuing, the old
Teſtament kiſſes the
New, &amp; either to other,
one by fore-telling, the
other by fulfilling giue
mutuall witneſſe of their
irrepugnable Truthes.
Since therefore there is
ſo great vnitie in the
words, and the Prophets
are all ioyned in one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
&amp; Chriſt to whom
they witneſſe is vndiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I induſtriouſly ſpare
to make any diuiſion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I will ſet this one truth
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18185:178"/>
in the Light. <hi>That Chriſt
is the Center to whom all of
them ſtanding round about
him as a compaſſing clowd
of witneſſes, draw all the

then briefly gather ſuch
Inſtructions as ſhall bee

               <p>Wee might ſee this

by the laſt of the

4.</hi> and 5. chapters, where
in the midſt of 4. Beaſts,
and 24. Elders, a glorious
Lambe ſtandeth, and
ſends forth the 7. Spirits
of God into al the Earth.
That Chriſt is the Lamb
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18185:178"/>
himſelfe the Paſſeouer of
the Iewes wil tell vs. And
that the foure Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
are the foure beaſts,
their euen number; and
their ſtanding neereſt the
Throne; as waiting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
on the Lambe
of God our Sauior, and
the ſtrict keeping of <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
in figuring them like
beaſts, ſuch as the Lamb
himſelfe is, ſufficiently
proues. And doubtleſſe
the 24. Elders can be no
other then the 24. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of the Olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both becauſe they
are called Elders; being
more ancient then the
foure Euangeliſts, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:18185:179"/>
ſtand in a greater diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
&amp; farther off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt,
their number being iuſt
the very ſame as S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
obſerues: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as themſelues ſing
to their golden Harpes,
the Lambe had made
them Kings in matters of
Life, &amp; Prieſts in Points
of Doctrine to rule the
Earth, hauing before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God by his

to the ſtedfaſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
but onely to ſuch
who had beene yong ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
before they became
ſaintly Elders. And to
conclude, the ſeuen ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
ſent forth into all the

Earth, muſt needs be the
ſeuen gifts of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

Miracles, Guifts of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
Helps in gouernment,
Diuerſities of tongues,</hi>
which are therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the
very ſame place ſeauen
Lamps, and the ſeauen
hornes and eyes of the
Lambe; becauſe by them
Chriſt giues Light to his
Church, and exerciſeth a
viſible power in all the

               <p>And heere wee ſee all
our Sauiours witneſſes

twenty fower Prophets
hold out the firſt Lights
to diſcouer the Lamb of
God, &amp; leaſt they ſhould
be obſcure, the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
ſets the truth of the
ſtory by the wordes of
their Prophecie; and that
Chriſts Church may ſee
this truth, Chriſt ſends
out into the whole earth,
theſe ſeauen guifts of his
Spirit, as Lamps to giue
Light both to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles: So
that if any Spirit of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt

Catholique Church any
other witneſſes, or blinde
Light of gouernment,
&amp; interpretation beſides
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18185:180"/>
theſe, or think that Chriſt
ſent his ſeuen ſpirits forth
into Rome, &amp; not forth
into the whole earth, it is
to be held a Spirit of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,

               <p>But our Sauiour as he

had two Meſſengers. <hi>Iohn</hi>
was a burning &amp; ſhining
Light on Earth, but the
Starre burned, &amp; ſhined
to giue him Light from
Heauen. <hi>A Starre ſhall
come out of Iacob,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laam,
Num. 24. 17. Where

ſaies the Wiſe men, <hi>for
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18185:185"/>
we haue ſeene his ſtarre, &amp;

Mat. 2. 2.</hi> And this is the
heathen mans argument,

               <p>Now if we ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,

it led the Wiſe men
after it had brought them
out of their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
was it not in the
time of the firſt <hi>Herod,
Luke 3. 1.</hi> when the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>Iudah? Gen. 49. 10. And
the Land was forſaken of

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:18185:185"/>
And this was olde <hi>Iacobs</hi>
argument to proue <hi>Iudahs</hi>
ſonne the Meſſias. <hi>The
Scepter ſhal not depart from
Iudah, till Shiloh,</hi> that is,
his <hi>Sonne come.</hi> And went
it not with them directly
to a little <hi>Bethleem?</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by <hi>Micah</hi> the 5. the 2.
and in the 2. and 5. of
<hi>Mathew</hi> interpreted by
the chiefe Prieſts and
Scribes, and people, all
gathered together at the
commmand of <hi>Herod</hi> to
this very purpoſe, who
making this quiry, <hi>Where
Chriſt ſtould be borne?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
this anſwere: <hi>In
Bethleem of Iudah. And
thou Bethleem art not the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:18185:186"/>
leaſt among the Princes of
Iudah: for out of thee ſhall
come the Gouernour that
ſhall rule my people Iſraell.</hi>
And this was the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all our Sauiours
enemies met together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him: <hi>Herods,</hi> the
chiefe Prieſts, the Scribes
and the Peoples to proue
him the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>Wee might now take
our Sauiour out of the
Cradle of his birth, and
looke vpon him in the
Miracles, Offices, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Humanity of
his Life: all which wee

not onely by the

arreſted by the Peoples &amp;

looking for the glory of a

hating the ſhame of the

knowing God to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18185:187"/>
and therefore
mocking the Chriſtians
God by calling him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the Crucified
God: let vs ſee whether
our Sauiour may not ſay
to theſe two Naturalls,
what hee ſometimes said
to his owne diſciples tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling
to <hi>Emaus,</hi> who at
that time were iuſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion'd
in euery point like
vnto. For firſt, they
dream'd of a temporall
Redemption. Secondly,
when they ſaw our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
condemned and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
they concluded, it
could not be hee that
ſhould redeeme Iſraell.
Thirdly, they talked of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:18185:187"/>
Chriſt, as of one dead &amp;
crucified, when hee wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
into the middeſt of
them: and when hee tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to them out of his
word, their eies were held
(as theſe mens are) that
they know him not. And
therefore well may our
Sauiour now ſay to theſe
as hee did then to them.
<hi>O fooles and ſlow of heart,
to beleeue all that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
haue ſpoken: Ought
not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe
things, and to enter into
glory?</hi> Yes aſſuredly, if
with our Lord we ſhould
begin from <hi>Moſes</hi> (who
ſpilt the typicall bloud of
our Sauiour in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:18185:188"/>
Lambe, and in all
his bloudy Sacrifices) &amp;
goe through all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
we ſhall find none
more punctually leuelled
at him, or more cloſely
touching him to the
quicke, then thoſe of his
Paſſion.</p>
               <p>If GOD bee to ſmite
him, <hi>Zachary</hi> will foretell
it, <hi>Awake, O Sword, againſt
my Shepheard, and againſt
the man that is my fellow,
ſaith the Lord of Hoaſtes,
Zachar. 13. 7.</hi> If at this
firſt blow of God, his
Diſciples proue all fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
the ſame Prophet
in the ſame place foretels
it. <hi>Smite the Shepheard
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:18185:188"/>
and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>
And this was our
Sauiours owne argument
to proue himſelfe the true
Shepheard, and them his
little, and fearefull flocke.
If the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> people and
the heathen Soldiers, if
the Kings of the earth,
&amp; the rulers of the <hi>Iewiſh</hi>
Synagogue gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
together againſt
him, as at his death they
did, and for many yeares
after: <hi>Dauid</hi> will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
it: <hi>Why did the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
rage, and the people
imagine vaine things?
The Kings of the earth
ſtood vp, and the Rulers
were gathered together
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18185:189"/>
againſt the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Chriſt. And
this was the argument
of the whole Primitiue
Church met together in
Prayer. <hi>Acts. 4. 27.</hi> If
wee would know who
ſhould betray him, <hi>Dauid</hi>
tells vs. <hi>Hee that eates
bread with me. And when
he had dipped the ſop, hee
gaue it to Iudas Iſcariot.</hi>
Sayes the beloued diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>Ioh. 13. 26.</hi> And
this was <hi>Iudas</hi> his ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Argument to proue
our Sauiour the Sonne
of God, and himſelfe the
ſonne of perdition. If we
would know the price of
his treaſon <hi>Zachary</hi> ſets it
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:18185:189"/>
downe. <hi>They weighed for
my price thirty pieces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and I caſt them to the
Potter in the houſe of the
Lord: Zach. 11. 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the time of death be
doubted <hi>Dauid</hi> will fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
vs, in the 9. Chapter
and 5. laſt verſes of his
Propheſie, where hee

that is 49. yeares,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18185:190"/>
were to be accompliſht
before the building of the

that is 434. yeares before
the Annoynting of the

was ended, when the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens

whoſe wings were ſiluer,

finde exactly fulfilled in

Prophet of his death, and
the meſſenger of his

               <p>But if we would ſee the

backe ſhould be beaten
with ſtripes, and his
cheekes buffeted, <hi>Eſay</hi>
will ſet him before our

his fifty and two and fifty
Chapters. His viſage
ſhall be more deform'd
then any mans (ſayes the
Prophets) his forme more
then the Sonnes of men:
<hi>I gaue my backe to the

them that pluck't of the

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18185:192"/>
of it vpon the Croſſe, ſo
that his bones ſhould be
diſioynted, and might all
be tould: if his handes,
&amp; feete were to be nayl'd
to it: if the people that
paſt by ſhould wagge
their heads at him, and
the Prieſts ſhould mock
him and ſay he truſted in
God let him deliuer him,
if he will haue him; if the
Soldiers ſhould caſt lotts
for his Garments, and the
ſtanders by ſhould giue
them vineger to drinke,
all this will <hi>Dauid</hi> moſt
heauily ſing in the 22. and

All my bones are out of

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18185:192"/>
and my feete,</hi> I <hi>may tell all
my bones. They that paſſe

ſaying. He truſted in God,
let him deliuer him if he will
haue him. I was a thirſt,
and they gaue me vineger

preciſely ſayes aſmuch in

<hi>For the tranſgreſſion of my

But if any would lay

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:18185:205"/>
word in the earth ſhould
be more certaine, then
word of God immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeaking to him from
heauen? Certes, not in
regard of the ſubſtance of
the thing deliuered. For
ſo both the word of God
immediatly framed by
himſelfe, &amp; ſpoken from
heauen, or vttered by the
mouth of his Prophet, is
all one, and hath the very
ſame identiall certaintie:
but both in regard of the
manner of deliuery, the
Propheſies are more ſure,
becauſe they are larger,
and more copiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſitiue
of themſelues, in
caſe of doubts emergent,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:18185:206"/>
God ſpeaking but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
by a voyce imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
framed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but ſpeaking by his
Prophets from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world to
the end of it, which are
therefore interpretatiue
of themſelues: and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in regard of vs, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the voyce of God
immediately ſpeaking
from heauen to vs, is
more aſtoniſhing and
leſſe inſtructiue then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
it would be. So
we ſee the Children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God ſpake
from heauen to them,
<hi>Exodus 20. 18. 19.</hi> ſhaken
into ſuch an Ague of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:18185:206"/>
feare and trembling (as
<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe was, <hi>Heb.
12. 21.)</hi> that they ſtarted
backe, and ſtoode a farre
off, and cryed to <hi>Moſes.
O let not God ſpeake anie
more vnto vs, leſt wee die.</hi>
Which naturall feare
God does not onely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but approue, and
therefore ſtooping to
their nature, and laying
aſide his owne Maieſtie,
wee ſhall ſee in the 18. of
<hi>Deuter. 16.</hi> verſe, what he
ſayes to them, and by
whoſe mouth hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to ſpeake to vs. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to all that thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the Lord thy God in
Horeb, in the day of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18185:207"/>
ſaying, Let me not
heare againe the voice of the
Lord my GOD, neither let
me ſee this great fire any
more, that I die not. And
the Lord ſayd vnto me, they
haue well ſpoken in all that
they haue ſaid, I will raiſe
them vp a Prophet from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
their Brethren, like
vnto thee, and will put my
words in his mouth, him
ſhall they heare, &amp;c.</hi> Thus
when the Greeks came to
ſee our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn 12.
21.</hi> and God gaue a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſticall
witneſſe to him
from heauen: they were
all ſo horrowed with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
amaſe and affright,
that ſome thought it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:18185:207"/>
thundred; others, that an
Angel ſpake from heauen
to him: but what was
ſayd, none of them all
knew. And thus our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
heere himſelfe was
for the time that GOD
ſpake in Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi>
ſtrucke halfe beſide his
vnderſtanding with feare
and aſtoniſhment. <hi>Matth,
17. 6.</hi> and talked himſelfe
hee knew not what. <hi>Luke
9. 33.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee therefore, how
ſtrongly the Rocke of our
ſaluation, Chriſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone
is layd by the
Prophets, in the Church
of God, and how migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily

how the liuing ſhould be

               <p>It was <hi>Eliahs</hi> ſpeech

thou art Gods Enimie,
thou art the enimie of his

feede his flocke, feede his

If thou diddeſt loue his

ſhew thy loue by thy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

euery one eleuen
moneths reſidence vpon
his cure, and graunts him
but one months abſence,
whereas it is a venture,
but without long ſearch
you may finde one that
abſents himſelfe eleauen
moneths, and is reſident
but once a yeare, and that
is perhaps at harueſt, or
peraduenture at Eaſter,
when his owne, and not
ſo much the Churches
profit calles him to his

He would being reſident
preach euery Sunday, as
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:18185:214"/>
ſhee commaunds him, in
her 45. Cannon. Hee
would labour to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince
Heretiques, (which now

Canons. He would keepe
the ſound in ſafety, and
viſit the ſicke, as ſhee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects

Thus he would do,
and not laugh at them
that did thus, and would
haue him doe ſo, as men
more preciſe, than wiſe,
of more heate than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
I am not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate,

               <p>A double wound it is

with kniues of ſtone,
moſt elogantly ſpeaketh
of him. <hi>Mathew</hi> was a
Publican, but to gather
the precious ſoules of
men into the Heauenlie
Treaſury of the King of
Kings. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a
Tent-maker, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<hi>Iaphet</hi> to dwell in
the Tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> and to
ſpread Chriſts Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
all the world ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles. But
in the great day of their
Reckoning, when the
Diſciples of our Lord
ſhall bring in their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comps,
and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall
ſay, <hi>I haue gathered to the
faith,</hi> all the Riches of the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:18185:220"/>
Gentiles; and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
I haue gained all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of <hi>India;</hi> and S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
I haue gathered the

And therefore as the

               <p>Pardon mee (right
deerely beloued in our
Lord and Sauiour) if
when Thorns &amp; Thiftles
grow vpon Gods Altar,
as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>
ſpeakes, I am forced to

there is ſuch a neceſſity

O that it might alwaies

<hi>Melchiſedcks</hi> Tithes, the

as it is verilie
thought, the Church
within theſe threeſcore
yeres, by concealements,
incroachments, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary
thefts, hath been
ſpoyled of no leſſe then
40000. yearely. What
hope can there be of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the Prophets,
when the inſufficiency of
their meanes will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
it? when one Subiect
into whoſe cofers 20000
pounds: when a Lay Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:18185:221"/>
into whoſe Cofers
20000. pounds annually
flow in, and therefore if
he were but a Phariſee in
profeſſion, ſhould out of
his aboundant ſtreames
of wealth, caſt in much
into the common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of the Church, ſhall
taken into his owne poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
fifteeene houſes of
God, and ſticke downe
but the bare feathers of
ten pounds or twenty
Nobles a yeere for the
needy ſeruice of Gods
Altar? Can all the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing

wits in the world, if they
were headed in one
braine, ſhew by what iuſt
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:18185:222"/>
right a Laye hand can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade

he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thoſe that
wait vpon his Altar for
the food of their bodies,
and the poore people
change with vs for the
foode of their ſoules? Is
not this the reaſon why
in the great harueſt there
are ſo few Laboures. For
the Pſalmiſt had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſaid, <hi>They haue ſent
fire into thy Sanctuary</hi>
(meaning perhaps the fire

                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:18185:222"/>
but preſently it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>There is no more
any Prophet, neither is

               </p>
               <p>But GOD perſwade
thoſe whom it moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes,
to regard in time
