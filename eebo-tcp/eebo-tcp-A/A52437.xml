            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Esteem, wherewith your Ladyship honour'd my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer writings, has at once <hi>obliged</hi> me to an high measure of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and <hi>pointed</hi> me out a way of <hi>shewing</hi> it. For I was hence led to conclude, that if any thing of Mine could afford you Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Entertainment, when you had no other interest in it than in
<pb facs="tcp:60271:3"/>
the <hi>Common</hi> light of the Sun, much more would it be acceptable, if made yours by some <hi>peculiar</hi> Right and Property. The difference of advantage seeming to me much the same, as between taking a turn in a <hi>Common walk,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Retirements of one's <hi>own Private Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One only Objection stood in my way. I was a little scrupulous whether the <hi>Oblation</hi> were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the <hi>Altar,</hi> whether so mean a Performance could <hi>Strike</hi> the <hi>Tast,</hi> much more <hi>deserve</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage</hi> of a Person of such nice and refined Sense, and whom <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and your own <hi>unassisted Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity</hi> have Conspired to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish beyond what the <hi>Present Age</hi>

can <hi>parallel,</hi> Or (unless your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship will be perswaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath some Monument of your extraordinary Genius to the world) the <hi>Future</hi> will ever <hi>believe.</hi> This Consideration I confess, did a little <hi>arrest</hi> my Pen, till I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted it with another, that your Ladyship is as Eminent for Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and goodness, as for Parts and Ingenious Attainments, and that you have Mildness and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness enough to temper the <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> even of your <hi>own Iudgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Madam, were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations that embolden'd me to entitle your Ladyship to this work. Concerning which (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faults it may be charged with) I have something to boast,

which I am sure all writers have not, that I make an Offering of that which is purely my <hi>Own.</hi> Which if your Ladyship please to accept, there will be much added both to the <hi>Happiness</hi> and to the <hi>Duty</hi> of</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>HAving accounted in the first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the general <hi>Design</hi> of this undertaking, I have here no more to do than only to prepare the Reader, by giving him some few Advertisements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Manner</hi> of its <hi>Performance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first place, <hi>I make no Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies;</hi> For I would not have exposed these Papers to the view of the world if I thought they needed any. Neither do I desire any Favour or kind allowances from my Reader, I only desire that he would be so <hi>kind</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> and so <hi>just</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> as to afford me his Closest and most unprejudiced <hi>Attention,</hi> that he would suspend his Iudgment till he has gone over the whole, and that then he would <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> no farther than he <hi>Understands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:60271:5"/>This Request is at all times <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi> but now I think it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>necessary.</hi> For I have here used great <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Thinking,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly could not avoid lighting upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Notions, which are <hi>remote</hi> from common Observation, and some that are directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the Vulgar Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And these I have endeavour'd to dispose according to the greatest Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of Order and Method, and to carry on with a Thred of more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary connexion and Dependence. All which, as it requires a great deal of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Application of mind in the <hi>Composer,</hi> so does it almost as much in the <hi>Reader,</hi> who can no more expect with an hasty and careless glance to comprehend the Recesses and Retirements of a nice Speculation, than a man that rides Post can discern the artful strokes and curiosities of a fine-wrought Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Attention</hi> therefore is the thing that I do again commend to him that shall
<pb facs="tcp:60271:5"/>
find leasure to persue these Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Though for his comfort I must tell him, that I have endeavour'd to ease him of this trouble as much as I could, by expressing my Notions with all possible distinctness and Perspicuity. In order to which I found it necessary sometimes to use new Terms, and such as would raise more clear and distinct Ideas than those which had before obtain'd, which I hope will easily be excused by those who consider, that Words are purely in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Thoughts, and would therefore ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>think rightly,</hi> than <hi>Speak Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this I was the more necessitated to do, by reason of the <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> of my Design. For I must fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther observe to the Reader, that this way of writing <hi>Ethics</hi> is intirely New and unblown upon. For though the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Vertue and Vice to the various Modification of Love be Obvious enough to any one that will consider, yet I do not know of any Moralist that ever drew
<pb facs="tcp:60271:6"/>
up a Scheme of Morality upon this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope the Reader will find it here done to his satisfaction, though I must tell him that I do not descend to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular consideration of Virtues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it being not my Design to insist mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely upon Particulars, but only to lay down such general Principles upon which a more Particular Scheme of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be <hi>erected,</hi> or into which those Particular Morals which are already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant may and ought to be ultimately <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole I have endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize within as little Room as may be. I have set my self this Law, to write nothing but what is directly and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly</hi> to the Point in hand, and to express what is so in as few words as I could with <hi>perspicuity.</hi> For I think it the Perfection of <hi>Discourse</hi> to come as nigh <hi>Intuition</hi> as may be, and that none are so far removed from the Measures of <hi>Angels,</hi> as prolix and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
<pb facs="tcp:60271:6"/>
writers. It would have been more for my own ease to have been <hi>lax and Popular,</hi> but I thought it of more concern to consult the <hi>Patience,</hi> the <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Purse</hi> of the Reader.</p>

                     <head>SECT. I. The general designe of this undertaking, and its great usefullness to the whole drift of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 THE Subject of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations is <hi>Love.</hi> A thing that has employ'd many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pens to little purpose, and has been perhaps the <hi>most</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the <hi>worst</hi> written upon of any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the world. 'Tis I confess, strange that men should <hi>write</hi> so darkly and Confusedly of that which they <hi>feel</hi> and experiment so intimately, but I must take the boldness to say that what I have hitherto seen upon this Subject,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60271:9"/>
has been so Confused, ambiguous and indistinct, that I was thereby rather <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,</hi> than <hi>inform'd</hi> in my Notions concerning it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Finding therefore no Satisfaction in advising with <hi>Books,</hi> I was fain to shut my Eyes and set my self a <hi>Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> without having any regard to what others had observ'd upon the same matter, so as to be in the least sway'd or determin'd in my Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by it. A method that would tend more to the discovery of <hi>Truth,</hi> and to the Advancement of all <hi>Notional Learning,</hi> than that narrow straitlaced humour of adhering to the Dictates of those, who have nothing more to recommend them, but only the <hi>luck</hi> of being <hi>born</hi> before us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 My design therefore here is to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Meditations about two things, 1<hi>st.</hi> the <hi>Theory</hi> of Love according to its full Latitude and Comprehension, and 2<hi>ly.</hi> the <hi>Measures</hi> of its <hi>Regulation.</hi> The discharge of which double under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60271:9"/>
will thoroughly exhaust the Subject, and answer the Ends both of <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Practise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 I think it requisite to begin with the <hi>Theory</hi> of Love. For since the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian</hi> thinks it necessary to know the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of that Body which he is to <hi>Cure,</hi> and the <hi>Logician</hi> to open the nature of those Intellectual operations which he is to <hi>direct,</hi> I know not why the <hi>Moralist</hi> should not think himself equally concern'd to frame a just <hi>Theory</hi> of that Affection of the Soul which he is to <hi>regulate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 The whole work I conceive to be of great usefulness and general impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all the purposes of Morality, nay indeed to contain the whole Sum and Substance of it. For what is the grand intendment and final upshot of Morality but to teach a man to <hi>Love regularly</hi>? As a man <hi>Loves</hi> so is he. Love is not only the <hi>Fulfilling,</hi> but also the <hi>Transgressing</hi> of the Law, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Vice is nothing else but the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60271:10"/>
Various Application and Modification of <hi>Love.</hi> By this a Good man is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd from a bad, and an Angel of Light from an Angel of Darkness. This is that which discriminates the Orders of men here, and will consign us to different Portions hereafter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>St. Austin</hi> Faciunt Civitates duas Amores duo. Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem facit Amor Dei: Babylonem A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor Saeculi. Interroget ergo se quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quid Amet, &amp; inveniet unde sit Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis. <hi>The two Loves make the two Cittys. The Love of God makes Hierusalem, the Love of the World Babylon. Let every one therefore ask himself what 'tis he Loves,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De. Civ. Dei l. 14. Cap. 28. Tom. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>and he will find to which Citty he belongs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 He therefore that shall rightly state the Nature, and prescribe due Measures for the Regulation of Love, not only serves the Cause of Morality, but may be truely sayd to discharge the whole Province of a Moralist; This I take to be a Sufficient Apology

for the <hi>undertaking</hi> it self, and if the <hi>Performance</hi> come up to the Moment of the Design (whereof the world is to judge) I know of nothing wanting to render it both <hi>Serviceable</hi> and <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to the Public.</p>

                        </gap> or word, and the other by way of <hi>Love</hi> which is the <hi>H. Spirit,</hi> so likewise in the Humane nature there are as it were two <hi>Processions,</hi> and that of the same kind too as in the Divine, <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60271:11"/>2 These are the two Noble Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys that branche out from the Soul of man, and whereby he becomes a little <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And altho' we generally value our Selves most upon the <hi>Former</hi>; yet I know not whether there be not an Equality in <hi>these</hi> as there is in the <hi>Divine</hi> Processions, and whether it be not as much the Glory of man to be an <hi>Amorous,</hi> as to be a <hi>Rational</hi> Being.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Sure I am that in the Gentile Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and in the most refined Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Ancients the preheminence is given to <hi>Love. Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plato's Symposion</hi> says Concerning Love, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and most honorable of the Gods.</hi> And we know Love is made the first Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis in the Platonic Triad. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture goes yet higher, and does not only in several places set forth Love as the <hi>Flower</hi> of the Divinity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify the Divine Essence chiefly from that Excellence, but seems to resolve
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60271:12"/>
all the Perfection of the Deity into this <hi>one Point.</hi> For when it defines God it does not say he is <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> no not so much as <hi>Wise</hi> or <hi>Powerfull,</hi> but seems to overlook all his other Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and says in the Abstract that he is <hi>Love.</hi> They are great words of <hi>St. Iohn,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1.4.16.</note> and such as make much for the great Dignity of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Affection, <hi>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God.</hi> So No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing is Love, and so deserving of our most intense Theory and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And indeed it <hi>needs</hi> it, as well as <hi>deserves</hi> it. For there is nothing that darken's the Nature of things, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scures the Clarity of our Conceptions more than Ambiguity of Terms, and I know nothing that is more Equivocal and full of Latitude than this word, <hi>Love.</hi> It is given to things whose Ideas are Notoriously different, and men seem to have agreed together not to detect the Fallacy, and from the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60271:12"/>
of the <hi>name</hi> to conclude the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>thing.</hi> To give one instance out of many, what is there that passes for an Axiom of a more simple, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and uniform Signification than that Common Proposition in Divinity, that <hi>we must love God for himself, and our Neighbor for God's sake.</hi> But now when we come to examin what Ideas we have under these words, 'tis plain that that Idea which is express'd by Love in the first part of the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not the same with that which is express'd by Love in the Second. For Love in reference to God Signifys <hi>Simple Desire,</hi> and in reference to our Neighbor, <hi>wishing well to,</hi> which Ideas are as different as East and West, and yet because of the Commonnes of the Name, and the Jingling turn of the Proposition, this passes smoothly and unquestionably for one and the same Love.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 But tho' this word Love be used to signify Ideas so very different that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60271:13"/>
they seem to have nothing in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon but the Name, yet I think there is one thing wherein they all agree and whereof they all partake, and which may therefore be acknowledg'd as the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Transcendental</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love. And that is, <hi>A motion of the Soul towards good.</hi> This I say is the first and most general Notion of Love, and which runs throughout all the Species of it. But then this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes two things. For as in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodys we first Conceive <hi>Gravity</hi> or a Connaturality to a certain Term of motion, and then the motion it self which is consequent upon it, so also in Love (which is the motion of the Soul) order requires that we first conceive a certain Connaturality or Coaptation of the Soul to good, whence arises all the variety of its <hi>actual</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and tendencys toward it. This I take to be that peculiar Habitude of the Soul to good which the Schools call Complacentia boni <hi>a Complacence, a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60271:13"/>
Liking</hi> or <hi>Relish</hi> of good, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider as really distinct from and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to its actual motion towards it. For as 'tis observ'd by <hi>Aristotle</hi> with more than Ordinary Nicenes in his 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                        <hi>de Anima</hi>; The motion of Love is in a <hi>Circle.</hi> First good moves and acts upon the Soul, and then the Soul moves and exerts it self towards good, that so <hi>there</hi> may be the <hi>End</hi> whence was the <hi>Rise</hi> of its motion. This first Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Soul from good answers to <hi>Gravity</hi> in <hi>Bodys,</hi> and may be call'd for distinction sake the <hi>Moral Gravity of the Soul,</hi> the Second to <hi>Gravitation</hi> or actual Pressure, and may as fitly be call'd <hi>the Moral Gravitation of the Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 I further Consider that this <hi>Moral Gravity</hi> is impress'd upon the Soul pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and Originally by <hi>good</hi> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> or by the universal good or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of good, that is, by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who is the Sum and Abstract of all goodness, and the Centre of all Love. So that this <hi>Moral Gravity</hi> of the Soul
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60271:14"/>
will be its <hi>Connaturality</hi> to all good, or good in general, that is, to God as its primary and adequate object, and to particular goods only so far as they have somthing of the Common Nature of good, something of God in them. Whence it will also follow that the <hi>Moral Gravitation</hi> of the Soul does Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and Necessarily respect good in Common or God as the Term of its motion and Tendency. So that upon the whole to speak more <hi>explicitly</hi> the most general and Comprehensive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love will be found to be, <hi>A Motion of the Soul towards God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7 But now in this motion there is great difference. For God having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded his Perfections in the Creation with almost infinite Variety, and as it were drawn out himself into a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous issue of <hi>Secondary</hi> goods, our Love becomes also Multiplied, and divides its cours among several Chanels, and tho' after all its turnings and windings we may at last trace it up to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="8">8 Nor does our Love receive lesse variety and diversity from the <hi>manner</hi> of its Motion or Tendency, Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Specify'd from the <hi>manner</hi> of it as well as from its <hi>Term.</hi> And it may be also lastly diversify'd according to the nature of the <hi>Part</hi> moved, whether it be the Superiour or the Inferiour part of the Soul. From these three, the <hi>Term</hi> of Motion, the <hi>manner</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the nature of the <hi>part</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, arise all the different kinds of Love, such as Divine and Worldly, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60271:15"/>
and Carnal, Charity and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Love of Concupisccnce and Love of Benevolence, Intellectual and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, Natural, Animal and Rational Love, with several others which I shall not stand to enumerate.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 But notwithstanding this variety I believe all will be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these two in general, <hi>Concupiscence</hi> and <hi>Benevolence.</hi> This I take to be the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Division of Love, to which all the several kinds of it may be aptly reduced. For when I Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Motion of Love, I find it tends to two things, namely to the good which a man wills to any one, whether it be to himself or to another, and to him to whom this good is will'd. So that the Motion of Love may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd either barely as a <hi>Tendency</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards good, or as a <hi>willing</hi> this good to some person or Being. If it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in the first way, then 'tis what we call <hi>Concupiscence</hi> or <hi>Desire,</hi> if in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, then 'tis what we call <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60271:15"/>10 For there is the same Proportion in <hi>Love</hi> that there is in <hi>Hatred,</hi> which also involves a <hi>double Motion.</hi> Either a declining or tending from evill, which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Latins Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, in our own language Aversion or Abhorrence, or else a willing evil to some person or other, which we call <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Malevolence.</hi> Concupiscence or Desire answers to the former of these, and Benevolence or Charity to the Latter.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 There is indeed this difference to be observ'd between the Motions of Love and the Motions of Hatred, that those of Hatred are not <hi>necessarily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant.</hi> For there may be a simple Aversion without any Malice or wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill to, tho' perhaps the latter can hardly be conceiv'd without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But now in Love these Motions are always concomitant and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. There is no <hi>Desire</hi> without <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,</hi> and no <hi>Benevolence</hi> without <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</hi> For every thing that is desired is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60271:16"/>
desired to some body, and so again, desiring to some body implies and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses <hi>simple</hi> Desire. And this I suppose has been the occasion of that great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion which has been generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd in this matter, men being very apt from <hi>union</hi> and <hi>Concomitancy</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>indistinction</hi> and <hi>Identity.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Connexion, the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Desire and Benevolence are very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, as will easily and Clearly appear to any close and attentive Thinker.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 HAving in the foregoing Section fix'd the general Idea of Love in the <hi>Motion</hi> of the Soul towards <hi>good,</hi> and this being a Term somwhat Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical, and withall not so often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Scholastic Writers to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I thought it concern'd me to draw here a short Parallel between <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Physical Motion,</hi> and to shew the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Agreement and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that is between them: whereby 'twill appear that the general Idea of Love could not have had a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Representation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The excellent <hi>Monsieur Malebran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> undertaking to describe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60271:17"/>
of the Mind, and considering its I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea to be very abstract, and such as did not fall within the Sphere of Imagination,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. De In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirendâ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate. p. 2.</note> thought it best to Shadow it forth by the two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Propertys of matter, <hi>viz.</hi> that of receiving various <hi>Figures,</hi> and that of <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Mobility.</hi> To the Property of receiving various Figures he resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that Faculty of the mind which we call <hi>understanding.</hi> And to Motion or Mobility he liken's the <hi>Will.</hi> The first of these Parallels he persues and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrates in many Particulars, but when he comes to the last he gives only this one instance of resemblance, that as all Motions Naturally proceed in a right line, unless by the interposition of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and particular causes they are otherwise determin'd, so all the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which we have receiv'd from God, are <hi>Right,</hi> and would tend only to the true good, were they not turn'd aside to ill ends by the impulse of some <hi>forreign</hi> cause.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60271:17"/>3 This indeed is finely observ'd by this Ingenious and Learned <hi>Theorist,</hi> but for an inlargement of the Parallel I consider further, that as in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodys <hi>Gravity</hi> precedes <hi>Actual Gravitation,</hi> that is, we necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a certain Congruity or Conna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turality of a Body to a certain Term before its actual Tendency thither, so in the Soul there is a Natural <hi>Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> or liking of good, before its <hi>actual exerting</hi> it self towards it, for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing but what we like or relish as convenient and agreeable to us. But this I have touch'd upon already, and shall therefore no longer insist upon it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Further therefore, as this Affection call'd <hi>Gravity</hi> in Bodys, is nothing else but that <hi>first impression</hi> or alteration made upon them by the various actings of those Effluviums or streames of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which issue out from the womb of the great Magnet, the <hi>Earth,</hi> so that if there were either no such Magnetic Body, or a Vacuum to intercept its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60271:18"/>
there would be no such thing as Gravity; so in the like manner this radical <hi>Complacency</hi> and Connaturality of the Soul towards good (which I call her <hi>Moral Gravity</hi>) is nothing else but that first Alteration or Impression which is made upon her by the stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences of the Great and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magnet, <hi>God,</hi> continually acting upon her, and attracting her by his active and powerfull Charms. So that if either there were no God, or this his influence never so little a while inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, there would be no such thing as this Complacency or <hi>Moral Gravity</hi> of the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Again, as this Physical Gravity causes in Bodys an actual Effort or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency toward the Centre, and that with such necessity that they cannot but tend thither even while violently detain'd, and when at liberty hasten with all possible speed to this last Term of their Motion, so by Vertue of this Moral Gravity the Soul actually puts
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60271:18"/>
forth and exerts her self towards the <hi>great Magnet,</hi> good in general or God, and that with as much necessity as a stone falls downwards. And tho' de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd violently by the interposition of her Body, yet still she endeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her Centre, and is no sooner set at liberty but she hastens away to it and unites her self with it. For the will notwithstanding all her Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dominion acts according to Nature and Necessity when she tends to her Perfection. Nay I take this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to be such, that I think it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Impossible for God to Create a Soul without this Tendency to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that not only because 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Order and Decorum that he should do so, but also because this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gravity of the Soul whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all her actual Tendencys, is caused by the continual acting of God upon her by this attractive and Magnetic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. For God is the first Mover in Moral as well as in Natural Motions,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60271:19"/>
and whatever he moves he moves to himself.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Again I consider, that as the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation</hi> or <hi>actual endeavour</hi> of Bodys towards the Centre is always alike and uniform however their <hi>real Progress</hi> may be <hi>hinder'd</hi> or the swiftness of it <hi>resisted</hi> by accidental Letts and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, so is this Moral Gravitation or actual indeavour of the Soul towards good in general or God always equal and uniform (for a man does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be Happy more at one time than at another as I have elsewhere shewn) I say this endeavour of the Soul towards good is always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,<note place="margin">Contemp. and Love. p. 296.</note> however her real advancing to it be hinder'd or resisted by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Again I consider, that as Natural Motion is a Tendency or Translation of a Body from an undue and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous place to a place of Rest and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence, whereby it acquires as it were a <hi>new Form</hi> of Perfection, so Love
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60271:19"/>
is <hi>Extatical,</hi> and carries a man out from himself as insufficient to be his own good towards good without him, which by union he endeavours to make his <hi>own,</hi> and so to <hi>better</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> his Being, till at length his Desire be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up in the Fruition of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal good, and <hi>Motion</hi> be exchanged for <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Acquiescence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8 This Parallel between <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> in general might be carried on much further, but besides that 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to leave somthing for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Reader to work out by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I have also another Parallel to make between Love and a <hi>certain Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Motion,</hi> namely that of the <hi>Heart,</hi> wherein as there is as much Harmony and Correspondency in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects, so there is this peculiar in it, that this is a Motion perform'd <hi>within</hi> a man's <hi>self,</hi> and depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>intrinsic</hi> and <hi>vital</hi> Principle as well as the other.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 First then we may Consider that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60271:20"/>
the Heart is the great Wheel of the Humane Machine, the Spring of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal and vital Motion, and the Head-fountain of Life, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> somwhere calls it, and that its Motion is the First and Leading Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, that it begins as soon as the Flame of Life is Kindled, and ends not till the <hi>vital Congruity</hi> be quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd. And thus 'tis in <hi>Love.</hi> This is the great wheel of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> frame as the other is of the <hi>Natural,</hi> this is the Spring and Ferment of the Soul, that gives her Life and Energy, and without which she would be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torpid and unactive. Love is the first and <hi>Mother</hi> Motion that both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and actuates all the rest. 'Tis from her that all the Inclinations and Passions of the Soul take their rise, and did we not first love we should neither Hope nor Fear, nor hate nor be Angry, nor Envy nor be any other way affected. Nay we Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire before we can Apprehend, Judge,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60271:20"/>
Reason or Discourse, nay our Love is then Commonly most impetuous and high-set; we love long before we know what 'tis to Love, nay before we know whether we love or no, even as soon as we receive the Breath of Life. And as 'tis the <hi>First,</hi> so it is also the <hi>Last</hi> Motion. 'Tis the <hi>Vltimum Moriens</hi> of the Intellectual, as the Heart is of the Natural Structure. This is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that out lives and sees the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all the other Operations of the Soul. For when either Age or sickness by disturbing the Crasis of the Body has also untuned and disorder'd the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultys of the Soul, when the man can no longer understand, nor Discourse, nor Remember, when all his Rational Facultys are as 'twere benumm'd and <hi>death-struck,</hi> yet still he <hi>Loves,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines towards Happiness with as much weight as ever;<note place="margin">Can.</note> 
                        <hi>for Love is strong as Death,</hi> and as Importunate as the <hi>Grave, many waters cannot quench Love, neither can the Floods drown it</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60271:21"/>10 Again we may consider, that as by the <hi>Pulsation</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial blood is transmitted to the Brain, whereby are generated those Animal Spirits which are the Instruments of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout the Body, and which very Animal Spirits do again return and assist the Motion of the Heart by Contracting its Muscular Fibres, and so straitning its Ventricles to expel the blood contain'd in them into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; the same Reciprocation may we observe in the Motion of Love. That Moral Gravity and Gravitation of the Soul impress'd on her by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Good acting attractively upon her, and whereby she stands inclined to good in general, first moves the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which as the Schools allow, is moved by the will <hi>quoad exercitium actus,</hi> tho' not <hi>quoad specificationem.</hi> And then the understanding Moves the will as to <hi>particular</hi> and actual Voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning particular Goods. For as to <hi>these</hi> we will nothing but what we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60271:21"/>
first know and judge pro hic &amp; nunc fit to be will'd. Which by the way may give great light to that intricate and perplex'd Controversy, whether the will moves the understanding or the understanding the will. For they both move one another, tho' in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent respects. Even as the Heart by its Motion sends Spirits to the Brain, and is by those very Spirits assisted in her Motion. This indeed is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful instance of Resemblance, and the more I consider it the more strange I think it, and full of Mystery.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Again as by the Continual Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation of the <hi>Pulse</hi> there is caused a Circulation of the Blood, which is expell'd out of the Heart into the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, out of these into the parts which are to be Nourish'd, from whence 'tis imbibed by the Capillary Veins, which lead it back to the Vena Cava and so into the Heart again; and same may in proportion be applied to Love. This is the <hi>Great Pulse</hi> of the <hi>Body Politic,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60271:22"/>
as the other is of the <hi>Body Natural.</hi> 'Tis Love that begets and Keeps up the great Circulation and Mutual Dependence of Society, by this Men are inclined to maintain Mutual Commerce and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with one another, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute their Benefits and Kindnesses to all the parts of the Civil Body, till at length they return again upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Reciprocation of Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12 And if we further Meditate upon the Motion of the Heart we shall find that it is not only an apt Embleme of <hi>Love in General,</hi> but that it also My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically points out to us the <hi>two great Species</hi> of Love, <hi>Concupiscence and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</hi> The Motion of the Heart we know is Double, <hi>Dilatation</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</hi> Dilatation whereby it receives blood into its Ventricles, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whereby it expels it out again. And is it not so also in this great Pulse of the Soul, <hi>Love?</hi> Is there not here also the like double Motion? For we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60271:22"/>
                        <hi>desire</hi> good, which answers to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation and immission of the Blood, and we also <hi>wish well to,</hi> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Contraction and Emission of it.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 I know not what some may think of this, and I know there are a sort of men in the world that never think themselves, and look with Scorn and Contempt upon such Notions as are not to be found out without more than Ordinary Thinking; But for my part I must needs own that I stand amazed at this wonderful Harmony and Correspondence, and that I am thereby the more Confirm'd in that Celebrated Notion of the <hi>Platonists,</hi> that as the Soul is the Image of God, so the Body is the Image of the Soul, and that this Visible and Material is but the <hi>Shadow,</hi> or (as <hi>Plotinus</hi> will have it) the <hi>Echo</hi> of the Invisible and Immaterial World.</p>

                     <head>SECT. IV. Of the First Great Branch of Love <hi>viz.</hi> Love of Concupiscence or Desire, with the several Kinds of it.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 WE have Consider'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Love in general, and have shewn it to Consist in a <hi>Motion of the Soul towards Good,</hi> whence we took occasion to represent the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy between Love and Physical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we find to be exact and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite even to Surprise and admiration; We have also discover'd the double Motion of this Mystical Pulse, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly have branch'd out Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two General Parts, Love of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and Love of Benevolence. I come now to treat of each of these severally.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And first of Love of <hi>Concupiscence</hi> or <hi>Desire.</hi> The general Idea of which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60271:23"/>
I conceive to be <hi>A simple Tendency of the Soul to good,</hi> not at all considering whether it wills it to any Person or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or no. Not that there is or can be any desire without wishing well to, (For as I observ'd before these are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inseperable Concomitants) but their Ideas being very distinct, I think I may very well abstract from the one, when my business lies only to consider the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Concerning this Love of Desire I further consider, that the Primary and Adequate object of it is the same that is of all Love, namely <hi>good in general</hi> or <hi>God.</hi> For we desire good as good, or good in Common, before we desire this or that good in particular. And when we <hi>do</hi> desire any particular good, 'tis still for the sake of the universal good whereof it partakes, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the degree of this Participation either real or apparent so we measure out and dispence our Love. So that good in general is the Primary and Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate object of Desire.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:60271:24"/>4 But now this general or universal good being variously participated by Particular Beings, hence it comes to pass that our Desire has many Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and Secondary objects, which it tends to with more or less Inclination according as the Marks and Footsteps of the universal good appear in them more or less discernable. For the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal good is so Congenial and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to the Soul as always acting upon it and attracting it to it self, that we love every thing that carries the least image or semblance of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 There is this difference only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the love of the universal, and the love of Particular goods. Our love to the universal good is Natural, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and unavoidable. We have no more Command over this love than we have over the Circulation of our Blood or the Motion of our Pulse. For God is the Centre of Spirits, as the Earth is of Bodys, and in our love of him we are as much determin'd as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60271:24"/>
Fire is to burn, or a stone to descend. And the Blessed in Heaven Love him with the highest degree of Necessity and Determination. But now we are not thus determin'd to the Love of Particular goods. I say not <hi>thus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd. For it must be acknowledg'd that there is a sort of determination even <hi>here</hi> also. For good being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable as good and consequently in <hi>every degree</hi> of it, so far as we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any thing as good we must needs Love it with a <hi>Natural Inclination,</hi> that which the Schools term a <hi>Velleity</hi> or <hi>Voluntas Naturae,</hi> or a loving a thing <hi>Secundum quid,</hi> according to a certain respect; But it being possible that this Lesser Particular good may in some circumstances come into Competition with a greater Particular good or with the greatest of all, the universal good, and so upon the whole become evill, 'tis not necessary, nor are we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to love it absolutely, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and efficaciously, but may nill and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60271:25"/>
decline it <hi>Absolutely,</hi> tho' still we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>Natural Love</hi> or <hi>Velleity</hi> towards it as before.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 For the case is the same here as 'tis in Evill. We necessarily hate evill as evill, and the greatest evill we hate <hi>Absolutely</hi> as well as <hi>necessarily.</hi> But for particular and lesser evills, tho' we necessarily hate them too by a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Aversion as far as we Consider them as <hi>evill,</hi> yet 'tis not necessary that we should always hate them <hi>Absolutely,</hi> but may in some Circumstances <hi>Absolutely</hi> will them as a means either to avoid a greater evil, or to obtain a greater good. And in the same proportion as any evil less than the greatest tho' it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily nill'd and declined in some <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> may yet be <hi>Absolutely</hi> will'd and embraced, so any Particular good tho' it be in some <hi>respect</hi> necessarily lov'd, may yet <hi>Absolutely</hi> be nill'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Indeed the Excellent <hi>Monsieur Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebranche</hi> in his Treatise of Nature <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60271:25"/>
and grace, asserts this non Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Love to Particular goods in more large and unlimited terms, when he tells us, that <hi>the Natural Motion of the Soul to good in general, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible in respect of any Particular good.</hi> And in this <hi>non Invincibility</hi> he places our <hi>Liberty</hi> or Free will. But in my Judgement this Proposition of his must either be <hi>Corrected,</hi> or <hi>better explain'd.</hi> For without this our Distinction, it will not hold true. Our Love to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good is Invincible <hi>Secundum quid</hi> or as to a certain <hi>respect,</hi> but <hi>Absolutely</hi> and simply speaking it is not Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if in this <hi>Absolute non Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibility</hi> he will have our Liberty or Free will to consist, I readily agree with him, and do think the Notion to be very sound and good.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 And thus the Difference between our Love of the universal, and our Love of Particular goods is clear and apparent. Our Love to the universal good is Primary and Immediate, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60271:26"/>
our Love to Particular good Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary and Mediate. Our Love to the universal good is invincible <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Simply,</hi> we will it <hi>necessarily,</hi> and we will <hi>throughly,</hi> but our love to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good is invincible only in <hi>some certain respect.</hi> We do not always love it thoroughly and effectually, tho' we must always love it. In short, our love to the universal good is like the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Blood within our veins, which we have no manner of empire or Command over, but our Love to Particular good is like the Motion of <hi>Respiration,</hi> partly necessary, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Free. We cannot live without Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, and yet we can suspend any one turn of Respiration in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but yet not without a natural inclination to the Contrary. And so in like manner we can't live without loving some particular good or other, but when we point to this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good, there is not one but what we may nill and refuse <hi>Absolutely and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60271:26"/>
simply,</hi> tho' yet in some respect we must love it too, with a <hi>Natural Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9 Thus far I have Consider'd the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral nature of this First great Branch of Love, Love of Concupiscence or Desire. I come now to the <hi>Kinds</hi> of it. For the right distribution of which I consider first that any Motion of the Soul is specify'd from the <hi>Quality</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Term</hi> to which it tends. Now the Object of Desire being good it follows that the <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>Desire</hi> must receive their distinction from the <hi>Kinds</hi> of <hi>good.</hi> Now good is <hi>Relative,</hi> and the Relation that it implies is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Convenience</hi> either to the Soul or Body, that is, either to the Soul Directly and Immediately, or Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and by the Mediation of Bodily sensations. So that all good is either <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>sensual,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same Members of Divisition will be the adequate Distribution of <hi>Desire.</hi> That is an Intellectual Desire whose <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> is an Intellectual good, and a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60271:27"/>
Desire is that whose <hi>Object</hi> is a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual good.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 But I further observe, that this same denomination of Intellectual and sensitive may be taken from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>part moved</hi> as well as from the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty</hi> in man is double as well as the <hi>Cognoscitive,</hi> and consists of a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and Inferiour, of a Rational and sensitive part. For as in the <hi>Cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> part there is <hi>Pure Intellect</hi> whereby Ideas are Apprehended without any Corporeal Image, and <hi>Imagination</hi> whereby objects are presented to our minds under some Corporeal Affection, so also in the <hi>Appetitive</hi> there is a pure and mere act of Tendency or Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the agreeable object, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to Pure Intellect and is what we call <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Volition,</hi> and there is also such a propension of the Soul as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with a Commotion of the Blood and Spirits, and this answers to Imagination, and is the same with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60271:27"/>
what we usually term the <hi>Passion</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> And 'tis in the divided Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or Discord of these two wherein consists that <hi>Lucta</hi> or Contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> That which our B. Lord intimated when he sayd <hi>The Spirit truly is willing, but the Flesh is weak,</hi> and which <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Law of the Mind and the Law of the Members.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> I say in the <hi>Divided</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of these two. Because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Intellectual and Sensitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite may both point one way, and conspire in the same object, as it does either in men very wicked, who sin with <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>intireness</hi> of <hi>Consent</hi> without any Check or Remorse from the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part, or in men Eminently good, who have reduced even their very <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi> Inclinations to the <hi>order of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and have attain'd to the highest degree of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>simplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Desire.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 And it may yet be observ'd fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that so far as this Denomination
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60271:28"/>
of Intellectual and Sensitive is taken both from the quality of the Object, and from the part moved, our Desire may be at the same time both Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and Sensitive. For that Desire which is <hi>Intellectual</hi> in respect of the <hi>Part</hi> may be also <hi>sensitive</hi> in respect of the <hi>Object,</hi> (For we may <hi>Will</hi> a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual good as well as <hi>Passionately</hi> Desire it) and so on the other side, that Desire which is <hi>sensitive</hi> in respect of the <hi>Part</hi> may be <hi>Intellectual</hi> in respect of the <hi>Object.</hi> For there may be a <hi>sensitive</hi> Appetite of an <hi>Intellectual</hi> good, and we may love even God himself <hi>Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> as well as <hi>Rationally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12 Thus is Love of Desire divided in general into <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>sensual.</hi> But as for the particular kinds under these they are almost infinite, and therefore I shall not offer at a distinct recital of them. I shall only remarque some few things concerning <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Love,</hi> and by the way shall also briefly touch upon the <hi>principal</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60271:28"/>
most eminent species of <hi>sensual Love,</hi> and so end this Section.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 And first concerning Intellectual Love, I consider that the general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or Beauty. For Intellectual Love is that whose object is an Intellectual good, and an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual good is that which pleases the Intellect, and the Intellect is pleas'd with nothing but as 'tis <hi>Proportionable, Harmonious</hi> and some way or other <hi>Beautifull.</hi> Whence it follows that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Love has Beauty in general for its proper Object.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. But then this Beauty which is the proper Object of Intellectual Love, is either the <hi>First and Original Beauty,</hi> or <hi>Created and Derivative Beauty;</hi> if the First and Original Beauty, then the love of it is <hi>Divine Love,</hi> and if this be in a very high degree such as is the Product of an intense Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then 'tis what we call <hi>Seraphic Love,</hi> which is the greatest Exaltation, and Perfection of <hi>Intellectual Love,</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60271:29"/>
withall the <hi>greatest Happiness</hi> the Soul of man is capable of in this State,<note place="margin">See Idea of Happiness.</note> as I have shewn at large in another Treatise.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 But if it be <hi>Created and Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Beauty, then I consider that either we <hi>Ascend</hi> by and from the love of it to the love of the First and Originary Beauty, or else we <hi>stick there,</hi> or we <hi>Descend</hi> to the desire of Corporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, and the delight arising from it. If we take Occasion to Ascend, then 'tis what we call <hi>Platonic Love,</hi> which (as I have elsewhere more at large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd the Notion) is the Ascent of the Soul to the love of the Divine Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Aspect of Beauty in Bodys. But if we terminate and stick in this sensible Form or Pulchritude, tho' this Affection be not so noble and generous as that which ascends higher, yet still this is <hi>pure Intellectual Love,</hi> so long as 'tis free from all desire of Corporal Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for distinction's sake may be call'd the Love of <hi>Abstracted Beauty.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60271:29"/>16 And let not any one think it strange that I make this <hi>Abstract Love</hi> of sensitive Beauty an <hi>Intellectual Love.</hi> For Beauty let the subject of its inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be what it will, consists in <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> which is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate good of the Soul, that only being capable both of understanding it, and of being <hi>primarily</hi> affected with it. And tho we give it the name of <hi>Sensible Beauty,</hi> yet that is only because the senses are the Instruments of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiances,</hi> not as being the part <hi>primely affected,</hi> and to distinguish it from those Beautys which are <hi>immediately</hi> Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, such as the Beauty of <hi>Truth,</hi> the Beauty of <hi>Vertue</hi> and the like; But in reference to the Part directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affected all Beauty, even Sensible Beauty is an Intellectual good, and is one of the fainter Rays of the Divine glory, one of the remoter Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that reflect the Supreme and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Beauty.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 The Sublime Platonist <hi>Marsilius
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60271:30"/>
Ficinus</hi> has a fine Notion to this purpose.<note place="margin">Lib. de Lumine Tom. 1. Cap. 14. p. 1006.</note> He takes the First Beauty to be nothing else but the Splendour of Gods Glory, and of this he says there is a threefold Reflection. For he supposes Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Minds, Rational Souls, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Bodys as three Glasses of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Colours, which reflect this one and the same light after different Manners. His words are, <hi>Ipsa certe Pulcritudo Prima nihil aliud est quam Splendor Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae penes Patrem luminum, &amp; Figura Substantiae ejus. Vnde triplex emicat Pulcritudo. Prima quidem per Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos Intellectus, secunda vero per Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuales animas, tertia per Corpora ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que formosa quasi lumen unum per tria quaedam vitra Coloribus inter se varia, ideoque varium ex Primo Splendorem su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binde reddentia. The First Beauty Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is nothing else but the Splendour of Glory with the Father of Lights, and the Figure of his substance. Whence there shines forth a threefold Beauty. The
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60271:30"/>
First through the Angelical Minds, the second thro' Intelligent Souls, the third thro' Beautifull Bodys, which reflect the same Light as it were through three Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of diferent Colours, and accordingly they successively reflect a different splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from the First.</hi> So that sensible and Corporeal Beauty is one of the Glasses that reflect and represent the First Beauty, and tho' it must be confess'd that we see through <hi>this Glass darkly,</hi> yet still it represents according to its proportion, and is only as a Picture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely drawn after several Copies, a weaker and <hi>further projected</hi> Ray of God. And therefore it must needs be an Intellectual good, and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Love of it, if abstracted from Corporal Applications, must also be a pure Intellectual Love.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 But if we do not stick and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate here, but are by the aspect of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Beauty precipitated down to the desire of Corporal Contact, and the pleasure thence arising, then this is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60271:31"/>
                        <hi>sensual Love,</hi> that is, a desire of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual good. I may add of the <hi>greatest</hi> sensual good, and Consequently that this is the <hi>most</hi> sensual Love. And 'tis so Common with men thus to <hi>descend,</hi> rather than love <hi>Platonically</hi> or <hi>Abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly,</hi> that the name of love is almost wholely appropriated to <hi>this</hi> Affection, and <hi>to be in Love</hi> signifies as much as to be inclined to <hi>Corporal Contact</hi> by the Occasion of Corporeal Beauty.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60271:32"/>
concerning this Kind of sensual Love, the Desire of Corporal Contact occasion'd by the Aspect of sensible Beauty, and that is, that this is a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion peculiar to <hi>Man. Brutes</hi> are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> it, and <hi>Angels</hi> are <hi>above</hi> it. For Man being a middle sort of Creature between an Angel and a Beast, 'tis requisite he should have somthing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him from each, and that in his <hi>Appetitive</hi> as well as in his <hi>Intellective</hi> Part. And thus it is, in his <hi>Intellective</hi> part he has <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> which is above <hi>sensible knowledge,</hi> and short of <hi>Intuition.</hi> And so likewise in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive</hi> there is this Desire of Corporal Contact arising from the sight of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is a <hi>mixt</hi> Love, partly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and partly sensual, and is thereby distinguish'd from the Love of <hi>Brutes,</hi> which is purely sensual (for they are not affected with <hi>Beauty</hi>) and the love of <hi>Angels</hi> which is purely Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual.

                     <head>SECT. V. Of the Second Great Branch of Love <hi>viz.</hi> Love of Benevolence, its division into Self-Love and Charity, where also 'tis enquired whether all Love be Self-Love.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 HAving dispatch'd the First great Branch of Love, Love of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence or Desire, with the several Kinds of it, I come now to consider the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> Love of Benevolence. By this I understand a desiring or willing of good to some Person or Being that is Capable of it. And herein 'tis dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenc'd from Love of Concupiscence. The Idea of Love of Concupiscence is, <hi>A simple Tendency of the Soul to good,</hi> not at all considering whether it wills it to any Person or Being or no. But the Idea of Benevolence is <hi>A desiring or willing this good to some Being or other.</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60271:33"/>
As far as 'tis a <hi>Desiring</hi> or willing of good, it agrees with Love of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, but it is distinguish'd from it in that it <hi>wishes well too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 For as in Physical Motion a Body may be consider'd either as simply mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving towards another, or as moving this other to some Certain Body, so in Love which is a <hi>Moral Motion,</hi> the Soul may be consider'd either as simply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring or willing good (which is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence</hi>) or as desiring or willing it to some Capable Being, and this is that Species of Love which we call <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 And I further Meditate that as in Motion the Body that moves another may either move it towards it self as in <hi>Circular</hi> Motion, or towards some other Body as in <hi>Direct</hi> Motion. So in the Love of Benevolence this wishing well to, may either be a willing of good to <hi>ones self,</hi> or to some <hi>other Being.</hi> If to ones self, then 'tis that special sort of Benevolence which we call <hi>self-love.</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60271:34"/>
If to another, then 'tis what we call <hi>Charity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 Then again as to Charity, this may be consider'd either as extended to all men in Common, grounded upon one Common Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Nature, and a Capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefitted, which is <hi>Common Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; Or as confined to one or two, and as Mutual, and as Mutually known, and withall as in a special degree of Intens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Application, and then 'tis <hi>Friendship,</hi> which differs not from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charity but as 'tis qualify'd by the preceding modifications.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 But this our Division is in danger of being closed up again by some who contract all these kinds of Benevolence into one, by telling us that <hi>all Love</hi> is <hi>self-Love.</hi> Thus the <hi>Epicureans</hi> of old, who by this Plea thought to evade the necessity of owning a Providence. For when you argue from the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God that the world is cared for and govern'd by him; No say they, the

quite contrary follows. For all Love is self-Love, and proceeds from <hi>Indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> if therefore God be such a <hi>Full</hi> and <hi>Perfect</hi> being as you suppose, he cannot be concern'd for any thing abroad, as having no self-interest to serve.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And indeed the <hi>Conclusion</hi> would be right, were the <hi>Principle</hi> so. For if all Benevolence did proceed from Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, it would certainly follow that the more perfect and self-sufficient any being is, the less he must needs regard the good of others, and consequently a being that is <hi>absolutely</hi> perfect, must necessarily be <hi>utterly</hi> void of all Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence or Concern for anothers wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 But to hear an <hi>Epicurean</hi> Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Principle is no wonder. Even <hi>Plato</hi> himself in some places seems to look favourably towards it, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <hi>Lysis,</hi> where purposely treating of Friendship he concludes toward the end of the Dialogue that Friendship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from Indigence, necessity and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60271:35"/>
The same he again insinuates in his <hi>symposion,</hi> when he makes Penia Indigence or Poverty to be the Mother of Love. But the <hi>Roman Plato, Cicero,</hi> in his book of Friendship will by no means allow this Notion, but contends that Love proceeds rather from <hi>Nature,</hi> than from Indigence or Imbecility.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 There is in the other opinion som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Truth, and somthing of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or rather 'tis either true or false as 'tis understood. How far true and how far false, I shall determin in the following Conclusions. And first I do acknowledge that all Love of <hi>Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence</hi> does proceed from Indigence, and ends in self-Love. For all desire is in order to further Perfection, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and did we not <hi>want</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>within,</hi> we should not <hi>endeavour</hi> towards any thing <hi>without.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly God, the self-sufficiency of whose Nature excludes all want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digency, is by no means capable of Love of <hi>Concupiscence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:60271:35"/>9 Again I acknowledge that even Love of Benevolence or Charity <hi>may</hi> be, and (such is our Present Infirmity) is for the most part occasion'd by Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and when unravel'd to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom concludes in self-love. Our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity not only <hi>begins</hi> at home, but for the most part <hi>ends</hi> there too. For it must be confess'd that we generally love others with respect to our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and dispense kindnesses upon the consideration of common Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that both the <hi>Condition</hi> and the <hi>Releif</hi> may be our own another day.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 I do also further acknowledge that things are so happily twisted and complicated together, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not benefit another without doing some kindness to himself, either in the <hi>Consequence</hi> &amp; final issue of things, or in the <hi>very act</hi> of Benefaction, it being not only a Pleasure to do good to others, but perhaps one of the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures in the world. And this Pleasure is withal inseparable from acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60271:36"/>
so that 'tis as impossible for a man to bestow a kindness to his Neighbour, without having it some way or other redound to himself; as 'tis for the Sun to shine upon the Earth, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his light reflected back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his own Orb.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 All this is true, and thus far I grant that Love proceeds from Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and that all love is self-love. But if the Meaning of the Assertion be that all love of Benevolence does so <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily</hi> depend upon Indigence and so necessarily point to self interest, that were not a man Indigent himself, and had an eye to his own advantage, he could not possibly wish well or do well to another, in this sense I deny that all love is self love. And I think not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just reason. For first there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>Nature of the thing</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but that there may be a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>disinteressed</hi> Benevolence. For I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the good of another consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as <hi>anothers</hi> may be the object of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60271:36"/>
volition as well as ones own. For the object of Volition is good in common, or that which is agreeable to any Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual being, whether ones self or any other. But now good as anothers or to another, is good as well as ones own, and therefore may be the object of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, and consequently we may will good to another independently on our own Interest.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 If it be objected that there is no such thing as <hi>Pure Malice,</hi> for when we wish ill to another we consider his evil as making for own good, and therefore why should there be any such thing as <hi>Pure Benevolence.</hi> I answer, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lies in this. That in <hi>Malice</hi> the thing which we wish to another is <hi>evil.</hi> Now evill being not any way desireable whether to ones self or another, as <hi>evil,</hi> it must in order to eligibility be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd under the formality of <hi>good</hi> in some respect or other. But now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the formality of good with respect to our <hi>Neighbor,</hi> for to <hi>him</hi> we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60271:37"/>
wish it as <hi>Evil.</hi> It must therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear good with reference to <hi>our selves.</hi> That is, we consider anothers evil as making for our good some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so will it to him. But now in Charity or Benevolence the thing which we will to another being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be good already, there is no cessity that in order to the willing of it we should further consider it under the formality of being <hi>our own.</hi> The Nature of <hi>good</hi> in <hi>Common</hi> being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for that. And this I conceive to be the reason that although there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>uninteressed Malice,</hi> yet there may be a <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed Charity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13 Besides, this Love of Benevolence is frequently exercised without any <hi>design</hi> of Prospect, nay sometimes where there is no <hi>possibility</hi> of any self advantage. This is plain in God, who as he is the most <hi>self-sufficient</hi> and <hi>unbenefitable,</hi> so is he also the most <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficient</hi> and <hi>Communicative</hi> Being. And
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60271:37"/>
I question not but that it may be so in Men also. For not to mention our doing kindnesses to those, whom we are certain never to see again, to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons, who cannot live to requite us, or to the living when we our selves are dying, and can't live to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited, and the like, I only consider, that we often rejoice at the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those who were born and lived before us, and hear with pleasure the successes of good Men, with whom (as being of another Age) our Interest cannot be at all concern'd. Now what we rejoice at we do implicitly and vertually Will, for nothing can be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ioy</hi> which is not according to our <hi>will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14 Lastly I consider that if all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence did necessarily spring from Indigence and self-love, then it would certainly follow that our Inclination to do good would be continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated as our Fortune rises, and we make nigher advances to Full-ness and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60271:38"/>
Self-sufficiency. But now I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Common Observation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, whether there be not many generous Spirits, who retain the same Propension to be beneficial, when they are set at the greatest distance from Poverty, as they had before when at the lowest Ebb, which yet could never be, if Benevolence did necessarily depend on Indigence. More I might add, but this I thing sufficient to shew that all Love is not, as some pretend, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable into Self-love, or Founded upon Indigence, and consequently that my Division of Benevolence into <hi>Self Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> is sufficiently accurate and contra-distinct.</p>

                     <head>SECT. I. That Love requires some Measures of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, and why love as Dirigible is made the subject of Morality rather than understanding.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 HAving finish'd the <hi>Theory of Love,</hi> I come now to consider the <hi>Measures</hi> of its <hi>Regulation.</hi> A great and important work this; for next to the <hi>Regulating</hi> of our Love, I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either more difficult or more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary, than to prescribe Measures how it <hi>ought</hi> to be Regulated. Indeed it is very Necessary to six the Bounds of Regulating our Love; and that both because of the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of Loving Regularly, and because of the <hi>Moment</hi> and Consequence of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60271:40"/>2 For the Difficulty, as tis impossible not to love at all, so is it one of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest things in the world to love well. <hi>Solus sapiens scit Amare,</hi> says the Stoic, <hi>The wise man only knows how to Love.</hi> And there are very few of these wise Men in the World, and to love regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is oftentimes more than the wisest of us all can do. For first the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite which we have to good in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is so strong and Craving that it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us on to all sorts and degrees of Particular good, and makes us fasten wherever we can trace the least Print or Foot-step of the universal good. Now this Promiscuous and Indefinite prosecution of Particular goods must needs oftentimes engage us in sin and irregularity. For though these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular objects of Love <hi>separately</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered are good, as being Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the universal good, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as they stand in <hi>relation</hi> either to <hi>one another</hi> or to the <hi>universal,</hi> they may become evil, in as much as there
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60271:40"/>
may be a <hi>Competition,</hi> and the the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may hinder the greater. As for instance, The pleasure of sense (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all Pleasure) singly and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately consider'd is good, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it may in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances be against a greater good, the good of Society, and then 'tis evil as in <hi>Fornication</hi> or <hi>Adultery.</hi> But now we are so violently push'd on to Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good, by that General Thirst after good in Common, that we don't mind how things are in <hi>Combination,</hi> but only how they are <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi> in themselves. For to observe how things are in <hi>Combination</hi> requires <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>Reflexion,</hi> which in this Hurry we are not at leisure to make, but to find how things are <hi>Singly</hi> in themselves there needs nothing but <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Tast</hi> and <hi>natural sensation.</hi> Whence it comes to pass that we more readily do the one than the other, and so are very apt to transgress order, and to <hi>love irregularly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60271:41"/>3 This is one ground of the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Loving well, and as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a very considerable one, tho' no one that I know of did ever assign this as the cause of this difficulty. But there is also another. For as from the love of good in general we are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly carried out to Particular goods, so from the Original Pravity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of our Nature, among all these Particular goods, that which we most eagerly propend to, is <hi>sensual good.</hi> The Lower life is now highly invigorated and awaken'd in us, <hi>the Corruptible Body</hi> (as the wise man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains) <hi>presses down the Soul,</hi> and the Love, which we have to good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, does now by the Corruption of our Nature almost wholly display and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert it self in the prosecution of this one Particular good, the <hi>good of Sense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Now though good of Sense be as truely good as good of the Intellect, as being a Rivulet of the same Sea, and a Ray of the same Sun, yet (as I said
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60271:41"/>
before) it may in some Circumstances and Combinations cross and thwart some higher Interest, and so become Evil. And the strong inclination, which we now have to the good of Sense in general, will often betray us into the love and enjoyment of it in <hi>those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> circumstances wherein it is evil, and against Order. And that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, even when we consider it as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that is, when we do not only mind it as it is <hi>singly</hi> in it self, but as it is in a <hi>certain Combination.</hi> For this Sensual Concupiscence in us may be so strong, that though we do actually consider a sensual pleasure so circumstantiated as <hi>Evil,</hi> yet we may for that time think it a <hi>lesser Evil</hi> than to deny our selves the gratification of so importunate an Appetite, and so chuse it, and be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an exorbitant and irregular Love.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And if we further consider how we are perpetually sorrounded with sensible goods, which by Troops thrust themselves upon us, while those
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60271:42"/>
that are Intellectual require our <hi>Search</hi> and Inquisition, how early they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us, and what deep impressions they make upon our then <hi>tender</hi> Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, how much the <hi>Animal</hi> part is <hi>afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi> with the <hi>Rational,</hi> that we live the life of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Beasts</hi> before we live the life of <hi>men,</hi> and that not only in the sense of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> while we are in the Womb, but long after we have beheld the Sun, that the <hi>Seducer Eve</hi> is Form'd while <hi>Adam sleeps,</hi> and that sensuality comes to be <hi>Adult</hi> and <hi>Mature,</hi> when our Discourses are but <hi>young</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> So that by that time we arrive to some competent use of our Reason, there has been laid in such a stock of Animal impressions, that 'tis more than work enough for our riper Age, even to <hi>unravel</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of our youth, and <hi>unlive</hi> our former life; I say if we consider this, the Difficulty of <hi>Regular love</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so great, that instead of admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ill course of the World, one
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60271:42"/>
should rather be tempted to wonder that men love so regularly as they do. So great Reason had the Stoic to say, <hi>The wise man only knows how to love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 But were it onely a piece of <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> to steer the Ship right, and were there not also <hi>danger</hi> of splitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Rocks, and of other ill Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencys, the Pilot might yet be secure and unconcern'd, commit <hi>himself</hi> to his <hi>Pillow,</hi> and his <hi>Vessel</hi> to the <hi>Winds.</hi> But 'tis otherwise, there is <hi>Moment</hi> and Consequence in Loving regularly as well as <hi>Difficulty.</hi> No less a thing than Happiness depends upon it, private Happiness and publick Happiness, the Happiness of single Persons, and the the Happiness of the Community, the Happiness of this world, and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the next.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 For as Motion is in the Natural, so is Love in the Moral world. And as the good state of the Natural World depends upon those <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Regular Motion,</hi> which God has establish'd in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60271:43"/>
it, in so much that there would need nothing else to bring all into confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and destruction, but the irregular Motion of those Bodies which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of, so does the welfare and happy state of the Intellectual world depend upon the <hi>Regularity</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this Motion proceeds, so is the Moral world either an Harmonical Frame, or a disorderly Chaos, and there needs nothing but the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Love to undermine the Pillars of Happiness, and to put the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Intellectual World out of Course.</hi> And accordingly we see that God who loves Order, and takes care for the perfection of <hi>both</hi> worlds, has prescribed both <hi>Laws of Motion</hi> and <hi>Laws of Love.</hi> And for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son 'tis a thing of great importance and necessity to state these Laws and Measures, the welfare of the Moral world being as much concern'd in <hi>Love,</hi> as that of the natural is in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60271:43"/>8 And this is the Reason why <hi>Love as Dirigible</hi> is made the subject of Morality rather than <hi>understanding.</hi> For the Happiness of life is not so much concern'd in the Acts of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as in the Acts of our Love; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not at all in our understanding any further, than as our understanding affects our Love, and opinion influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences practise. And then indeed it is, which is the ground of that Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> which we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as to those Articles of Faith which are call'd <hi>Fundamental.</hi> Otherwise in matters of pure Speculation the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Society is not at all concern'd in what we think, as for instance in that Celebrated Mathematical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, <hi>whether the pertual Approxima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some lines be consistent with the impossibility of their Concourse,</hi> what does it signify to the good estate of Society which way this be held? 'Tis indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent therefore which side we take. But now we can't advance one step in the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60271:44"/>
Motion of Love, but something or other comes on't in relation to Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Happiness, as there is not the least Motion in Nature but what tends ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Generation</hi> or <hi>Corruption.</hi> For the difference is this, the Acts of our understanding are <hi>Immanent,</hi> and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of any alteration upon things without us, but the Acts of Love are <hi>Transient,</hi> and leave external and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent effects behind them in the course of things, and for this reason Love, as Dirigible, is made the Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and proper subject of Moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and understanding is here no otherwise concern'd than as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and determines our love.

Whether sensual Pleasure be in its self evil, with an account of the true Notion of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concupiscence and of Mortification.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 BEing now to define the Measures of Love, I shall first begin with Love of Concupiscence. And here I consider that <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> divide between them the Bounds of Morality, which ought wholely to be taken up in the consideration of these two things, what we <hi>must</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to do, and what we <hi>may</hi> do without being Peccant. And accordingly I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all the Measures of Love of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence to these two general Heads, what we <hi>must</hi> desire, and what we <hi>may</hi> desire.</p>

God, as the greatest and last End <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Simply,</hi> the good of the Community, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of <hi>Subordinate</hi> Ends, and all those things which have a Natural Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it, as <hi>Means</hi> without which 'tis not to be obtain'd.

                     <p n="3">3 The first thing which we must love or desire is <hi>God.</hi> But now God may be loved two waies, either <hi>confusely</hi> and <hi>implicitly,</hi> or <hi>distinctly</hi> and <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly.</hi> The confuse and implicit Love of God is Natural and necessary, for tis the same with the love of good in common or Happiness, to which our Nature is Originally and invincibly

determin'd, and consequently cannot be Morally obliged. But that which we are here obliged to, is to love or desire him distinctly and explicitly, that is, to contract and concentre that Natural and Original Love, which we have to good in general or happiness, upon God, as being the true and only cause of all that happiness, to which we so blindly and necessarily aspire.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The love of God therefore, to which we are obliged, includes two things, a <hi>Desire</hi> and an <hi>Explicit</hi> desire of him. And this indeed is the only Love of him to which we can be Morally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged. For as to loving him confuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that</hi> we can't be obliged to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis <hi>necessary</hi> and unavoidable; and as to loving him with love of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence or wishing well to, <hi>that</hi> we cannot be obliged to because 'tis <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable</hi>; The former we cannot be obliged to, because of the condition of <hi>our own</hi> Nature, and the latter we cannot be obliged to, because of the Nature of <hi>God.</hi>

                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60271:46"/>I know very well that I am singular in this Point, and that nothing is more common, among those that treat of the love of God, than to talk of it as of a love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and accordingly they alwaies express our Love to God, and our Love to our Neighbour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same common Appellation of <hi>Charity,</hi> as if they were both one and the same love, whereby we love God, and whereby we love our Neighbour. But there is I remember an old Rule, that <hi>we may talk with the Many, but must think with the Few,</hi> and I think tis very applicable in this case. For however we may use the word Charity in respect of God, to comply with popular modes of speaking, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how in strictness and propriety of Notion God may be lov'd with Love of <hi>Benevolence.</hi> For certainly as Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the <hi>Lover</hi> is the ground of <hi>his</hi> loving with love of Concupiscence, so Indigence in the Person <hi>lov'd</hi> is the ground of our loving him with love
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60271:46"/>
of Benevolence. But now what can we wish to God that he has not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? <hi>My goodness extendeth not to thee,</hi>

                        <hi>but to the Saints which are in the Earth,</hi> sayes the Psalmist, and to speak truely we can no more love God with love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> than he can love us with love of <hi>Desire.</hi> God is as much above <hi>this</hi> our <hi>Love</hi> as he is above our <hi>understanding,</hi> He can indeed <hi>wish well</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> but we can only <hi>Desire him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 And I observe that in Scripture our Love of God is set forth in such expressions as import not any <hi>Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> to him, but a <hi>Desire</hi> of him. As when the Psalmist saies,<note place="margin">Psal. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>like as the Hart desireth the Water-brooks, so longeth my Soul after thee O God</hi>; And again; <hi>My Soul is a thirst for God, when shall I come to appear before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> And again, <hi>My Soul breaketh out for fervent Desire.</hi> Again, <hi>whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in Comparison of thee.</hi>

in the Canticles which express the very Soul and Spirit of Divine Love, saies the inamour'd Spouse, the Church, <hi>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his Mouth,</hi>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60271:47"/>
and consequently <hi>that</hi> is the Love wherewith we love God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 If it be here objected that though there be no room for wishing well to God <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Directly,</hi> yet we may rejoyce and take a <hi>Complacency</hi> in those Perfections of his, which make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of our more express Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which will amount (as was urged before) to an <hi>implicit</hi> and <hi>vertual</hi> willing them to him, I answer, that what we rejoyce at we do implicitly will, if it be in a Being who either might not have had that Happiness, or holds it precariously and may hereafter be deprived of it, For here is still some <hi>Indigence</hi> in the Person to make him capable of our good wishes; But now the <hi>Happiness</hi> of God is as necessary as his <hi>Existence,</hi> and consequently how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may rejoyce in his being Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we can no more <hi>will</hi> him to be <hi>Happy,</hi> than we can will him to <hi>exist.</hi> For to will him to be happy necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily supposes, that he has not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60271:48"/>
Possession of that Happiness which we will him, for if he has, why do we yet will it to him? Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no room for Benevolence. Nay I do not conceive how we can wish well to God so much as <hi>ex Hypothesi,</hi> on supposition that he were not happy in that respect wherein we would wish well to him. For the Supposition is impossible, and takes away the very <hi>Subject</hi> of our Benevolence. For if God were not completely Happy, he would not be what he is, but some other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 I would by no means straiten or retrench our Love to God, but am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for inlarging and multiplying its Chanels as much as may be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any think that God may be lov'd with Love of Benevolence, Let them <hi>enjoy</hi> and (if they can) <hi>act</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Notion. For my part I cannot bring my self to any clear conception of it, and I am very scrupulous in venturing upon any thing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60271:48"/>
whereof I have no distinct Idea. Which ought to be Apology sufficient for me, if I make <hi>Love of Desire</hi> to be the only Love, wherewith we are obliged to love God.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 And that we are obliged thus to love him, I shall briefly make out from the consideration of <hi>our own</hi> Nature, and from the Nature of <hi>God.</hi> As to our own Nature, I consider that our Thirst after good or Happiness in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is so natural, so necessary, and so vehement, that as at present we can neither <hi>suspend,</hi> nor <hi>moderate,</hi> nor in the least <hi>interrupt</hi> it, so we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect fully to <hi>quench</hi> or extinguish it, but in the enjoyment of that Object, which has all that happiness in it, on which the whole Bent of our Soul is so strongly set.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 From the strength and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble necessity of this our Inclination to good in general, I conceive 'twill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that 'tis highly Reasonable, that that Being wherein is all this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60271:49"/>
to which we <hi>indefinitely</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, ought to be lov'd and desired <hi>expressly</hi> by us, and not only so, but with the very same love wherewith we love happiness it self. For otherwise we should contradict our first and grand Appetite, and act against the very Frame and Constitution of our Nature.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 This admitted, I consider second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God is that Full and rich Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that has all this happiness in him. He is not only the <hi>Cause</hi> of all good, but the very <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of it. He is (as the Divine Philosopher stiles him) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>good it self, Lovely it self, and Desirable it self.</hi> He is indeed the <hi>First Desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as well as the <hi>First Intelligible,</hi> and as we <hi>see</hi> and <hi>understand</hi> all things in him, so in him we <hi>desire</hi> all that we desire. In short, he is the Complement and perfection of good, the End and the Centre of the whole Intelligent Creation, and all that we can desire or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60271:49"/>
enjoy; and consequently as we cannot Love <hi>beyond</hi> him, so we ought not to love <hi>short of him.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> has words to this purpose worth Citing. <hi>Summa Bonorum Deus. Neque infra remanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum nobis est, neque ultra quaerendum. Alterum enim periculosum, alterum nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est- God is the Sum of all good. We are neither to fix on this side of him, nor to seek any thing beyond him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. De Mor. Eccl.</note> 
                        <hi>the former is dangerous, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12 And as we are obliged to love God, so ought we to love him beyond all other things whatsoever. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed love him as he is <hi>lovely</hi> at all, nor can we love him to <hi>our</hi> utmost till we shall see him as he is, but we may &amp; must now <hi>prefer</hi> him in our love. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; so</hi> runs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. And very just we should. For if even in Particular goods Order requires that the most lovely should be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60271:50"/>
loved most, much more ought we to love him who is the very <hi>Essence</hi> of good, <hi>good it self,</hi> beyond all <hi>Derivative</hi> and <hi>secondary</hi> good. For there is here no Proportion or Comparison at all.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 And for the same cause we can never love God <hi>too much.</hi> As mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration has here no <hi>excellence,</hi> so excess has here no <hi>place.</hi> An Infinite Desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able can never be too much desired. God is the Measure of all Love, every thing being lovely only so far as it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates of him, and consequently the Measure of loving him is to love him without Measure. The Philosopher sayes well in his Politics, that <hi>the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the End is alwaies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end or Term,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and that bounds and stints are only in those things that are in order to the End.</hi> God therefore being our End we can never love him to excess, no nor the Angels in Heaven neither. Indeed the thing is <hi>Absolutely</hi> as well as <hi>Relatively</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, for as the <hi>Narrowness</hi> of <hi>our</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60271:50"/>
Nature will hinder us from loving him <hi>enough,</hi> so the infinite <hi>Fulness</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> makes him uncapable of being lov'd <hi>too much.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. And thus much for the Love of God. The next thing that we are to desire is the good of the Community. This next to God is the greatest possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good. For 'tis the good of the <hi>whole,</hi> than which nothing can be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The good of the Community is the End, the Measure, the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the final result of all private goods. Hither they all point, and here they all conspire and concentre. And consequently this is the greatest Beauty, the greatest Order, and the greatest Harmony that can possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from the <hi>Creature,</hi> and is the very next Resemblance of the Perfection of God, who is <hi>all in all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15 This therefore being the greatest Delectable good in <hi>it self,</hi> it ought to be so also <hi>to us,</hi> who are to love and desire this good of the Community be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60271:51"/>
all private good whatsoever. Nay we ought to desire private good no further than as 'tis conducive to, or at least consistent with the Public Interest. For I consider Society as a Musical Instrument, consisting of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of strings of different sizes, and strain'd up to different pitches, some of whose Sounds, though ungrateful in some junctures, are yet Musical as they stand in relation to others, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Common design. Now tho 'tis Natural to desire the grateful sound of every string singly, were this equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducing to the harmony of the whole, yet certainly no body is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably absurd, as to desire that this or that Discord should be turned into a sound singly more grateful, to the prejudice of the general harmony, which is of infinitely greater Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than the single gratefulness of one or two Particular Strings.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 And this is the Case of us men in Society, and this ought to be our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60271:51"/>
We ought to consider our selves as so many strings of one great Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not affect any <hi>Pitch</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> more grateful to our selves, to the prejudice of the common harmony, the good of the Community, which is the most <hi>delectable</hi> good, and ought by us to be most Cordially tender'd, and Principally regarded. Especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that this is the good which God himself cheifly proposes, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally regards both in the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>government</hi> of the nniverse.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 And now since the Desire of the End necessarily includes the Desire of the Means, the next Object of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire must be all things which have a Natural Connexion with the good of the Community. And here 'tis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the first place, that there are some things that have this Natural connexion with it. And 'tis necessary so to suppose. For as God cannot make a natural World according to any particular system whatsoever, but there
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60271:52"/>
will necessarily arise upon it some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Relations and habitudes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and disagreement; some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will naturally make <hi>for</hi> its order and Perfection, and some <hi>against</hi> it. So is it impossible for God to make an Intellectual word, that is, to constitute Society in any particular condition, Scheme or posture, but Relations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and disagreeable will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and necessarily arise; some things will naturally make for its order and convenience, and some things will be as naturally contrary to it. And this without any arbitrary interposition of God by the mere natural result and necessity of things. For to recur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the instance of a Musical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, let an Instrument be so and so made, so and so strung, and so and so tuned, and some certain strokes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it will necessarily be harmonical, and other some as necessarily dishar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical. But now let the Instrument be tuned another way, and the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60271:52"/>
of convenience and disconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will alter, the same strokes, that were before disharmonical, may be now harmonical, and so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But yet still some strokes will be naturally agreeable and some disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, let the Instrument be set which way you please. The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this to Society is too obvious to insist upon.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 To proceed therefore, it being supposed that there are some things, which have a natural connexion with the good of the Community, the next obligation of our Love will be, that whatsoever has this natural connexion be will'd and desired by us. For as the good of the Community is the greatest <hi>Delectable</hi> good, so that which has a natural Connexion with it is the greatest <hi>Proffitable</hi> good, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be lov'd with the same love wherewith we love the good of the Community it self, wherein is also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that whatever has an opposite
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60271:53"/>
Relation is in the same manner to be hated and abhorred. For this is the <hi>general Reason</hi> of Moral good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, of Vertue and Vice, and the <hi>Prime Fundamental</hi> Law of Nature, which never can cease of expire, however the Particular Instances may change ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variation of the <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Systeme</hi>: As I have more fully shewn in another Discourse,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Consid. upon the Nature of Sin.</hi>
                        </note> and shall therefore here no further enlarge upon it.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. And now because with relation to the present posture of the Intellectual world, there are some particular things in Specie, which have this natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the interest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, such as Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, Patience, Humility, Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Fidelity and the like; hence it comes to pass that these are to be lov'd and will'd by us, by vertue of that general Canon, that whatever natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally serve to the good of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is to be loved, to which these are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60271:53"/>
reduced as special Instances and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications.</p>
                     <p n="20">20 But I do not think my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to descend to a <hi>particular</hi> prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of these or any other vertues, it being not my design to insist upon <hi>Particulars,</hi> but only to lay down such <hi>general Principles,</hi> upon which a more Particular Scheme of Morality may be erected, or into which those Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Morals which are already extant may and ought to be resolv'd. And besides having brought the Reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Road,</hi> I think I may now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused from attending him any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and shall therefore advance to some other Theoryes of more remote and uncommon observation.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 Having therefore fix'd the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bounds of <hi>Duty</hi> by shewing what we <hi>must</hi> desire, I proceed to consider the Bounds of <hi>Liberty</hi> by shewing what we <hi>may</hi> desire. Now the Measures of this are either <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Particular.</hi> The general Measures are two. The
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60271:54"/>
First is, that we <hi>may</hi> desire any thing that is not contrary to what we <hi>must</hi> desire. From this arises the second ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Measure, which is that we <hi>may</hi> desire any thing that is not contrary or Prejudicial to the <hi>good of Society.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22 Now as to the Particular Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, there is too much variety in them to be all minutely and punctually consider'd. And besides it would be a <hi>needless</hi> as well as a <hi>tedious</hi> undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I shall therefore only touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the more considerable Instances, and such as have not been made the subject of ordinary speculation. And the first Instance of our Liberty which I shall consider, is that we <hi>may</hi> desire <hi>Pleasure.</hi> First because the Desire of it is <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>invincible,</hi> implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us by the Author of our Nature, and which we can no more devest our selves of, than we can of any the most essential part of our constition. 2ly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause pleasure as such in the common Nature of it is singly and simply good,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60271:54"/>
and in no respect or combination evil. It is singly and simply good, because convenient and agreeable, and in no respect or combination evil, because <hi>as such</hi> not against the good of the Community.</p>
                     <p n="23">23 For if pleasure <hi>as such</hi> were against the good of the Community, then <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Particular</hi> pleasure would be so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every particular Pleasure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the common nature of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which would then be enough to render it evil, the least defect being a sufficient reason to make any thing so. But now this is so far from being true, that not only some Pleasures are laudable and excellent, but on the contrary no particular pleasure is evil so far as <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but only by reason of some accidental Combinations and Circumstances, wherein some higher In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is opposed by it. Now this is so far from making against Pleasure, that it makes strongly for it. For if the enjoyment of particular pleasures be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60271:55"/>
then only and in such Instances and Circumstances restrain'd, when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of some greater Happiness is thereby cross'd, it follows that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it self is a thing principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and provided for by God; and consequently that it is good in it self, and therefore <hi>may</hi> be desired by us.</p>
                     <p n="24">24 So much as to the Desire of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in general, or as such. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Particular Pleasures I propose these <hi>two general Canons,</hi> which I think will hold in all Instances whatsoever. First that that Pleasure which has no trouble or pain annex'd, may, nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cannot but be embraced; as on the contrary, that Pain which has no Pleasure annex'd is to be avoided. The other Canon is, that that pleasure which either hinders a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or causes a greater pain is to be nill'd and avoided, as on the contrary that pain which either takes off a greater Pain, or causes a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is to be will'd and embraced. By
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60271:55"/>
these two general Canons we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our desire of particular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
                     <p n="25">25 But now of Particular Pleasures, some are Intellectual and some are Sensual. As to Intellectual Pleasures there is no question to be made, but that any of them may be desired as to their kind, only there are some Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to be observ'd with reference to their Degree, Time, Place, and other Circumstances which are too numerous to define, and withal too obvious to need it, and may therefore be left to the Discretion of common Prudence to determine according to the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding general <hi>Canons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26 But now concerning sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, especially that eminent Species of it which we call <hi>Venereal,</hi> there is more difficulty. Of this it may be doubted whether it be in its self Evil or no. Some we know among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have expressly thought so, and upon this ground have condemn'd the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60271:56"/>
use of Marriage, as namely, the Sect of the <hi>Essenes</hi> among the Jews, <hi>Tatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Marcion, Manichaeus</hi> and others. And though these were censured as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> yet nothing more common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among Orthodox and approv'd Writers, than to let fall such expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from which the same conclusion will follow. For when they tax the immorality of some particular instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sensual Pleasure (suppose Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Fornication) they don't ground their charge wholely upon those Civil inconveniences, which either of them bring upon Society in their respective Circumstances, but resolve part of their immorality into sensuality as such, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from those other ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. They condem them not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as unjust, as injurious, as inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Public, &amp;c. but also as <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual</hi>: Now if any particular sensual pleasure be evil as <hi>sensual,</hi> then 'twill unavoidably follow that sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>as such</hi> is evil.</p>
                     <p n="27">
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60271:56"/>27 And that it is so, a man might be further induced to think, when he observes that in the Divine Writings (not to say any thing of our Common way of Discourse) such peculiar Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of Infamy are given to certain Instances of sensual Pleasure, which can belong to them on no other score than as <hi>as Sensual.</hi> Nay and as if here lay the very <hi>Point</hi> of the Immorality, they often receive a Denomination from the Sensual Pleasure, but never from the injustice, unfaithfulness or the like. Thus is Adultery call'd the sin of <hi>Vncleanness.</hi> And Adulterers are common call'd <hi>unclean</hi> Persons, <hi>Filthy, brutish,</hi> &amp;c. In like manner David in his Penitentials for that sin insists cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the <hi>sensual part</hi> of it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly speaks of <hi>washing, cleansing,</hi> and <hi>making clean.</hi> From all which a man would be tempted to gather that the Moral ilness of Adultery were at least <hi>partly</hi> to be resolv'd into the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi> of it, and consequently that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60271:57"/>
sensual pleasure is in it self or as such evil.</p>
                     <p n="28">28 And this seems yet more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from the consideration of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Instance of Sensual Pleasure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there seems to be nothing besides the mere sensuality. As namely <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Pollution.</hi> And yet this is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally condemn'd as immoral, and consequently sensual pleasure seems to be in it self evil.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. As it does yet further from those sharp invectives, which the Moral wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all ages have ever used against it as a low, base, brutish and dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing, and from that <hi>Shame</hi> which naturally attends it, even in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances professedly lawful, whereby men seem naturally conscious of some <hi>Moral incongruity</hi> in the thing purely as such.</p>
                     <p n="30">30 But now to all this I need oppose but these two things. First that if sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasure were evil in it self or as such, it would be so in all its Instances.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60271:57"/>
This is an undeniable Consequence. But now that it is not so in all its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, is plain from the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Marriage. And therefore it is not evil in its self. For it must not be thought (as some seem to fancy) that Marriage makes that good which was in it self evil. For if once evil in it self, it must eternally and universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be so, and consequently even in Marriage it self, <hi>that</hi> as to <hi>Sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> being the same with <hi>Fornication</hi> or <hi>Adultery.</hi> But sensual pleasure is not evil in <hi>Marriage,</hi> therefore not in <hi>it self</hi> or as such. This is <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="31">31 To this I further add that even the grossest Pleasure of Sense, is one of the remoter Participations of God. For it must be granted to be at least a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural good,</hi> and every particular good be it what it will, is a Ray and Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the universal good. But now nothing of God can be <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> evil. And besides, I consider
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60271:58"/>
that in the Human frame God has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Organs and Instruments for the use of Sensual Pleasure, and that he has also given us Natural Appetites and Inclinations to it. Whereby it appears that God has provided for the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Animal</hi> as well as the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> life. And though this is to be <hi>chiefly nourish'd,</hi> yet the other is not to be <hi>starv'd.</hi> For it is a Tree of Gods own planting, and therefore the Fruit of it may be <hi>good</hi> for <hi>Food,</hi> as well as <hi>Fair</hi> to the <hi>eye.</hi> For there can be nothing simply evil in the <hi>Paradise of God.</hi> As tis finely made out by the excellent <hi>Doctor More</hi> in several places of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectura Cabalistica,</hi> where the Reader may find this Argument copiously and very excellently managed.</p>
                     <p n="32">32 I conclude therefore that Sensual Pleasure is not in its own simple Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evil, and Consequently that no Particular Instance of it is evil barely as being <hi>Sensual</hi> (for if so then sensual pleasure as such would be evil) but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60271:58"/>
only as it stands invested with some Circumstances, which make it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with some higher good, the good of society. Thus in voluntary Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is a <hi>deordination</hi> from the End of Nature, <hi>Generation,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in consists its evil, not in its being a <hi>sensual pleasure.</hi> And accordingly we find that those other <hi>Pleasures</hi> of sense, which are not appropriated by Nature to any peculiar end, are in their use wholely indifferent, as using rich Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, drinking delicious Wines, &amp;c. Thus again in Fornication, though the end of <hi>generation</hi> may be here serv'd, yet the ends of <hi>Convenient Education</hi> cannot. And herein lies the evil of this, not in its being an act of sensuality or a sensual Pleasure.</p>
                     <p n="33">33 But because there are some that are ready to call in question the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural immorality</hi> of simple Fornication, and those that do allow it are scarce resolv'd where to fix it, 'twill not be amiss to prosecute this a little further.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60271:59"/>
The best Account that I know of this matter, is that which is given by <hi>Tho. Aquinas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 3. con. gent. cap. 122.</note> and indeed I think it very Full, rational and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And because I cannot do it in better words, I will give it in his own. <hi>It is to be consider'd</hi> (sayes he) <hi>that in those Animals, in which the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male alone is sufficient for the bringing up of the young, the Male and Female af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Copulation remain no time together, as in Dogs. But among those Animals in which the Female is not sufficient for the bringing up of the young, the Male and Female after Copulation remain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as long as is necessary for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Instruction of the young. As it appears in some Birds, whose young ones can't get their living presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are brought forth. For since Birds don't nourish their young with milk (which Nature has made ready at hand, as in Beasts) but are forc'd to go forrage abroad for Meat, and besides to cherish their young while they feed them, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60271:59"/>
would not be sufficient alone for all this. And therefore by the order of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the Male among such Creatures is Naturally inclined to abide with the Female for the Education of the young. Now 'tis plain that in Human kind the Woman would by no means suffice alone for the Education of the Child, since the necessity of Human life requires many things which cannot be supplied by one only. It is therefore convenient accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Human Nature that the Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conjunction should abide by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not presently depart, and take up indifferently with any body, as 'tis among those that Fornicate. Neither will the case be alter'd by the womans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so rich as to be able to nourish her child by ber self. Because the Natural Rectitude of Human actions is not to be measured according to those things, which happen by Accident in one Individual, but according to those things which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the whole Species. Again it is to be consider'd, that in Human kind the Off-spring
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60271:60"/>
does not only need nourishment as to the body, like other Animals, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Instruction as to the Soul. For other Animals have Natural Instincts by which they may provide for themselves. But now man lives by Reason, and must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to discretion by long experience. Whence it becomes necessary that Children be instructed by their experienc'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Nor are they capable of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction assoon as they are born, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a considerable time, and chiefly when they come to years of Discretion. For to this Instruction a great deal of time is required, and even then too by reason of the violence of Passion by which the Iudgment is perverted, they will want not only to be instructed, but to be subdued. Now for this the Woman alone is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but this is rather to be the work of the Man, whose Reason is better able to instruct, and his strength to Correct. 'Tis necessary therefore in Human kind to take care of the Off-spring not for a short time as in Birds, but for a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60271:60"/>
space of life. And therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as tis necessary in all Creatures that the Male abide with the Female as long as the Office of the Male is requisite for the Off-spring, 'tis natural to mankind that the Man associate not for a little while but alwaies with one determinate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And this Society we call Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Matrimony is therefore natural to mankind. And Fornicarious mixture, which is besides Matrimony, is against the good of Man, and for this reason must of necessity be a sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="34">34 Thus this excellent and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>Theorist,</hi> whose words I should not have transcribed at length, were they not of more than ordinary weight and moment. By this it appears, that Simple Fornication is naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral, and wherein its Immorality lies. Not in its being a Sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but in its being so circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated as not to comport with the good of society. And what I observe here in particular of simple Fornication, the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60271:61"/>
same may be said of any other forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Instance of Sensual Pleasure, that they are not evil as sensual, but upon the Consideration of some Accident or Circumstance, whereby they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with the Publick interest.</p>
                     <p n="35">35 To the Objections therefore on the other side I answer, first that it must be own'd that nothing is more common, even among approv'd Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, than when they tax the immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of some particular Instances of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasure to condemn them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Formality of their being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual. But herein is their <hi>mistake,</hi> and if men will talk confusedly of things, and assign <hi>false</hi> causes for <hi>true</hi> ones, who can help it?</p>
                     <p n="36">36 To the second I answer, that when the Scripture gives such peculiar Epithetes of Infamy to some instances of sensual pleasure, that can belong to them on no other score than as sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it must be confess'd that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual part is then tax'd. But then this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60271:61"/>
is not, must not be understood as to the <hi>kind,</hi> but as to the <hi>Degree.</hi> Not the degree of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but the degree of <hi>Affection,</hi> it being a plain Argument, that men are too much <hi>set</hi> upon Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Pleasure, when for the sake of it they will adventure to gransgress <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and trespass against the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>Society.</hi> And this indeed is a <hi>culpable sensuality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="37">37 To the third I answer, that in that certain condemn'd Instance of sensual pleasure wherein there seems to be nothing besides the mere sensual perception, there is really something besides, tho not according to a <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> yet according to a <hi>Moral Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For it is not barely a sensual pleasure, but a sensual pleasure <hi>deor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated</hi> from the end of <hi>God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> namely, <hi>generation,</hi> for which it was design'd. And in this <hi>Deordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> not in the <hi>sensuality</hi> consists its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evil and Moral Turpitude.</p>
                     <p n="38">38 To the fourth I answer that those
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60271:62"/>
severe declamations which the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists of all Ages have made against sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasure in general, as a low, base, brutish and dishonourable thing, must either be understood <hi>Comparatively,</hi> with respect to the higher character of Intellectual Pleasures, or they are <hi>ill grounded</hi> and <hi>unreasonable.</hi> And then as to the <hi>shame,</hi> which naturally attends the acting of this sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in all its instances, though it may in the first place be question'd whether this shame be from <hi>Nature</hi> or no, and not rather from <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary usages,</hi> yet for the present I will suppose it natural, and the Account of it I conceive must be this, it being a thing of vast consequence and Moment to the interest of Sociable life, that man should be propagated in a decent and regular way, and not as Brutes are, God thought it convenient for this purpose to imbue our Natures with this impression of shame with respect to venereal pleasure <hi>in general.</hi> Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60271:62"/>
this sensual delectation is in its own nature simply evil, but lest our Inclination to sensual pleasure <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> should betray us into <hi>those instances</hi> of it which are so. Which this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impression was intended as a curb to prevent. By all which it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears notwithstanding all the intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherewith some confused Thinkers have entangled this matter, that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, even the grossest sensual pleasure cannot be in its own nature and as such evil, and consequently that it <hi>may</hi> be desired by us in such convenient Circumstances, wherein no higher good is opposed.</p>
                     <p n="39">39 Now from this Hypothesis it will follow first, that <hi>Original Concupiscence</hi> must be far otherwise stated than usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is. It is commonly understood to be a vicious disposition or Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, whereby we become inclined to <hi>evil.</hi> Now if you ask, what evil. They tell you, tis Carnal or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual pleasure. But now (as it has been
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60271:63"/>
abundantly demonstrated) this is not <hi>simply</hi> and in its own nature evil, but only as 'tis <hi>Circumstantiated.</hi> And this original Concupiscence is not so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular (as being a blind Appetite) as to point to sensual pleasure in this or that <hi>Circumstance,</hi> but is carried only to sensual pleasure in <hi>common</hi> or <hi>as such.</hi> Which being not evil, neither can the inclination that respects it be evil or sinful, every Act or Inclination being specified from its <hi>Object.</hi> It must not be said therefore, that this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Concupiscence, or natural Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression toward sensible good, is <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil and sinful,</hi> the most we can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is, that it is an <hi>Occasion</hi> of evil, the strong tendency we have to sensual pleasure in <hi>common,</hi> being very apt to betray us to consent to the enjoyment of it in <hi>inconvenient Instances</hi> and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                     <p n="40">40 Another Consequent from the Premises is this, that the Duty and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Mortification does not consist
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60271:63"/>
(as 'tis vulgarly apprehended) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and killing the natural Desire of sensual pleasure. For the natural <hi>Desire</hi> of sensual pleasure is not evil, its <hi>Object</hi> not being so, and consequently not to be eradicated. But that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in such a due Repression and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline of the Body, that our <hi>natural</hi> desire of sensual pleasure in <hi>Common</hi> may not carry us to the <hi>express</hi> willing of it in <hi>such instances</hi> as are against <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and the <hi>good of Society.</hi>

                     <head>SECT. III. The Measures of Love of Benevolence, particularly of Self-love.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 HAving prescribed some general Measures for the Regulation of the first great Branch of Love, Love of <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> I come now to set bounds to the other <hi>Arm</hi> of the same great <hi>Sea,</hi> Love of <hi>Benevolence.</hi> And because this is first divided into <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> or wishing well to <hi>ones self,</hi> and wishing well to some <hi>other</hi> Being, I shall in the first place state the Measures of regulating <hi>self-love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 This sort of Love is generally the most irregular of any, and that which causes irregularity in all the rest. We love our selves <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>last,</hi> and <hi>most</hi> of all. Here we alwaies <hi>begin,</hi> and here we most commonly <hi>end,</hi> and so immoderate are we in it that we prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60271:64"/>
our own private interest, not only without any respect to the Common good, but oftentimes in direct Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to it, and so we can but secure to our selves a <hi>Plank,</hi> care not what becomes of the Vessel we sail in. This is the great <hi>Sucker</hi> of Society, and that which robbs the Body Politick of its due nourishment, and drains the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fountain to feed our own lesser Streams. Nay so foolishly immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and inordinate are we in the love of our selves, that we prefer our own little interest not only before greater of the <hi>Public,</hi> but before greater of our <hi>own,</hi> and love our Bodyes better than our Souls, a lesser interest that's present better than a greater that's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, tho equally sure, ond infinitely greater. In short, tis from the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinateness of this one Principle, Self-love, that we ruin the good of the Community here, and our own selves both here and hereafter. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is great need of Regulation.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:60271:65"/>3 Now I suppose the Measures of Self-love may all be reduced to this one in general, viz. <hi>that self-love is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver culpable, when upon the whole matter all things being taken into the Account, we do truely and really love our selves.</hi> It is then only culpable, when we love our selves by <hi>halves,</hi> and in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular respects only to our greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage in others of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And because this we generally do, hence it comes to pass that <hi>self-love</hi> is commonly taken in a bad sense, as if 'twere a thing evil and irregular in it self. But that's a mistake, Self-love is a Principle and Dictate of Nature, and the Instrument of attaining to that Happiness, which is the End of our Creation, and consequently can never be faulty, when upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all things consider'd, it is a <hi>true</hi> Love of our selves,</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Now to make it so, three things are required. First that we do not mistake our <hi>true selves</hi> by wishing well
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60271:65"/>
to, or consulting the welfare of our worser part in prejudice to our better, by feeding the <hi>Brute</hi> and starving the <hi>Man.</hi> This would be to love our selves in a little, and to hate our selves in much, and would therefore upon the whole, better deserve the name of <hi>self-hatred</hi> than <hi>self-love.</hi> If therefore we would love our selves truely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, we must learn in the first place not to mistake our <hi>true selves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 The next requisite is, that we do not mistake our <hi>true Interest,</hi> by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to our selves a lesser good, when the having it will cost us the loss of a greater. This is properly that <hi>Foolish Exchange</hi> condemn'd by our B. Saviour; 'Tis to gain a <hi>World,</hi> and loose a <hi>Soul</hi>; and what gain's that? This is indeed the Bargain of Fools and Madmen, and yet such Bargains we usually make, and what adds to the folly, think that we <hi>love</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> all the while. But this is not to love our selves <hi>truely,</hi> and therefore not <hi>Regularly.</hi>

                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:60271:66"/>6 The third and last Requisite for the Regulation of self-love is, that we do not will any good to our selves, that is not consistent with the good of the <hi>Community.</hi> And that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Publick good is of greater Consequence than any Private good can be, but also because that which is against the good of the Community, cannot be upon a final Consideration of things really for the good of any Particular Person in it. For the good of the <hi>whole</hi> is the good of the <hi>Part,</hi> and the evil of the whole is the evil of the Part, and all private Interest is so twisted, complicated and imbarqued with the Publick, that there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing this without prejudicing that. This indeed may not be the present and immediate effect, but 'twill prove so in the consequence and final up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot. For Society is like an <hi>Arch</hi> in a Building, where one Stone supports an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and in supporting others they support themselves. And so on the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60271:66"/>
contrary, should they undermine one another, they would at length by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence undermine themselves. He therefore that out of love to himself prosecutes any private interest to the Prejudice of Society, trespasses against his own good as well as that of the Community, and when all is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, cannot be said truely and really to love <hi>himself.</hi> The Sum is, to make our self-love Regular and according to Order, we must take care not to mistake our <hi>true selves,</hi> nor our <hi>true Interest,</hi> and that we don't prejudice the <hi>Publick</hi> welfare, and then we can never love our selves too much.</p>

                     <head>SECT. IV. The Measures of Common Charity.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 COncerning <hi>Common Charity.</hi> I consider that the Measures of it may all breifly be absolv'd in these two, the <hi>Object</hi> of it, and the <hi>Order</hi> of it. As to the <hi>Object</hi> of Charity, 'tis of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and diffused latitude, and takes in first <hi>all men,</hi> whether good or bad, Friends or Enemies, Neighbours or Strangers, and in all Respects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to Soul or Body, name or goods &amp;c. It extends also in some Measure to the very <hi>Irrational Creatures,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Characters of a good man in Scripture to be Merciful to his Beast. Nay it reaches to the <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Natures</hi> themselves, and indeed to the whole Intellectual, Rational and Sensitive world that are capable of the least degree of Benefit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In all this there is no Difficulty,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60271:67"/>
only it may be here question'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devils and Damn'd Spirits are to be comprehended within the Sphere of our Charity? To which I answer, that there are two things that may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Being uncapable of being an Object of our Charity or wishing well to. Either <hi>Perfect Fulness,</hi> or <hi>Perfect Indigence.</hi> Now 'tis the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Indigence to be reduced to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of want as not to be in a <hi>Capacity</hi> of ever being releiv'd. The former is the Condition of <hi>God,</hi> which makes him uncapable of being made the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Benevolence, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd before, the latter is the case of <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Damn'd Spirits</hi>: And for this reason we cannot will any good to them, as not being capable of any. For we cannot exert any act of Love which we know to be in vain and to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at all, let the incapacity proceed either from extream Fulness or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Indigence; for what is there that should excite any such Act? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60271:68"/>
if we could possibly wish well to such Beings, yet I don't see how we may do it <hi>lawfully</hi> and <hi>Regularly.</hi> For our will would not be then conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods, but directly opposite to it, and besides we should disapprove, at least tacitly and interpretatively, the <hi>Iustice</hi> of his waies, by thus loving them whom he <hi>extremely</hi> hates, and Blessing them whom he curses and abandons for ever.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thus far of the <hi>Object</hi> of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now concerning the <hi>Order</hi> of it, let these general Measures be observ'd. First that we wish well to him most, who is most likely to be serviceable to the Publick, supposing the good which we will him, to be such, as by the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he become more capable of serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Publick. Thus had I the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposal of an <hi>Ecclesiastical Benefice,</hi> which is a thing wherein the good of the Publick is highly concern'd, I ought certainly to bestow it upon him who I thought would do most good in it. Tho
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60271:68"/>
at the same time I had never so many Friends or Relations that wanted it. For this is a sure and never failing Rule, that the good of the Publick is alwaies to be prefer'd before any Private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest whatever.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Secondly that of two that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually serviceable to the Publick, we will this good wherein the Publick is concern'd, to him that is most <hi>Indigent</hi>; for after the Publick exigence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, private necessity comes in to be regarded. But if both equally <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable</hi> and equally <hi>Indigent,</hi> then we are to will it to him that is most our Neighbour, Friend, or Relation, or any other way indear'd to our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 But thirdly, supposing the good to be such that the Interest of the Public is not concern'd who has it, then I am only to consult the good of the <hi>Person</hi> to whom I will it, and consequently here Equity will require that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be given to those that are near
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60271:69"/>
me before strangers, and among those that are near to those that are nearest, whether by Nature, Choice, or Place, or in any other Respect. And among strangers 'tis equitable that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent be prefer'd in our Charity before the Rich, the good before the Bad, and the more good before the less good, and the like. But still with this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Reserve, that all other things be equal between them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 For 4ly, 'tis utterly unreasonable, that I should prefer the <hi>Convenience</hi> of my <hi>Friend</hi> before the <hi>Necessity</hi> of my <hi>Enemy.</hi> No, I ought to do the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and prefer the <hi>Necessity</hi> of my <hi>worst</hi> enemy before the <hi>Convenience</hi> even of my <hi>Dearest</hi> Friend. Thus I would leave my Friend in the Mire, to save my enemy from drowning. For in this and such like cases the greatness of the <hi>Necessity</hi> compensates for the <hi>want</hi> of <hi>merit</hi> in the Person.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 The last general Measure that I shall prescribe is, that as we ought not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60271:69"/>
to prefer any man's convenience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>another</hi> man's necessity, so neither ought we to prefer any man's own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience before his <hi>own</hi> necessity. My meaning is, that we ought to consider our Neighbours true and best Interest, will and do him that good which he stands most in need of, and not do him a little kindness which will end in a greater mischief. Hence it follows that we ought to tender the Interest of his Soul, more than the good of his Body; the <hi>Direction</hi> of his conscience more than the <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>security</hi> of it; that we stick not to <hi>prick</hi> and <hi>launce</hi> him in order to his <hi>Cure</hi>; and (when both can't be done) that we chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>proffit</hi> him than to <hi>please</hi> him. For this is <hi>true</hi> Charity, tho a <hi>severer</hi> sort of it, and he is a Fool, who when saved from drowning, complains of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pluckt out of the water by the hair of his head.</p>

                     <head>SECT. V. The Measures of Friendship.</head>
                     <p n="1">1 I Am now come to my last Stage, where I am to give Measures to the greatest <hi>Rarity,</hi> and the greatest <hi>Excellency</hi> in all the world. <hi>For indeed among all Human enjoyments nothing is so Rarely acquired, so Dearly possess'd, and so unhappily lost as a True Friend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Indeed true Friendship is so great a Rarity, that I once thought it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth while, to prescribe Measures to a thing that so <hi>seldom</hi> happens, and when it does, those few excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that are fit for so Sacred a union, can never want to be instructed how to conduct it. But then considering withal the great excellency, and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it to human life, I could not forgive my self so considerable an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as the passing by the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60271:70"/>
of so noble a Charity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 I call it <hi>Charity,</hi> for 'tis a special Modification of it, and differs no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from common Charity, than as 'tis qualify'd by some particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications and Circumstances, as was above described. It is a <hi>Sacred Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of that Benevolence, which we owe to all Mankind in <hi>Common,</hi> and an <hi>Actual</hi> exercise of that kindness to a <hi>few,</hi> which we would willingly shew to all, were it practicable and consistent with our <hi>Faculties, Opportunities,</hi> and <hi>Circumstances.</hi> 'Tis indeed a kind of <hi>Revenging</hi> our selves upon the <hi>Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of our Faculties, by exemplifying that extraordinary Charity upon one or two which we both owe, and are also <hi>ready</hi> and disposed, but by reason of the scantiness of our condition, are not sufficiently <hi>able</hi> to exercise towards all. We are willing that even <hi>this</hi> our love should be as extensive and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused as the Light, (as for <hi>Common</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that must and ought to be so) but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60271:71"/>
then finding that the Rayes of it would be too faint and weak, to give any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy any considerable warmth, when so widely spread and diffused, we are fain to contract them into a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass to make them burn and heat, and then our <hi>Charity</hi> Commences <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 Now as to the Measures of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, these have been already so amply and excellently stated by the Seraphic Pen of a great Prelate of our Church, in a just Discourse upon this Occasion, that there needs nothing to be further added; nor should I offer to write an <hi>Iliad</hi> after such an <hi>Homer,</hi> did I not think it more necessary to the Intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this work in <hi>general,</hi> than to make up any defect in this <hi>Particular</hi> Part, which that excellent Author has not supplied. I shall therefore be the more brief and sparing in this Account.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Now I suppose all that is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Regulation of Friendship may conveniently be reduced to these
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60271:71"/>
three general considerations. First what Measures are to be observed in the Contracting of Friendship. 2ly What Measures are to be observ'd in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting or maintaining it. 3ly What Measures are to be observ'd in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 In the contracting of Friendship our first care must be to make such a choice as we shall never have cause to <hi>repent</hi> of. For when ever we cease to <hi>love</hi> a Friend, 'tis great odds if we do not <hi>mortally hate</hi> him. For 'tis hard to maintain a <hi>Mediocrity;</hi> and nothing can reflect more upon our Prudence and Discretion, than to <hi>hate</hi> him whom we once thought worthy of our <hi>highest</hi> love.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Now that we may not repent of our Choice, the Measures to be observ'd are these. First, that the Person whom we mark out for a Friend, be a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> Man. For an ill man can neither long <hi>love,</hi> nor be long <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd.</hi> Not by a <hi>good</hi> man to be sure,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60271:72"/>
nor indeed by one as <hi>bad</hi> as <hi>himself.</hi> For this is a true Observation, that however men love evil in <hi>themselves,</hi> yet no man loves it in <hi>another,</hi> and tho a man may be a Friend to <hi>Sin,</hi> yet no body loves the <hi>Sinner.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we find that the Friendships of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are the most <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>short-lived</hi> things in the world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are rather to be call'd <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> than <hi>Friendships.</hi> And besides their Interests will draw them several waies, and so distract and divide their union; for vice is full of <hi>Variety</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> sets one and the same man at odds with <hi>himself,</hi> much more with <hi>another.</hi> But now Virtue is a thing of <hi>oneness, simplicity</hi> and <hi>uniformity,</hi> and indeed the only solid Foundation for Friendship.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 The next Measure is that we chuse a Person of a <hi>sweet, liberal and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humour.</hi> For there are a thousand little endearments and compliances in the exercise of Friendship, that make
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60271:72"/>
                        <hi>good Nature</hi> and necessary as <hi>rigid virtue</hi> and <hi>Honesty.</hi> Strict vertue in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is like the exact Rules of <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> in Musical compositions, which indeed are necessary to make the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>true</hi> and <hi>regular,</hi> but then there must be something of <hi>Ayre</hi> and <hi>Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in it too, to <hi>sweeten</hi> and recommend it, or else 'twill be but flat and heavy.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 The next Measure to this purpose is that we chuse a Person of a humour and disposition as nigh our <hi>own</hi> as we can. This will make our friendly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications both more <hi>pleasant</hi> and more <hi>lasting.</hi> The other qualities are as the <hi>Materials</hi> in Building, this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to <hi>Figure</hi> and shape. And unless the Materials be of an agreeable and correspondent <hi>figure,</hi> though otherwise never so good, the structure will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be sightly to the eye, nor hold long together.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 One thing more I would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd in the contracting of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that is, that we don't make
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60271:73"/>
our selves over to too <hi>many.</hi> Marriage which is the strictest of Frienships ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits but of <hi>one,</hi> and indeed inferiour Friendship admits not of many more. For besides that the Tide of Love, by reason of the contractedness of our faculties, can't bear very high when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among several channels, 'tis great odds but that among many we shall be deceiv'd in some, and then we must be put upon the inconvenience of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>retractation of choice,</hi> which in nothing is so uncomely and inconvenient as in <hi>friendship.</hi> Be <hi>kind</hi> therefore to <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>Intimate</hi> only with <hi>a few.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11 Now the Measures of conducting and maintaining friendship may be such as these. 1. That we look upon our Friend as another self, and treat him accordingly. 2. That we love him fervently, effectually and constantly. 3. That we <hi>use</hi> his conversation <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> and <hi>alwaies prefer</hi> it. 4. That we trust him with our Secrets and most
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60271:73"/>
important concerns. 5. That we make use of his help and service, and be not shy of being obliged to him. 6. That we don't easily entertain any Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies or Suspicions of him. 7. That we defend his Reputation when we hear it wrongfully charged. 8. That we wink at those small faults which he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> has. 9. That we take the Freedom to <hi>advise,</hi> and if need be, to <hi>reprove</hi> him, and that we be well contented to take the same usage from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. 10. That we freely pay him that Respect and just Acknowledgment that's due to his Merits, and that we shew our selves pleased when the same is done by others. 11. That we do not <hi>envy</hi> him when advanced above us, nor <hi>despise</hi> him when fallen beneath us. 12. That we relieve him plentifully and liberally when reduced to any streights or exigencyes. And lastly, that we alwaies prefer the good of his Soul before any other interest of his, and make it our strictest concern to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60271:74"/>
his Happy condition in the other world. This indeed is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and necessary Office of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and all without this is but of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle signification.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And thus much for the <hi>Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> of Friendship. I proceed now to the Measures that are to be observ'd in the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of it. And here two things come to be consider'd, the <hi>Cause,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of dissolving it. And first, 'tis supposed that there may be a Cause for the <hi>Dissolution</hi> even of <hi>Friendship.</hi> The wise man tells us, that for some things every Friend will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and Marriage, which is the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Frindship, has its <hi>Divorce.</hi> For tis with the union of two Friends, as with the union of Soul and Body. There are some degrees of distemperature that, although they weaken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the union, yet however they are consistent with it, but then there are others again, that quite destroy the <hi>Vital Congruity,</hi> and then follows <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60271:74"/>13 Now as to the Cause, that may justify a Dissolution of Friendsh, it can be no other than something, that is directly contrary to the very Design and Essence of Friendship, such as a notorious Apostacy to vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, notorious Perfidiousness, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Malice or the like. To which (were I to speak my own sense) I would add, a desperate and resolv'd conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in all this, For I think as long as there is any hopes of amendment, the man is rather to be <hi>Advised</hi> than <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14 But if hopeless and irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we may and must desert him. But let it be with all the tenderness imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, with as much unwillingness and reluctancy as the Soul leaves her <hi>over-distemper'd</hi> Body. And now our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est care must be that our former Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness turn not to inveterate Hatred. There is great danger of this, but it ought not to be so. For tho the <hi>Friend</hi> be gone, yet still the <hi>Man</hi> remains, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60271:75"/>
tho he has forfetted my <hi>Friendship,</hi> yet still I owe him <hi>common Charity.</hi> And 'twere well if we would rise a little higher, and even yet pay him some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle respect, and maintain a small <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-current</hi> of Affection for him, upon the stock of our former dearness and Intimacy. For so the deceased Ghost loves to hover for a while about her old Companion, though by reason of its <hi>utter discongruity,</hi> it be no longer fit for the mutuall intercourses of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Action.</hi>

                  <head>MOTIVES TO THE STUDY AND PRACTICE OF REGULAR LOVE By way of Consideration.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. COnsider O my Soul, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Essence</hi> of the most <hi>Perfect</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>Regular Love.</hi> The very same <hi>Apostle</hi> that saies <hi>God is Love,</hi> saies also in another place that <hi>God is Light,</hi> and that in him <hi>there is no darkness at all,</hi> Joh. 1.5. God therefore is both <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Light</hi>; Light invigorated and actuated by Love, and Love directed and regulated by Light. He is indeed a Lucid and Bright act of Love, not Arbitrary Love, but Love regulated by the exactest Rules and Measures of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60271:76"/>
                     <hi>Essential</hi> Perfection. For how Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a Love must that needs be, where the same Being is both <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Light</hi>!</p>

Love</hi> that makes up the Harmony of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> world, as <hi>Regular Motion</hi> does that of the <hi>Natural.</hi> That Regularity of the <hi>understanding</hi> is of no other Moment or Excellency, than as it serves to the Regulating of <hi>Love.</hi> That herein lies the Formal Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and bad <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>this</hi> world, and between the good and bad <hi>Spirits</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> Brightness of <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is Common to both, and for ought we know, in an equal Measure, but one of these <hi>loves Regularly</hi> and the other does not, and therefore one we call an <hi>Angel,</hi> and t'other a <hi>Devil.</hi> For 'tis Regular Love upon which the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Civil Happiness of Society de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. This is in all respects the same to the <hi>Moral</hi> world, as <hi>Motion</hi> is to the <hi>Natural.</hi> And as this is maintain'd in its Course by <hi>Regularity</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> so must the other be upheld by <hi>Regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> And therefore further.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider O my Soul, that the God of <hi>Order,</hi> he that is both <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:60271:77"/>
has prescribed two sort of Laws with respect to the two worlds, <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> Indeed the Latter have not their Effect as <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily</hi> and determinately as the former; for the Laws of <hi>Motion</hi> God executes by himself, but the Laws of <hi>Love</hi> he has committed to the execution of his Creatures, having endow'd them with choice and Liberty. But let not this my Soul be used as an Argument to make thee less Studious of Loving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, because thou art not irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly determin'd and necessitated to Love according to Order, but art left to thy own Choice and Liberty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thou fancy God less concern'd for the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> than for the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Motion,</hi> because he has not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced those, with the same <hi>Necessity</hi> as he has these, For</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Consider yet further My Soul, that God has taken as much care for the Regulation of Love as is consistent with the Nature of <hi>Free Agents.</hi> For
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60271:77"/>
has he not prescribed Laws of Regular Love? And has he not furnish'd thee with a stock of <hi>Natural Light</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, of Reason and Discourse to discern the <hi>Antecedent</hi> Equity and Reasonableness of these Laws? And lest thou should'st be negligent in the use of this <hi>Discursive Light,</hi> has he not as a farther security of thy Regular Love against the danger either of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> or <hi>Inconsideration,</hi> furnish'd thee with certain <hi>Moral Anticipations</hi> and <hi>Rational Instincts,</hi> which prevent all thy Reasonings and Discoursings about what thou oughtest to Love, and point out the great Lines of thy Duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art able, and when thou dost not attend enough to see into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural grounds of it. And left all this should prove insufficient or ineffectual, has he not bound thy Duty upon thee by the most weighty <hi>Sanctions,</hi> and most prevailing <hi>Ingagements</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> of Eternal Happiness, and Eternal Misery? And
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60271:78"/>
to make all this efficacious, does he not assist thee by the Graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Regulation of thy Love? And what can God do more with the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his <hi>own Wisdom,</hi> and of <hi>thy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</hi> And lest thou should'st fancy that 'tis either <hi>in vain,</hi> or <hi>unnecessary</hi> to apply thy self to the Study of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Love,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Consider yet further My Soul, that the great <hi>Mystery of godliness</hi> is nothing else but a <hi>Mysterious Expedient for the promotion of Regular Love.</hi> As it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Love, so does it wholly tend to the Regulation of it. 'Twas to attone for the Irregularities of Love, that the Son of God became a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his Father. To attone for it so far, that all the Lapses and Misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of our Love should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, provided we return to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of Love for the future. Had he not done <hi>so much,</hi> to return to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Love had been <hi>in vain,</hi> and had he done more, it had been <hi>Needless.</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60271:78"/>
But herein is the <hi>Mystery of Godliness,</hi> that by the wise dispensation of God the matter is so order'd, that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is attainable by the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and not without it. And can there be a stronger ingagement, O my Soul, to perswade thee to the Study of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Love, or to convince thee that God is not less concern'd for the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the <hi>Moral,</hi> than of the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> world, for the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> than for the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Motion?</hi> Be wise then O my Soul, and consult the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and thy <hi>own Eternal Happiness.</hi> And that these thy Considerations may be the more effectual, apply thy self with all possible elevation of spirit to the God of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>

                     <p>But there is more in the business yet.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I Have received your very civil and elegant Latin Letter, but answer you according to my constant use to our own Countrey men, in English. You have therein such significations of your kindness and esteem for me and my writings, that you have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obliged me to a professed readiness to serve you in any thing that lies in my power. And therefore without any further Ceremony I shall endeavour, as touching those two difficulties you propound, to give you the best satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I can. The first difficulty, if I understand you aright, is this: How that <hi>Immobile Extensum</hi> distinct from matter which in my <hi>Enchiridium Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicum</hi> I demonstrate to exist, can truely be said to be infinite, when as it has <hi>all</hi> its parts that are or can be <hi>coexistent at once.</hi> Because to exist ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>all</hi> its parts at <hi>once</hi> is to be <hi>included</hi> within certain limits, as any number how big soever is conteined
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60271:84"/>
under some certain species of Number, and therewithal conceived finite as the term [<hi>All</hi>] also implyes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>successive Quantity</hi> seems more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being infinite then <hi>permanent Quantity,</hi> because there may be still more parts coming on; when as in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Quantity all the parts are at once, and that term [<hi>All</hi>] includes an actual bounding of the whole. This I conceive is the full scope of the first difficulty propounded.</p>
                     <p>To which I breifly answer first, That that <hi>Immobile Extensum</hi> distinct from matter, being really a substance In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal, I do not conceive that the Term [Parts] in a Physical sense does properly belong thereto, every Incorporeal substance or spirit, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my notion of things, being <hi>Ens unum per se &amp; non per aliud,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore utterly indiscerpible into parts, it implying a contradiction, that this of the substance or Essence should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from that, the entire substance
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60271:84"/>
being <hi>Ens unum per se &amp; non per aliud.</hi> But understanding by parts onely <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or Logical</hi> parts, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with this Indiscerpibility, wee'll ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the phrase in this sense for more easy and distinct discourse sake, and also of <hi>Totum</hi> and <hi>Omne</hi> and whatever is a kin to them. And the same cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I premize touching the word [Quantity] that we take it not in that crass Physical sense, such as belongs to matter and bodyes, but meerly in that notional and Logical sense, which is so general that it clashes not at all with the <hi>sacrosanctity,</hi> as I may so speak, of incorporeal substances.</p>
                     <p>And now secondly to come nearer to the point, if we mind closely and distinctly, what sense we have of those terms <hi>Totum</hi> and <hi>Omne,</hi> we shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly discern, that they may signify either the <hi>Entireness-Indefectuousness</hi> or <hi>Perfection</hi> of the thing they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced of, or meerly that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>left out</hi> of that subject they are
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60271:85"/>
spoken of, or else they imply also a <hi>comprehensibleness, limitableness,</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustableness</hi> of the number of those parts which are said <hi>all</hi> to be there. In this sense is <hi>Totum</hi> plainly used in <hi>summa totalis</hi> at the <hi>foot of a reckoning.</hi> But for those that hold Infinity of worlds at once, and infinite Matter, when they will easily acknowledge, That <hi>omnes partes Materiae sunt divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi> understanding by <hi>Materia</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of Atoms; <hi>Omnes Mundi genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles &amp; corruptibiles,</hi> and <hi>Tota Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Mundana impenetrabilis,</hi> without the least suspicion that they thereby imply, that there is onely a finite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of worlds, or parts of Matter, or that all the matter of the Universe taken together is but finite; It is plain that to them the former sense is as easy and natural of <hi>Totum</hi> and <hi>Omne</hi> as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And indeed to speak my own mind, I think it is the most natural and proper of all and the onely true Logical sense of <hi>omne</hi> and <hi>totum</hi>; which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60271:85"/>
suspends it self from making the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of which it is pronounced, either finite or infinite, but declares onely whatever it be that there is no part left out of that Subject it pronounces of. So that if <hi>Totum,</hi> or <hi>Omne,</hi> or <hi>omnes partes</hi> be pronounced of a Subject infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it leaves nothing of that infinite Subject out nor omits any parts, and consequentially implies the perfect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity thereof. So far is it from curbing or terminating it, it reaching as far as that absolute Infinity it is pronounced of. So that it is the subject of which <hi>Omne &amp; Totum</hi> are pronounced, when it is finite that makes them have a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite signification, and not the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick sense of those terms themselves. Whence I think we may discern, that there is no Repugnancy to assert that all the parts of that <hi>Immobile Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> distinct from Matter do exist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at once, though it be infinite, and that [<hi>All</hi>] in this <hi>Enunciation</hi> does not curb the Immensity of this

                        <hi>Extensum,</hi> but rather necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes it according to the true Logical Notion thereof, that term being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies commensurate, when it is truely used to the subject it is spoken of.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, it is onely <hi>permanent Quantity,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>indiscerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> whose parts are all at once, that is capable of <hi>absolute Infinity.</hi> But as for <hi>successive Quantity,</hi> it is not capable of being infinite, neither a <hi>parte ante</hi> nor a <hi>parte post.</hi> But your phancy seems unawares to have transferred the property of <hi>successive quantity</hi> to the permanet, and so because, so soon as we can say of successive quantity there is <hi>all of it,</hi> it implyes certainly there is an <hi>end of it,</hi> and so it is finite; so you seem unawares to have imagined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is true of the parts of perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Quantity that there is <hi>all of them at once,</hi> therefore they are now <hi>exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as the parts of successive Quantity were, and therefore are finite. This I think is the sophisme you put upon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60271:86"/>
your self. But you are the best judge of your own meaning.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the second difficulty, it seems such to you from your missing my meaning in my bringing in that Instance of Wax drawn out an Ell long. And after reduced into the form of a Globe, suppose no bigger than of an ordinary Nutmeg: An heedless or Idiotick Spectator of this change may haply imagine the dimension of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude quite lost thereby, whenas there is not one Atom of the quantity thereof lost by this change of Site, no more than there is of the <hi>substance</hi> of the wax. But what seems lost in Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it is compensated in Latitude and profundity. So say I of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of a created Spirit, suppose from a spherical form, (for we must take some figure or other) of half a yard diameter, to a sphear of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Retraction of it self into so much less an <hi>Vbi</hi> (eight times less than before) for as much as nothing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60271:87"/>
of its substance is annihilated thereby, nothing of its dimensions is, but what seems to be lost in Longitude, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and profundity, is gained or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated in <hi>Essential spissitude,</hi> which is that <hi>fourth dimension</hi> I stand for, that it is in <hi>Rerum Natura.</hi> Which tho it is more particularly belonging to the contraction of one and the same spirit into it self, yet it is also truely found, when any two substances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever adequately occupy the same <hi>Vbi;</hi> As suppose a Spirit occupyd a <hi>Cube</hi> of Matter of such a <hi>side</hi> or <hi>Diameter.</hi> The spirit and the <hi>Cube</hi> have their proper dimensions each of them in the same <hi>Vbi,</hi> and therefore are an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a real <hi>essential spissitude</hi> in that <hi>Vbi.</hi> And if there were another Spirit in like manner occupying the same <hi>Cube,</hi> there would be still a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>essential spissitude.</hi> And he that will not grant this <hi>essential spissitude,</hi> He must either list himself with that ridiculous Sect of the <hi>Nullibists,</hi> or that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60271:87"/>
wretched sect of the <hi>Materialists,</hi> or <hi>Atheists,</hi> that hold there is nothing but matter in the Universe, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have again and again demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to be false in this <hi>Enchiridium</hi> of mine. But I suppose out of what has been said, you see plainly now that by the contraction of a Spirit, I mean that of the same spirit, whereby it may occupy a less <hi>Vbi</hi> than before, and not of several spirits so contracted, that they may take up no more space then any one of them did before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. And these hints I doubt not are sufficient to one of such quick parts as yours, to make you thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distinctly understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the 7th Section of the 28th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my <hi>Enchiridium Metaphysocum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To satisfy your desire of knowing my intention touching the finishing the said <hi>Enchiridium,</hi> I must confess to you freely, that I have no purpose of so doing. I am now of a great Age, above threescore and ten, and have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60271:88"/>
other designs also. And besides, this first part which I have finished is the most useful, the most assured, and yet I add the most difficult of all; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoroughly made out the main truths of the existence of Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and what its nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is, intelligibly and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, I make account the greatest business is done, and I may leave the rest to others, especially there being laid in so much already in other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of mine, as you may observe in reading the <hi>Scholia</hi> upon the 21 Sect. of the 28th chapter of the <hi>Enchiridium.</hi> Where yet I have left out what is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, my <hi>Cabbala Philosophica,</hi> &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the <hi>Iewish Mercava,</hi> or <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiels Vision,</hi> the right understanding whereof contains the choicest secrets of the <hi>Iewish Theosophy</hi> or <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi>

Which gives me incouragement to trouble you with another Inquiry, especially since I find you <hi>willing</hi> as well as <hi>able</hi> to inform, and that you do not send away those that inquire of you, as the Sullen Oracle did <hi>Augustus,</hi> asking concerning his Successour with

                     </p>
                     <p>The thing then is this. I am not well resolv'd concerning the Moral Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sensuality. Not of such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it as are complicated and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with <hi>civil incommodotyes,</hi> such as <hi>Adultery, Fornication,</hi> &amp;c. (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which 'tis easy to account from those mischeifs, which, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present system of the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual world, they necessarily bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60271:89"/>
Mankind) but of sensuality as such. Now concerning this I inquire, 1. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Moral Turpitude in it or no. And 2ly, supposing there is, wherein it lies. For my own part I am so divided betwixt Arguments on both sides, that I know not what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve. For first that there is some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or intrinsick Turpitude, in Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as such, I am tempted to suspect from the Authority of many great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists (especially among the Antients) who, when they lay open the immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Adultery or Fornication, do not fetch their Arguments wholely from those ill effects, which either of them has upon the welfare of society, but resolve <hi>part</hi> of their immorality into <hi>Sensuality as such,</hi> abstracted from those other ill Consequences. Besides I observe, that in the Divine Writings (not to say any thing of our Ordinary Oral discourses) such peculiar Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes and Adjuncts of infamy are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Adultery, which can belong to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60271:90"/>
it on no other score, than as 'tis an act of sensuality. Nay, and as if that were the principal Ingredient, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes receives a Denomination from the sensuality, but never from the injustice, infaithfulness, or the like. Thus it is call'd the <hi>sin of uncleanness.</hi> And Adulterers are said to be <hi>unclean</hi> persons, <hi>filthy, brutish,</hi> &amp;c. In the like manner <hi>David,</hi> in his Penitentials for that sin, insists much upon its <hi>sensuality,</hi> and accordingly speaks of <hi>washing,</hi> and <hi>cleansing,</hi> and <hi>making clean.</hi> All which seems to imply, that the immorality of Adutery is not <hi>wholly</hi> to be deriv'd from those mischeivous effects it has upon <hi>Society,</hi> but does also <hi>partly</hi> (if not <hi>chiefly</hi>) consist in the <hi>mere sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and consequently that Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as such is immoral.</p>
                     <p>Again 2ly (to proceed from <hi>mental</hi> abstraction to <hi>real</hi> separation) there are some acts of sensuality (such as voluntary Pollutions &amp;c.) which are really separated from such ill effects,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60271:90"/>
and yet these by the consent of all Nations were ever condemn'd as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable and immoral, and yet there is nothing in them besides the <hi>sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and consequently there seems to be a Moral Turpitude even in <hi>Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as such.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again 3ly, that there is some natural Turpitude in Sensuality as such, I am apt to believe, when I consider how unanimously 'tis vilify'd and decry'd by those, who were mere strangers to Revelation, and so could not derive this Notion from the prohibition of <hi>some certain Species</hi> of it. Sir I need not tell you, what a Continual Topic for Invectives this has been to the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists</hi> and <hi>Stoicks.</hi> Now how these men, who follow'd the mere Conduct of Nature, should all conspire in such abject and disdainful thoughts of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, unless it were some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disagreeable to the unsophisticate and <hi>genuin relish</hi> of the Soul, I cannot comprehend.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60271:91"/>Again 4ly and lastly, that there is some Natural intrinsick Turpitude in Sensuality as such, seems to receive no small confirmation from that <hi>natural shame,</hi> which attends the acting of it, and that not only in Circumstances professedly unlawful, but also in those which are otherwise reputed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men seem conscious to themselves of some incongruity in the <hi>thing as such.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this and more that might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, it seems to me that there must be some Moral Turpitude in sensuality as such. But now wherein this immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity should ly, I am still to seek. As also I am how to unwind my self from the Difficulties of the other side. For first, I find that the more Modern Masters of Morality (such as <hi>Grotius,</hi> Dr <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Puffendorf</hi> with many others) resolve the immorality of Adultery wholly into those pernicious effects it has upon Society, without bringing in the <hi>sensuality as such</hi> into any part of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60271:91"/>
the Account, which they could not do, did they Apprehend any moral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude in Sensuality as such.</p>
                     <p>Again 2ly, that there is no moral Turpitude in Sensuality as such, seems to appear from hence, that if there were, it would be so in all its instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Consequently even in <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> it self. But 'tis said <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. So that hence arises a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difficulty. For if there be <hi>no</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Turpitude in sensuality as such, then all abstracted Acts of it (as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Pollutions &amp;c.) must be held <hi>lawful,</hi> which are yet <hi>condemn'd.</hi> And if there <hi>be,</hi> then Marriage must be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd,</hi> which yet is held <hi>lawful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again 3ly, I can see no reason why that sort of <hi>Corporal indulgency,</hi> which is emphatically call'd <hi>sensuality,</hi> should be charged with any moral Turpitude, when as <hi>other pleasures</hi> of sense (and those perhaps equally intense) are not so. Such as using choice perfumes, eating delicious Sweet-meats, &amp;c. Tis
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60271:92"/>
plain these all agree in this, that they are gratifications of sense, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why there should be a Moral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude in one, and not in another, I am yet to learn.</p>
                     <p>Again 4ly and lastly, to argue from the simple and absolute nature of the thing, I cannot imagine how it should be a Moral incongruity for a man to <hi>please</hi> himself. What malice is there in it either against God, himself, or his Neighbour? For that there is in some particular instance (as in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery) or in Degree (as in intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) is purely accidental, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be charged upon sensuality as such.</p>
                     <p>These considerations do prevail with me to think, that there is no Moral Turpitude in Sensuality as such, that all the Pleasures of sense are in <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> equally indifferent, like the <hi>Trees of Paradise.</hi> So that if that, which we here treat of, only be evil, it must be (as the forbidden Fruit) because
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60271:92"/>
                        <hi>made so</hi> by a <hi>Positive</hi> law (which yet I know not of) as an instance to try our obedience. But how to reconcile this with the former difficulties, I profess I know not. And here Sir, I desire your unerring hand to lead me out of this Labyrinth, and that at your own lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, (For I am not in hast, and would by no means be troublesome to you) you would be pleased to give me a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of this whole matter, and that you would not only <hi>satisfy</hi> the <hi>Doubts,</hi> but also <hi>pardon</hi> the <hi>boldness</hi> of</p>

                     <p>YOU may very well judge me more than ordinarily rude and uncivil, that I have not all this time answered your so friendly and affectionate Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But I have such abundance of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness lying upon my hands, that I could not find time till now, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing that I shall be suddenly more busy than before, in this strait of time that I am in, I have chosen, rather than to be still silent, to write, though but <hi>briefly,</hi> and it may be <hi>brokenly</hi> to the point you propound. Viz. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Moral Turpitude of Sensuality.</hi> You have shewed a great deal of not onely wit and eloquence, but solidity of Reason in pleading <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> in the case. But you had proceeded more clearly, if you had first defined what you meant by <hi>sensuality,</hi> (which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary acception of the word, signifies <hi>immorally,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60271:93"/>
an irregular and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indulgence of the pleasure of the grosser senses) and so the business had been less difficult. But considering the whole matter of your arguing on both sides, I perceive you mean no more by sensuality, then the pleasure of what <hi>Iul. Scaliger</hi> in his <hi>Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> calleth the <hi>sixt sense.</hi> For so he counts <hi>that Tactus venereus,</hi> which some are so taken with. And therefore, if you will, we will state the Question according to his phrase, and it shall be, whether the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense</hi> have any Moral Turpitude in it. Wherein I will adventure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that it has not as such. But to be captivated to that pleasure, so as to make us less capable of that, which is better, or to break the laws of what is just and decorous, this is the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude that is contracted therein, and argues him, that is thus captivated, to be brutish and sensual in the ordinary sense of the word. And therefore it is
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60271:94"/>
no wonder such persons are stiled fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, brutish, and unclean in the holy Scriptures, because the <hi>goatish</hi> nature has got dominion over them. You have urged excellently well for the Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sensuality hitherto taken in the usual sense, though prescinded from the consequent Inconveniencies thereof. But now that <hi>Platonists</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry without Revelation, the delight of corporeal pleasures, and that there is a <hi>natural shame</hi> of having to do with those pleasures of the <hi>sixt sense,</hi> this looks like a shrewd argument for an <hi>innate turpitude</hi> in those very pleasures themselves, though in lawful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; But yet I conceive this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of natural shame, if rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, does not so much intimate any <hi>Moral Turpitude</hi> in having to do with the pleasures of the <hi>sixt sense,</hi> as admonishes us, that though these things rightly circumstantiated have no Moral Turpitude in them, yet such is the nobleness of the Soul of man, that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60271:94"/>
such gross enjoyments are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly below her, who is designed for an <hi>Angelical life,</hi> where <hi>they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore even nature has taught her to <hi>sneak,</hi> when, she being Heaven-born, demits her noble self to such <hi>earthly drudgery.</hi> If this Passion of Venereal shame be rightly interpreted, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this is all it signifies, and not that there is any <hi>intrinsick Immorality</hi> or Turpitude in the pleasures of the <hi>sixt sense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for sensuality taken in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sense, of which Adultery is a <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen,</hi> most certainly there is a foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and uncleanness in it, distinct from what it sins against <hi>Political So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> which by no means is the <hi>adequate measure</hi> of sound Morality, but there is a <hi>Moral Perfection</hi> of human nature <hi>antecedent</hi> to all Society. I pray read what I have writ on this Argument in my <hi>Scholia</hi> on the 3 Sect. of the 4 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the first Book of my <hi>Enchriridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

This rightly phrasing the point in question takes away all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that would infer <hi>no</hi> moral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude, where there <hi>is</hi> such, or <hi>any</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Turpitude, where there is <hi>none.</hi> To your third plea for no moral Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I answer, that corporeal pleasures in eating and drinking &amp;c. if they be <hi>irregular</hi> or <hi>excessive,</hi> have a moral Turpitude in them. Viz. if they are so much as to hinder and lessen the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enjoyments of the Soul, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the design of living <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> some where speaks, and makes our bodies a less commodious Temple for the spirit of God to dwell in. And to your fourth and last, wherein you say you cannot imagine how it should be a moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity for a man to <hi>please</hi> himself. <hi>What malice is there in it either against
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60271:95"/>
God, himself, or his neighbour?</hi> You say right, he may mean no ill to <hi>himself,</hi> but he may <hi>mistake</hi> himself, and out of ignorance of the dignity of his own nature, take that to be <hi>chiefly himself,</hi> which is least of all himself, or the meanest part of him, I mean that part which is common to him with the Brutes, the pleasures of which life the more he endeavours to shun, as far as is consistent with the health of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and disdains to be captivated with the gratifications of the flesh, the more surely will he arise into the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such a life, as is unexpressibly above all the pleasures this mortal flesh can afford. But he that layes his hand to the plough and looks back is not fit for the kingdom of God. There must be assiduity, constancy, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual guard and watchfulness over a mans waies, over the Inclinations of of his mind and outward words and actions, and devotional addresses to God for further <hi>illumination</hi> &amp; strengths,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60271:96"/>
to carry on the work of <hi>real Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and the issue will at last be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effably pleasing and glorious. And he, that gives himself up to such a <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> of life, will not miss of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>clearness</hi> of all <hi>useful truths.</hi> And when his <hi>true self</hi> is <hi>awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened</hi> in him, it will be a <hi>Moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> to please himself, that is, that Intellectual and Godlike life and sense <hi>raised</hi> in him. And all the <hi>Trees of Paradise,</hi> which God has planted, the <hi>pleasures of all the six Senses,</hi> he may tast of, so long as he keeps in the life aforesaid, and makes that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all his inferiour Enjoyments, that he is not <hi>lessened above,</hi> by being captivated by any thing <hi>below.</hi> Then the pleasure of the sixt sense is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, nor is there any thing forbid in the <hi>Paradise of God,</hi> but the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our own lust and will. I hope out of this you will pick out my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though this pinch of time that I am in, has made me but huddle up
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60271:96"/>
things together with less order than I usually endeavour to do. Thus in some hast committing you to Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous keeping, I take leave and rest,</p>

                     <p>SUddainly after my receiving your last, I withdrew into the Country, whence I am but lately return'd. I had no manner of conveniency of writing to you there, but now I have, I think, my self obliged to use it forthwith, left you should suspect that I am forgetful of <hi>you,</hi> or of the <hi>thanks</hi> I owe you for your last excellent Letter. It gave me much satisfaction in several things, and I read it (as indeed I do every
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60271:97"/>
thing of yours) with a <hi>peculiar</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But since I have begun to move a Question, and you have been so kind as to Communicate to me your thoughts concerning it, I hope you will not take it amiss, if in order to the clearing up the whole matter I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume it, and desire from you some further satisfaction obout it.</p>
                     <p>The Summ of the Determination which you give to the Difficulty I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, is (if I understand you right) in short this. You distinguish of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality as it signifies <hi>Concretely</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morally</hi> either as to <hi>Measure</hi> or <hi>other Circumstance,</hi> Or as 'tis <hi>Simply</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of the <hi>pleasure</hi> of the <hi>sixth Sense.</hi> Which last (that which I meant in my inquiry) you acquit from all Moral Turpitude. Now I confess I am and ever was perfectly herein of your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that (among other reasons) because of the <hi>Divine Institution</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</hi> Only there is one thing that still sticks with me. I find my self still
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60271:97"/>
intangled in one of my Difficulties which, tho in your Answer you take notice of it, appears to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the most considerable of all. 'Tis this, that if there be no Moral Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the simple perception of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal pleasure, then all <hi>Abstracted</hi> acts of it, such as voluntary pollutions, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious embraces &amp;c. must be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful, which are yet condemn'd by all Moral and Divine writers. The reason of the Consequence is, because there seems to be nothing in such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted acts, besides the <hi>simple Pecepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pleasure of the sixth Sense.</hi> For as for excess, Captivation of Spirit, too sensitive applications and the like, these are merely <hi>accidental,</hi> and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incident to the same acts in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumstances.</p>
                     <p>This is the short of the Difficulty, which I need not persue in more words to a person of your exquisite Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Sir I humbly crave your sense in this point, (the only thing not clear'd

                     <p>IT is now above a Month since I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yours. But Indisposition of Body, and several unexpected Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences have hindred me from writing till now. If my memory fail me not, I intimated to you in my last, that I would read over again that Sermon, which you was pleased to dedicate to me, and signify to you more of my mind touching it. Wherefore to be as good as my word, I will take notice of a Passage or two, before I answer this present Letter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60271:98"/>You fall, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. upon a very <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Subject,</hi> viz. What it is, in which our pretense to free Agency may be safely grounded, whether in the <hi>will</hi> or <hi>understanding.</hi> And in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the point in hand, you do with good judgment declare against talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the will and understanding, as faculties <hi>really distinct</hi> either from <hi>one another,</hi> or the <hi>Soul her self.</hi> But tho you begin thus hopefully, yet methinks you run your self into an unnecessary nooze of Fatality, by granting the Soul necessarily wills as she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands; you know that of the Poet. —<hi>Video meliora proboque, Deteriora se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</hi> —And for my part, I suspect there are very few men, if they will speak out, but they have experienced that truth. Else they would be in the state of <hi>sincerity,</hi> which over few are.</p>
                     <p>But now that you would salve the <hi>Phenomenon</hi> of free Agency, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. by making it depend upon the degrees of <hi>Advertency</hi> or <hi>Attention</hi> which the Soul
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60271:99"/>
uses, and which to use either more or less, is fully and immediatly in her own power, this is an Invention ingeniously excogitated, to escape the difficulty you have cast your self into, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Soul necessarily wills as she <hi>understands,</hi> and necessarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands as the <hi>Object appears</hi> to her. For thus indeed we were <hi>frozen up</hi> in a <hi>rigid Fatality</hi> and <hi>Necessity.</hi> But this does not cast the ground of free Agency upon the Soul as <hi>Intelligent,</hi> more than as <hi>Volent,</hi> if so much. For unless she <hi>will</hi> exert her Advertency or Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how can she to any degree advert or attend to the Object? So that the ground of free Agency will be still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into the Soul, not as <hi>Intelligent,</hi> but as <hi>Volent,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to understand the nature of every Object she is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to speculate.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, though the Soul be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to exert her Advertency or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Object, this <hi>alone</hi> seems but a defective Principle as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60271:99"/>
us into the ability and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of closing with what is best, as discerning it to be so. For as the eye, let it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> never so much, if it be vitiated in it self, cannot rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern the condition of the visible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it fixes its sight upon; so the mind of man, let him set himself never so diligently to contemplate any <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Intelligible</hi> Object, if she be made dim by Moral corruptions and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, will not be able or free to close with what is best in the Circumstances that lye before her, being held cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the vices the Party has not yet purifyed himself from. Wherefore the true ground of our being able and free to chuse what is best, consists rather in the <hi>purity</hi> of the Soul from vice, than in <hi>Advertency</hi> and <hi>Attention</hi> to the Object, while the mind is vitiated and obscured for want of due <hi>purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Which the best <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> have alwaies declared to be requisite to true <hi>Illumination.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60271:100"/>And that notable <hi>Instance</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome,</hi> which you bring in to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the case, methinks, may be made rather to illustrate and confirm what I drive at. Viz. that there is something of greater weight than <hi>Advertence</hi> or <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> that will enable a man to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the truth with his blood. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the mere being <hi>notionally convinced,</hi> that sin, or such a sin as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of Christ, is the greatest evil in the world, though he never so closely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this truth in the <hi>Notion</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if the old man or carnal mind be still alive in him, that crafty Serpent will not fail to suggest such evasions or Tergiversations, as will excuse him from suffering, and that, it may be, though he do firmly believe the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, and Joyes of Heaven after this life. For the <hi>Mercy of God,</hi> and <hi>future Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Violence</hi> of the <hi>Temptation,</hi> or <hi>pretense of making amends some other way,</hi> and I know not how many other such slim Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60271:100"/>
may be fool the Unregenerate man from ever adventuring to suffer Martyrdome.</p>
                     <p>But he that is to a due degree Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and made, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, <hi>Partaker of the Divine nature;</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life in the New Birth being <hi>awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened</hi> in him, and the Love of God in him perfected; this <hi>New Nature</hi> in him into which he is born from above, having rather <hi>quicker sensations</hi> than the <hi>Animal Nature</hi> it self, this is the thing indeed that will secure the crown of Martyrdom to him, nor will he be liable to be imposed upon by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, to listen to such Evasions and Tergiversations as I mentioned before, but had rather dye a thousand natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deaths, than <hi>wound</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> into which he is rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. Wherefore no fear of pain from man can shake him; the <hi>Love</hi> of the Lord Jesus and of his life, into which he is regenerate, being <hi>stronger than Death,</hi> and all pains of the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60271:101"/>
life</hi> more tolerable by far to him, than to <hi>wound</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> in him, which is <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is that which the beloved Apostle <hi>S. Iohn</hi> witnesses, 1 Joh. 4.18. That <hi>there is no fear in Love, but perfect love casteth out fear. Because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love.</hi> And towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Chapter he saies, <hi>Greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world.</hi> Speaking of the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the spirit of the <hi>World.</hi> These things I hint to you to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that sometimes more than the <hi>notional attending</hi> to the hainousness of sin is required to furnish out a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. And that our being redeemed into an ability or freedom of chusing what is best, is not from <hi>mere attention</hi> to the Object, but from <hi>Purification, Illumination</hi> and <hi>real Regeneration</hi> into the <hi>Divine Image.</hi> But I cannot insist largely on any thing. <hi>Verbum sapienti sat est.</hi>

                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:60271:101"/>I will onely take notice of one place more in your ingenious Discourse, and that is, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. where I stumbled a little at your seeming severity towards the <hi>severe Masters,</hi> as you call them, of <hi>Spiritual Mortification.</hi> I confess some passages in them lye fair for your lash. But the high and Hyperbolical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of holy and devout men are not to be tryed by the rigid Rules of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted candidly, according to the scope they aym at. Which is a <hi>perfect exinanition</hi> of our selves, that we may be filled with the <hi>sense</hi> of God, who worketh all in all, and <hi>feelingly</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what ever good is in us to be from him, and so be no more <hi>elated</hi> for it, than if we had none of it, nor were conscious to our selves we had any such thing. And to be thus <hi>self-dead</hi> and <hi>self-annihilated</hi> is the onely sure safe passage into <hi>eternal life, peace</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi> And is the most safe and lovely condition of the Soul that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60271:102"/>
can be attained to. All know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg to this is but vain fluttering, a Feather in a mans Cap tossed with the wind. Here is <hi>firm Achorage, Rest,</hi> and <hi>such a Peace</hi> as passes all <hi>understanding.</hi> This is the proper Character of Christ and his followers. <hi>Learn of me for I am humble and meek, and you shall find rest for your souls.</hi> And <hi>blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> This <hi>Mystical Death or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Annihilation,</hi> whereby all <hi>self-wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is destroy'd, is the peculiar tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendency of the <hi>Christian</hi> state above that of the noblest Heathen <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> that ever were. And who ever feels it will find it so. For these are <hi>Divine sensations,</hi> and lye deeper than <hi>imaginative Reason</hi> and <hi>Notion.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>mistake</hi> in this state devoid of all <hi>self-attribution.</hi> For tho the soul attribute not to her self what good she has in possession, yet she denyes not but that she has it. Like that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of S. Paul Gal. 2.20. <hi>I am crucifyed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60271:102"/>
with Christ, nevertheless I live, yet not I but Cbrist liveth in me,</hi> namely by his Spirit. And being this Christian state is the most perfect state the soul of man is capable of, we are obliged by way of duty to endeavour after it as much as we can, according to that of the Stoick, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. But I have dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point also longer than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And I know you will pardon my freedom in thus descauting upon these two passages of your learned and Elegant Discourse. I will pass now to your Letter, and endeavour to finish the point betwixt us there, and make up what you think defective in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter.</p>
                     <p>We are both agreed in this, that the <hi>simple perception</hi> of the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense</hi> hath no moral Turpitude in it. But you say hereupon that there is one difficulty still you are entangled in, which, though I took no notice of in my Letter, yet seems to you the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60271:103"/>
greatest and most considerable of all, namely, If there be no Moral Turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the simple perception of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Pleasure, then all abstracted Acts of it, such as voluntary Pollutions, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious Embraces, &amp;c. must be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lawful, which are yet condemned by all Moral and Divine Writers. And the Reason of the consequence, you say is, because there is nothing in such abstracted Acts besides the simple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense.</hi> For as for Excess, Captivation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, too sensitive Applications and the like, these are merely Accidental, and equally incident to the same acts in all other circumstances. I suppose you mean in the state of Matrimony, where the perception of this pleasure is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and allowed.</p>
                     <p>There was in my former Letter what might answer this difficulty, tho you took no notice of it. But here I will answer more fully and gradually.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, though we should
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60271:103"/>
admit, that the perception of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>sixt sense</hi> in such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as you describe, had nothing in it immoral, yet certainly it were a thing <hi>Disangelical,</hi> if I may so speak, and <hi>undivine</hi>; whenas we being born to that high condition of Angels, we ought to breath after that state, and as <hi>Aristotle</hi> somewhere adviseth (against that vulgar Proverb <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) we ought <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to affect the life of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Angels, who neither marry nor are given in marriage, and therefore to have nothing to do with that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure farther then necessity requires, not for the <hi>mere pleasures sake,</hi> which Nature has stigmatized with the sense of shame accompanying it, on purpose to remind us of that immortal and Angelical Condition we are called to, where <hi>that</hi> pleasure is <hi>perfectly silent;</hi> though at the Resurrection, we then having <hi>organized</hi> bodies, it were hard to conceive, that we should be like the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60271:104"/>
                        <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> have eyes and see not, ears and hear not, noses and smell not, no not so much as the <hi>fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant odours of Paradise,</hi> nor tast of the <hi>food of Angels,</hi> as the Psalmist some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where expresses it. Which <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hypothesis,</hi> if it be true, there is an Obvious Reason why the <hi>sixt sense</hi> has the stamp of shame upon it, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five not, and is no contemptible argument of the immortal state of the Soul out of this earthly body: so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely are these things complicated gether.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it being apparent to any, that has but the least sagacity in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Nature, that the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense</hi> is in order to that weighty end of <hi>Propagation,</hi> it is most manifestly a gross <hi>abuse</hi> of the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense,</hi> to affect it, and excite it merely for the pleasures sake, the end of God and Nature being frustrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the same time, and the <hi>due use</hi> of that sensation grosly <hi>perverted.</hi> If
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60271:104"/>
this be not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, an <hi>unnatural Act</hi> or the transgression of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what is? so that it cannot be said that this is <hi>the simple perception</hi> of the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense,</hi> but is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thereof in <hi>such Circumstances,</hi> as make it abominable. And here are broken the Laws of what is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous,</hi> as I intimated to you in my former Letter, and which might have afforded an Answer to this scruple you now again raise in this.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly and lastly, There is an Analogie betwixt the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense,</hi> and the pleasure of <hi>Tast.</hi> The former as it is in order to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <hi>species</hi> of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so the latter is in order to the sustentation of the <hi>Individuals.</hi> The pleasure of the tast is to engage the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal to eat sufficiently to nourish him and to renew his strength. Now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any man had found some Art or Trick, to enjoy the pleasure of the Tast of Meats and Drinks all the day
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60271:105"/>
long in a manner, and from day to day, though he eat no more for strength and sustenance than others do, were not this man most wretchedly sensual and gluttonous? How then can the exciting of the Venereal pleasure by voluntary Pollutions, &amp;c. be thought to be any other than the foulest Act of Lust that may be, thus to indulge to this carnal pleasure meerly for the pleasures sake, against the Law of God and Nature. Wherefore you see that the Reason of your Consequence is very infirm, and that there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in those <hi>Abstract Acts,</hi> as you call them besides the <hi>simple perception</hi> of the pleasure of the <hi>sixt sense.</hi> For the very <hi>Abstractiveness</hi> of this pleasure from the natural end and use of it, is its <hi>Essential Filth</hi> or <hi>Moral Turpitude,</hi> to be abhorred of all holy Souls, and abominated for the reasons I have mentioned. Nor is the pleasure of the sixt sense lawfully enjoyed, but in the state of Matrimony. But excess Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60271:105"/>
of Spirit, &amp;c. are lawful in no state that I know of.</p>
                     <p>And thus you have as full Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point as I can give, and if it may have the success to prove sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to you, I shall think my pains well bestow'd. But if upon a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perusal of what I have writ, and an impartial improvement thereof to your best satisfaction you can, there should chance to remain any further scruple, I shall, if you write me word of it, readily endeavour to ease you thereof as it becomes</p>

                     <p>THere was no need of an Apology either for the <hi>lateness</hi> of your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> or your <hi>freedom</hi> in descanting upon some passages in my <hi>Sermon.</hi> I can very easily be contented to stay for what by its excellency will reward my <hi>Patience,</hi> and can easily <hi>forgive</hi> him that will make me <hi>wiser.</hi> For I am concern'd for no Opinion any farther than I think it <hi>true,</hi> and so far I am, and therefore as I profess my self hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily obliged to you for your kind and excellent endeavours to rescue me from an <hi>Errour,</hi> so I must beg your leave to return something in defence of my <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> Which I question not but you will readily grant, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when I assure you that I argue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be better inform'd. And that your Authority is so Sacred with me that nothing less than the desire of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60271:106"/>
                        <hi>Truth</hi> should ingage me to oppose it.</p>
                     <p>Presuming therefore upon your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I shall first offer something in confirmation of my Opinion, and then consider what you alledge to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And in the first place 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed betwixt us that there must be a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>some Principle of free Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Man.</hi> All that does or can fall under debate is what is the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>immediate subject</hi> of this free Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Now this being a <hi>Rational</hi> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction must be primarily subjected ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>understanding</hi> or in the <hi>will,</hi> or (to speak more accurately) either in the Soul <hi>as Intelligent,</hi> or in the Soul <hi>as Volent.</hi> That the latter cannot be the <hi>Root of Liberty</hi> will be sufficiently clear, if this one Proposition be fully made out, viz. that the will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows the Dictate of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or that the Soul necessarily wills as she understands.</p>
                     <p>Now for the <hi>Demonstration</hi> of this, I shall desire but this one <hi>Postulatum,</hi>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:60271:107"/>
which I think all the Schools of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will allow me, viz. that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Soul <hi>as Volent</hi> is <hi>Apparent good,</hi> or that the Soul cannot will <hi>Evil</hi> as <hi>Evil.</hi> Now good <hi>Apparent</hi> or evil <hi>Apparent,</hi> is the same in other terms with that, which is <hi>apprehended</hi> or <hi>judg'd</hi> to be good or evil respectively. (For to appear thus or thus does not <hi>ponere aliquid in re,</hi> but is an <hi>Extrinsecal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination</hi> of the Object in reference to the <hi>Faculty.</hi>) If therefore good <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent</hi> be the Object of the will, good <hi>Apprehended</hi> will be so too, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Soul necessarily <hi>wills</hi> as she <hi>understands,</hi> otherwise she will chuse Evil <hi>as Evil,</hi> which is against the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I take to be as clear a <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> of the Souls necessarily <hi>willing as she understands</hi> upon the supposition that our <hi>Postulatum</hi> be true, as can be afforded in the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> But for more Illustration, we will bring it to an example. And for the present let
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60271:107"/>
it be that of <hi>S. Peter's</hi> denying of his Master. Here I say that S. <hi>Peter</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that part <hi>most eligible</hi> which he <hi>chose,</hi> that is, he judged the <hi>sin</hi> of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Master, at that present juncture, to be a <hi>less evil</hi> than the <hi>danger</hi> of not denying him, and so chose it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise if he had then actually thought it a <hi>greater evil,</hi> all <hi>that</hi> whereby it <hi>exceeded</hi> the other, he would have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen <hi>gratis,</hi> and consequently would have will'd <hi>evil as evil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There was therefore undoubtedly an errour in his <hi>understanding,</hi> before there was any in his <hi>will.</hi> And so it is in the case of every sinner, according to those trite sayings, <hi>Omnis peccans ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Nemo malus gratis</hi> &amp;c. And therefore tis that in Scripture, <hi>Vertue</hi> is expressed by the names of <hi>Wisdom and understanding,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> goes under the names of <hi>Folly and Errour.</hi> All who commit sin think it, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of Commission, all things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, a <hi>lesser evil,</hi> otherwise 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60271:108"/>
they should commit it. But <hi>this</hi> (as the Psalmist expresses it) <hi>is their Foolishness,</hi> and in another place, <hi>have they any understanding that work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi>? From all which I conclude that the will is necessarily determin'd by the Dictate of the understanding, or that the Soul necessarily wills as she understands, so that in this sense also that of the Stoick is verify'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>The Soul therefore <hi>as Volent</hi> cannot be the <hi>immediate subject</hi> of <hi>Liberty.</hi> If therefore there be any such thing as <hi>Free Agency,</hi> the seat of it must be in the Soul <hi>as Intelligent.</hi> But does not the Soul <hi>necessarily understand</hi> as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>appears,</hi> as well as she <hi>necessarily wills</hi> as she <hi>understands?</hi> she does so, and therefore I do not place the Seat of Liberty in the soul <hi>as judging</hi> or forming a Judgment, for <hi>that</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be determin'd by the <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of things. But though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the Soul <hi>judge</hi> as things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60271:108"/>
yet 'tis not necessary (except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>self evident Propositions</hi>) that things should <hi>appear</hi> thus or thus, but <hi>that</hi> will wholely depend upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Advertency</hi> or <hi>Attention; such</hi> a degree being requisite to make the Object appear <hi>thus,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> a degree to appear <hi>otherwise.</hi> And this <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> is that wherein I place the seat of free agency. <hi>Lower</hi> than this I discern not the least glimps of it, and <hi>higher</hi> I cannot go. Here therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have good reason to fix, and to affirm that the only <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the Soul consists in her having an <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate power</hi> to <hi>Attend</hi> or not <hi>Attend,</hi> or to attend <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less.</hi> I say an <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> power, for if you will have an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> act of the <hi>will</hi> interposed, that act of the will must have a <hi>Practical Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that Judgment an <hi>Objective ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> that appearance <hi>another At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> that attention <hi>another Will,</hi> and so on <hi>ad Infinitum.</hi> I think it therefore reasonable to stop at the First.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:60271:109"/>I shall now apply my self to your <hi>Objections.</hi> And first, against the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Soul's willing as she un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands you alledge that of the <hi>Poet,</hi> Concerning <hi>Medea —Video meliora pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boque, Deteriora sequor</hi> —I answer by distinguishing the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> a thing may be judg'd good either by a <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> or <hi>universal</hi> knowledg, and that I do <hi>not</hi> alwaies follow, Or by a <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi> Knowledg, when I look upon it and pronounce of it <hi>pro hic &amp; hunc</hi> as cloath'd with all its Circumstances, and that I <hi>do</hi> alwaies follow.</p>
                     <p>But you farther urge that if so, then there would be no such thing as Sin against <hi>Knowledg.</hi> Or (which is the same otherwise worded) that then men would be in a state of <hi>sincerity.</hi> To this I answer, that a sinner according to this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> may be said to sin both <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>ignorantly</hi> too in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent respects. He sins <hi>knowingly</hi> in as much as he knows in the <hi>Theory</hi> or by an <hi>Habitual</hi> judgment, that such a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60271:109"/>
Fact is a Sin, and yet he sins <hi>ignorantly</hi> too, in as much as either he does not <hi>actually attend</hi> to that <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Habitual</hi> judgment of his, that such a thing is a sin, Or if he does, yet he thinks it upon the whole matter to be a <hi>lesser evil;</hi> which indeed is <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly</hi> and <hi>confusely</hi> though not <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly</hi> that tis not a sin, because that which is <hi>truely</hi> a lesser evil cannot be a sin, for a sin can never be <hi>eligible,</hi> but a <hi>lesser evil may.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas you say that <hi>Adverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or <hi>Attention</hi> to the Object is a <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Principle as to the redeeming us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ability of closing with what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern'd best,</hi> I confess I can easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how a man may be defective <hi>in his Attention,</hi> but not how Attention it self if duely applied can be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive towards <hi>true illumination</hi> though in the midst of <hi>Moral Corruptions.</hi> All that can be said is, that these moral Corruptions may divert the Soul from sufficiently <hi>attending</hi> to the <hi>Beauty of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60271:110"/>
Holiness,</hi> and this I take to be the true and ultimate ground of all sin, and here tis I fix the necessity of <hi>Grace and Divine assistence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas you say, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Martyrdom</hi> which I alledg for my Opinion, does rather confirm that there must be something of more weight than <hi>Advertency</hi> to inable a man to dy for the Truth; And that though a man be <hi>notionally</hi> convinc'd that the denying of Christ is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est evil in the world, and attend never so closely to this Notion, he may yet find such evasions as will excuse him from suffering; For you say the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God,</hi> and <hi>future Repentance,</hi> and <hi>of the temptation,</hi> or <hi>pretence of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amends some other way,</hi> may do it.</p>
                     <p>To this I reply, that he who is <hi>notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> convinc'd that the denying of Christ is the greatest evil in the world, cannot possibly chuse it so long as he continues that Judgment, or Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conviction, there being according
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60271:110"/>
to his <hi>then apprehension</hi> no greater evil for the avoiding of which he should think it eligible. If thefore he should <hi>then</hi> chuse it, he must chuse it <hi>as a greater evil,</hi> that is, <hi>simply as evil,</hi> than which I think there can be no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er absurdity. As for those Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore which you subjoyn, <hi>the Mercy of God, future repentance,</hi> &amp;c. these cannot prevail with him to chuse the denying of Christ <hi>while</hi> he judges it the greatest evil, any more than they can induce him to chuse evil as such. They may indeed prevail with him in the present juncture <hi>not to think it the greatest evil,</hi> nay to pronounce it a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser evil than the evil of Pain, and then no wonder if he chuse it. But this I do not conceive to make any thing <hi>against</hi> my Hypothesis, but to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>according to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to what you remark concerning <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Mortification,</hi> I think I may be perfectly of your mind without retracting or altering any
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60271:111"/>
thing of my Sermon, for I don't find, if the business be sifted to the bottom, that we differ any thing at all.</p>
                     <p>Your Determination concerning the pleasure of the sixt sense, I submit to as very full and satisfactory. And I have only one thing more to move concerning it. Which is, that since you make the <hi>Abstractedness</hi> of this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from the <hi>natural end</hi> of it, that of propagation, to be its <hi>Essential Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude,</hi> whether this does not conclude against all those who Marry in such an age, when 'tis impossible according to the course of nature, that this End should be serv'd. And whether there be any difference according to your Measures between the enjoyment of the <hi>sixt sense</hi> in such Circumstances or the like, and Voluntary Pollutions. I would willingly know your sense in this matter.</p>
                     <p>And now (Sir) all I have to do is to return you extraordinary thanks for your many and great Civilities, to

                     <p>I Have received yours, and reading the Confirmation of your Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis (which I took the boldness a little to vellicate) and your Answer to my Objections against it, I could not but observe your ingenious dexterity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with pleasure. And yet I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously confess that I still stick where I was, nor can conceive but that the free Agency we are conscious to our selves of, is placed in the Soul as <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> as much as <hi>intelligent,</hi> because this <hi>Volency,</hi> as I may so speak, is <hi>implyed</hi> in her <hi>Attention</hi> or Advertency, and is a necessary requisite thereof. The thing therefore that I affirm being this viz. That this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is placed in the Soul as <hi>Volent</hi> as well as <hi>Intelligent,</hi> the Volency of the Soul being required to make those free attentions or Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies on the object, let us see how you
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60271:112"/>
demonstrate that it cannot be seated in the Soul as <hi>Volent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your argument in breif is this, (For I intend to answer your Letter with all possible brevity I can) That since the Soul cannot will evil as evil she must necessarily will and and chuse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>betterness</hi> of the Object appears to her understanding, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise she will chuse evil as evil which is against the supposition. To this I answer, that though she does not chuse according as the betterness of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject appears to her understanding, it does not thence follow that she will chuse evil as evil, but that she will chuse a <hi>natural</hi> good and prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Moral.</hi> So that the absurdity of chusing evil as evil here vanisheth, and the demonstration falls to the ground. And this was the case of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in denying Christ. The Object of his choice was that <hi>natural good,</hi> his security from pain and punishment, which he preferred before that <hi>Moral

                     <p>The cheif Pith of the last Paragraph of your Confirmation is this. Though it be necessary the Soul judg as things appear yet 'tis not necessary (except

onely in self-evident Propositions) that things should <hi>appear</hi> thus or thus, but <hi>that</hi> will wholly depend upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Advertency</hi> or <hi>Attention.</hi> And in this, say you, I place the seat of free Agency, viz. in <hi>an immediate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Soul of attending or not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending or of attending more or less to the Objects that occur.</hi> I demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this any thing more then what is couched in that of the Poet,

Viz. A sincere Inquisition (and <hi>since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is immediatly in our power, that is, it is in our power to do as well as we can) after that Truth and Good in which human Happiness consists. Which if it be done in a <hi>mere Notional way</hi> there will still remain that liberty I mentioned above of the Soul chusing contrary to the dictates of her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. So that there will be more liberties then you conclude for in this Paragraph. But if this diligent and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60271:114"/>
sincere Inquisition, or sincere desire of knowing <hi>what is man and whereto serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he, what is his good and what is his evil</hi> be absolutely sincere, it cannot fail to inquire what is the most safe and effectual way to have Objects duly represent themselves to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing as the Objects of sight to a pure and clear eye. And what can this be but the <hi>Purification</hi> of the soul as I intimated in my last to you, which is by <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>real Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the <hi>Divine Principle</hi> may be more fully <hi>awakened</hi> in us, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>life</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> to us in virtue whereof the soul will be free and able to chuse what is absolutely the better, that is to prefer the Moral or Divine Good before that which is Animal or Natural, and if this state advance to the highest, never to chuse any, if they stand in competition but the Moral or Divine, according to that of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> above mentioned, <hi>He that is born of God sinneth not</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore so far as I

Which taken in the full sense thereof as I have intimated, is, as I conceive, a sound and useful Theorem and well adapted for the chastising of the world for their <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>laziness</hi> in these things.</p>
                     <p>We come now to your Answers to my Objections. And to that of <hi>Video meliora proboque</hi> you answer indeed learnedly and scholastically, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a thing may be judged good ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a <hi>Speculative or Vniversal</hi> knowledg, or by a <hi>practical</hi> knowledg when it is lookt upon and pronounced of <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> as cloathed with all its circumstances, the former is not alwaies followed but the latter is. But is there any thing more in this but that the <hi>Eligent</hi> (when as both these
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60271:115"/>
knowledges are speculative or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, the former already <hi>granted,</hi> the other plainly <hi>implyed</hi> by the choice of the Eligent, who in such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces judges the choice is <hi>universally</hi> to be made, else how is he obliged to make it?) but that the Humour of the Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent onely has made this latter pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical by putting it into practice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the former, it being clothed with the circumstances of <hi>Iucundum</hi> or <hi>Vtile,</hi> when the other recommends it self onely upon the account of <hi>Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum:</hi> which though he sees (as <hi>Medea</hi> sayes <hi>Video meliora proboque</hi>— and that <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> for she speaks of the <hi>present</hi> case and time, yet <hi>deteriora sequor</hi>) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he declines that which is <hi>absolutè &amp; simpliciter melius</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own judgment, and closes with that which <hi>seems melius,</hi> that is, <hi>Vtilius</hi> and <hi>jucundius</hi> to himself, to his Animal Nature against the Dictate of the Divine. This is the clear case of the Controversy freed from the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60271:116"/>
                        <hi>clouds</hi> of the <hi>School.</hi> And therefore notwithstanding what you have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered it is plain that the Soul may <hi>understand Notionally</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then she <hi>practises,</hi> and not follow the dictate of her Understanding but of her Animal Appetite.</p>
                     <p>To my Objection against your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, That thence every man would be <hi>sincere,</hi> nor any sin against <hi>knowledg,</hi> you answer, That a sinner may be said to sin both knowingly and ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he may know in Theory or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual judgment such a fact is a sin, and yet be ignorant by not <hi>actually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> to his <hi>Habitual knowledg;</hi> or by judging the sin upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be the <hi>lesser evil</hi> and thence <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly</hi> to be no sin, and so not sin against knowledg. But I answer, It is incredible that one that has an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual knowledg, that such a thing is a sin should not remember it is so when he meets with it or is entring upon it. It is as if one had the habitual Idea of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60271:116"/>
such a person in his mind, and should not remember it is he when he meets him in the very teeth. Nor can he judg the sin upon the whole matter to be the lesser evil, but he must in the mean time remember it is a <hi>sin</hi> and so commit it against his knowledg, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sugar'd over with the circumstance of <hi>Iucundum</hi> or <hi>Vtile</hi> or both. This Composition though there be <hi>Ratsbain in the Sugar,</hi> makes the Soul listen to the dictate of the Animal Appetite and let go that of Moral reason, tho they both clamour in her ears at once. And there the Soul against the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing concludes for the suggestion of the Animal Appetite, that bears her in hand, that such a sin with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and profit is better then an Act of of virtue with pain and wordly loss. This I conceive is the naked case of the busines. Nor does this choice seem to be of a lesser evil to the Soul as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual,</hi> which dictates the contrary, but as <hi>sensual or Animal.</hi>

                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:60271:117"/>To your Answer to my third Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Attention or (Advertency) being a <hi>defective Principle,</hi> That though a man may be defective in his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet you cannot easily conceive how <hi>Attention it self</hi> if duly applied can be defective: I reply, that mere At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of it self in a Morally corrupt mind, let it be never so great can no better rightly discover the Moral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than the vitiated eye the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. It is the <hi>Purity</hi> of the Soul through <hi>Regeneration</hi> that enables her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the beauty of Holiness as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour speaks, <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi> There is no seeing of God but by being purified and regenerate into his Image. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60271:117"/>
Honesto.</hi> But if this Principle of life be not sufficiently awakened in us, no Attention is sufficient to make us rightly discern the beauty of Holiness, but onely a <hi>shadowy Notion</hi> or <hi>Meager Monogrammical Picture</hi> thereof, which will not avail though you use all the Attention in the world against the dictates of the <hi>Animal sense and life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified,</hi> in the day of trial. Whence the defect of this Principle alone, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p>But if you mean by sufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the beauty of Holiness the diligent and sincere Inquisition after Truth and Holiness, which implies our serious entring into a <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and clearing our <hi>inward Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight</hi> by our resolved progress in the way of <hi>Mortification</hi> and thereby of <hi>real Regeneration,</hi> whereby the <hi>Divine Life</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> will sufficiently at length be <hi>awakened</hi> to counterpoise and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>sway</hi> and <hi>importunity</hi> of the <hi>Animal life and sense;</hi> the neglect of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60271:118"/>
this we shall be both agreed in, that it is the ultimate ground of all sin, and that we shall discern, when we seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously make trial, the necessity of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> to carry us thro so weighty an Enterprise as you right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note in this Paragraph; which I hope I have sufficiently spoke to by this.

                     </p>
                     <p>And now lastly for your Reply to what I said touching the <hi>Instance of Martyrdome,</hi> which Reply of yours is this. That he that is notionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the denying of Christ is the greatest evil in the world, cannot possibly chuse it so long as he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues that judgment, there being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>then</hi> Apprehension no
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60271:118"/>
greater evil for the avoiding of which he should think it eligible. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he should <hi>then</hi> chuse it he must chuse it as a greater evil, that is, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as evil, than which I think there can be no greater absurdity, &amp;c. This Reply is handsome and smart, but in my judgment not free from a fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous subtilty. If where the greater evil is chosen the two compared evils were of <hi>one kind</hi> that Absurdity would be manifestly consequent, but when one of the Evils is <hi>Moral,</hi> suppose the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Moral evil that is, the other <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and very great or the greatest Natural Evil that is, suppose a painful torturous and ignominious Death, in the avoiding of which is implied the securing to himself the natural Ease and sweetness of this present life, tho upon this account he chuse that which is the <hi>greatest Moral evil</hi> and is so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed in his notional judgment, yet he cannot be said then to chuse it as <hi>evil,</hi> but as the onely <hi>effectual means</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60271:119"/>
and therefore good or expedient for that end, <hi>viz.</hi> the avoiding the <hi>highest natural Evil</hi> and enjoying the sweet of that great Natural Good, a life pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and at ease. And therefore upon this account he having onely a <hi>Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment</hi> of the <hi>Moral evil</hi> of that highest sin mentioned, but a <hi>lively sense</hi> both of the <hi>natural evil</hi> and Good here specified which are the one avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other secured by chusing the aforesaid Moral Evil: It is no wonder that, though retaining still his notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment of that greatest Moral Evil he yet chuses it to avoid that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid natural evil, and to enjoy the sweet of that Natural Good, viz. this life with ease and safety, there being in one scale of the balance nothing but the <hi>mere truth of Notion,</hi> in the other the <hi>urgent weight of Life and sense</hi> which will easily preponderate, if there be not <hi>life and sense</hi> also, (which is the state onely of the <hi>Regenerate</hi>) to weigh against it in the other scale of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60271:119"/>
So that though the Notional judgment be not corrupted, but that such a sin is still held the greatest <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Evil</hi> that is, yet the Soul is born down to follow the suggestion of the <hi>Animal Life and sense</hi> against the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of her <hi>notional discernment</hi> and may truely pronounce with <hi>Medea.</hi>

                     <p>Nor need I proceed any further. For what is already said I hope will reach every Particular of the whole Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph which contains your Reply to this last point. At least it will make good, that the Soul does not chuse evil as evil in the present case, which is the main sting of your Argument.</p>
                     <p>That we agree in our sentiments touching <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> this profession of yours I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily beleive from reading what occurs in the latter part of your Sermon which is excellently good solid and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>

Because there is a considerable end of marriage besides that of propagation of children, which in our Liturgie the Office of Marriage takes notice of, viz. mutual society Help and Comfort, which comprizeth all the handsome Adjustments of the married Parties, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs and Oeconomical Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and also their mutual help to one another in Piety and devout pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of fitting themselves for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, their Age remainding them that it is not far off.

the Soul does not chuse according <hi>as the Betterness of the Object appears to her understanding,</hi> it does not thence follow that she will chuse <hi>evil as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> but that she will chuse a <hi>natural good</hi> and prefer it before the <hi>Moral.</hi> True, but unless this <hi>natural good</hi> be in the present Circumstance, all things consider'd, judg'd <hi>greater and more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> than the <hi>Moral,</hi> the chusing of it will not be the chusing of <hi>good,</hi> but of <hi>evil as evil.</hi> For a <hi>less</hi> good (whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>any other</hi> it matters not) tho good <hi>singly consider'd,</hi> yet in <hi>Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> with a greater does <hi>induere spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem mali,</hi> as a <hi>less</hi> evil tho evil <hi>singly consider'd</hi> yet in <hi>competition</hi> with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er does Commence <hi>good and eligible.</hi> Such a choice therefore as is here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd would not be the choice of a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural good,</hi> nay not so much as <hi>of good,</hi> but of <hi>evil as evil.</hi> There is therefore no choice but what is according to the <hi>appearing Betterness of the Object</hi>; which Conclusion you your self seem
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60271:122"/>
unawares to slip into by using the word <hi>(Prefer)</hi> for what is it to <hi>Prefer,</hi> but to think or pronounce upon the whole matter to be <hi>better</hi> or <hi>more eligible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus you say again concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi> that he <hi>prefer'd</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> good of security from pain before the <hi>Moral</hi> good of adhesion to his Lord. Well, if so, then however strange it may seem, his understanding <hi>did</hi> err so grossly as at that instant not to think Faithfulness to his Master to be <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> better than security from pain, otherwise his chusing the <hi>latter</hi> would have been the chusing of what he then thought a <hi>lesser good,</hi> and consequently of evil as such. Nor will it <hi>suffice</hi> to say, that there was wanting in that act of his denial the <hi>exertion of his will</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>divine good,</hi> That indeed is <hi>true,</hi> but not the <hi>whole Truth,</hi> for had there not been also a defect in his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> there would have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiss in his <hi>will.</hi> As for your <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>As to the close of this your third Paragraph how sinning <hi>according to the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60271:123"/>
Dictate of the understanding</hi> and yet <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Conscience</hi> are consistent, I think they are very reconcileable. For he that commits a sin tho by not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attending to it at the moment of action either <hi>as a sin,</hi> or as a <hi>greater evil</hi> he comes to pronounce it eligible and so to chuse it, and so may be said to <hi>sin ignorantly,</hi> yet he sins <hi>knowingly and against conscience too,</hi> in as much as he does such a fact either against an <hi>actual Dictate</hi> that tis <hi>a sin,</hi> or an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Dictate</hi> that tis also a <hi>greater evil,</hi> as I intimated to you in my last.</p>
                     <p>As to the question which in this next Paragraph you are pleas'd to put to me, whether this <hi>Attention,</hi> wherein I place the seat of <hi>Free Agency,</hi> differ any thing from what is coutch'd in that of the Poet
<q>
                           <l>Quid verum atque bonum quaero &amp; rogo &amp; omnis in hoc sum.</l>
                        </q>
I answer that it does, and that my notion may be more clearly conceiv'd, I shall here breifly explain what I mean
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60271:124"/>
by this <hi>Power of Attention.</hi> Whereas therefore the Operations and Powers of the Soul as Intelligent are usually divided into these three, <hi>Apprehension, Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> I find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to add a <hi>fourth,</hi> that of <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which I look upon as really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the other three, they being Conversant about their Objects as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> but this only as <hi>Intelligible,</hi> and is only in short, a <hi>general power of converting the Acies of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing towards any Intelligible Object, whether simple or complex,</hi> and answers exactly to the <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>eye</hi> to a <hi>sensible object,</hi> and accordingly is as distinct from either <hi>Apprehension, Iudgment</hi> or <hi>Discourse</hi> as this <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eye</hi> is from the very <hi>act of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> In short 'tis a kind of <hi>Openness or Wakefulness of Soul,</hi> such as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be hinted at in Scripture by such and the like expressions as these, <hi>watch lest you enter into Temptation, Awake to righteousness and sin not, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60271:124"/>
thou that sleepest and arise from the dead</hi> &amp;c. The Notion thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd I will now shew how it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that of the <hi>Poet.</hi> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in this. That inquisition of the <hi>Poet</hi> denotes a <hi>particular exertion</hi> and employment of <hi>all</hi> the faculties, a diligent use of all means, methods and opportunities, and that in order to the finding out a <hi>Truth</hi> or a <hi>good not yet known,</hi> but this Attention I speak of is onely a <hi>general wakefulness</hi> of the understanding, or <hi>Application of mind</hi> to the speculation of a <hi>Truth habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally known,</hi> which will make it <hi>actually present,</hi> and so determine the <hi>Practical judgment,</hi> and by that the <hi>Will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to the place where you consider my <hi>Answers</hi> to your <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And here to that distinction of mine of <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Practical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> the latter of which I said was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies follow'd, though not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, you say they are <hi>both speculative and universal,</hi> the first granted to be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60271:125"/>
so, and the other plainly implied by the choice of the <hi>Eligent,</hi> who in <hi>such</hi> circumstances judges the choice <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally</hi> to be made. I answer, you may call them both <hi>speculative</hi> if you please, I shall not contend with you for a <hi>word,</hi> but then 'tis to be consider'd that there will be <hi>two distinct Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Dictates,</hi> one that is <hi>Habitual, out</hi> of the Circumstance of action, that such a thing is <hi>a sin</hi> and <hi>a greater evil,</hi> and another that is <hi>actual, in</hi> the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of action, that 'tis a <hi>lesser evil,</hi> which therefore for distinction's sake I call <hi>Practical,</hi> because of the <hi>immediate</hi> influence it has upon <hi>action.</hi> Which latter is alwaies follow'd, tho the former is not. Neither is this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you say made onely Practical by being put into <hi>Practice,</hi> but is so <hi>Antecedaneously,</hi> being that which <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines</hi> the choice of the <hi>Eligent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the next Paragraph, where you think it incredible that one, who has an <hi>Habitual</hi> knowledg that such a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60271:125"/>
thing is a sin, should not remember it to be so <hi>when he is entring upon it.</hi> I reply, that it seems to me most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that whoever commits sin must think it some way or other <hi>eligible.</hi> Now this must come to pass one of these two waies, either by his not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to it as <hi>sin,</hi> or not as a <hi>greater evil.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of which in <hi>many</hi> cases I can easily conceive <hi>possible,</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> in <hi>all</hi> cases I think <hi>certain.</hi> And this methinks you your self run into by saying <hi>(Paragraph the sixth)</hi> that the Animal appetite bears the Soul in hand, and such a sin with pleasure and profit is better than an act of virtue with pain and worldly loss. For what is this but in other words to say, that the <hi>Concupiscible</hi> may be so strong and rampant, that the Soul may judg <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> the <hi>uneasiness of abstaining</hi> to be a <hi>greater evil</hi> than an <hi>unlawful Indulgence,</hi> so as upon that Judgment to chuse the <hi>latter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To your next <hi>Paragraph</hi> where you
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60271:126"/>
continue your Charge upon <hi>mere At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> as a <hi>defective Instrument</hi> towards the discovery of a Moral Object in a Morally corrupt mind, I make this short reply, that since for such a Fact to be a sin, or for sin to be the greatest evil, are plain and obvious Theorems, I cannot conceive but that constant and actual Attention should prove a <hi>sufficient Directory</hi> to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the Difficulty is <hi>to be thus actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and constantly attentive,</hi> and here (as I said before) is the work of <hi>grace and Regeneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now lastly to your last Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph concerning the <hi>Instance of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,</hi> whereas I said that he, who is notionally convinc'd that the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ is the greatest evil in the world, cannot possibly chuse it so long as he continues that judgment, there being, according to his then Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, no greater evil for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which he should think it eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if therefore he should <hi>then</hi> chuse
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60271:126"/>
it, he must chuse it as the greatest evil, that is simply as evil, &amp;c. This reply you say is not free from a fallacious subtilty, Concerning which you thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish. If where the greater evil is chosen the 2 compared evils were of <hi>one kind,</hi> that absurdity would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow; But where one of the evils is <hi>Moral,</hi> the other <hi>Natural,</hi> tho a man should chuse the greatest Moral evil, yet he cannot be said to chuse it as evil, but as the only means of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural evil, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as good. This is the sum of your Answer. To which I return, that I cannot conceive how the diversity of the compared evils, as to their Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Nature, can any thing alter the case, the Question as to <hi>eligibility</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not concerning their <hi>specifick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> but concerning their <hi>Degrees,</hi> not which is <hi>Natural</hi> and which <hi>Moral,</hi> but which has <hi>most</hi> of the <hi>general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of evil.</hi> So that if I chuse that which to me has the most of the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60271:127"/>
nature of evil,</hi> notwithstanding its being an evil of <hi>another</hi> kind, I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly chuse evil as evil. Neither can this be brought off by saying that tis chosen as a means of avoiding the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evil, and consequently as good, for it can never be good to chuse a greater evil to avoid a less, that being <hi>all over loss and damage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus as briefly and as fully as I could have I set down the grounds of my opinion, which I am ready to part with upon the first conviction of their weakness or insufficiency. If you should find any thing in this paper worth your notice, you may return answer at your best leisure, for I would by no means divert you from more important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. I am very sensible what interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have already given you, but I hope you will easily pardon me when you consider that tis the peculiar reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I have for your Judgment which has brought this trouble upon you from</p>

                  <p>COnsidering with my self that those into whose hands these Papers may light, may not all of them have that other Book of mine, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Hypothesis here defended concerning the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and that tis very necessary the Hypothesis should be seen with its Defence, I thought it convenient to set it down here for the Benefit of the Reader.</p>
                  <div type="hypothesis">
                     <head>The Hypothesis runs thus.</head>
                     <p>That the will cannot be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Subject of Liberty, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd plain, if the will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows the Practical Dictate of the understanding. And that it does so I think there is Demonstration.</p>
                     <p>'Tis an unquestionable Axiom in the Schools of Learning, that the Object of the will is <hi>Apparent good.</hi> Now Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb facs="tcp:60271:128"/>
good in other words is that which is Judged to be good, and if so, then it Follows that the will cannot but conform to the Dictate of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; Because otherwise som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be the Object of the will that is not apprehended good, which is contrary to the supposition.</p>
                     <p>In short, the will (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> well expresses it) is the conclusion of an <hi>Operative Syllogism,</hi> and follows as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily from the Dictates of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, as any other Conclusion does from its Premises, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot be the immediate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Liberty.</p>
                     <p>But then are we not involv'd in the same Difficulty as to the <hi>understanding</hi>? Does not that act with equal (if not More) Necessity than the Will? So I know 'tis Ordinarily taught.</p>
                     <p>But if this be absolutly and universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, I must Confess it above the reach of my Capacity to Salve the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Morality, or Religion. For
<pb facs="tcp:60271:128"/>
since tis evident that the will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conforms to the Dictates of the understanding, if those very Dictates are also wholly and altogether neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, there can be no such thing as a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the man is bound hand and foot, has nothing left him whereby to render him a Moral Agent, to qualify him for Law or Obligation, Virtue or Vice, Reward or Punishment. But these are consequences not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and therefore I conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of right reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Principle from which they flow to be so too.</p>
                     <p>To clear up then the whole Business, I shall no longer consider the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will as Faculties really distinct either from the Soul it self, or from one another, but that the Soul does immediately understand and will by it self, without the intervention of any Faculty. And that for this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative Reason in short, because in the contrary <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> either Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:60271:129"/>
must be ascribed to the will, and then the will immediately commences understanding, or the Assent of the will must be blind, brutish, and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, both which are Absurd.</p>
                     <p>This being premised, I grant that as the Soul necessarily wills as she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, (For so we must now speak) so likewise does she necessarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand as the Object appears.</p>
                     <p>And thus far our sight terminates in fatality, and necessity bounds our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon. That then which must give us a prospect beyond it must be this, that altho the Soul necessarily understands or judges according to the appearance of things, yet that things should so <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> (unless it be in Propositions self-evident) is not alike necessary, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the degrees of <hi>Advertency</hi> or <hi>Attention</hi> which the Soul uses, and which to use either more or less is fully and immediately in her own Power.</p>
                     <p>And this Indifferency of the Soul as to attending or not attending I take
<pb facs="tcp:60271:129"/>
to be the only <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Bottom and Foundation into which the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of every action must be at length resolv'd. For a farther proof and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of which Hypothesis, let it be apply'd to a particular case, that we may see how well it will answer the <hi>Phenomena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Case then of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> I look upon sin as an evil, and not only so but (while I attend fully to its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) as the greatest of evils. And as long as I continue this Judgment 'tis utterly impossible I should commit it, there being according to my present apprehension no greater evil for the declining of which I should think it eligible. But now the evil of Pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing presented before me, and I not sufficiently attending to the evil of sin, this latter appears to be the lesser evil of the two, and I accordingly <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> so pronounce it, and in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that dictate necessarily chuse it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:60271:130"/>But because twas at first absolutely in my Power to have attended more heedfully, there was liberty in the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> the mistake which influenc'd the action was <hi>vincible,</hi> and consequently the Action it self justly <hi>imputable.</hi> This is the <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>

                        <item>11. That the Soul as Intelligent <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily judges</hi> according as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject appears to her, is certain.</item>
                        <item>12. That therefore the Soul as <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>forming</hi> a <hi>judgment,</hi> can no more be the Immediate subject of Liberty, than the Soul as <hi>Volent,</hi> is certain.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb facs="tcp:60271:131"/>13. That, since the Soul necessarily wills as she judges, and necessarily judges as things appear, we have thus far no glimps of Liberty, is certain.</item>
                        <item>14. That therefore our Liberty must be founded upon the <hi>No Necessity</hi> of some certain things appearing deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately thus or thus, or that we have no Liberty at all, is as Certain.</item>
                        <item>15. That things appearing thus or thus (unless in self-evident Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) depends upon the various degrees of <hi>Advertency</hi> or <hi>Attention,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, is certain.</item>
                        <item>16. That therefore we have an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power of Attending or not Attending, or of Attending more or less, is certain.</item>
                        <item>17. That therefore this Indifferency of the Soul as to Attending or not At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, or Attending more or less is the Prime Root and Immediate sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Human liberty, is no less certain, which was the Point to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</item>
