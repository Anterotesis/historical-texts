            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Yorke</hi> his Grace, Metropolitane of <hi>England,</hi> to bee preſently publiſhed

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ancient and laudable vſe of Viſitations, haue beene to
reforme ſuch abuſes, as by tract of time haue crept into the Church; The
diſcouery of which abuſes, as by a Booke of Articles is offered vnto you, and
you bound by a ſacred oath to preſent the ſame; ſo for the refreſhing of your
memories, and diſcharge of mine owne conſcience towards God, I thought
fit to denote ſome in particular vnto you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I vnderſtand of a great irreuerence, openly ſhewed in your Churches
and Chappels during the time of Diuine Seruice; which is, that yong men
miſ-led by the example of their elders, doe ſit couered with their hats on their
heads, neither regarding the holineſſe of the houſe of God, nor the greatneſſe
of the Diuine Maieſtie, which is to bee worſhipped with feare and reuerence: For a preſent remedie of this
abuſe, I require the Churchwardens and Side-men, at the beginning of Diuine Seruice, to looke carefully
vpon the Congregation, and if any of the elder ſort offend in this kinde, I require them to goe perſonally vnto
them, and to deſire them in gentle termes to remember themſelues, and to ſit vncouered: and if after gentle
admonition they doe not forbeare, then I require that they bee preſented at my next Court day, holden in
Yorke: and for the yonger ſort, I require the Churchwardens to goe perſonally vnto them, in caſe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and to rebuke them ſharpely for their contempt, and if they perſiſt, and will not obey by vncouering
their heads, I will the Churchwardens to pull off their hats, and I require the maſters of ſuch profane ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
and fathers of children, to giue them ſuch priuate chaſtiſement, as the qualitie of their fact requireth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am giuen to vnderſtand, that it is growen vſuall and familiar for men to walke vp and downe,
and to talke before and after Diuine Seruice within the Church, and in ſome Pariſhes to keepe Ales and
Drinkings within the Church, and when the Pariſhioners doe make their vſuall rates, that they goe vp to
the Communion Table, and there write them, and that about the ſetting of thoſe rates many vnchriſtian and
vnſeemely words are exchanged amongſt them, to the great diſhonour of Almighty God, and the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his holy Temple, which if they bee not ſpeedily amended, I ſhall vſe all the ſeuerity againſt the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that any Law, Canon, or Conſtitution Eccleſiaſticall ſhall affoord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it commeth from the grones and ſighes of the people, that for a booke of Articles containing
little more then two leaues in <hi>quarto,</hi> which may bee printed for the value of a penie, an Archdeacon at his
annuall Viſitation, exacteth from euery Pariſh, two ſhillings and ſixe pence, and compelleth them euery yeere
to take new bookes, whereas one booke will ſerue for many yeeres, and that the Archbiſhops Chancellour
in the Viſitation riſeth higher, and requireth for euery booke of Articles of euery Pariſh, iij. s. <hi>Ab initionon fuit
ſic; &amp; malus mos, quanto antiquior, tanto nequior.</hi> For redreſſe hereof, I require the Archdeacon at his annuall
Viſitation to take for euery booke of Articles but ſixe pence, and in ſeuen yeeres following to impoſe no
booke at all vpon the ſeuerall Pariſhes, but to let their old bookes to ſerue the turne, except ſuch Pariſhes as
haue loſt their old bookes: And for mine owne Viſitation, I command, that no more then twelue pence be
required for a booke of Articles, nor no more paid; the diſtribution of which twelue pence amongſt the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parators
and others, I reſerue to my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I heare much complaint of the increaſe and exaction of Fees, by ſeuerall Officers in ſeuerall
Courts, much to the ſcandall of our Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction: For remedy whereof I ſtrictly charge my
Regiſter to carrie with him, and to affixe in a publique place, that all men may ſee and reade them, a Table
containing the ſeuerall, ancient, and accuſtomed Fees for all matters belonging to my Viſitation: and if any
of my Officers ſhal directly or indirectly, exact or take any greater Fees, vpon iuſt complaint I ſhal lay ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or any other greater cenſure vpon him, that the Law Eccleſiaſticall ſhall authorize me to inflict.</p>
