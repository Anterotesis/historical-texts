            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALphonsus <hi>King of</hi> Aragon <hi>being demanded, what company he liked
best? replyed,</hi> Bookes, for these (<hi>saith he</hi>) without feare, or flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or any reward, will tell me faithfully all that I desire to know.</p>
            <p>Pithy <hi>sentences,</hi> and choise <hi>Apothegmes;</hi> are not onely as <hi>pictures</hi> for
Ornament; but also briefe and happy <hi>conclusions:</hi> extracts of experience,
that both leave a deeper impression in the <hi>heart,</hi> and take faster hold on the
<hi>head,</hi> and <hi>memory.</hi> They are to the <hi>mind,</hi> as <hi>musick</hi> to the <hi>ear,</hi> which (next to
<hi>sleep</hi>) is the best <hi>recreation.</hi> Quaint and elegant <hi>phrases,</hi> on a good subject:
are <hi>baits</hi> to make an ill man <hi>virtuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This little <hi>Incheiridion,</hi> is a <hi>feast</hi> of them: wherein <hi>wholsomenesse</hi> strives
with <hi>pleasantnesse,</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> with both. By perusall whereof, a man may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54627:2"/>
not onely become more <hi>eloquent,</hi> but more <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good.</hi> Yea, let him
con'n them well, and (with <hi>Gods</hi> blessing) he may in this short <hi>jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
make more true <hi>gaine,</hi> then does the <hi>Spanish Fleet</hi> from the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
For in so doing, he shall greatly <hi>increase his knowledge,</hi> and <hi>lessen his vices.</hi>
In <hi>one hour</hi> he may read it, and for <hi>ever after</hi> be the better for it</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antisthenes</hi> being asked what fruit he had reaped of all his study? made
answer, <hi>I have learned by it, both to live, and walke with my selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambros</hi> was wont to say, I am never <hi>lesse alone;</hi> then when I am <hi>all alone:</hi>
for then I can injoy the presence of my <hi>God,</hi> without interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dubartas</hi> (and before him <hi>Scipio</hi>) would not spare to tell his friends; <hi>I
have never better company, then when I have no company: for then can I
freely entertain my own thoughts, and converse with all the learned, which
have been in former ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Cato Vtican,</hi> in vacation times, and at his best leasure, went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
himselfe in the country, he used to cary with him the best Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and choisest Books. <hi>Algerius</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Martyr said, <hi>He had rather be
in prison with Cato, then with</hi> Caesar <hi>in the Senate house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> was, and I am of his mind; and though I be no Hermit, to sit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my dayes in a dull Cell, yet will I choose rather to have no companion
then a bad one. My reason is, the <hi>soule</hi> that lives among <hi>thornes,</hi> [vicious
men] shall hardly <hi>thrive</hi> in <hi>grace.</hi> They are such Backbyasses to a godly
life, that they will do what they can, to hinder our goodnesse to heaven,
and the goodnesse of heaven to us; they will wither all our good parts and
qualities which are in us; like an evill North-wind, they blow upon the
buds of our graces, and nip them.</p>
            <p>There be some that care not to know; and there be some, that care for
nothing else but to know; many strive after knowledge, but why? they
would be wiser, not holier by it: it is their <hi>own honour</hi> they seek, not the
<hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Men of <hi>Herods</hi> mind, whom you shall see turning over the
Bible, searching the Scriptures, examining the Prophets, but to what end
and purpose? to know good, but to do evill.</p>
            <p>Now he that is <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>obey, God</hi> thinks <hi>unworthy</hi> to <hi>know.</hi> Whence
many striving to expell ignorance, fall into error; as an Empirick to cure
one disease; causeth a worse.</p>
            <p>True, a <hi>wicked man</hi> may be taken for a <hi>wise man</hi> (as a <hi>Bristo Stone,</hi>
may be taken for <hi>a Diamond</hi>) but were he so in deed, he would fore-fee
the <hi>torments of Hell,</hi> and prevent them, as <hi>Bernard</hi> speakes. Yea, to speak
really, he is worse then a fool, for, saith Saint <hi>Augustine, If the Holy Ghost
termes him a foole, that onely laid up his own goods,</hi> Luk. 12. 18. 20. <hi>finde
out a name for him, that takes away other mens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> think that to be <hi>wisdome,</hi> which is not; like <hi>Eve,</hi> who
thought it <hi>wisdome</hi> to eat the forbidden fruit; or <hi>Absalom,</hi> who thought
it <hi>wisdome</hi> to lie with his Fathers Concubines, in the sight of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
or the false Steward, who thought it <hi>wisdome</hi> to deceive his Master:
As what saies <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his deep counsellers? <hi>Come, let us do wisely,</hi> when
indeed he went about that which destroyed him, and his country. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54627:2"/>
Scribes, Pharisees, and Elders <hi>tooke counsell against Christ,</hi> as though they
would most wisely prevent their own salvation. <hi>Ioseph's</hi> Brethren to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his having dominion over them, as his dreames imported, thought
they had taken a very wise course, in selling him to the <hi>Ishmalitish</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
which was indeed the onely meanes to effect it. And the same is
to be observed in all other cases: that the <hi>greatest Politician,</hi> is <hi>the greatest
foole.</hi> He is <hi>most wise,</hi> that is <hi>most holy:</hi> for <hi>goodnesse,</hi> in the Scripture, is
termed <hi>wisdome;</hi> and vice, folly; <hi>sinners</hi> and <hi>fools, Seunonomies, Prov. 1. 7.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is the best scholler that learns of Christ obedience, humility, &amp;c. He
is the best Arithmetician, that can add grace to grace. He is the best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that knows how to be saved; yea, all the Arts in the world are artlesse
Arts to this.</p>
            <p>Wherefore O God make me but soule wise, and I shall never envy their
knowledge, that pirty my simplicity: yea, let me be weak in policy, to I
may be wise to salvation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first lesson</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> (and so the <hi>first step to wisdome</hi>) is <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Mat. 11. 29. Prov. 1. 7. He will teach the humble his way,</hi> Psal. 25. 9.
and he that hath not learned the <hi>first lesson,</hi> is not fit to take out <hi>a new, 1 cor.
3. 18.</hi> Yea, saith <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cyprian, It is as much lost labour, to preach unto a man
the things of God, before he be humbled with the sight of his wants, as to
offer light to a blind man, to speake to a deafe man, or to labour to make a
brute beast wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> brings in the <hi>Devill</hi> triumphing over <hi>Christ,</hi> in this manner; As
for my followers, I never dyed for them, (laid down my life, &amp;c.) as <hi>Christ</hi>
hath done for his; I never promised them so great reward as <hi>Christ</hi> hath
done to his; and yet I have more followers than he, &amp; they do more for me
than his do for him. O that men would duly consider how true this is, and
amend before the Draw-bridge be taken up; but this is the misery, and a
just plague upon our so much for mality and prophanesse, under our so muc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
means of Grace: There be very few men that make not the whole <hi>Bible,</hi>
and all the <hi>Sermons</hi> they hear, yea, the <hi>checks of their</hi> own <hi>Consciences,</hi> and
the <hi>motions of God Spirit,</hi> utterly in-effectuall for want of wit, and grace
to <hi>apply</hi> the same to themselves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>naturall man</hi> is just like a <hi>Child,</hi> that (<hi>beholding his naturall face in a
Glass</hi>) thinks he sees <hi>another</hi> Childs <hi>face,</hi> and <hi>not his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not more love our selves above others; then we see others better
then our selves. But this is to be affectedly blind: wherefore as one sayes
that <hi>poverty</hi> is justly <hi>contemptible</hi> that is purchased with following of <hi>vice:</hi>
so I in this case, that <hi>poverty</hi> of <hi>wit,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> is justly contemptible, which
is purchased by a wilfull <hi>rebellion</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> and the great meanes of
<hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> which we injoy.</p>
            <p>Those <hi>Soules</hi> have <hi>seeled Eyes,</hi> that see not sinne in their best actions.</p>
            <p>It is an easie matter to believe, thinks the worldling, but he that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it shall find it as hard a work to <hi>believe the Gospel,</hi> as to <hi>keepe the Law?</hi>
and onely <hi>God</hi> must inable to both. And yet, so far as we come short of
either, so far we have just cause to be humbled, if we consider <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

            <p>No forces are so strong as the spirituall, which made the <hi>Queen Mother
of Scotland</hi> confesse, that she more feared the prayers and fasting of Mr.
<hi>Knox,</hi> and his assistance, then an Army of twenty thousand men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoline Prince of Wales,</hi> when he was moved by some about him, to make
War upon our <hi>Henry the third</hi> replyed; yea, did I not much more fear his
Alms, then his Armies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fredrick the Elector of Saxony,</hi> intending to War against the <hi>Archbishop
of Magdenburgh,</hi> sent a Spye to search out his preparations, and to hearken
out his designes: But understanding that he did nothing more, then commit
his Cause to <hi>God,</hi> and give himselfe to fasting and prayer: Let him fight,
saith he, that hath a mind to it; I am not so mad, as to fight against him,
that trusts to have <hi>God</hi> his Defender and Deliverer.</p>
            <p>All heavenly hearts are charitable; And to be a means to bring others
to heaven, is the inseparable desire of every one that belongeth to it; good
men wish all good, and happy like themselves.</p>
            <p>Love to the body, is but the body of love; the soul of love, is the love of
the soule.</p>
            <p>One drunkard may professe to another, that he loves him as wel as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54627:3"/>
and therein speaks truth, for, saith <hi>Augustine</hi> most elegantly, to such
an one, <hi>thou lovest thy selfe, so as thou wlit destroy thy selfe; and thou will
destroy him whom thou lovest as thy selfe;</hi> yea, better then themselves; for
you shall have one Ruffian salute another, with, <hi>God save you Sir,</hi> but after
some strange attestations, sweare away himselfe with, <hi>God damn me Sir:</hi>
now how can any wise man think him a friend, that is his own enemy? he
that is evill to himselfe, to whom will he be good?</p>
            <p>But see the depth of such a mans love, and whether it be not to damn
thy body and soul everlastingly. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> tells us of one, who solicited
a godly woman to incontinency, saying, <hi>he infinitely loved her:</hi> she answers,
<hi>if you love me so well as you seem, put one of your fingers into the flame, till
your flesh be burnt off:</hi> he replyes, <hi>that was no part of love in her to require
it:</hi> yes, said she, <hi>if yours be love, to cause both my body and soule to burne
in hell fire for ever; which by consequence will follow, if I yeeld to your request,
and take your counsel.</hi> The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel, <hi>Pro. 12. 10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A drinking friendship, is but a drunken friendship: and believe it, thou
wilt find those friends firmest, that thy vertues purchase thee: these will
love thee, when thy wealth is gone: whereas those that be wonne without
desert, will also be lost without a cause: you need but be an Arbitrator
between two such friends to make them both your enemies.</p>
            <p>Things that differ in their <hi>end,</hi> will surely part in their <hi>way:</hi> now thy end
is to <hi>gain him,</hi> his end to <hi>make a gain of thee.</hi> And have you deserved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so well from him, the denyall of one favour, nay, an health, shall drown
the memory of many fore-performed ones: which is all one, as if for the
abortion of one child, a man should kill all the former issue: whereas the
good mans thanks for old favours, lives even in the blows of injutie: or can
you not feed these <hi>vermine</hi> as you have done, away they go, like a <hi>Sunne
Diall,</hi> you shall be no longer regarded, then you are <hi>shined on</hi> by <hi>prosperity</hi>
Yea, <hi>Rats</hi> run not faster away from an <hi>house on fire,</hi> not <hi>lice</hi> from a <hi>dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;</hi>
then they from <hi>poverty:</hi> and if ever it be your misery, to stand in need
of them, look for no other requitall, then <hi>Iob</hi> had of his carnall <hi>friends:</hi>
whom he compares to a deceitfull <hi>Brook,</hi> which in <hi>winter</hi> is hard <hi>frozen</hi> with
cold, in <hi>summer dried up</hi> with heat, between winter and summer passing <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
alwaies <hi>deceitfull,</hi> never of <hi>use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, a man may say of such friends, as a <hi>learned Antiquary</hi> said of <hi>Rumney
Marsh: bad</hi> in <hi>winter, hurtfull</hi> in <hi>summer, never good.</hi> And thou hast sped
well, if such friends prove not dangerously <hi>hurtfull,</hi> as well as <hi>helplesse.</hi> Have
we not known some of them resemble the <hi>Snake;</hi> which when a kind <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi>
had taken out of the <hi>cold,</hi> and cherished in his bosome, and she
had recovered her <hi>lively</hi> heat, and was grown lusty: singled out him, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to try her first sting upon. Or a <hi>Promotor,</hi> that in <hi>Lent eats flesh</hi> at your
<hi>Table,</hi> and yet is the first that <hi>accuseth</hi> you to the <hi>Magistrate.</hi> If <hi>Ziba</hi> be
waxed great under <hi>Mephihosheth,</hi> he will give him a list for all he hath. A
promoted Begger hath not seldome renounced his advancer.</p>
            <p>And what else can be looked for from them? They cannot make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of civill duties, who make none of divine. If a Man have cast off his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54627:4"/>
God, he will easily cast off his friend. They that have broken their faith
with him, will keep no faith with us. When Religion is once gone, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
will not stay long after. Nothing rivits <hi>hearts</hi> so <hi>close,</hi> as <hi>Religion:</hi> it
<hi>unites</hi> them together as glew doth boards together: it makes a knot, even
between such as never saw one anothers face, that <hi>Alexander</hi> can not cut:
yea, Tyrants will sooner want invention for torments, then they with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be made treacherous. How many have chosen rather to embrace the
flames, then to reveale their companions, and brethren in <hi>Christ?</hi> There is
no friendship like the <hi>friendship</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> There is <hi>Amor,</hi> among Beasts;
<hi>Dilectio,</hi> among Men; <hi>Charitas,</hi> among Christians, that is their peculiar,
Nature, makes husband and wife but one flesh; grace makes them even one
spirit: and it is a question, whether naturall Parents are to be beloved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
spirituall: we know that <hi>Christ</hi> preferred his spirituall kindred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
that of the flesh: and <hi>major est connexio cordium, quàm sanguinum,</hi> saith <hi>Beza.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristippus,</hi> and <hi>AEschenes,</hi> two famous <hi>Philosophers,</hi> being fallen at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<hi>Aristippus</hi> came to <hi>AEschenes,</hi> and saies, Shall we be friends againe?
Yes, with all my heart, saies <hi>AEschenes:</hi> Remember then saies <hi>Aristippus,</hi>
that though I be your elder, yet I sought for peace: True, saith <hi>AEschenes,</hi>
and for this I will ever acknowledge you the more worthy man; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the strife, and you the peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> being reproached by one; answers, I will not strive with
thee in this kind of fight, in which he that is overcome, is the better man.
Whom we may do well to imitate, and onely labour (when aspersed) as
the ecclipsed Moon, to keep on our motion, till we wade out of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and receive our former splendour: In which take Master <hi>calvin</hi> for
a pattern; who said, Though <hi>Luther</hi> call me a Devill, yet I will honour
him as a dear servant of God.</p>
            <p>Milde words, and gentle behaviour, may be resembled to <hi>milke,</hi> that
quenches <hi>wildfire;</hi> or <hi>Oyle,</hi> that quenches <hi>Lime,</hi> which by water is kindled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> (I pray mind it seriously) told his friends, that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
would prove a notorious wicked man, he took such delight in disputing
against that which was good.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Erasinus</hi> was asked by the <hi>Elector of Saxony,</hi> why the <hi>Pope</hi> and his
<hi>Clergy</hi> could so ill abide <hi>Luther?</hi> he answered, For two no small offences,
viz. He had medled with the <hi>Popes triple Crowne,</hi> and with the <hi>Monkes fat
paunches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was never any to whom some Belialists took not exceptions: it is
not possible to please or displease all, seeing some are as deeply in love
with vice, as others are with vertue; and the applause of ignorant and evill
men hath ever been vilipended by the wise and vertuous. <hi>Phocion</hi> had not
<hi>suspected</hi> his speech, had not the common people <hi>applauded</hi> it. <hi>Antisthenes
mistrusted</hi> some ill in himselfe, for the vulgar <hi>commendations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> ever suspected that, which past with the most, and <hi>generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</hi>
And reason good, for most mens <hi>soules</hi> are <hi>drowned</hi> in their
<hi>senses;</hi> or so <hi>bleered</hi> with <hi>custome,</hi> that they cannot <hi>distinguish,</hi> nor <hi>discern</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54627:4"/>
the true <hi>visage of things:</hi> but are deluded with <hi>misprisions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>false sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
even against goodnesse it selfe; and carried away with weak <hi>opinions,</hi>
raised from <hi>vulgar mistakes,</hi> and <hi>shadowes of things.</hi> And indeed, no vice
could ever be loved but for the seeming good, which it makes shew of.</p>
            <p>Worldly hearts can see nothing in actions of zeal, but folly and madness;
untill we be born again, we are like <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who knew not what it was
to be <hi>borne againe, Iohn 3.</hi> untill we become zealous our selves, we are like
<hi>Festus,</hi> who thought zeal madnesse, <hi>Act. 26.</hi> untill we be humble our selves,
we are like <hi>Michael,</hi> who mocked <hi>David</hi> for his humility, and thought him
a foole, for dancing before the Arke, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 6. 16. 20. And how should
they other then miscarry; who have a <hi>Pirate (the flesh</hi>) for their guide.
As who observes not, that <hi>some</hi> will <hi>condemne,</hi> what they as little <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</hi>
as they do <hi>themselves:</hi> and that <hi>others,</hi> the <hi>better</hi> a thing is, the <hi>worse</hi>
they will like it. As nothing is more <hi>bitter</hi> then <hi>honey,</hi> to him that hath
the <hi>Iaundies.</hi> But Contumelies and contempt, that are cast upon us for
goodnesse should be born cheerfully, because they are confirmations of
our conformity to <hi>Christ,</hi> and add weight to our <hi>Crownes.</hi> Therefore the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi>
rejoyced, that they were graced so, as to be disgraced for <hi>Christ, Act.
5. 41.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>worlds</hi> smiles, may be resembled to the <hi>fruit</hi> that undid us all, which
was <hi>faire</hi> to the <hi>sight, smooth</hi> in <hi>handling, sweet</hi> in <hi>tast;</hi> but <hi>deadly</hi> in effect,
and <hi>operation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not, saith <hi>Luther,</hi> have the glory and fame of <hi>Erasmus;</hi> My grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
fear is, the praises of men. Yea, I rejoyce saith he, that <hi>Satan</hi> so rages
and blasphemes: It is likely I do him and his Kingdom the more mischiefe.
Whence <hi>Ierome</hi> told <hi>Austin,</hi> It was an evident signe of glory to him, that
all <hi>Hereticks</hi> did hate and traduce him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be praised of evill men</hi> (said <hi>Bion) is to be praised for evill doing:</hi> so
the better they speak of a man, the worse, and the worse, the better; as
being like the <hi>Blackamores,</hi> who (judging of <hi>beauty</hi> by contraries) paint
the <hi>Angels black,</hi> and the <hi>Devils white.</hi> Or the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who preferred <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas,</hi> before <hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there are not a few, who <hi>feare</hi> the <hi>worlds opinion,</hi> more then <hi>Gods
displeasure;</hi> which is to runne into the fire, to avoid the smoak; who more
<hi>dread</hi> the <hi>mockes</hi> and flouts of men on earth, then they do the grinning
mocks of the Devills in Hell; which makes them cease to be good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that they may be thought good companions: wherein they put down
<hi>AEsop's</hi> foolish fishes, that leap out of the warm water, into the burning
fire for ease: or <hi>Timocrates,</hi> who, as <hi>Thucidides</hi> relates, kil'd himselfe for
fear, least he should be drowned. Or <hi>Narcissus,</hi> who to embrace his shadow,
drowned himselfe: But for a man to be <hi>scoft</hi> out of his <hi>goodness,</hi> by those
which are lewd, is all one, as if a man that seeth should blindfold himselfe,
or put out his eyes, because some blind wretches revile and scoffe at him
for seeing; or as if one that is sound of limms, should limpe or maime
himselfe to please the cripple, and avoid his taunts. A wise man will not
be scoft out of his money, nor a just man be flouted out of his saith: the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54627:5"/>
taunts of <hi>Ishmael</hi> shall never make an <hi>Isaac</hi> out of love with his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dion</hi> writes of <hi>Severus,</hi> that he was carefull of what he should doe, but
carelesse of what he should heare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Libanius</hi> could say, If <hi>Basile</hi> commend me, I care not what all other say
of me: If <hi>Demetrius</hi> have <hi>a good report of the truth,</hi> and such an one as St.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> to bear record for him, he need not care though <hi>Diotrephes prattle</hi> as

            <p>
               <hi>Latimer</hi> would rejoyce when any objected indiscretion against him in his
Sermons, saying, He knew by that, that they could not object against the
matter it self.</p>
            <p>As I think not my self either longer or shorter, at morning, or at noon,
because my shadow is so (saith <hi>Politian</hi>) no more am I lifted up, nor cast
down, with mens flatteries or slanders.</p>

               <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> and being entertained with a Speech,
that tended much to his praise; answered, That the Orator rather taught
him what he ought to be, then told him what he was.</p>
            <p>Good men will neither back-bite others, nor give eare to back-biters of
others; Whence <hi>Austin</hi> wrote over his Table thus:
<q>
                  <l>To speake ill of the absent forbeare,</l>
                  <l>Or else sit not at Table here.</l>

               <hi>Surgius,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> two great <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and blessed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> being
accused for Christians, and commanded to offer unto the <hi>Idols,</hi> refused to
go into the <hi>Temple,</hi> saying: We O <hi>Emperour,</hi> are bound to you onely in an
earthly warfare, you have no command over our souls; <hi>God</hi> onely is Lord
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulinus Nolanus,</hi> when his <hi>City</hi> was taken by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> prayed thus
to God: Lord, let me not be troubled at the losse of my Gold, Silver,
Honour, &amp;c. for thou art all, and much more then all these unto me.</p>
            <p>When some bad stop <hi>Luthers</hi> mouth with gold and preferment; one of
his adversaries answered, It is in vain, he cares neither for wealth nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
Yea, when great gifts were offered him to a better end, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them, saying, That <hi>God</hi> should not put him off with these things; nor
would he be satisfied with any thing that was here below.</p>
            <p>Thou hast made us, O Lord, for thy selfe (saith <hi>Austin</hi>) and our hearts are
unquiet till they come unto thee.</p>
            <p>As what I have, saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> if offered to thee, pleaseth not thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my selfe; so, O Lord, thy good things we have from thee, though they
refresh us, yet they satisfie us not without thy selfe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spaine</hi> they lived happily, untill fire made some Mountaines vomit
Cold; but what miserable discords have followed ever since.</p>
            <p>They offered to make <hi>Luther</hi> a <hi>Cardinall</hi> if he would be quiet; No, saith
he, I will not betray the truth by my silence if ye would make me <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they offered <hi>Basile</hi> money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prelerments to tempt him, he
answered, Can you give me money that can last for ever, and glory that may
eternally flourish?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54627:5"/>Again, when <hi>Valence</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> sent to offer him large preferments,
and to tell him what a great man he might be, he answered, Offer these
things to <hi>Children,</hi> not to <hi>Christians.</hi> Nor would any solicite them to doe
ill did they rightly know them, for what <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks of <hi>Cato,</hi> viz. O gentle
<hi>Cato,</hi> how happy art thou to have been such an one, that never man durst
yet presume to solicite in any dishonest cause, or contrary to duty, may be
applyed to every Beleever rightly so stiled.</p>
            <p>The magnanimous <hi>Christian,</hi> will lose his <hi>life</hi> rather then the <hi>peace</hi> of a
good <hi>conscience:</hi> like <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> he will hold his integrity, though he
lose his Head for it. And reason good, for let a man but keep a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with <hi>God,</hi> and his own conscience: and then he may answer
all frighting Alarms, as he did when the <hi>Tyrant</hi> threatned him: I will take
away thy <hi>House,</hi> yet thou canst not take away my <hi>Peace:</hi> I will break up thy
<hi>Schoole,</hi> yet shall I keep whole my <hi>peace:</hi> I will confiscate all thy <hi>Goods,</hi>
yet there is no <hi>premunire</hi> against my <hi>peace:</hi> I will banish thee thy <hi>Country,</hi>
yet I shall carry my <hi>peace</hi> with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Priest</hi> might enter into a leaperous house without danger, because he
had a calling from <hi>God</hi> so to do; and we may follow <hi>God</hi> dry-shod, through

            </p>
            <p>I more fear what is within me, saies <hi>Luther,</hi> then what comes from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
The stormes and wind without do never move the earth, onely vapours
within cause Earthquakes, <hi>Iames 4. 1.</hi> It is not the tossing of the <hi>Ship,</hi> but
the distemper of the <hi>stomacke,</hi> that causeth sicknesse; the <hi>choller within</hi> and
not the <hi>waves without:</hi> Whence <hi>Vespasian</hi> (having conquered <hi>Ierusalem</hi>)
refused to have the <hi>Crowne</hi> set upon his head; saying, I indeed am the Rod

            <p>
               <hi>Ierome</hi> writes of a brave woman, that being upon the Rack, bad her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors

<hi>Francisco Soyit</hi> to his adversaries, <hi>you deprive me of this life, and promote me
to a better, which is, as if you should rob me of counters, and furnish me with
gold. The sooner I die,</hi> quoth another, <hi>the sooneer I shall be happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> tempted <hi>Fabricius;</hi> the first day with an Elephant, so
huge and monstrous a beast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as before he had not seen; the next day with
money, and promises of honour: he answered, <hi>I feare not thy force, and I
am too wise for thy fraud.</hi> He will never fear to be killed, who by <hi>killing</hi> is
sure to be <hi>Crowned. A Christians</hi> resolution, is like that of <hi>Gonsalvo:</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to his souldiers, shewing them <hi>Naples, that he had rather die one foot
forwards, then to have his life secured for long by one foot of retrait.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Modestus, the Emperours Lieutenant,</hi> threatned to kill <hi>Bazill,</hi> he
answered, If that be all, I fear nor, yea, your Master cannot more pleasure
me, then in sending me unto my Heavenly Father, to whom I now live,
and to whom I desire to hasten. And another time being threatned with
<hi>bonds, banishment, confiscation, cruell torture, death,</hi> &amp;c. He bad him fright
babies with such bug-bears; his <hi>life</hi> might be taken away, but not his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi>
his <hi>head,</hi> but not his <hi>Crowne.</hi> Yea, quoth he, had I a thousand lives,
I would lay them all down for my <hi>Saviours</hi> sake, who hath done abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more for me</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Ardely</hi> profest to <hi>Bonner,</hi> when he told him of burning, and how
ill he could indure it, That if he had as many lives, as he had haires on his
head, he would lose them all in the fire, before he would lose his Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gordius</hi> the Martyr, said, It is to my losse, if ye bate me any thing of my
sufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> was so earnest to suffer with his father, when he was but sixteen
years of age, that if his mother had not kept his clothes from him, he would
have ran to the place where he suffered, to professe himselfe a Christian,
and to have suffered with him; which was a common thing with the Martyrs,
making all hast, least they should misse of that noble entertainment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Austin</hi> observed, That though there were many thousands put to death
for professing Christ; yet they were never the fewer for being slaine; and
the like is affirmed by <hi>Luther.</hi>

            <p>The more we are cut down by the Sword of persecution, the more still
we are, saies <hi>Turtullian</hi> of the Christians in his time: Yea, the sufferings
of one, begat many to the love of the truth. We read that <hi>Cicilia,</hi> a poor
Virgin, by her gracious behaviour in her Martyrdome, was the meanes of
converting four hundred to Christ. Whence <hi>Master Iohn Lindsay,</hi> a friend
to <hi>Bishop Bettoune,</hi> upon the burning of <hi>Master Patrick Hamilton,</hi> said to
him, My Lord, if you burn any more, let them be burnt in hollow Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;

               <hi>Instine Martyr,</hi> beholding the piety of Christians in life, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
in suffering such great things so cheerfully at their death; gathered,
that it was the true Religion which they profest; saying, Surely these men
have more in them then the men of the world; they have other principles,
and thereupon came to embrace the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrianus,</hi> seeing the Martyrs suffer such grievous things; asked why they
would indure such misery, when they might (by retracting) free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?
To which one of them alledgeth that Text, <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor
eare heard,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. The naming whereof, and seeing them suffer so
cheerfully, did so convert him, that afterwards he became a Martyr too.</p>
            <p>The more the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, and their Successors the <hi>Prelates</hi> of late,
opposed the truth, the more it prevailed.</p>
            <p>The Reformation in <hi>Germany</hi> was much furthered by the <hi>Papists</hi> oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
yea, when two <hi>Kings</hi> (amongst many others) wrote against <hi>Luther,</hi>
viz. <hi>Henry the eighth of England,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus of Hungary;</hi> this Kingly
Title being entred into the controversie (making men more curious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the matter) stirred up a general inclination towards <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faninus,</hi> an <hi>Italian Martyr,</hi> being asked why he was so merry at his
death sith <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe was so sorrowfull; answered, That <hi>Christ</hi> sustained
in his soul all the sorrows and conflicts of hell and death due to us; but by
his sufferings, and the assistance of his Spirit, we are delivered from the
guilt of sinne, which is the sting of all troubles, and from sorrow, and fear
both of death and hell. Yea, even in the very act of suffering, God gives
courage with the one hand, and holds out a crown with the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 5. and 12. 10.</p>
            <p>Many will do something for <hi>God,</hi> that will suffer little or nothing for
him. The <hi>King of Navarre</hi> told <hi>Beza,</hi> He would launch no farther into the
<hi>Sea,</hi> then he might be sure to return safe to the <hi>Haven;</hi> though he shewed
some countenance to Religion, yet he would be sure to save himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantius the Emperour,</hi> called together all his Officers and Servants,
pretending to keep and promote onely such as would sacrifice to the Idols,
and they that refused should be banished; so they dividing themselves, he
kept and promoted onely the Christians, who had sleighted both his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
and threats; telling the rest, they were Traytors to <hi>God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be loyall to him.</p>
            <p>Before these dayes came (said Mr. <hi>Bradsord</hi> Mattyr) how many thought

               <hi>Aygolandus</hi> (the better to make his peace with <hi>Charles the Great</hi>) would
become a Christian, and be Baptized; but when he came to the Court,
where he saw at a Table in a room thirty poor people, in meane habites,
and at ordinary fare, which the <hi>Emperour</hi> told him were the Servants of
<hi>God,</hi> he replyed, That if <hi>God</hi> kept his servants so poorely, he would be
none of his servant. It were good we would examine our selves, whether
we have taken up goodnesse upon love to it, or upon some sinister ends.</p>

            <p>It is no argument that <hi>Christ</hi> is not in the <hi>Ship,</hi> because tempests and

<hi>Athenians,</hi> and my Wife commands me, and my Son commands my wife:
So the Churches adversaries in some places, may boast what their Father
the Devill can do; for he commands the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> commands the
<hi>Iesuites,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuites</hi> command such a King, or <hi>Emperour, Revel. 17. 12.

               <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> when he was to dye, brake forth into this expression; O my
Soul, whether art thou going? thou shalt never be merry again. When I
first entered into Orders (said <hi>Pope Quintus</hi>) I had some good hope of my
Salvation, when I became a <hi>Cardinall,</hi> I doubted of it; but since I came to
be <hi>Pope,</hi> I do even dispair of it.</p>
            <p>Surely said <hi>Cardinall Woolsie,</hi> if I had been as carefull to serve <hi>God,</hi> as I
was to please men, I had never been at this passe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gasper Olivianus</hi> a German Divine saies, I never learned how great God

               <hi>Galiacius, that Italian Marquesse,</hi> that left all for <hi>Christ,</hi> had no ill bargain
of it; whereas he that forsakes <hi>Christ,</hi> to save his life and estate, makes as
good a match as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, who sold his Salvation; or the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who
bought their damnation for thirty peices of Silver; or <hi>Pope Sextus the fifth,</hi>
who sold his Soul to the Devil, to injoy the glory and pleasure of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

should be greatest.</p>
            <p>The first thing that <hi>Caius</hi> did after he came to the <hi>Empire</hi> was, to prefer

            <p>Riches, Honours, Pleasures, &amp;c. are so transitory, that the same man the

               <hi>Bernard</hi> reports of <hi>Pope Eugenius,</hi> that meeting with a poor, but honest

him, as the custome was for such to do; so, if <hi>God</hi> did not first furnish us

him, or do good to others. Of thine own I give thee, said <hi>Iustinian
the Emperour,</hi> borrowing it from the Psalmist.</p>
            <p>If we <hi>have</hi> any thing that is <hi>good, God</hi> is the <hi>giver</hi> of it. If we doe any
thing <hi>well,</hi> he is the <hi>Author</hi> of it. <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Alpha,</hi> the <hi>fountaine</hi> from which all
<hi>grace springs:</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>sea</hi> to which all <hi>glory</hi> runs. All <hi>blessings</hi> come
from him, like so many <hi>lines</hi> from the <hi>center</hi> to the <hi>circumference:</hi> therefore
we must return all <hi>praises</hi> to him, like so many <hi>lines</hi> from the <hi>circumference</hi>
to the <hi>center, Rom. 11. 36. 1 Cor. 10. 31.</hi> His <hi>wisdome</hi> he communicates,

            <p>The <hi>little World</hi> Man, is so the Compendium and abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all creatures, that whatsoever is imprinted with
Capitall Letters in that large volum as in folio, is sweetly
and harmoniously contracted in <hi>Decimo Sexto,</hi> in the briefe
text of man, who includs all: <hi>Planets</hi> have being, not life;
<hi>Plants</hi> have life, not sense, <hi>Beasts</hi> have sense, not reason,
<hi>Angels</hi> have being, life reason, not sense, <hi>Man</hi> hath all, and
contains in him more generallity then the <hi>Angels,</hi> viz. <hi>being</hi>
with <hi>Planets, Life</hi> with <hi>Plants; sense</hi> with <hi>Beasts, reason</hi> with
<hi>Angels:</hi> But the Beleever hath over and above, <hi>Gods</hi> spirit and
faith. Nor does the <hi>rational</hi> so much excell the <hi>sensual,</hi> as the

            <p>And so according to my ability, I have provided for my
Reader, something of every thing, because no one thing wil
please all. It may serve eitheir as a <hi>Banquet of sweet Meats,</hi>
or as a <hi>publique feast for all commers:</hi> to which I have added
an <hi>aftercourse of Kickshawes</hi> for <hi>quesie stomacks,</hi> that care
for no better meat. Let each man please himselfe, (that will
be pleased) and it shall not a little content me, that I can
give so good entertainment to so many (<hi>Luk. 9. 14. to 18.</hi>)
at so cheap a rate in these hard times.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Apostle</hi> that prefixt his name to thirteen of his <hi>Epistles,</hi> held it
meet to leave the same out, of that to the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> And the same
did I in publishing those two Tracts, <hi>A small Map of the many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
and few Christians in England;</hi> and, <hi>Preparation to Conversion.</hi>
Sundry reasons induced me to think, that it would be best so to do;
but as when <hi>a Pirate</hi> said to his fellowes, Woe to us if <hi>we be knowne;</hi>
an honest man in the same <hi>Ship</hi> replyed, And woe to me if I bee <hi>not
knowne:</hi> so fares it in this case. For contrary to what was expected,
concealing my name, proves no small hinderance to the sale of them.
Wherefore, though I should count it a priviledge to be unknown to the
<hi>envious,</hi> (since to be <hi>more obscure,</hi> were to be <hi>more secure</hi>) and so to the
<hi>incorrigible,</hi> (because <hi>I am become their enemy for telling them the truth</hi>)
being now requested by the vendors of those Books; I both own them

            <p>IT being observed, that many meeting with some of this Authors
Collections, do earnestly enquire after the rest; and that others (and

not amiss to satisfie the one, inform the other, and save both any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
