            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore with their perswasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the vse and comfort of all, especially of the godlie. And now right honorable my verie good Lord, calling to minde the dutie, honor, and seruice due by mee vnto your good Lordship, for the great loue and fauour which I haue alwaies receiued at your L. hands. (For I acknowledge my selfe to none more bound then to your honor:) I haue beene the more emboldened to present this simple worke to passe vnder your L. fauour and protection. Wishing that the same may chieflie serue to the glorie &amp; praise of God.

Now to acquaynt thee with the Auctors order in this second woorke, he hath for varietie gone through the Psalmes twice, which are now deuided into two Setts: whereof in the former the ordinarie singing part is caried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conueyed in the highest part. Herein ther is required of the Reader, if he be a louer of Musick, that he would accept of their labour that haue taken paines in publishing exactlie a worke of such singuler skill, and speciall vse for them, that after the serious labour of their calling are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous rather to recreate them selues in singing of Psalmes, then in other exercises of lesse comfort, and euill marke.</p>

William Damon late one of hir Maiesties seruaunts, which booke being found not onely in my poore opinion, but in the riper iudgement of some speciall Musicions to be excellentlie sette, either to serue for voices or instruments: for the great vse that might come thereof, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to preserue the labours of the Auctor, so worthie and skillfull a man in his profession: also to leaue his Religion and pietie herein witnessed, that so careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and speciallie laboured to aduaunce the vse of singing the Psalmes: I was earnestlie dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my priuate store in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, that of it selfe conteyned matter so worthie publiquelie to enterteyne and to receiue enterteynment. Therefore with their perswasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the vse and comfort of all, especially of the godlie. And now right honorable my verie good Lord, calling to minde the dutie, honor, and seruice due by mee vnto your good Lordship, for the great loue and fauour which I haue alwaies receiued at your L. hands. (For I acknowledge my selfe to none more bound then to your honor:) I haue beene the more emboldened to present this simple worke to passe vnder your L. fauour and protection. Wishing that the same may chieflie serue to the glorie &amp; praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the recreation of your minde, after your worthie and great trauayle from day to day taken in the most weightie affaires of this common wealth. And so I commend your good L. to the mercifull keping of thalmightie God.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Maiesties Musitions, being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of Dauids Psalms as they are ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his friends priuate vse. These Psalmes so set, &amp; made without labour or purpose to publish them, were notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding published by the same friend of M. Damon; which not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gaue him occasion to take vppon him a new labour to recouer the wrong his friend did in publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not purposed or framed for the learned eares of our times. Therefore at his best leisure &amp; fittest times he composed the same tunes againe in so excellent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by triall see that the Auctor could not receiue in his Art such a note of disgrace by his friends ouersight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthie knowledge much more graced by this second trauaile. Now to acquaynt thee with the Auctors order in this second woorke, he hath for varietie gone through the Psalmes twice, which are now deuided into two Setts: whereof in the former the ordinarie singing part is caried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conueyed in the highest part. Herein ther is required of the Reader, if he be a louer of Musick, that he would accept of their labour that haue taken paines in publishing exactlie a worke of such singuler skill, and speciall vse for them, that after the serious labour of their calling are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous rather to recreate them selues in singing of Psalmes, then in other exercises of lesse comfort, and euill marke.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable my singuler good Lord, there came to my hands of late a booke conteyning all the tunes of the Psalmes, as they are ordinarilie soung in the Church, composed into foure parts by M. William Damon late one of hir Maiesties seruaunts, which booke being found not onely in my poore opinion, but in the riper iudgement of some speciall Musicions to be excellentlie sette, either to serue for voices or instruments: for the great vse that might come thereof, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to preserue the labours of the Auctor, so worthie and skillfull a man in his profession: also to leaue his Religion and pietie herein witnessed, that so careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and speciallie laboured to aduaunce the vse of singing the Psalmes: I was earnestlie dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my priuate store in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, that of it selfe conteyned matter so worthie publiquelie to enterteyne and to receiue enterteynment. Therefore with their perswasions and reasons, I was brought to publish them for the vse and comfort of all, especially of the godlie. And now right honorable my verie good Lord, calling to minde the dutie, honor, and seruice due by mee vnto your good Lordship, for the great loue and fauour which I haue alwaies receiued at your L. hands. (For I acknowledge my selfe to none more bound then to your honor:) I haue beene the more emboldened to present this simple worke to passe vnder your L. fauour and protection. Wishing that the same may chieflie serue to the glorie &amp; praise of God. And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the recreation of your minde, after your worthie and great trauayle from day to day taken in the most weightie affaires of this common wealth. And so I commend your good L. to the mercifull keping of thalmightie God.</p>

                     </gap> Reader, M. William Damon one of her Maiesties Musitions, being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of Dauids Psalms as they are ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his friends priuate vse. These Psalmes so set, &amp; made without labour or purpose to publish them, were notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding published by the same friend of M. Damon; which not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gaue him occasion to take vppon him a new labour to recouer the wrong his friend did in publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not purposed or framed for the learned eares of our times. Therefore at his best leisure &amp; fittest times he composed the same tunes againe in so excellent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by triall see that the Auctor could not receiue in his Art such a note of disgrace by his friends ouersight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthie knowledge much more graced by this second trauaile. Now to acquaynt thee with the Auctors order in this second woorke, he hath for varietie gone through the Psalmes twice, which are now deuided into two Setts: whereof in the former the ordinarie singing part is caried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conueyed in the highest part. Herein ther is required of the Reader, if he be a louer of Musick, that he would accept of their labour that haue taken paines in publishing exactlie a worke of such singuler skill, and speciall vse for them, that after the serious labour of their calling are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous rather to recreate them selues in singing of Psalmes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then in other exercises of lesse comfort, and euill marke.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Maiesties Musitions, being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of Dauids Psalms as they are ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his friends priuate vse. These Psalmes so set, &amp; made without labour or purpose to publish them, were notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding published by the same friend of M. Damon; which not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gaue him occasion to take vppon him a new labour to recouer the wrong his friend did in publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not purposed or framed for the learned eares of our times. Therefore at his best leisure &amp; fittest times he composed the same tunes againe in so excellent a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by triall see that the Auctor could not receiue in his Art such a note of disgrace by his friends ouersight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthie knowledge much more graced by this second trauaile. Now to acquaynt thee with the Auctors order in this second woorke, he hath for varietie gone through the Psalmes twice, which are now deuided into two Setts: whereof in the former the ordinarie singing part is caried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conueyed in the highest part. Herein ther is required of the Reader, if he be a louer of Musick, that he would accept of their labour that haue taken paines in publishing exactlie a worke of such singuler skill, and speciall vse for them, that after the serious labour of their calling are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous rather to recreate them selues in singing of Psalmes, then in other exercises of lesse comfort, and euill marke.</p>
