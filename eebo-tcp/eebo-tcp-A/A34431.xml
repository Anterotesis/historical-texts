         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S for the Originals of Bishops and their antiquity, that is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleered aud proved by many and sundry learned Divines both Bishops and Doctors, and others, and may goe for currant till encountred with better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and confuted with stronger Arguments.</p>
            <p>But as they now stand incorporated into the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior part of the body of our Common-wealth, they are represented to every Ordinary apprehension, so impregnably fortified on all sides, as that they may securely endure, like Iron Pillars or Rocks of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all the battery of any eloquence or Sophistry whatsoever.</p>
            <p>For although their opposers advance their noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards the borders of Divinity, in imitation of the old <hi>Heretiques,</hi> who in a blush to be sole and bare in themselves and their single inventions, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out their absurdities for a while with Scripture flourishes, and as <hi>Vincentius Lyrenensis</hi> said of them that they did <hi>divinae legis sententiis quasi quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam vellerebus sese obvolvere,</hi> so they tyred in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94334:3"/>
with their owne self-conceited presumptions and preapprehending the dangers they are in to be censured as Sacrilegious, or inforced to flee to the Scriptures, and from thence to extort succour with a wrest of violence for the better boulstering out their home-bred exceptions against Bishops, that savour something of ignorance and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of whom J may say as <hi>Athanasius</hi> said of the <hi>Arrians</hi> in his Oration <hi>contra Arrianos</hi>; That <hi>Christum simulant &amp; contra Christum pugnant,</hi> so they pretend the authority of Christ speaking in the Scriptures, when in very deed they strive though insensibly they perceive it not, and contend and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue against Christ and almost against all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, &amp; so fulfill not only the predictions of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment wherewith blindnesse and ignorance should out-strip the cleere sunshine of manifest light and truth, but also accomplish the Prophecies of the wild degeneration of Charity into new and strange heats and fits of zeale without knowledge, &amp; so ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themselves obnoxious to the wrathfull displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Almighty; for as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium divinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dum devitatur impletur, humana autem sapientia du reluctatur comprehenditur,</hi> so whiles man goes about to defeat and avoyd the authority of his commanding Word by any act of disobedience, he falls within the compasse of another branch of his word of Prophecie, which is thereby fulfilled and accomplished, and so whiles humane wisedome like the builders of <hi>Babell</hi> soares towards heaven in a pride, to vie and contest with the wisdome of the Almighty that is infinite and incomprehensible, it is taken in the snares of its owne impotencies, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94334:3"/>
have its vaine imaginations like <hi>Achitophels</hi> turned round into folly and simplicity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As first, because it is against Christ and his will revealed in his word, whereby hee ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the beauty of honour, and the dignity of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the strength and sinewes of Revenues, wheresoever he finds them rightly fixed by humane Lawes, whether on <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Turke,</hi> or <hi>Infidell,</hi> or upon <hi>Christians,</hi> but especially i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> on his houshold servants and high stewards of his chiefest treasures, and most mysterious secrets, such as the Bishops are, who are graced in our Common-wealth with titles of Honours, and with the dignity of authority by the favour of Princes, and are indowed with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues by the franck donation of many famous Founders and Benefactors, and have ever been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in all by the Lawes of the Kingdome, which are as neere as may be regulated by his will, so farre as hath been possible to make discovery of it, either by the dictates of nature, or his expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands set forth in the Scriptures. And all this he seconds by surrounding them for the glory of his generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, with a guard of a double perfection not onely of strict Injunctions to honour and obey, to assist and support them in all. But also with direfull menaces of punishment proportionable to their transgression, denounced against all (that prevent it not in time with a due repentance) that should dare to derogate from their honors, or disobey their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or disturb the peace they injoy in their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and turnes of all violations of his Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on them, but against himselfe from any the least termination upon them onely, and strikes in as a party, and makes himselfe the Center of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94334:4"/>
and reflects back again like a Rock upon the Authors, the offences offered to his Messengers, as if he himselfe had suffered, saying not they, but I, not you, but me, which is the same with his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to <hi>Saul</hi> before he was St. <hi>Paul</hi>; saying, when he appeared to him as he was travelling to <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> breathing out slaughter and threatnings against the Disciples of the Lord, <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> why perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutest thou me, who, in all probability, were not Disciples of the Ecclesiasticke, but the Civill state, and that too in the time of his ignorance, and while hee was yet in unbeliefe, but here CHRIST is persecuted in his chiefe Ecclesiastick Disciples, and that by knowing and beleeving Ministers, which is like the <hi>Contention</hi> between the Sunne and the Moone, which is an allusion the Poet tooke to expresse the insolencies wherewith the male contents of <hi>Rome</hi> seditiously did venture to outbrave their Superiours and Governours; saying,

            </p>
            <p>In English thus:
<q>
                  <l>The Moone impatient of her rule by night,</l>
                  <l>Would needs dissease the Sunne the day to light;</l>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly,
<q>It is against the light of nature, that prescribes a rule for every man to measure anothers good by the estimate and affection they hold and beare to any thing they can, or doe call theirs;</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which is this,

                  <l>Quod tibi fieri non vis alteri ne feceris.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Manifested thus: if there be any that can intitle themselves either to honour or office, or inheritance that hath beene conferred upon them, either by the favour of Princes, or by the donation of Ancestors, and that confirmed by the Sanctions and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of humane lawes and judicatures, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation re-established by ancient prescription of long possession, and nothing to the contrary: It would be thought a thing very grievous and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a title so cleare and strong, and so impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be unhinged and abrogated, and not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low like Justice to the Bishops in all they are, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in like correspondence in every respect is obvious to every ordinary eye, will prove a <hi>Paradox</hi> too too pregnant with mysterious absurdities both in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Divinity and naturall Logique and vulgar Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Moralty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is against the King his sole Deputy and Vice-gerent upon Earth, and that in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold respect.</p>
            <p>As first, It is against his Royall <hi>Prerogative,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94334:5"/>
which above all other glorious beames of Divine Majesty that shine upon him, and abundantly shew themselves in him, not onely in his power, but in his parts, both of sanctity and intelligence, proves him the only expresse Image &amp; lively representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both of the ample and free liberty, &amp; also of the communicative goodnesse of the Almighty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is free and loose from the mixtures of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane limitations and restrictions, which like Sea-bankes bounds it up and circumscribes it in many particulars, but in this left free and absolute, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged as it is according to the prescript rule of the word of God for the setting forth of his glory, by promoting of his peoples good, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the supreame end of all his Majesties; for <hi>Salus pupuli</hi> especially <hi>spiritualis &amp; eterna</hi> is <hi>suprema lex,</hi> as his Majesty hath ever done to his eternall renowne by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, and continuing, and confirming according to the Royall patterne of his famous progenitors, the honours and authority, and bountifull mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Bishops as hee found them at his first comming to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Wherin he approacheth by imitation as neere as is possible to the nature of the Almighty, and that in a double respect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First thus: as God when he sent his Angels as <hi>nuntioes</hi> on his arrand to Mankind, he formed them with lineaments suitable to humane nature, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate with their seeming germane affinity to their kind, some reciprocall welcome to be spent in a willing and favourable attention, and waiting on the delivery of their message, and so to steale upon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94334:5"/>
both their apprehensions, and faith, and beliefe, all together by the prefaces of humane insinuations: so his Majesty takes his naked spirituall creatures, of the poore Ministers of the Gospell, and lest they should be too much estranged, and abstracted, like Angels in respect of secular and politicall out sides from all familiar association, with common and vulgar expectations; he cloathes them with the Court Wardrope of honour and authority, and of the plentifull affluence of means, and so sends them forth, to charme the senses of his Subjects, with the pleasing shyne of greatnesse, into a happy and holy treason to their soules, for the betraying of their darling ignorance, and misleading darkenesse, into the sweet captivity of a farre better guide of light from above, which is usually as odious to them, as a candle or day-light is to a Thiefe and a Robber.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, it is against the Lawes of the Kingdome, and that in a double respect.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>Fistly, and Lastly, it is against the Lawes of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and common humanity, and that in a double respect.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94334:8"/>1.

            <p>So may they say and more, and trulier of their workes, but they are no boasters.</p>
            <p>And now to defeate the aymes of those deceased founders, and to contend with them in a vye of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wisdome and larger liberty, and greater power then ever they had, or exercises over their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, is like <hi>cum mortuo Protogene bellum gerere</hi> was enough heretofore to make the victorious and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Warriour <hi>Demetrius</hi> to retreat and shrinke

Peter called the distressed Iewes,</hi> writing to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strangers scattered through <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</hi> or both of them to be and not to be, like a Picture, that is and is not, what it seemes to signifie and represent; a Nation and no Nation, a people and no people, Christians, and yet no Christians, as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>Or else because they are, as they are good Bishops; who for the most part are as good as any sort of men: amid the many infirmities our weake nature is subject unto, and notwithstanding the many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations our best performances are too too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blasted and blemished with.</p>
            <p>And in some respects doe farre surmount and transcend many thousands of other vocations and conditions, in both unknowne and unvaluable emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, and that in a double respect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As first, because in their tender yeares, almost as soone as they could see, to discerne of colours and differences, they could be so Eagle-eyed, as to spy out the pretious pearle of the Gospell; to the study whereof they did wholly dedicate themselves without any further consult with nature; and that with a kinde of disdaine of all other professions whatsoever, and singled out its excellencies from all the flatteries of honour, and riches, and renown, that courted their judgement from every corner of the earth, and the knowne world; to be their sole, and secure, and most sincere delight, and as most really and substantially advantagious to themselves, and as most universally and freely profitable to all

others in their most spiritualized, and sanctified de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and wishes; howsoever slighted and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by some ignorant <hi>Atheist,</hi> as the most barren and chargeable, and laborious, and difficult, and despicable vocation in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And secondly, for the many weary dayes and, weekes, and moneths, and yeares, and anxious, and vexatious cares and indefatigable and restlesse, paines, whereby they have exhausted and consumed the flower of their strength, and prime time, and all to enrich themselves by Gods blessing, and the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his holy Spirit, with heavenly treasures, to be retayled againe, sometime to men of corrupt minds, who for the most part requite them with no other rewards, but heapes of contumelies and heart-breaking reproaches; wherewith they abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly revenge all the great good of grace and glory which they intended them.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, when the State did never yet decree by any publique act, eyther riches, or any honourable remuneration, to any of the Bishops, or any of theirs; for any of the best services, and performances; which measured by the strictest exactions of humane Lawes; may well goe for lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant and redundant super-erogations. And now to treat of nothing but degradations and demoliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those Pillars of earth; contrary to the word of God, and the light of nature; and contrary to the Rights of his Majesty; his Title, Oath, and Prerogative; and contrary to the Lawes of the Kingdome, and of common

generis humani,</hi> and the Chariots of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the horsemen thereof, as <hi>Elisha</hi> said of <hi>Elias,</hi> and ought to be honoured with all thankefulnesse; <hi>omni loco, actu, habitu, tempore,</hi> as <hi>Ausonius</hi> said to <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> the Emperour, and rather then to abase them any lower, then they are, with any dimiunitions; to study how to adde to them further and ampler en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements in all; for as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> said in point of obedience, so may I say in matter of beneficence, <hi>quis pudor, quod nonpraestet fides, quod praestitit infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitas,</hi> so what a shame is it that <hi>Our Father</hi> should not be as bountifull to the Church as ever was <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Noster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But instead thereof, in this cleere and plentifull Sun-shine of the Gospell, to bereave them contrary to the Lawes of grace, &amp; of nature; of those endowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were confer'd upon them, by such as were contrary to themselves, both in nature and in grace, in respect both of naturall and spirituall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: will prove a double aequivocall operation, in the production of contrary effects in both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, both theirs, and ours.</p>
            <p>For as their blind superstition, became to them like the clay, wherewith our Saviour opered the blind mans eyes in the Gospel, which was likelier quite to put them out, then any way to cleere them or recover them: taught them to worke out new Discoveries of better wayes of serving God, and honouring him with their substance; not onely for the buying out of the Prince of darknesse from his Regencie (if it were possible) wherewith hee ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over the Children of darknesse: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for the hyring of the light of the world (if it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94334:14"/>
might be) to breake out, and shine upon them, their kindred and Country-men; and with a holy kinde of Symony, to purchase for them the gifts of the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>So the abundant bright Sun-shine of the Gospel, dazles the light of nature in some, into such a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por of insensible blindnesse and ignorance; as they can neither see their owne hands; nor yet the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plussages of their over-flowing estates, nor the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry formes of wants and miseries, wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour proclaims and presents his distresses, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in many thousands of his poore and afflicted members.</p>
            <p>But when they come to the Church they seeme to see double, and take all temporall accessions, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, of authority, and of revenues, to be <hi>a voene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and <hi>a perditio,</hi> and altogether superfluous, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and dangerous. But <hi>manum a tabula.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as the Hills stand about <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> as the <hi>Psal.</hi> saith, so let the Lord, and the Lords annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the minor Lords of the earth; and all that beare good will unto <hi>Sion,</hi> incompasse, and incampe, like Legions of Angells; round about the reverend Bishops, and all they are, from this time fourth, and for evermore, <hi>Amen good Lord, so be it.
