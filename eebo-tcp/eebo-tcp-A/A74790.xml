            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIrſt for the honour of Almighty God, and in purſuance of the ſolemne League and Covenant which we made in the preſence of Almighty God for the Reformation and defence of Religion, the honour and happineſſe of the King, and the peace and ſafety of the three Kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, we have granted, and by this our preſent Charter have conſirmed, That the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhall be free to deny the perpetuall Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, to countenance ſpreading hereſies, curſed blaſphemies, and generall looſeneſſe and prophaneneſſe, and that all Lawes and Statutes formerly made againſt the aforeſaid offences for the puniſhment and reſtraining thereof ſhall be utterly repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that ſo all men may freely enjoy and profeſſe what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever they pleaſe without reſtraint: And we will that all Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and their dependents ſhall be eternally ſuppreſſed, and all their Mannours, Lands and poſſeſſions ſold to defray and advance the Publique Faith. That all Miniſters ſhall be plundered and thruſt out of their livings and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds by our Committee of plundering Miniſters without Oath or legall tryall, upon bare informations of ſuch of their Pariſhioners who are indebted to them for Tythes, or have any Kinſman to preferre to their livings. And to ſupply the want of Miniſters, That all Officers, Souldiers, Coblers, Tinkers, and gifted Brethren and Siſters, ſhall freely preach, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Goſpell to the people, and new dip and rebaptize them without puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
