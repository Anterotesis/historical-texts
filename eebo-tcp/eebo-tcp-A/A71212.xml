            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF
The Arch-Biſhop
And ſeveral other Biſhops.
FROM THE
IMPUTATIONS and CALUMNIES
Caſt upon them
By the Author of the Modeſt Enquiry.</head>
            <p>VVHereas in a late Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>A Modeſt Enquiry
into the Cauſes of the preſent Diſaſters, &amp;c.</hi> We, whoſe
Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, are among others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
as the <hi>Authors and Abetters of Englands miſeries;</hi>
and under the abuſive Names of <hi>the Lambeth Holy Club, the holy Jacobite
Club, and the Oeconomick Council of the whole Party,</hi> are charged with a
<hi>Third Plot,</hi> and with the compoſing of a <hi>New Liturgy,</hi> and uſing it in
our <hi>Cabals;</hi> and whereas the <hi>Clergy,</hi> ſuch of them as are ſtyl'd <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi>
are ſaid (together with others) to have <hi>preſented a Memorial to
the King of France,</hi> to perſwade him to Invade <hi>England;</hi> and are alſo
affirmed to have kept <hi>a conſtant Correſpondence with Monſieur de Croiſſy</hi>
in order thereunto.</p>
            <p>We do hereby ſolemnly, as in the preſence of God, Proteſt and Declare:</p>
            <p>I. That theſe Accuſations caſt upon us are all of them malicious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
and diabolical Inventions; that we are innocent of them all;
and we defie the Libeller (whoever he be) to produce, if he can, any
legal Proof of our Guiltineſs therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>II. That we know not who was the Author of the <hi>New Liturgy,</hi> as
the Libel calls it; That we had no hand in it, either in <hi>Club, Cabal,</hi> or
otherwiſe; nor was it compoſed, or publiſh'd, by Our Order, Conſent, or
Privity, nor hath it been uſed at any time by Us, or any of Us.</p>
            <p>III. That neither We, nor any of Us ever held any <hi>Correſpondence,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly, with Monſieur <hi>de Croiſſy,</hi> or with any other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
or Agent, of <hi>France:</hi> And if any ſuch <hi>Memorial</hi> as the Libel men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
was ever really preſented to the French King, we never knew any
thing of it, or any thing relating thereto: And we do utterly renounce both
That, and all other Invitations, ſuggeſted to be made by Us, in order to
any Invaſion of this Kingdom by the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50643:2"/>
IV. That we utterly deny and diſavow all <hi>Plots</hi> charged upon us as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
or carried on, in our Meetings at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> the intent thereof being to
adviſe, how in our preſent Difficulties we might beſt <hi>keep Conſciences void of
offence towards God, and towards Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. That we are ſo far from being the <hi>Authors or Abbettors of</hi> England'<hi>s
Miſeries,</hi> (whatever the Spirit of Lying and Calumny may vent againſt us)
that We do, and ſhall to our dying Hour, heartily, and inceſſantly pray for the
Peace, Proſperity, and Glory of <hi>England;</hi> and ſhall always, by God's Grace,
make it our daily Practiſe <hi>to ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> to bear our Croſs patiently, and
to ſeek the good of our Native Country.</p>
            <p>Who the Author of this Libel is, we know not: But whoever he is, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
as our Lord hath taught us, to return him good for evil: He barbarouſly
endeavours to raiſe in the whole Engliſh Nation ſuch a Fury, as may end in
<hi>De Witting</hi> us (a Bloudy word, but too well underſtood!) But we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him to the Divine Mercy, humbly beſeeching God to forgive him.</p>
            <p>We have all of us, not long ſince, either Actually, or in full Preparation
of Mind, hazarded all we had in the World in oppoſing Popery, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power in <hi>England;</hi> and we ſhall, by God's Grace, with greater Zeal
again Sacrifice all we have, and our very Lives too, if God ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to call us thereto, to prevent Popery, and the Arbitrary Power of <hi>France,</hi>
from coming upon us, and prevailing over us; The Perſecution of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Brethren there being freſh in our Memories.</p>
            <p>It is our great Unhappineſs, That we have not opportunity to publiſh
full and particular Anſwers to thoſe many Libels, which are induſtriouſly
ſpread againſt us: But we hope, that our Countrymen will never be moved
to <hi>hate us without a cauſe;</hi> but will be ſo juſt, and charitable to us, as to
believe this ſolemn Proteſtation of our Innocence.</p>
