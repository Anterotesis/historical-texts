            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. <hi>Edward Cocker</hi>'s PROEME or PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BY the sacred influence of Divine Providence, I have been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the benefit of many, by vertue of those useful Arts, <hi>Writing</hi> and <hi>Engraving:</hi> And do now with the same wonted alacrity cast this my Arithmetical Mite into the publick Treasury; beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Almighty to grant the like blessing to these, as to my former labours.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Seven <hi>Sciences</hi> supremely excellent</l>
               <l>Are the chief Stars in Wisdom's Firmament:</l>
               <l>Whereof <hi>Arithmetick</hi> is one, whose worth</l>
               <l>In beams of Profit and Delight shines forth.</l>
               <l>This crowns the rest: this makes man's mind compleat;</l>
               <l>This treats of Numbers, and of this we treat.</l>
            </q>
            <p>I have been often desired by my intimate Friends to publish something on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; who in a pleasing freedom have sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to me that they expected it would be extraordinary. How far I have answered their expectations, I know not; but this I know, that I have design'd this Work not extraordinary abstruse or profound, but



<pb facs="tcp:51879:4"/>
have by all means possible, within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of my capacity, endeavoured to render it extraordinary useful to all those whose occasions shall induce them to make use of Numbers. If it be objected that the Books already published, treating of Numbers, are innumerable; I answer, that's but a small wonder, since the Art is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. But that there should be so many excellent Tracts of Practical Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick extant, and so little practic'd, is to me a greater wonder: knowing that as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize is the Life of the Weal-publick; so Practical Arithmetick is the Soul of Merchandize. Therefore I do ingenuously profess, that in the beginning of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, the numerous concerns of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Merchants first possest my conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and how far I have accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Composure for his most worthy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, let his own profitable experience be judge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For your service, most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Professors, whose understandings soar to the subli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y of the Theory and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this noble Science, was this Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical Tractate compos'd: which you may please to employ as a monitor to instruct your young <hi>Tyroes,</hi> and thereby take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to reserve your precious moments,



<pb facs="tcp:51879:4"/>
which might be exhausted that way, for your more important affairs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For you, the ingenious Off-spring of happy Parents, who will willingly pay the full price of Industry and Exercise for those Arts and choice accomplishments which may contribute to the felicity of your future state. For you, I say (ingenious Practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) was this Work composed, which may prove the pleasure of your youth, and the glory of your age.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for you the pretended Numerists of this vapouring age, who are more disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously witty to propound unnecessary questions, than ingeniously judicious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve such as are necessary. For you was this Book composed and published, if you will deny your selves so much as to invert the streams of your ingenuity, and by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously conferring with the Notes, Names, Orders, Progress, Species, Properties, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, Proportions, Powers, Affections and Applications of Numbers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>elivered herein, become such Artists indeed, as you now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem to be. This Arithmetick ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously observed, and diligently practised, will turn to good account to all that shall be concerned in Accompts. All whose Rules are grounded on Verity, and deliver'd with Sincerity. The examples are built up gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually



<pb facs="tcp:51879:5"/>
from the smallest consideration to the greatest. All the Problemes or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are well weigh'd, pertinent and clear, and not one of them throughout the Tract taken upon trust; therefore now,

            <head>CHAP. I. Notation of Numbers.</head>
            <p n="1">I. ARITHMETICK is an Art of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, or Knowledge which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Number well; (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Doctrine of Accompting by Numbers. And there are divers species and kinds of Arithmetick and Geometry, the which we do intend to treat of in order, applying the Principles of the one, to the Definitions of the other: For as Magnitude or Greatness is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Geometry, so Multitude or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is the subject of Arithmetick; and if so, then their first Principles and chief Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, must have like Definitions; or at least, a Semblable Congruency.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Number, is that by which the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of any thing is Expressed or Numbred; as the Unit is a number by which the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of one thing is expressed or said to be



<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51879:7"/>
one, and two by which it is named two, and ½ half by which it is named or called half, and the Root of 3 by which it is called the Root of 3, the like of any other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence it is that Unit is Number, for the part is of the same matter that is his whole, the Unit is part of the Multitude of Units, therefore the Unit is of the same matter that is the Multitude of Units; but the matter of the multitude of Units is num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, therefore the matter of Unit is number: for else if from a number given no number be substracted, the number given remain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth; let three be the number given, from which number substract, or take away one (which as some conceive is no number) therefore the number given remaineth, that is to say, there remaineth three, which is absurd.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence it will be convenient to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine from whence number hath its Rise or Beginning; Most Authors maintain that Unit is the beginning of number, and it self no number; but looking upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Definitions in the first rudiments of Geometry, we shall find, that the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a point is in no way congruous with the definition of an Unit in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; and therefore one, or unit must be in the bounds or limits of Number, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently



<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51879:7"/>
the beginning of number is not to be found in the number one; wherefore to make number and magnitude congruent in Principles, and like in Definitions, we make and constitute a Cypher to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of number, or rather the medium between Increasing and Decreasing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, commonly called absolute or whole numbers, and negative or fractional num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, between which, nothing can be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more agreeable to the definition of a point in Geometry; for as a point is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of a line and it self no line, so is (0) Cypher an adjunct of number and it self no number: And as a point in Geometry cannot be divided or increased into partes, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (0) cannot be divided or increased into parts; for as many points though in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber infinite do make no line, so many (0) Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, though in number infinite do make no number. For the line AB cannot be
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
Increased by the addition of the point. C, neither can the number D be increased by the addition of the (0) Cypher E, for if you add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to 6, the sum will be 6, (0) neither increasing nor diminishing the number 6, but if it be granted that AB be extended or prolonged to the point C, so that AC be made a



<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51879:8"/>
continued line, then AB is increased by the addition of the point C, In like manner if we grant D 6 be prolonged to E (0) so that DE (60) be a continued number mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 60, then 6 is Augmented by the Aid of (0) as to the constituting the number (60) sixty, And furthermore that one or unit is material and a number, and that (0) is the beginning of number, is proved by all Authors although indirectly, for the Tables of Sines and Tangents prove one degree to be a number, because the Sine of 1 degree is 174524 (the Radius being 10000000) and the beginning of that Table is (0) and to it Answereth 00000 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence it is that number is not quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty discontinued, for all that which is but one quantity, is not quantity disjunct; (60) six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as it is a number, is one quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> one number: (60) sixty therefore as it is number, it is not quantity disjunct; for number is some such thing in magnitude, as humidity in water; for as humidity extends it self through all and every part of Water, so Number alated to magnitude, doth extend it self through all and every part of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Also as to continued Water doth answer continued Humidity, so to a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinued Magnitude doth answer a continue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Number. As the continued Humidity or



<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51879:8"/>
any intire Water, suffereth the same Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Distinction that his Water doth; so the continued Number suffereth the same Division and Distinction that his Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude doth. From all which considerations we might enlarge a farther digression con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Number and Magnitude, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Definitions of the one, with the Principles of the other, for having found a (0) Cypher to be answerable in Definition to a point in Magnitude, we may very well conclude that number may be congruent to a line; as also the Figurative number to be consonant in definition with a superficies, and solid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the order of Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Magnitudes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Characters or Notes by which Numbers are signified, or by which a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is ordinarily expressed, are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, (<hi>viz</hi>) 0 Cypher or nothing, 1 One, 2 Two, 3 Three, 4 Four, 5 Five, 6 Six, 7 Seven, 8 Eight, 9 Nine; The Cypher which though of it self signifieth nothing, (<hi>viz.</hi>) expresseth not any certain, or known quantity, but is the beginning, Radix or Root of Number, and the other nine Figures or Characters are called signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Figures or Digits.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In Numbers of any sort, two things



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51879:9"/>
are to be considered, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Notation and Numeration.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Notation teacheth how to describe any Number by certain Notes and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and to declare the value thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so described, and that is by Degrees and Periods.</p>
            <p n="9">9. A degree consists of three figures, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of three places comprehending Units Tens and Hundreds, so 365 is a degree, and the first figure (5) on the right hand, stands simply for its own value, being Units or so many ones (<hi>viz.</hi>) five; the second in order from the right, signifies as many times ten, as there are units contained in it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) sixty; the third in the same order signifies so may hundreds as it contains units so will the expression of the Number be, three hundred sixty five, also 789, is seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eighty nine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. A period is when a Number consists of more than three figures, or places, and whose proper order is to prick or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish every third place, beginning at the right hand, and so on to the left; so the Number 63452 being given it will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished thus, 63.452 and expressed thus sixty three thousand four hundred fifty two, likewise 4.578.236.782 being distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you see will be expressed thus, four

            <p n="3">3. Artificial (by some called Logarith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical) Arithmetick is that which is performed by Artificial or borrowed <hi>numbers</hi> invented for that purpose, and are called Logarithmes.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Of Addition of whole Numbers.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ADdition is the Reduction of two, or more <hi>numbers</hi> of like kind together into one Sum or Total. Or it is that by which divers <hi>numbers</hi> are added together, to the end that the Sum or Total value of them all may be discovered.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>number</hi> in every addition is called the Addable <hi>number,</hi> the other, the <hi>number</hi> or <hi>numbers</hi> added, and the <hi>number</hi> invented by the <hi>Addition</hi> is called the <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate</hi> or <hi>Sum,</hi> containing the value of the <hi>Addition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Collation of the <hi>numbers,</hi> is the right placing of the <hi>numbers</hi> given re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively to each denomination; And the Operation is the Artificial adding of the <hi>numbers</hi> given together in order to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the <hi>Aggregate</hi> or Sum.</p>
            <p n="2">

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:51879:23"/>2. In Addition, place the <hi>numbers</hi> given respectively the one above the other, in such sort, that the like degree, place, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination may stand in the same Series, <hi>viz.</hi> Units under Units, Tens under Tens, Hundreds under Hundreds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pounds under Pounds, Shillings under Shillings, Pence under Pence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yards under Yards, Feet under Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Having thus placed the <hi>numbers</hi> given (as before) and drawn a line under them, Add them together, beginning with the lesser denomination, <hi>viz.</hi> at the right hand and so on, subscribing the sum under the line Respectively; as for Example.</p>
            <p>Let there be given 3352 and 213 and 133 to be added together, I set the Units in each particular <hi>number</hi> under each other, and so likewise the Tens under the Tens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and draw a line under them as in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, then I begin at the place
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
of Units and add them together upwards saying, 3 and 3 are 6 and 2 make 8, which I set under the line, and under the same fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures added together; then I proceed to the next place, being the place of Tens, and add them up in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I did the place of Units, saying 3 and 1 are 4 and 5 are 9, which I likewise



<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51879:23"/>
set under the line Respectively; then I go to the place of Hundreds, and add them up as I did the other, saying 1 and 2 are 3 and 3 are 6, which I also set under the line; and lastly I go to the place of Thousands, and because there are no other figures to add to the 3, I set it under the line in its respective place, and so the work is finished; and I find the sum of the 3 given numbers to be 3698.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if the sum of the figures of any Series exceeds ten, or any <hi>number</hi> of tens, subscribe under the same the Excess above the tens, and for every ten carry one to be added to the next Series towards the left hand, and so go on until you have finished your addition; alwayes remembring, that how great soever the sum of the figures of the last Series is, it must all be set down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the line Respectively. So 3678 being given to be added to 2357, I set them down as is before directed and as in the margent, with a line drawn under them, then I begin and add them, saying 7 and 8 are 15
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
which is 5 above ten, I set 5 under the line, and carry 1 for the ten to be added to the next Series, saying 1 that I carried and 5 is 6 and 7 are 13 I set down 3 and carry 1 for the ten, then to the next Series, I say 1 that I carried and 3



<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51879:24"/>
are 4 and 6 are ten, now because it come to just 10 and no more, I set 0 under the line and carry 1 for the ten to the next, and say 1 that I carried and 2 are 3 and 3 are 6 which I set down in its Respective place, thus the addition is ended, and the total Sum of these <hi>numbers</hi> is found to be 6035, several Examples of this kind follow.</p>

            <p n="5">5. If the Numbers given to be added are contained under divers denominations, as of Pounds, Shillings, Pence and Farthings; or of Tuns, Hundreds, Quarters, Pounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then in this case having disposed of the <hi>numbers,</hi> each denomination under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of like kind; begin at the least deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, (minding how many of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination do make an Integer in the next) and having added them up, for every Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the next greater denomination that you find therein contained, bear a unit in mind to be added to the said next greater denomination, expressing the excess respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively under the line, proceed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner untill your addition be finished, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Examples will make the Rule plain to the learner.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Multiplication</hi> is performed by two <hi>numbers,</hi> of like or unlike kinde, for the <hi>production</hi> of a third, which shall have such reason to the one, as the other hath to unite, and in effect is a most brief and artificial compound <hi>Addition</hi> of many equal <hi>numbers</hi> of like kind into one sum. Or <hi>Multiplication</hi> is that by which we

               <hi>Multiply</hi> two or more <hi>numbers,</hi> the one into the other, to the end that their product may come forth, or be discovered.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>Multiplication</hi> is the increasing of any one <hi>number</hi> by another, so often as there are unites in that <hi>number,</hi> by which the other is increased, or by having two <hi>numbers</hi> given to find a third, which shall contain one of the <hi>Numbers</hi> as many times as there are unites in the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Multiplication</hi> hath three parts, first the <hi>Multiplicand,</hi> or <hi>number</hi> to be <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Multipliar,</hi> or <hi>number</hi> given, by which the <hi>multiplicand</hi> is to be <hi>multiplied,</hi> and Thirdly, the <hi>product</hi> or <hi>number</hi> produced by the other two, the one being <hi>multiplyed</hi> by the other, as if 8 were given to be <hi>multiplyed</hi> by 4, I say 4 times 8 is 32, here 8 is the <hi>multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Multiplication</hi> is either single by one figure, or compound that consists of many.</p>
            <p>Single <hi>multiplication</hi> is said to consist of one figure, because the <hi>multiplicand</hi> and <hi>multipliar</hi> consist each of them of a digit, and no more, so that the greatest product that can arise by single <hi>multiplication</hi> is 81,

being the square of 9; and Compound <hi>multiplication</hi> is said to consist of many fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, because the <hi>multiplicand</hi> or <hi>multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi> consist of more places than one; as if I were to <hi>multiply</hi> 436 by 6, it is called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, because the <hi>multiplicand</hi> 436 is of more places than one, (<hi>viz</hi>) 3 places.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of Division of whole Numbers.</head>
            <p n="1">1. DIVISION is the Separation, or Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Number, or Quantity given, into any parts assigned; Or to find how often one Number is Contained in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Or from any two Numbers given to find a third that shall consist of so many Units, as the one of those two given Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is Comprehended or contained in the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Division hath three Parts, or Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> First the Dividend, Secondly the Divisor, and Thirdly the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. The Dividend is the Number given to be Parted or Divided. The Divisor is the Number given, by which the Dividend is divided; Or it is the Number which sheweth how many parts the Dividend is to be divided into. And the Quotient is the Number Produced by the Division of the



<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51879:44"/>
two given Numbers the one by the other.</p>
            <p>So 12 being given to be divided by 3, or into three equal parts, the Quotient will be 4 for 3 is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ained in 12 four times, where 12 is the Dividend; and 3 is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor, and 4 is the Quotient.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Division set down your Dividend, and draw a Crooked line at each end of it, and before the line at the left hand, place the Divisor, and behind that on the right hand, place the figures of the Quotient, as in the margent, where it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

               </gap>
to divide 12 by 3; First I set down 12 the Dividend, and on each side of it do I draw a crooked line, and before that on the left hand do I place 3 the Divisor; then do I seek how often 3 is contained in 12, and because I find it 4 times, I put 4 behind the Crooked line on the Right hand of the Dividend, denoting the Quotient.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But if the Divisor being a single Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, the Dividend consisteth of two or more places, then (having placed them for the work as is before directed) put a point under the first Figure on the left hand of the Dividend, provided it be bigger then, (or equal to) the Divisor, but if it be lesser then the Divisor, then put a point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the second Figure from the left hand of

the Dividend, which Figures as far as the point goeth from the left hand are to be Reckoned by themselves, as if they had no dependance upon the other part of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend, and for distinction sake may be called the Dividual, then ask how often the Divisor is contained in the Dividual, plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the answer in the Quotient; then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the Divisor by the Figure that you placed in the Quotient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and set the product thereof under the Dividual; then draw a line under that product, and Subtract the said Product from the Dividual, placing the Remainder under the said line, then put a point under the next figure in the Dividend, on the Right hand of that which you put the point before, and draw it down, placing it on the Right hand of the Remainder, which you found by Subtraction; which Remainder with the said Figure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed before it, shall be a new dividual; then seek again how often the divisor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this new dividual, and put the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in the Quotient on the Right hand of the Figure there before, then multiply the divisor by the last Figure that you put in the Quotient, and subscribe the Product under the dividual, and make Subtraction, and to the Remainder draw down the next Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure from the grand dividend, (having first

put a point under it) and put it on the right hand of the Remainder for a new dividual as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observing this general Rule in all kind of Division, first to seek how often the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor is contained in the dividual; then (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put the answer in the quotient) multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Divisor thereby, and Subtract the Product from the dividual. An Example or two will make the Rule plain. Let it be Required to divide 2184 by 6, I dispose of the Numbers given as is before directed, and as you see in the margent, in order to the work, then (because 6 the
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
divisor is more then 2 the first Figure of the dividend) I put a point under 1 the second Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which make the 21 for the Dividual, then do I ask how often 6 the

                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
divisor, is contained in 21 and because I cannot have it more then 3 times, I put 3 in the Quotient, and thereby do I multiply the divisor 6 and the product is 18, which I set in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dividual, and Subtract it therefrom, and the Remainder (3) I place in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the line as you see in the Margent.</p>
            <p>Then do I make a point under the next

Figure of the dividend being 8, and draw it down, placing it before the
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
Remainder 3, So have I 38 for a new dividual, then do I seek how often 6 is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 38, and because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have more than 6 times, I put 6 in the quotient, and thereby do I multiply the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor 6, and the product (36) I put under the dividual (38) and Subtract it therefrom, and the remainder 2 I put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the line as you see in the Margent.</p>
            <p>Then do I put a point under the next (and last) Figure of the dividend
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
(being 4) and draw it down to the remainder 2, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the Right hand ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it maketh 24 for a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual; then I seek how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten 6 is contained in 24, and the Answer is 4, which I put in the quotient, and multiply the divisor (6) thereby and the product (24) I put under the dividual, and Subtract it from it, and the Remainder is 0, and thus the work is finished, and I find the quotient to be 364, that is, 6 is contained in 2184 just 364 times, or 2184



<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51879:46"/>
being divided into 6 equal parts, 364 is one of those parts.</p>
            <p>If it were Required to divide 2646 by 7 or into 7 equal parts, the quotient would be found to be 378, as by the following o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration appeareth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So if it were Required to divide 946 by 8, the Quotient will be found to be 118 and 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>And here Note, that if after your Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is ended, any thing do Remain, it must be lesser then your divisor, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise your work is not Rightly performed.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51879:47"/>5. But if the divisor consisteth of more place then one, then choose so many Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures from the left side of the dividend for a dividual, as there are Figures in the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, and put a point under the farthest Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that dividual to the Right hand, and seek how often the first Figure on the Left side of the divisor, is contained in the first Figure on the Left side of the dividual, and place the Answer in the quotient, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by multiply your divisor, placing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct under your dividual, and Subtract it therefrom, placing the Remainder below the line; then put a point under the next Figure in the dividend, and draw it down to the said Remainder, and annex it on the Right side thereof, which makes a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, and proceed as before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it so happen that after you have chosen your first dividual (as is before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) you find it to be lesser then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor, then put a point under a Figure more, nearer to the Right hand, and seek how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the first Figure on the Left side of the divisor, is contained in the two first Figures on the Left side of the dividual, and place the answer in the quotient, by which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the divisor and place the product ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in order under the dividual, and Subtract it therefrom, and proceed <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:51879:47"/>Alwayes remembring, that (in all the cases of division) if after you have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed your divisor by the Figure last plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the quotient, the product be greater then the dividual, then you must cansel that Figure in the quotient, and instead thereof put a Figure lesser by a unit (or one) and multiply the divisor thereby, and if still the product be greater then the dividual, make the Figure in the quotient yet lesser by a unit, and thus do untill your product be lesser then the dividual, or at the most equal thereto, and then make Subtraction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if you would divide 9464 by 24, the quotient will be found to be 394, I first put down the given <hi>Numbers</hi> as before is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, now because my divisor consisteth of two Figures, I therefore
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
put a point under the second Figure from the Left hand in my dividend, which here is under four, wherefore I seek how often two the first figure (on the Left side of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor) is contained in nine (the like first in the dividual) the answer is four, which I put in the quotient and thereby multiply all the divisor and find the product to be ninety six, which is greater than the dividual ninety four, wherefore I cancel the four in the



<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51879:48"/>
quotient, and instead thereof I put three (a unit lesser) and by it I multiply the divisor twenty four, and the product is seventy two, which I Subtract from ninety four the dividual, and the Remainder is twenty two, then do I make a point under the next Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure six in the dividend, and draw it down and place it on the Right side of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder twenty two, and
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
it makes 226 for a new dividual, now because the dividual 226 consisteth of a Figure more then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor, therefore I seek how often 2 (the first Figure of the divisor) is contained in 22 (the two first of the dividual) I say nine times, wherefore I put nine in the quotient, and thereby multiply the divisor 24, the product 216 I place under the dividual 226, and Subtract it from it, and there Remaineth 10.</p>
               <p>Then I go on and make a point under the next and last Figure (4) in the dividend, and pull it down to the Remainder 10, and it maketh 104, for a new dividual, which is also a Figure more then the divisor, and therefore I seek how often two is contained in ten, I answer five, but multiplying my divisor by five, the product is 120, which

is greater then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor,
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>

               <p>Another Example may be this, let there be Required the quotient of 1183653 divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 385, first I dispose of the <hi>Numbers</hi> in order to their dividing, and because 118 the three first Figures of the dividend is les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser than the divisor, I therefore make a point under the fourth Figure, which is 3, and seek how often 3

from the dividual 1188 and there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth 28. Then
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
(as before) I pull down the next Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which is six, and place it before the Remainder 28, so have I 286 for a new dividual, and because it hath no more Figures than the divisor I seek how often 3 (the first Figure in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor) is contained in 2 (the first Figure of the dividual) and the answer is 0, for a greater Number cannot be contained in a lesser, wherefore I put 0 in the the quotient and thereby (according to Rule) I should multiply my Divisor, but if I do the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will be 0, and 0 Subtracted from the dividual 286 the remainder is the same; wherefore I pull down the next figure (5) from the dividend
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and put it before the said Remainder 286 so have I 2865 for a new dividual, and because it consisteth of four places (<hi>viz.</hi>) a place more than the divisor, I seek how often 3 (the first Figure of the divisor) is contained in 28 (the two first of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual)



<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51879:49"/>
and I say there is 9 times 3 in 28, but multiplying my whole divisor (385) therby I find the product to be 3465, which is greater than the dividual 2865, wherefore I choose eight which is lesser by a Unit than nine, and thereby I multiply my divisor 385, and the product is 3080, which still is greater then the said dividual, wherefore I choose another Number yet a Unit lesser, <hi>viz.</hi> 7; and having multiplyed my divisor thereby the product is 2695 lesser than the dividual 2865, wherefore I put seven in the quotient, and Subtract 2695 from the dividual 2865, and there remains 170, then I pull down the last figure 3 in the dividend and place it before the said Remainder 170, and it makes 1703 for a new dividual, then (for the reason abov-said)
<gap reason="math">

I seek how often three is contained in 17, the answer is 5, but multiplying the divisor thereby, the product is 1925 greater than the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, wherefore I say it will bear four, a Unit lesser, and by it I multiply the divisor 385, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is 1540, which is lesser than the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,

               <p>The way to Resolve questions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to add the several pieces (into which the given Number is to be brought) into one summe and to Reduce the given Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

            <p n="3">3. The Relation of Numbers in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, consists in the differences, or in the Rate or Reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

but the Rate or Reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Numbers is the Quotient of the Antecedent divided by the Consequent. So 21 and 7 being given the difference betwixt them will be found to be 14, but the rate or reason that is betwixt 21 and 7 will be found to be Triple Reason, for 21 divided by 7 quotes 3, the reason or rate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Relation of Numbers in Quality, (otherwise called Proportion) is the Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or Respect that the Reason of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have one unto another; therefore the Terms given ought to be more than two. Now this Proportion or Reason between Numbers relating one to another,<note place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. Arithmetical proportion (by some called Progression) is when divers Numbers differ one from another by equal Reason, that is, have equal differences.</p>
            <p>So this Rank of Numbers, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, differ by equal Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> by 2 as you may prove.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In a Rank of Numbers that differ by Arithmetical proportion, the Sum of the first and last term, being multiplyed by



<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51879:81"/>
half the number of terms, the Product is the total Sum of all the Terms.</p>
            <p>Or if you multiply the Number of the terms by the half Sum of the first and last terms, the Product thereof will be the total sum of all the Terms.</p>
            <p>So in the former Progression given, 3 and 17 is 20, which Multiplyed by 4 (<hi>viz.</hi> half the Number of terms) the Product gives 80, the Sum of all the terms, or multiply 8, (the Number of terms) by 10 (half the sum of the first and last terms) the Product gives 80, as before.</p>
            <p>So also 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 3, being given, the Sum of all the terms will be found to be 84; for here the Number of terms is 7, and the Sum of the first and last (<hi>viz.</hi> 21 and 3) is 24, half whereof (<hi>viz.</hi> 12) multiplyed by 7, produceth 84 the sum of the terms sought.</p>

            <p n="9">9. Geometrical Proportion (by some called Geometrical Progression) is when divers <hi>numbers</hi> differ according to like Reason.</p>

            <p>So if 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024 were given, the Sum of all the <hi>terms</hi>
               <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
will be found to be 1364. For first I divide 64 one of the <hi>terms</hi> by his next lesser <hi>term,</hi> and the Quotient is 4, by which I multiply the last <hi>term</hi> 1024 and it produceth 4096; from whence I substract the first <hi>term</hi> 4, and the Remainder is 4092, which I divide by the quote less 1 (<hi>viz.</hi> 3) and the quote is 1364 for the total sum of all the <hi>terms,</hi> as <hi>per</hi> margent.</p>
            <p>So likewise if 2, 6.18,

            <p>

               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51879:82"/>So 8, 16, 32 being given, the square of the mean, <hi>viz.</hi> 16 is 256, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Product of the <hi>Extreams</hi> 8 and 32, for 8 times 32 is equal to 256.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Of 4 Geometrical proportional <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> given, the Product of the two means, is equal to the Product of the two <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So 8, 16, 32, 64, being given, I say that the Product of the two means, <hi>viz.</hi> 16 times 32 which is 512 is equal to 8 times 64 the product of the <hi>Extreams.</hi>

that by which we find out a fourth <hi>number,</hi> in <hi>proportion</hi> unto <hi>three</hi> given <hi>numbers,</hi> so as this <hi>fourth number</hi> sought may bear the same Rate, Reason, or Proportion to the <hi>third</hi> (given) <hi>number,</hi> as the second doth to the first, from whence it is also called the Rule of <hi>Proportion.</hi>

            <p>The second Effect is, by the price or value of one thing to find the price or value of many things of like kind?</p>
            <p>The third Effect is by the price or value of many things to find the price of 1, or by the price of many things (the said price being 1) to find the price of many things of like kind.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:51879:97"/>The fourth Effect is, by the price or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of many things, to find the price or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of many things of like kind.</p>
            <p>The fifth Effect is, thereby to Reduce any Number of moneys, weight or measure the one sort into the other, as in the Rules of Reduction contained in the 8 Chapter foregoing Examples of its various Effects have been already Answered.</p>

            <p>So the first Question of this Chapter (whose Answer, or fourth Number we found to be 18 <hi>s.</hi>) is thus proved, <hi>viz.</hi> the first Number is 4, which multiplyed by 18 (the fourth) produceth 72. And the second and third Numbers are 12 and 6, which multiplyed together produce 72, equal to the product of the first and fourth, and therefore I conclude the work to be Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed.</p>

            <p>WE have already delivered the Rules of <hi>Single Proportion,</hi> and we come now to lay down the Rules of <hi>Plural Proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Plural Proportion,</hi> is when more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations in the Rule of 3 than one, are Required before a Solution can be given to the Question propounded. Therefore in Questions that Require Plurality in <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there are alwayes given more then three <hi>numbers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When there are given 5 <hi>numbers,</hi> and a sixth is Required in <hi>Proportion</hi> thereunto, then this sixth <hi>Proportional</hi> is said to be found out by the double Rule of 3, as in the Question following, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>If 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 12 Months gains 6 <hi>l.</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, how much will 75 <hi>l.</hi> gain in 9 Months?</p>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The double Rule of three is either <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> or else <hi>Inverse</hi>?</p>

            <p n="6">6. The 5 given <hi>Numbers</hi> in the double Rule of three, consist of two parts, <hi>viz. first</hi> a Supposition, and <hi>secondly</hi> of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.

            <p n="8">8.

Chapter I find the 4th. <hi>Proportional num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to be 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> so that by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>single</hi> question I have discovered how much 75 <hi>l.</hi> will gain Interest in 12 M. the operation wherof followeth on the left hand under the Letter A; and having discovered how much 75 <hi>l.</hi> will gain in 12 Moneths, we may by another question easily discover how much it will gain in 9 Moneths, for this 4th. <hi>number</hi> (thus found) I put in the middle between the two lowest <hi>numbers</hi> of the five, after they are placed according to the 7th.

the first and third <hi>numbers</hi> being of one denomination, <hi>viz.</hi> both Moneths, and may be thus expressed. If 12 Months Require 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> Interest, what will 9 Months Require? and by the 3 Rule of the 11 Chapter, I find it to be the <hi>Direct</hi> Rule, and by working according to the directions laid down in the 7, 8, and 9 Rules of the 10th. Chapter, I find the 4th. <hi>Proportional number</hi> to the last single Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be 3 <hi>l.</hi> 07 <hi>s.</hi> 06. which is the sixth <hi>Proportional number</hi> to the 5 given <hi>numbers</hi> and is the Answer to the General Question.

            <p>So that by the foregoing operation I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that If 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 12 Months gain 6 <hi>l.</hi> Interest, 75 <hi>l.</hi> will gain 3 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> in 9 Months, after the same Rate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thus have I found out what is the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of 100 <hi>l.</hi> for 9 Months, and I have now to find the Interest of 75 <hi>l.</hi> for 9 Months, to effect which, I make this 4th. <hi>number</hi> (found as before) to be my second <hi>number</hi> in the next Question, and say, If 100 <hi>l.</hi> Require 4 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> what will 75 <hi>l.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, this Question I find (by the said 3 Rule of the 11th.

            <p>Here observe, that according to the 8th.

Rule of 3 Composed of the 5 given <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When questions may be performed by the double Rule of 3 <hi>Direct,</hi> and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to resolve them by the Rule of 3 <hi>Composed,</hi> (first <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Rank</hi> your <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> according to the 7 Rule of the 12th. Chapter, then)</p>
            <p>The Rule is</p>
            <p>Multiply the <hi>terms</hi> (or <hi>numbers</hi>) that stand one over the other in the first place, the one by the other, and make their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> the first <hi>term</hi> in the Rule of 3 <hi>Direct,</hi> then Multiply the <hi>terms</hi> that stand one over the other in the third place, and place their product for the third term in the Rule of 3 <hi>Direct,</hi> and put the middle <hi>term</hi> of the 3 uppermost for a second <hi>term,</hi> then having found a fourth <hi>Proportional,</hi> direct to these 3, then this 4th. <hi>Proportional</hi> so found, shall be the Answer <hi>Required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the first question of the 12 Chap. (<hi>viz.</hi> If 100 <hi>l.</hi> in 12 Months gain 6 <hi>l.</hi> Interest, what will 75 <hi>l.</hi> gain in 9 Months? the <hi>numbers</hi> being <hi>Ranked</hi> (or placed) as is there <hi>Directed</hi> and done.</p>
            <p>Then I multiply the 2 first <hi>terms</hi> 100 and 12, the one by the other, and their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> is 1200 (for the first <hi>term</hi>) then I multiply the two last <hi>terms</hi> 75 and 9 toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

and their <hi>Product</hi> is 675 for the 3d. <hi>term.</hi> Then I say, As 1200 is to 6, so is 675 to the Answer, which by the Rule of 3 <hi>Direct</hi> will be found to be 3 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> as before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if the Question be to be Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the double Rule of 3 <hi>Inverse,</hi> then (having placed the 5 given <hi>terms</hi> as before) multiply the lowermost <hi>term</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> place, by the uppermost <hi>term</hi> of the <hi>third</hi> place, and put the <hi>Product</hi> for the <hi>first term</hi>; then multiply the uppermost <hi>term</hi> of the <hi>first</hi> place, by the lowermost <hi>term</hi> of the <hi>third</hi> place, and put the <hi>Product</hi> for the <hi>third term,</hi> and put the <hi>second term</hi> of the 3 highest <hi>numbers</hi> for the middle <hi>term</hi> to those two, then if the Inverse <hi>Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is found in the uppermost 3 <hi>numbers,</hi> the 4th. <hi>Proportional</hi> direct to these 3 shall be the Answer; so the first question of the 13th.

            <head>CHAP. XVIII. Allegation Alternate.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ALlegation alternate is when there are given the particular prises of several simples, and thereby we discover such quantities of those simples, as being mingled together shall bear a certain rate propounded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When such a question is stated, place the given prises of the simples one over the other, and the propounded price of the Composition against them in such sort that it may represent a root and they so many branches springing from it as in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. A certain Farmer is desirous to mix 20 bushels of wheat at 5 s. or 60 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel with rye at 3 s. or 36 d. <hi>per</hi> bush. and with Barly at 2 s. or 24 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel, and Oats at 1 s. 6 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel, and desireth to mix such a quantity of Rye, Barly and Oats with the 20 bushels of wheat as that the whole composition may be worth 2 s. 8 d. or 32 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:51879:121"/>The prises of the simples being placed according to the last rule, with the price of the composition propounded as a root to them will stand as followeth,
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Having thus placed the given num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers you are to link or combine the several rates of the simples the one to the other, by certain arches in such sort that one that is lesser then the root, (or mean rate) may be linked or coupled to another that is greater then the mean rate, so the question last propounded will stand,
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p n="4">

               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:51879:121"/>4. Then take the difference between the root and the several branches, and place that difference against the number or branch, with which it is coupled, or linked, and having taken all the differences and placed them as aforesaid, then those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences so placed, will shew you the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of each simple to be taken to make a composition to bear the mean rate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>So the branches of the last question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing linked together as in the first manner, I say the difference
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
between 32 and 60 is 28 which I put against 18 because 60 is linked with 18, then the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between 32 and 36 is 4 which, I put against 24 because 36 is linked or coupled with 24, then I say the difference between 32 and 24 is 8 which I place against 36 (for the reason aforesaid) then I say the difference between 32 and 18 is 14 which I place against 60; and then the work will stand as you see in the margent.</p>
            <p>So I conclude that a composition made of 14 bushels of wheat at 60 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel, and 8 bushel of Rye at 36 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel and



<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51879:122"/>
4 bushels of Barly at 24 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel, and 28 bushels of Oats at 18 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel, will bear the mean price of 32 d. or 2 s. 8 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel. And here observe that in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position there is but 14 bushels of wheat, but I would mingle 20 bushels, and this kind (or rather case) of Allegation alternate (<hi>viz.</hi> when there is given a certain quantity of one of the simples, and the quantities of the rest sought to mingle with this given quantity that the whole may bear a price propounded) is called alternation par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
            <p>And the proportion to find out the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quantities to be mingled with the given quantity is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the difference annexed to the branch that is the vallue of an integer of the given quantity is to the other particular differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so is the quantity given, to the several quantities required.</p>
            <p>So here, to find out how much Rye; barly, and Oats must be mingled with the 20 bushels of wheat, I say by the single rule of three direct, if 14 bushels of wheat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 8 bushels of Rye, what will 20 bush. of wheat require? answer 11 6/14 bushels of rye.</p>
            <p>Again, if 14 bushels of wheat require 4 bushels of barly what will 20 bushels of

wheat require? answer 5 10/14 bushels of barly. Again, I say, if 14 bushels of wheat require 28 bushels of Oats, what will 20 bushels of wheat require? answer 40 bushels of barly.</p>
            <p>And now I say that 20 bushels of wheat mingled with 11 6/14 bushels of rye, and 5 10/14 bushels of barly, and 40 bushels of oates each bearing the rates as aforesaid, will make a composition or heap of Corn that may yeild 32 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel.</p>
            <p>But if the branches had been coupled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the second order, or manner, then the differences would have been thus plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences

            <p>You see by this work we have found how many bushels of rye, barly, and oats, ought to be mixed with 8 bushels of wheat, and to find out how many of each ought to to be mixed with 20 bushel of wheat I say, As 8 is to 14 so is 20 to 35 bushels of rye. As 8 is to 28 so is 20 to 70 bushels of barly. As 8 is to 4 so is 20 to 10 bushels of oates. whereby I conclude that if to 20 bushels of wheat I put 35 bushels of rye, 70 bushels of barly, and 10 bushels of oats bearing each the foresaid prises <hi>per</hi> bush. that then a bush. of this mixture will be worth 32 d. or 2 s. 8d.</p>
            <p>And if the branches had been linked as you see in the third place, where each branch bigger then the root, is linked to two that are lesser then the root, then in this case you must have placed the several differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the root and branches, against those 2 with which each is coupled, as first the difference between 32 and 60 is 28 which I Put against 24 and 18 because it is

coupled with them both, then the difference between 32 and 36 is 4 which I set likewise against 24 and 18, because 36 is linked to to them both then the differenee between 32 and 24 is 8 which I put against 60 and 36 because 24 is linked to them both, then the difference between 32 and 18 is 14 which I put against 60 and 36 the yoke fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of 18.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I draw a line behind the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and add the differences which stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst each branch and put the sum behind the said line against its proper branch as you see in the margent.</p>
            <p>And now by this work I find that 22 bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of wheat mingled with 22 bushels of rye, and 32 bushels of barly, and 32 bushels of oats each bearing the said price will make a mixture bearing the mean rate of 32 d. <hi>per</hi> bushel.</p>
            <p>And to find how much of each of the rest must be mingled with 20 bushels of wheat I say</p>
            <p>As 22 is to 22 so is 20 to 20 bush of rye.</p>
            <p>As 22 is to 32 so is 20 to 29 2/22 bush. of barly. As 22 is to 32 so is 20 to 29 2/32 bushels of Oats.</p>

               <hi>Answer.</hi> 9 C. 1 qr.</p>
            <p>First find by the Rule of 3 how much the Pepper is worth, saying</p>

               <hi>Answer,</hi> 8 l. 8 s.</p>
            <p>Say by the Rule of 3 if 1 l. 17 s. 4 d. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 2 l. 16 s. in <hi>barter</hi> what will 5 l. 12 s. require in <hi>barter</hi>?</p>

B hath shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon worth 4 s. per yd.

               <hi>Answer,</hi> 180 yds. of shalloon.</p>
            <p>First (as in the last question) find out how B. ought to sell his shalloon in <hi>barter, viz.</hi> say If 6 s. require 8 s. what will 4 s. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?</p>

               <hi>Answer.</hi> 5 s. 4 d.</p>
            <p>Thus you see that B must sell his shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon in <hi>barter</hi> at 5 s. 4 d. if A sell his broad-cloth at 8 s. per yd.</p>
            <p>It remaineth now to find how much shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon B must give for 120 yds. of broad-cloth, which after the same method used to resolve the first question of this Chap. is found to be 180, and so many yds of shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon must B give A for the 120 yds. of broad-cloath.</p>

Practice how much the Cloth cost him at 8 s. 6 d. <hi>per</hi> yd. <hi>viz.</hi> 185 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> then by the same Rule find out how much he sold it for <hi>viz.</hi> 225 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> then subtract 185 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> which it cost him, from 225 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which he sold it for, and there remaineth 39 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for his gain in the sale thereof.</p>
            <p>Otherwise it may sooner be resolved thus, first find out how much he gained <hi>per yd. viz.</hi> subtract 8 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> which he gave <hi>per yd.</hi> from 10 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which he sold it for <hi>per yd.</hi> the remainder is 1 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> for his gaines <hi>per yd.</hi> then say.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Question may be Resolved at two single Rules of Three; for first I say,</p>
                  <p>If 3/1 Ducats at <hi>Naples</hi> make 150 pence at <hi>London,</hi> how many pence will 4 ⅘ Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats make?</p>

                  <p>By the fore-going Proportion we have discovered, that 4 ⅘ Ducats at <hi>Naples</hi> make 240 pence at <hi>London:</hi> And by the Tenour of the Question we see that 4 ⅘ Ducats at <hi>Venice</hi> make 34 ½ shillings at <hi>Brussels,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 240 pence at <hi>London</hi> are equal to 34 ½ shillings at <hi>Brussels,</hi> (for the things that are equal to one and the same thing, are also equal to one another,) wherefore we have



<pb n="320" facs="tcp:51879:166"/>
a way laid open to give a solution to this Question by another Single Rule of Three, whose Proportion is,</p>
                  <p>As 34 ½ shillings at <hi>Brussels</hi> is to 240 pence at <hi>London</hi>; so is 138 shillings at <hi>Brussels</hi> to 960 pence at <hi>London,</hi> which is the Answer to the Question.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Question is likewise answered at two single Rules of Three, <hi>viz.</hi> First, I say,</p>
                  <p>As 36 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> is to 40 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Lond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So is 90 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to 100 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Lond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by the Question you find that 90 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> is 116 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Dantzick</hi>; and therefore 100 l. at <hi>London</hi> is likewise equal thereunto, wherefore again I say,</p>
                  <p>As 100 l. at <hi>London</hi> is to 116 l. at <hi>Dant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So is 112 l. at <hi>London</hi> to 129 23/25 at <hi>Dant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:51879:166"/>By which I find that 112 23/25 l. at <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick</hi> are equal to 112 l. <hi>Averdupois</hi> weight at <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a more speedy way to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve such Questions as are contained under the two Cases before mentioned, laid down by Mr. <hi>Kersey</hi> in the third Chapter of his Appendix to Mr. <hi>Wingates</hi> Arithmetick, where he hath given two Rules for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the Questions pertinent to the two said Cases.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But I shall lay down a general Rule for the solution of both Cases; and first, let the Learner observe the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in placing of the given terms, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Having thus placed the Terms, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule is,</p>
                  <p>Observe which of the said Collumes hath the most Terms placed in it, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply all the Terms therein continually, and place the last Product for a Dividend; then multiply the Terms in the other Collume continually, and let the last Product be a Divisor; then divide the said Dividend by the said Divisor, and the Quotient thence

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. A Person having about him a certain number of Crowns, said if the fourth and third and sixth of them were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together they would make just 45, now I demand the number of Crowns he had about him? <hi>Answer</hi> 60 Crowns.</p>
               <p>To resolve this question I suppose he had 24 Crowns (or any other number that will admit of the like division) now the fourth of 24 is 6, and the third is 8, and the sixth is four, all which parts (<hi>viz.</hi> 6, 8, and 4,) being added together make but 18, but it should be 45, wherefore I say by the Rule of three.</p>
               <p>As 18 the sum of the parts, is to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition 24 so is 45 the given number to 60 the true number sought.</p>
               <p>For the fourth of 60 is 15, and the third of 60 is 20, and the sixth of 60 is 10, which added together make 45.</p>

Three Persons, <hi>viz.</hi> A, B, C, thus discourse together concerning their age, quoth B to A I am as old, and half as old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain as you, then quoth C to B I am twice as old as you, then quoth A to them, and I am sure the sum of all our ages is 165, now I demand each mans age? <hi>Answer A</hi> 30, <hi>B</hi> 45, <hi>C</hi> 90, years of age, which added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether makes 165.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXXII. Double Position.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe Rule of Double Position is, when 2 False positions are assumed, to give a resolution to the question propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. VVhen any question is stated in dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble position, make such a crosse as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Then make choice of any number you think may be convenient for your working, which call your first position, and place it at that end of the crosse at <hi>a,</hi> then work with this position (as if it were the true number sought,) according to the nature of your question, then having found out your errour, either too much or



<pb n="327" facs="tcp:51879:169"/>
too little place, it on that side the crosse <hi>d,</hi> then make choice of another number of the same denomination with the first positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which call your second <hi>position</hi>) and place it on that side of the crosse at <hi>b,</hi> then work with this <hi>position</hi> as with the former, and having found out your error, either too much or too little, place it on that side of the crosse at <hi>c,</hi> and then the positions will stand at the top of the crosse, and the errors at the bottom each under his correspondent <hi>position,</hi> and then multiply the errors into the <hi>positions</hi> cross-wise, that is to say multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the first <hi>position</hi> by the second error, and the second <hi>position</hi> by the first error, and put each product over its <hi>position.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Having proceeded so far, then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether the errors were both alike, that is, whether they were both too much, or both too little, and if they are alike, then subtract the lesser product from the greater and set the remainder for a dividend, then subtract the lesser error from the greater, and let the remainder be a divisor, then the quotient arising by this division is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the question.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But if the errors are unlike, that is one too much and the other too little, then add the products of the <hi>positions</hi> and errors, together and their sum shall be a dividend,



<pb n="328" facs="tcp:51879:170"/>
then add the <hi>errors</hi> together and their sum shall be a Divisor, and the quotient arising hence is the Answer; which two last Rules may be kept in memory by this verse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>When Errors are of unlike kinds</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Addition</hi> doth ensue</l>
                  <l>But if alike, <hi>Subtraction</hi> finds</l>
                  <l>Dividing work for you.</l>

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. A, B and C Build a house which cost 76 <hi>l.</hi> of which A paid a certain sum unknown, B paid as much as A and 10 <hi>l.</hi> over, and C paid as much as A and B, now I desire to know each mans share in that Charge?</p>
            <p>Having made a Cross according to the 2 Rule, I come according to the third Rule to make choice of my first position, and here I suppose A paid 6 <hi>l.</hi> which I put upon the Cross as you see, then B paid 16 <hi>l.</hi> (for it is said he paid 10 <hi>l.</hi> more then A) and C paid 22 <hi>l.</hi> for 'tis said he paid as much as A and B, then I add their parts



<pb n="329" facs="tcp:51879:170"/>
               <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and they amount to 44, but it is said they paid / 2 <hi>l.</hi> wherefore it is 32 too little, which I note down at the bottom of the Cross under its position for the first error.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I suppose A paid 9 <hi>l.</hi> then B paid 19 <hi>l.</hi> and C 28 <hi>l.</hi> all which added toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make 56, but they should make 76, wherefore the error of this position is 20 which I put at the bottom of the Cross un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his position, for the second <hi>Error,</hi> then I multiply the <hi>Errors</hi> and the <hi>Positions</hi> Cross-wise, <hi>viz.</hi> 32 (the <hi>Error</hi> of the first <hi>Position</hi>) by 9 (the second position) and the product is 288. Then I multiply 20 (the <hi>Error</hi> of the second <hi>Position</hi>) by 6 (the first <hi>Position</hi>) and the Product is 120.</p>
            <p>Then (according to the 4th. Rule) I subtract the lesser product from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (<hi>viz.</hi> 120 from 288 because the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>



               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:51879:171"/>
are both alike, <hi>viz.</hi> too little) and there Remaineth 168 for a dividend, then I subtract 20 (the lesser <hi>Error</hi>) from 32 (the greater <hi>Error</hi>) and the remainder is 12 for a Divisor, then divide 168 by 12 and the Quotient is 14 for the Answer, which is the share of A in the payment.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again secondly, If the errors had been both too bigg it had had the same effect, as appeareth by the following work; for first I suppose A payed 20 <hi>l.</hi> then B paid 30 <hi>l.</hi> and C 50 <hi>l.</hi> which in all is 100 but it should have been no more then 76, wherefore the first <hi>Error</hi> is 24 too much. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain I suppose A paid 18 <hi>l.</hi> then B must pay 28 <hi>l.</hi> and C must pay 46 <hi>l.</hi> which in all
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is 92 <hi>l.</hi> but it should have been but 76 <hi>l.</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the second <hi>Error</hi> is 16 too much; then I Multiply 20 (the first <hi>Position</hi>) by 16 (the second <hi>Error,</hi> and the product is 320, again I multiply 18 (the second <hi>Position</hi>)



<pb n="331" facs="tcp:51879:171"/>
by 24 (the first <hi>Error</hi>) and the product is 432.</p>
            <p>Then because the <hi>Errors</hi> are both too much I subtract 320 (the lesser product) from 432 (the greater product) and there Remaineth 112 for a Dividend, likewise I subtract 16 (the lesser <hi>Error</hi>) from 24 (the greater <hi>Error</hi>) and the difference is 8 for a Divisor, then perform Division, and the Quotient is 14 (as before) for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>Again Thirdly, If the <hi>Errors</hi> had been the one too bigg, and the other too little, Respect being had to the 5th. Rule fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, the answer would have been the same; as thus, I take for my first <hi>Position</hi> 6, and then the <hi>error</hi> is 32 too little, then I take for my second <hi>Position</hi> 18, and then the <hi>error</hi> is 16 too much, then I multiply the Positions and <hi>errors</hi> Cross-wise, and the products are 96 and 576, and because the <hi>errors</hi> are unlike
<gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>viz.</hi> one too bigg, and another too little, I



<pb n="332" facs="tcp:51879:172"/>
add the products 96 and 576 together, and their sum is 672 for a Dividend, I likewise add the <hi>errors</hi> 32 and 16 together, and their sum is 48 for a Divisor, then having finished Division I find the quotient to be 14 which is the answer, as was found out at the 2 several Tryals before.</p>
