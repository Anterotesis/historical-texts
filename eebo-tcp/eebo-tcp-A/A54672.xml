            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though its Grandeur hath been lately Eclips'd, and the wide circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of its Jurisdiction and Command hath been contracted into a narrower Orb, by the Revolt of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> because its ancient Rights
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60538:6"/>
were invaded by <hi>Conde Olivarez;</hi> and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Defection of <hi>Portugal,</hi> because its Native Franchises and Immunities were assaulted by <hi>Vasconcelos</hi> the Secretary, and other ill Ministers of State; yet is <hi>Catalonia</hi> by the valour and Magnanimity of <hi>John de Austria,</hi> and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct of the Marquisse of <hi>Mortara,</hi> almost retriv'd and again knit to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony; nor did the Duke of St. <hi>German</hi> and the Marquiss of <hi>Viana</hi> not long since manage and improve the increasing Hopes of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to lesse advantage in <hi>Portugal;</hi> for since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Olivenza</hi> by the first, and the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Monzon</hi> and <hi>Salvaterra</hi> on the River of <hi>Minho</hi> by the last, that Crown and Scepter did then seem to shake, and was fear'd (if not by a timely supply supported) it might have fallen from the Head and Hand of their own Native Soveraign, to prostrate themselves at the Feet of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarch. But not long after, the Victory of <hi>Elvase</hi> did so expiate these crooked and sinister accidents, that the Diadem of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> that did before look somewhat dim, did by this Conquest and other successes of a more modern Aspect, seem to recover its primitive lustre.</p>
               <p>Having in this short Preface limn'd out a Compendious prospect of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Empire, I shall now take a more full and serious view of all those Limbs which like so many Ingredients fall into the Composition of this great Body;

First, Though they give obedience to their Prince with their Bodies, they deny him the service of their Purses; being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all Tallages and Impositions, for when ever the King of <hi>Spain</hi> approaches their Borders, he is accosted in his progresse by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60538:21"/>
Noblesse of the Country, neer the Borders, and there they present him with some small pieces of Brasse, called <hi>Maravedies,</hi> treasur'd in a Lethern Bag appendant to the End of a Lance, which he is oblieged not to take; which refusal (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his,) does enwrap a Tacit Symboll of a Confirmation of their Immunity from Taxes. Secondly, at all their publique Assemblies, the Women first taste of the Cup, which custome hath grown by tacit Consent into use, and hath been made hoary and reverend by a prescription of many years, ever since <hi>Ogne</hi> Countesse of <hi>Castile</hi> attempted to destroy the Life of her Son, by a Cup of Wine fatally mingled with poyson. Thirdly, they admit no Bishops; which aversnesse to that Order, peradventure had its Rise and Growth from some antecedent pressure imposed upon them by that Order, as our modern Sectaries from some personal Defects they beheld in the <hi>English</hi> Protestant Bishops, did arrive at that height of Animosity as to abrogate their Function; as if this were an equitable piece of Logick, because there is an Error in the Seed therefore consequently there must be one in the Soil, not considering that these <hi>Biscainers</hi> by the want of Bishops and Episcopal Visitations have fallen into that ignorance, rudenesse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, which like a Cimmerian Mist dwells yet about them. Fourthly, they allow or give license to no Priest to officiate amongst them unlesse he bring his Concubine with him, to appease his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60538:22"/>
affirming it impossible to preserve their Wives chast and unmix'd from the imbraces of the Incumbent, if he hath not a woman with may allay the wilder flames of Concupiscence. But to proceed, though the ancient Inhabitants were so martial and vigorous, yet the frequent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of the <hi>Romans</hi> so wasted their strength, that though they were not wholly subdued, yet they were forced to resign themselves with some Salvo or Provision which had a Reflection on their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, to the Command of <hi>Augustus.</hi> Under the <hi>Romans</hi> they continued untill that Empire shrunk into its own Ruins, and then not brought under Servitude by the <hi>Goths,</hi> but surrender'd to them with the Residue of <hi>Biscay.</hi> And this indeed may be added to their glory, that they were the last Province of <hi>Spain</hi> which offered themselves up to the successeful Fury of the <hi>Moors</hi> (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Asturias</hi> never part of their Triumphs) and the first which disengaged their Necks of that yoke of Conquest the <hi>Moors</hi> had loaded them with, animated in that design by <hi>Soria,</hi> who so managed and improved their increasing Hopes, with Conquests and augmentation of Territory, that about the year 870. he undertook the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Lord of <hi>Biscay,</hi> and from him did the Title and Estate by the steps of several descents passe down to his Successor <hi>Lopez Diaz</hi> the third, the first who assum'd to himself the Sirname of <hi>Haro,</hi> borrowed from a Town of that name of that Foundation; and from him did it descend to

And in this posture it remained until the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> endevouring to enlarge their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories made it bow to their Government; but here it had not long been resident, when the power of the <hi>Romans</hi> growing paramount to theirs, it was forced to submit to the more
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60538:35"/>
predominant strength of that Empire, and to their Interest it was subservient, untill it was ravished away by the prevailing Arms of the <hi>Goths,</hi> whose Acquists here attended the Fate of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was surrendred to the <hi>Moors</hi> in that publique Calamitie which was complicated with their Conquest. But about that time when the Foundations of the Kingdomes of <hi>Leon</hi> and <hi>Navarre</hi> were established, one <hi>Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius</hi> a Person of an unbroken Courage, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining any longer to lye panting under that load of Slavery which the <hi>Moors</hi> had cast upon him, disengaged himself of the pressure, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny generous Conflicts with the <hi>Moors,</hi> wherein he exhibited many Symptomes of an inexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Courage, he invested himself in the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of some Lands on the Banks of the River of <hi>Aragon;</hi> but because he found his Power was too infirm and crazie to support his new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quists without some collateral supply, he put himself under the Protection of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> about the Year 775. And that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, both to excite and cherish so worthy a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue with some exemplary Guerdon, dignified him with the Title of Earl of <hi>Aragon;</hi> and from him it devolved by Descent to his Lineal Successor <hi>Fortunio Ximines,</hi> in whom the Male Line determined, so that <hi>Fortunio</hi> the Second King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> in Right of his Mother <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raca</hi> who was his Sister and Heir, was entitled to <hi>Aragon</hi> supported by this Alliance, annexed

this Province to <hi>Navarre;</hi> and from him the Clew of Descent transmitted it to <hi>Sancho the Great</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who gave it to his Son <hi>Raymir</hi> begotten in unlawful Embraces, to the prejudice of his Lawful Son <hi>Garcia,</hi> who indeed justly merited this Disherision, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had by an unnatural Accusation ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to blast the Reputation of his Mother Queen <hi>Elvira</hi> Wife to his Father, by besmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with the Calumnious Aspersion of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, from which black tincture she was assoil'd by the Noble and generous Assistance of <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> above mentioned, who offered to assert her Innocence by the solemn Decision of a mutual Combate with this <hi>Garcia,</hi> which obliged his Father King <hi>Sancho</hi> to reflect with so benigne an eye on so great a Virtue, that he thought the Earldome of <hi>Aragon</hi> a proportionate Guerdon to his Merit and Courage, and translated the Coronet of this Province into a Diadem, that the Reward designed him might swell into a more considerable Dimension, and with more Lustre adorn his Temples; and from this <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> did there Issue out a Series of Kings that was never interrupted, disturb'd, or ravel'd in the Clew of Descent, but in an even order went along untill the Line of Succession brought the Crown of <hi>Aragon</hi> to empale the Temples of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> sirnamed <hi>the Catholick,</hi> who by Matching with <hi>Isabella</hi> the Heir of <hi>Castile,</hi> linked and incorporated these two Kingdoms into one Body,

As for the Country it self though it be productive of a narrow Increase of Wheat, yet is it of a large plenty of Roots (the principal food of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants) some proportion of Maiz, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cocas, the Leaves whereof being dried and formed into Lozenges, are exceeding use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a journey, for melting in the mouth they appease both hunger and thirst, and preserve a man in his strength, and his Spirits in vigor; and though the Cattel of <hi>Europe</hi> brought hither in a considerable quantity, are not multiplyed to any great increase, yet is that defect supplied by Beasts called <hi>Vicagues,</hi> in Resemblance some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a wilde Goat, which in infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers graze in their woods and pastures; and great store of Sheep by the Natives called <hi>Pacos,</hi> profitable for Fleece and Burden, as big as a small breed of Horses, but in relish as pleasing as our Mutton, and no lesse conducing to nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment. A Creature so well acquainted with his own abilities, that when he is over-pressed

                  <hi>Honduras</hi> is a fourth Province of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> a Country so swoln with Hills or depressed with Vallies, that it affords little Champaigne, yet is productive of Maiz and Wheat, and of rich Pasturage, improved to that Fertility by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant over-flowings of their Rivers about <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas.</hi> Some Mines of Gold are affirmed to be wrapped up in the Entrails of the Earth not yet discovered; the Inhabitants being made so unactive with Sloth and Idlenesse, that they had rather subsist by Roots, the common stock of Nature, then by the more industrious design of Tillage, and therefore not easily charmed to toyle for others, that will not Labour for their own necessities.</p>

From the Top of the Tree issues a Juice in consistence like a Syrrup, which upon Decoction puts on the shape of an Hony; and if purified, the form of Sugar, out of which they extract both Wine and Vinegar. Out of the Bark, being roasted, is drawn a convenient Plaister for wounds, bruises and sores; and from the highest of the Bowes distils an unctuous Juice like a Gum, which is a Soveraign Antidote to chastise the malignity of

Poyson. But I have digressed, I now return to the description of those Provinces above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and first <hi>Panuco</hi> obviates our discovery, so called from <hi>Panuco</hi> the Chief River of it, which bubling out of the Hills of <hi>Tepecsuan,</hi> bordering upon <hi>Cinoloa</hi> and <hi>Couliacan,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding <hi>New Biscay</hi> from the Province of <hi>Zoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecas,</hi> glides through the middle of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and so at last after many traverses disem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogues it self into the Gulf of <hi>Mexico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is divided into three lesser Provinces called <hi>Aiotuxetlan, Chila,</hi> and a Third whose Name is not yet discovered. The Soil is in some parts fruitful and productive of Mines of Gold, in others again lesse pregnant, and in the last Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces dry and unpleasant, being condemned to Barrenness &amp; infertility not from any intrinsique defect in the Soil, but rather (as its thought) from a want of Inhabitants to cultivate the Earth, who being active and couragious, rather than they would bow their necks to a Forraign Servitude, have been almost rooted out in those Contests and Encounters which were waged between them and <hi>Cortez</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> the second Province, hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted its Name from that plenty of Fish their abundance of Rivers and Lakes afford them, the word importing in the Native Idiome <hi>Locus Piscosus</hi> or a Country of Fish. It is ennobled with an Air so sweet and salubrious, that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased people repair thither from distant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60538:72"/>
to retrive their Health, which is likewise promoted and inforced by the use of those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable hot Baths which issue from Rocks and other craggy Repositories. The Soil is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully productive of Grain even to admiration. It is well Wooded and full of excellent Pastures, which are improved by the multiplicity of Springs and Rivers, nor does it yeild to any part of <hi>America</hi> for Herbs and Plants of an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive and Medicinal nature in the Conquest and expulsion of Diseases. It is likewise redundant with Amber, Mulbery-trees, Wax, Hony, and such other things as are subservient both to Pompe and Pleasure. The Inhabitants are tall, strong, and active, of no contemptible Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, as being dextro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Mexicana</hi> is the third Province which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges our consideration. The Soil abundantly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes not only the Inhabitants, but likewise nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Herds of Cattel, with plenty of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor is it defective in Fruits, of which there is a liberal production. The Inhabitants
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60538:72"/>
are industrious as to the care of their common Subsistence, which commonly is supported by their copious Stock of Cattel, of which some private persons abound to such store, that their Register amounts to Forty thousand Kine and Oxen: Nor are they lesse dextrous in extracting a livelyhood from Fish, of which last they draw out such plenty from the Lake of <hi>Mexico</hi> alone, that the profits arising from this Trade swell to a volume of Twenty thousand Crowns paid yearly into the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Exchequer: They are ingenious likewise in those Mechanical Arts which here are professed, growing good Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftsmen, if they stoop so low as to Trades; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming rich Merchants, if they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a more noble and profitable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and waxing hardy and valiant Soldiers, if they are disciplin'd and imployed in Service, having in Times of more high ascent, very well managed the Sling and Arrowes their ancient Arms, and in these modern Ages as vigorously (being enured to it by their <hi>Spanish</hi> Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours) weild the Harcubuize and Pike which are their new. But the greatest Glory and Fame which both now &amp; anciently did accrue to them, was their exquisite perfection in composing their Feather Pictures, turning every feather to the Light every way, upwards and downwards, to discover in what posture it will best fit the place intended for; secondly, their most accomplish'd expertnesse in Refining their Metals; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60538:73"/>
their curious designs in Painting upon Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, whatsoever was represented to the Eye. But these Virtues and perfections were stained and debauched with so Barbarous a Cruelty, that they thought no victime so fit could be offered up to appease the Fury of their gods, as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of humane Sacrifices, so that it is no wonder if God permitted the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sword to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But Ignorance and Barbarity are still complicated and entwined, and so it was manifested here, for upon the first Eruption of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their misguided Apprehensions esteemed Them and their Horses to be one peice, and when they neighed they demanded what they spake, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly placing no Distinction between neighing and speaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guaxaca</hi> is a fourth Province which falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Cognisance. It hath assumed this Name from <hi>Guaxaca</hi> the principal Town of these parts, now styled <hi>Antequera.</hi> The Air hereof is sound and salubrious, which hovers over a Soile as fruitful, productive not onely of those Commodities which it enjoyes in common with other Provinces of this Continent, but likewise blest with such plenty of Mulberry-trees, that from thence is extracted such a quantity of Silk,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60538:73"/>
that if the Natives paid their Tithes (as they do not) the Income which issued from thence, would afford a Revenue competent enough to support five Bishopricks. Rivers are here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry numerous, whose Shores for the most part are enamelled with Golden Sand, nor is there here any deficiency of Cochineele, Cassia, Silver, and other Metals; so that if the Industry of the People were but correspondent to the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Soil and Wealth of the Country, it might become as opulent as any Province in <hi>America:</hi> But the natural sloth of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants makes them impatient of Labour, and consequently intercepts all opportunities which may suggest an occasion of ama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing together any considerable Estate; yet notwithstanding this, they are of a tractable and docile Capacity in relation to the Impressions of the Catholique Faith, which hath encouraged the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to establish here an Hundred and twenty Covents of <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers, and many other Schools and Seminaries of Learning, that by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and concurrent assistance they might better improve the growth of Christianity in this Province.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jucutan</hi> is a fifth Province which calls for our remembrance. It hath borrowed this Name from <hi>Jucutan,</hi> which in the Idiome or Dialect of the Country imports as much as <hi>What say you?</hi> For when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their first arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val demanded the Name of the place, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

The Soil is generally condemned to Barrenne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor are its bowels more pregnant in Mines of Gold and Silver or any other Metalls, so that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral subsistence of this People, is principally supported by Trades and Mechanick Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But that which makes this Country most remarkable, is, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon their first approach discovered here some symptomes or glimpses of Christianity, the people generally observing a constant Form of Baptisme, which in the Native Dialect is styled a second Birth, expressing by that word a Regeneration; nor is any one permitted, to Marry untill he hath the Symboll of this Initiation, which probably was some <hi>Vestigium</hi> or Relique of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion left here behind by <hi>Mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tlascalla</hi> is that eminent Province, which being one of the Seven Tribes, which having supplanted the Ancient Natives, the <hi>Chichime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,</hi> could never be reduced to the Tyranny and Usurpation of the Kings of <hi>Mexico,</hi> but
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60538:74"/>
still preserved themselves, notwithstanding their frequent Eruptions in the Liberty of a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie or Free State, and erected here the City of <hi>Tlascalla,</hi> which as it gave Name to, so it became the Metrapolis of this Province, and in this Capacity they remained until the Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Cortez</hi> made upon <hi>Mexico,</hi> to whose as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance out of Animosity to the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> they and the Inhabitants of <hi>Zempoallan,</hi> another City of this Province, contributed such large sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies both of Men and other Necessaries, that by their concurrence <hi>Mexico</hi> was reduced and the Scepter of that Kingdom broken to peices; and though they were forced afterwards to bow to the successful Sword of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet do they preserve still some shadow of ancient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, being exempt from all kind of Tribute, as a Recompense of their former Services, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be an handfull of Wheat for every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and permitted to live under the protection of the former Government.</p>
               <p>This Province is abundantly stored with Corn and Cattell, every where strewed with rich Pastures, and abundantly productive of Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is levell and beaten out into an even Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne, unlesse where it confines on the Sea, where it is made Gibbous and rugged with a Chain of craggy Mountains; but indeed the Fertility of the Earth is very much inforced and multiplyed by those many Rivers which stream almost through every vein of it.</p>

                  <hi>Jucutan</hi> was first Discovered by <hi>Ferdinand Cordova</hi> in the Year 1517. which Discovery was in the Year 1518. reinforced by <hi>John de Grijalua,</hi> and persued likewise by the Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Designs of <hi>Cortez,</hi> who about <hi>Tabasco</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over the Natives a signal Victory; but the final reduction of this Province to the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Soveraignty of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> is entitled to the Successful Sword of <hi>Francisco Monteio,</hi> who in the Year 1527. atchieved a full and absolute Conquest over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Guaxata</hi> followed the Fate of <hi>Panuco</hi> and <hi>Mechoacan,</hi> and by their Conquest and Subjection augmented the Triumphs of the Victorious <hi>Cortez,</hi> about the Years 1521, and 1522. <hi>Tlascalan</hi> was first Discovered by <hi>John Grijalua,</hi> but received under the Protection of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Scepter by <hi>Cortez</hi> in the Year 1521.</p>

                  <hi>Nova Gallicia</hi> is circumscribed on the East and South with <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> on the West with the River of <hi>Buena Guia,</hi> and the Gulfe of <hi>Califormia,</hi> the Countries which abutt on
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60538:75"/>
the Northern parts of it are not yet exposed to a Discovery. It hath assumed this Name from some resemblance or proportion it holds with the Province of <hi>Old Gallicia</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Air generally is of a temperate Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, yet more inclinable to heat than cold, yet often discomposed with Thunders and Storms, and Cataracts of Rain; the ground is much obnoxious to drynesse, if not mollified by the Morning Dewes which here distill fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, but whether the Temperature of the Air or Soil do contain in it some impure Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalities is incertain; sure it is, that here is a production of Gnats (it is possible they may proceed from a complicated putrefaction) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be in bulk equall to a Bean, which by their stings afflict the People, and raise Blisters on their Bodies proportionate in their dimension to a Walnut.</p>
               <p>The Country in general is more knotted with Hills then levell with Plains, and in most parts Sandy. Quarryes of stone are here in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but there is a deficiency of Marble, or any other Stone of value. Plenty here is of Mines of Silver, but few of Gold or Iron; yet is their Silver not free from a mixture of Lead. The Soil is so Fertile that for one Measure of Wheat it payes back its Interest in Sixty, and for one of Maiz it refunds Two hundred. The Rivers abound in Fish, and the Woods in Beasts; Swarms here are of Bees without stings, which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60538:76"/>
have no other Hive but the Forrest to compose their Hony in. Apples, Pears, Citrons, Figs, Malacotons, and other <hi>European</hi> Fruits trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Spain,</hi> thrive better here than in their Native soil, onely the Cherry and Olive arrive at no perfection; of which the first hath her nourishment purloin'd from her by Emmots, and the last thrusts forth such clouds of Leaves, (occasioned by the ranknesse of the circumam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient earth) that the Fruit seldome ascends to just maturity.</p>
               <p>The People are of an inconstant volatile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, apt upon any Disgust to abandon their Houses, and take Sanctuary in Woods and other Fastnesses; nay, to return to their ancient Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme. Tractable and docile enough even in Matters which relate to Religion; but lazie and impatient of Labour, to which they hardly are enur'd either with Stripes or Wages, yet they are of vigorous and healthful temper, contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diseases seldome breaking in upon them, which is occasioned by the sound Constitution of the Air. Much given they are to Dancing, Singing, and sometimes to Drinking. Their stature is reasonably tall, their Vesture general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a Shirt of Cotton, with a Mantle cast over it, fastned with two Buckles about their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They Inhabit in Villages, which swell in their Dimension, according to the greatnesse of those several Tribes they are to receive, which Tribes are under the Command of their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60538:76"/>
Chiefs, who succeed hereditarily, yet notwithstanding are all subservient to the Sway and Regiment of the Judges, and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Plenty here is of Sugar-canes and Cochineele; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being concerned in more gainfull Merchandise, and eager in the persuit and search of Metals, neglect to refine the one, and are not very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous to attend the ordering of the other.</p>
               <p>If you will Survey the Anatomy of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you will find it to be dissected into seven subordinate Provinces; namely, 1 <hi>Cinaloa.</hi> 2 <hi>Couliacan.</hi> 3 <hi>Xalisco.</hi> 4 <hi>Guadalaira;</hi> and on the Western shores, 5 <hi>Zacot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Cinaloa</hi> the first Province in the Register a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, is made happy by an Air ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally clear and healthy, and enriched with a Soil fat and Fruitful, productive of Maiz, Pulse, and a certain long Pease, equivalent to those in proportion the <hi>Latines</hi> anciently called <hi>Phaseoli,</hi> of which it contributes to the industry of the Inhabitants a large Abundance; and this plenty is much enhaunsed by the multiplicity of Rivers with which this Province is very well watered.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are generally of an eminent Stature, which much exceeds that of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> Warlike they are, vigorous and Active, and not reduced to the obedience of the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:60538:77"/>
without the expence of much Blood and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, though their Furniture either for offensive or defensive War, consisted in a narrow Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, being only a massie Club, a Bow and some poysoned Arrows. Those Garments which both Sexes attire themselves with, are made out of Cotton-wooll, of which this Province yeilds a plentiful increase; The Hair of both Sexes is nourished a considerable length, which the Men winde up in a knot, but the Women permit to shoot out into a wide Diffusion. Both Sexes at the first approach of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to veile their Nakednesse, onely their <hi>Pudenda</hi> were obscured, being both indigent and ignorant, adoring the Sun, and making their Diet out of Humane Butcheries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Couliacan</hi> is the second Province which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts our Notice; It enjoys a Soil plentiful of Fruits, and yeilding to none in its production of all sorts of provisions; and not defective in Mines of Silver, which owe their first Discovery to the Ingenuity of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are not much different from the residue of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> only the Beauty, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, and Dresse of the Women is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging; yet the Men were not secure from sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and unnatural uncleannesse. The Vesture which both Sexes were habited in at the first Discovery of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was framed out of Cotton-wooll. Their Houses are neatly thatch'd with straw, but the Lintells of the Dores are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60538:77"/>
embellished with paintings full of impudence and impure obscenity. They are ignorant of Gold, of which this Province is defective, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having discovered some Silver Mines, made them by a costly experience know the Value of that Metall, compelling them both to Dig and Refine it, that it might be more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall to the ends of their Avarice and Luxury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xalisco</hi> or <hi>Galesco</hi> is a third Province of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It enjoyes a Soil very capable of the production of Maiz, with which it plentifully rewards the Industry of the Inhabitants, onely the scorchings of the Sun have introduced a penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Herbage, which is the greatest defect, onely the Northern parts styled <hi>Chiatnetla,</hi> are endued with more fertility and people, being enriched with store of Wax, plenty of Honey, and some Mines of Silver. The People were formerly embarqued in perpetual Feuds and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contests amongst themselves, and dieted themselves with Mans flesh; which barbarous Customes, their conversion to Christianity hath extinguished, onely one of their Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes they yet adhere to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is, to sustain the smallest Burdens on their Shoulders, and not carry them under their Arms, as thinking the last indecent and mis-becoming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guadalaira</hi> is a fourth Province which obliges our Discourse. The Character which we have in generall propotioned to the Natives of <hi>Nova</hi>

                  <hi>Gallicia,</hi> may be fitted and shaped in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the Inhabitants of this Province. The Soil being moistned with the kind refreshments of the River <hi>Barania</hi> which cuts through the midst of it, becomes fortunate in the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Herbage, Maiz, Wheat, and other Fruits which owe their first Extraction to <hi>Europe;</hi> nor are they destitute of Silver Mines, whose bowels here cast out their Treasure in some plenty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacatecas</hi> is a fifth Province, circumscribed within the Pale of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> whose Inhabitants whether by the conduct and Instinct of Nature, or the impulse of external Force, are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious than the rest of the <hi>Gallician</hi> Natives. The Soil is in its entrails enriched with Silver Mines, but its surface is naked and barren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destitute of Maiz, Wheat, Water, and all other provisions which should contribute to the support of humane nature, as if it were design'd to be the residence of some greedy Miser, who delighted to glut his Eyes more than his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. The Northern parts styled <hi>Uxitipa,</hi> have nothing wanting which may give a supply either to necessity or pleasure; and though they are defective in Silver, yet are they plentifully stor'd with Corn and Fruit, whilst their Woods are liberally replenished with Deer, whose several Trees afford such entertainment to Quires of Birds, that they may be deemed the constant Repository of those feathered Choristers.</p>
