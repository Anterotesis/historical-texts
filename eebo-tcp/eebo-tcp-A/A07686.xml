            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſee it verefied by experience, that all earthly and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things haue their ende, to the which they tend. Our very yeares are limitted, God hath meaſured out our moneths, the dayes of our liues are dated, how long we haue to liue. So that our firſt leſſon (euen at the beginning) that we haue to learne, is this, to thinke of our ending. Wee ſee that the longeſt day paſſeth, and the night ſucceedeth: howe ſummer fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth winter, and winter ſummer. The ſunne it hath both his riſing, and his ſetting, his ſhining and his ſhading. The ſpring time hath his courſe in couering,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:6"/>
and clothing the ground with fruites. Summer it rypens them, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt gathers them, and winter ſpends them. Thus one thing followeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and both one and another paſſe ſwiftlie to their end. The generation of one thing is the diſtruction of another, and the death of one thing is the life of another: firſt is our generation, then our conception, after comes our birth in wonderfull weakeneſſe, our cradle is our caſtle, when we haue once crept out of that, we come to a little ſtrength: yet long is the time eare we come to ripeneſſe. And here (behold) we neuer continue in one ſtate: for as our ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth increaſed at the firſt, ſo by little, and little it diminiſheth at the laſt. As youth ſucceedeth childhood, and age youth: ſo childhood, youth, and age, haue all their end. We prooue by experience, that the freſheſt and ſweeteſt flower ſoone fadeth, and hath his fall: our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments waxe olde, be they neuer ſo gay:
<pb facs="tcp:21260:6"/>
our buildings become ruinous be they neuer ſo ſtately: And as our life is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by the death of Gods creatures: ſo death ſhall be the end aſwell of vs, as of them. But to come neere to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you ſee the former yeare, which was new, is both olde, and ended: the new yeare which is now entered, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a new gift, a debt I may call it, which your deſerts may challenge for a dutie. That which I write, I wiſh, God onely muſt giue it: yet (through him) I offer it, God graunt you may well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. A poſey therefore I preſent, moſt fitteſt for your ſtate, which is both freſh, and faire, ſweete, and ſauerie: which neither the froſt of Winter can ſo bite, or the heate of Summer ſo parche, or any ſtorme or weather what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſo aſſayle, but that it ſpringeth, ſmelleth, taſteth, and laſteth for euer. <hi>Memento mori:</hi> Remember to dye. <hi>Recordare nouiſsima,</hi> Remember your latter end: this is your Poeſey, and
<pb facs="tcp:21260:7"/>
you ſhall neuer doe amiſſe, this is the ſmell, this is the ſent of your Noſegay, which if you apply dayly to your ſences, it will perfume your ſoule and body, that all without you, and within you, ſhall be as a ſweete odour, and flagrant incenſe, to the Lorde of Hoſtes.</p>
            <p>Nowe to make profite of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, remember (I beſeech you) that ſithence we liue, mooue, and haue our being in God, that therefore our liues are not our owne, but lent vs for a time. Remember that we are borne to dye, and dye to liue: If this once were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into our braines, we would not ſo much deceiue our ſelues. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of death, and hope of life, makes vs ſo ſecure, and careleſſe, as that we deſire no other heauen, then earth. Many make a couenant with Death, and clap hands with the graue, hoping thereby to eſcape, and ſo bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their fleſhly pleaſures, and
<pb facs="tcp:21260:7"/>
wallowe like Swine in their filthineſſe, following things apparant to the eyes, neuer regarding the time to come, till death preuent them of a ſudden, and ſommon them to appeare before their Iudge: ſo it comes to paſſe, that as they liued wickedly, ſo they dye moſt miſerablie. Their hope is as the winde, and their confidence like the Cobweb. Death is a terrour, and a tormentour, both to ſoule and body: and this is the reaſon, they haue not learned to dye. Death is ſtrange vnto them, he ſeemes an vgleſome monſter, they dare not once beholde him. True it is, that Death in it owne nature is moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beholde, that the ſight thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazeth all our ſences: yet he that is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with faith, is well aſſured, that it is ſent for his profit, to be his packhorſe to carry him from earth, to heauen: from paine, to pleaſure: from miſery, vexation, griefe and woe, to endleſſe mirthe, melodie and ioyes vnſpeakable
<pb facs="tcp:21260:8"/>
with God for euer. To the ende there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the remembrance of Death driue vs not to diſpaire, but may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort vs in our conflicts, it will not be amiſſe (if according to my skill) I ſhew you ſome Anatomie, in which you may ſee (as in a glaſſe) the originall of Death, and from whence it came, what it is by nature, with the power, ſtrength, and ſting thereof: and what through Chriſt to the faithfull. Laſtly, a preſeruatiue, or at leaſt a preparatiue againſt the ſame, ſo that it may rather helpe vs then hurt vs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, touching the originall and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Death, it ſeemeth doubtfull from whence it came, &amp; what Auctor it had: for although the iſſues thereof be in the hand of God, and that it is his handmaide to execute his will (as he alſo fetters the very diuels themſelues, who can do nothing without him) yet all the creatures that God made were very good, and as he is the very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:21260:8"/>
it ſelfe: ſo can nothing but good proceede from God. And therefore ſince Death, and the diuell, be enimies to God and goodneſſe, be deſtroyers and corrupters of nature, which he had made, they are none of his creatures, he is neither their Auctor, nor they of his offpring. From whence then came Death? it proceeded from the diuell. <hi>God</hi> (ſaieth the wiſe man) <hi>created</hi> Adam <hi>without corruption, and made him after his owne Image: yet through enuie of the Diuell, came Death into the worlde, and they that holde of his ſide, prooue it.</hi> So that the father of Death is the Diuell: and as he is ill by nature, ſo is Death in it ſelfe iſſuing and proceeding from ſuch a Fountaine. The Diuell is the Auctor of ſinne, and conſequently of Death: for by Sinne, Death entred, and Death is the wages thereof. He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſinne, is of the diuell: for the diuel ſinneth from the beginning, he is a murtherer from the beginning, he is
<pb facs="tcp:21260:9"/>
both a lyar and the father thereof: not by creation, but by corruption. God made him an Angell, he made himſelfe a diuell. So falling from God, he fell from goodneſſe, and became the father of ſinne and wickedneſſe. <hi>Non ſtetit in veritate:</hi> he ſtood not in the trueth. Now being thus transformed, from an Angell to a diuell, and that of himſelfe, not of God, who made him good, he loſt the prerogatiue of his creation, and ſo was altered both in name &amp; nature. Now being falne, obſerue his fetches, (being that enuious man) he repined at the ſtate of man, made like to God: He came couertlie to <hi>Heuah</hi> in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the Serpent, and after long allurements, caught her in his ſnare, that ſhe conſented. So being ſnared, ſhe bends her force to catche her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band alſo: and indeed preuailed. Marke the diuels proceedings, and ſee what hookes he had hidden, vnder his fine and pleaſant baites. Firſt he bewitches
<pb facs="tcp:21260:9"/>
her ſences with a faire ſhew, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie taſte of the fruite forbidden. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he aſſaileth them with infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and doubtfulneſſe of Gods worde pronounced: namely, that they ſhould dye the death, and puts in peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Thirdly, he oppoſeth himſelfe to the vndoubted trueth of God, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe the contrarie, <hi>You ſhall not dye.</hi> Laſtly he pricks them forwarde to pride and ſelfe loue, <hi>You ſhall be as Gods, you ſhall be as cunning as the higheſt in good and euill.</hi> So the poore creatures, not leaning to God, nor asking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell at his worde, but truſting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and beleeuing his vaine and ſtrong deluſions, they yeelde and came to his lure: and in yeelding, were ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and ſo ſnared, and holden with the cordes of their owne ſinne, and fetters of their owne finding out. Then through this diſobedience, comes the iuſtice of God to reuenge it ſelfe on man, and the penaltie which it exacted,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:10"/>
was death appointed, and due by God to their diſobedience.</p>
            <p>See therefore nowe the petigree of Death, and of what parentage it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Came it from God? (I ſay) no; but was deriued from the diuell, by the meanes of ſinne, which he brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worlde, whoſe ſtipend and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, is death and damnation: the oucr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of mankinde, an enemy to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the breache of Gods lawe, the power of the diuell, the ſtrength of Gods wrath, and moſt heauie diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; And albeit that Death (as I haue ſaid) be deriued from the diuell, yet it is alſo attributed to man himſelfe, to leaue him inexcuſable, as it moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeareth in <hi>Paules</hi> compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Adam. As by the offence of one man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Death raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ouer all, and ſinne came on all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: ſo by Chriſt, which is one, the benefit of grace abounded towards all men to iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life: and as ſinne by</hi> Adam,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:10"/>
               <hi>reigned vnto Death: ſo grace reigned by righteouſneſſe vnto eternall life through Chriſt.</hi> In which oppoſition we may likewiſe ſee Death attributed vnto all, through <hi>Adam,</hi> and not vnworthily: ſo that man and diuell, are partners in ſinne, and ſo in Death. Here two things runne together: the tempter and the obeyer. Satan tempted, and perſwaded of enuie, intermingling the matter, with lying and ſlandering of the truth to breake Gods commandement: yet notwithſtanding all this, Satan had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preuailed, had man reſiſted, and not conſented: therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that in reſpect of Sathans enuie, and roote of his euill temptation and lying, tending all to mans vndooing, and vtter deſtruction, that ſo he may be called (as he is indeed) the Auctor of Death: yet in reſpect of the aſſent &amp; conſent of man in tranſgreſſing Gods lawe, Death may well lye on his neck, and he may moſt boldly be accounted
<pb facs="tcp:21260:11"/>
his owne bane, though indeede there were no other Autor, being created to the likeneſſe of God himſelfe, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing with free will, which (as then) he poſſeſſed. The diuell then is not the abſolute and proper cauſe of ſinne and death, becauſe the nature of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and proper cauſe is ſuch, that it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, the effect cannot chooſe but follow: but it falleth not out ſo in man, prouoked of the deuill: who although he continually aſſaile, and moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently aſſault Gods children to ſinne: yet ſinne doth not alwayes follow his aſſaults. His worke is not effectuall, for many of Gods ſaints and ſeruants very mightily reſiſt him, being armed with faith: which weapon he flyeth. Againe, let vs imagine (ſaith a godly father) the diuell himſelf neuer to haue falne from God and man (as yet) to haue ſtoode in his creation: yet man by nature might haue declined, and ſhould haue had indeed the cauſe of ſinne in himſelfe:
<pb facs="tcp:21260:11"/>
the reaſon is this; God gaue him free will, and ſo left him to himſelf: free it could not be, but that he had full choiſe of good and euill: yet not ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and naked was he left, but that God gaue him power and ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to continue in his vpright ſtate: albeit he leaning too much one waye, and ſliding from Gods lawe, and not vſing, but rather abuſing the meanes that God had giuen him, he fell of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from his creation, and ſo was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the ſnare of the diuell, death, and euerlaſting condempnation: ſo that in this ſuppoſition the ſuggeſtion of the diuell is not ſimplie the cauſe of ſinne and death (the diuell as yet not degenerating from God.) Neither alſo hath the diuell power of mans will to bowe it (as he liſteth) to his purpoſe. Furthermore, we muſt not thinke that God is to be blamed, for not ſhutting all gates, and ſtopping all gaps tending to ſinne: for that (as I ſayd before) he
<pb facs="tcp:21260:12"/>
gaue to man, armour ſufficient to defend himſelfe, and to keep him from falling. Neither yet was it vnagreeable to Gods iuſtice, to make a diſtinction betweene himſelfe and his creature, for that he himſelfe is only good, without change or alteration, all his creatures good, yet ſubiect to change: yea in the very Angels of heauen themſelues (in reſpect of God) there is found imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the Cherubins hide their faces with their wings, for the brightneſſe of his glory.</p>
            <p>Thus doth God humble all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to exalte himſelfe, to teach them this, not to go from him, of whom they had, and haue their goodneſſe, nor to leane onely to themſelues (though by creation good) yet ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Though mans nature (ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine)</hi> was vpright and ſound, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſinfull, yet it was capable of ſinne &amp; apte to receiue corruption. Though man in his nature were immortall (ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:21260:12"/>
in his ſtate) yet was he inclinable to mortalitie. As for example; we ſee our fleſh apte to receiue a wound, yet euery one is not wounded. The body of man is ſubiect to ſiekneſſe, yet many often dye, not ſubiect to ſickneſſe: ſo the ſtate of <hi>Adams</hi> body was ſuch, that although he might haue dyed, yet (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſinne had come betweene) he might and ſhould haue beene preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God from death. Euen as the hoſe and ſhooes of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in the deſert by Gods mightie power neuer waxed olde, by wearing or conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore to hedge vp this gap, man was ſubiect to death by nature, yet not neceſſarily, as though he ſawe no way to ſhunne it: for now I go no further then mans knowledge, ſetting Gods election and ſecret working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: for he had ſufficient force giuen him of God in his creation, to auoide it. Gods lawe was written in his heart agreeable to his nature: he thought it
<pb facs="tcp:21260:13"/>
no yoake or ſlauerie to obſerue it, his ſhoulders, and other parts being ſtrong enough to ſuſteine it. Sinne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſee, hath diminiſhed our ſtrength, and altered our nature, that now we are ſlaues to thoſe, who before were our ſubiects. Gods law now writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is the ſame that before were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in nature: yet now it is a huge weight, and heauie yoake, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, nor our fathers were able to beare, except we be firſt new borne in by the holy Ghoſt, giuen vs of God through Chriſt. So that to conclude this point, not only the diuell, but euen we our ſelues are the cauſe and auctor of ſinne, and ſo of Death. Although indeed (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alledgeth) <hi>An ill thing hath no cauſe efficient, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</hi> And if any man (ſayth he) wyll goe about ouer curiouſlie to ſearche out the efficient cauſe of Death, it is all one, as if a man ſhould labour with his eyes to ſee darkeneſſe, or to bend the
<pb facs="tcp:21260:13"/>
ſence of his eares to heare ſilencc, which ſince they bee of themſelues meere depriuations, haue no eſſence in nature, though exiſtent in ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and knowne vnto vs. The ſight ſeeth nothing but bright things, and the eare heareth nothing but a noyſe of loude things: theſe thinges are knowne to our ſences, not by vſe, but by depriuation onely. The deficient cauſe, and Autour therefore of ſinne and Death, is Diuell and Man: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell by ſuggeſting, the other by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: both their actions not vrged of God, but voluntarily of themſelues. Learne therefore this by the way, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer committeth ſinne is of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: whoſoeuer ſinneth is the ſeruant of Death. Neither let vs ſo rage againſt the Deuill, as that we altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empte our ſelues from gilte, but rather knowing the readineſſe of the diuell, in aſſayling, and our owne willingneſſe in obeying, we may both renounce the
<pb facs="tcp:21260:14"/>
Diuell, and forſake our ſelues, &amp; cleaue onely in this extremitie to the Lord. Out of this original of Death, we may fetche the definition: wherein let vs conſider what it is in nature of it ſelfe, without Chriſt, what ſting it hath, and of what power and ſtrength it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Death in it ſelfe, is not onely a killing of the body, but alſo a ſleying of the ſoule: not onely a ſeparation of ſoule from body, but a diuiſion and cutting off, both of ſoule &amp; body from God. Death therefore is two folde, to wit, corporall and ſpirituall: yet both of them, the ſtipends and rewards of ſinne, and both of them due to all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception: For all ſinned, and are deſtitute of the grace of God. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death (as I ſaid) is a ſeperation of the ſoule from the body, and is called the firſt death. Spirituall death, is a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, of the ſoule from God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding and ſhutting out of the ſame, from the bleſſed and ſweete countenance
<pb facs="tcp:21260:14"/>
of God, which is life it ſelfe: and this is called the ſecond death; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (I ſay) to all by reaſon of ſinne, yet not preuayling ouer Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for whoſe ſinnes Chriſt hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied. Death therefore at a worde, is nothing elſe but a departing from life, and the life of the body is the ſoule: therefore the ſeperation of the ſoule from the body, is death. And as the ſoule is life to the body, ſo the life of the ſoule is God: therfore the going or departing of the ſoule from God (to cleaue to ſinne) is the death alſo of the ſoule. Without God there is no lyſe: therefore <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah,</hi> departing from God, departed from life: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their ſoules were not preſently ſeperated from their bodyes, yet being gone from God, their life; they lay (as it were buried) in their bodies, as alſo their bodies themſelues, euery moment ſubiect to corruption. So ſoone as man by ſinne turned himſelfe from God:
<pb facs="tcp:21260:15"/>
euen ſo ſoone was he deſtitute of his grace and fauour, that he could not ſo much as once aſpire to felicitie, ſo tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And euen as thoſe that are condempned of the Iudge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for a while (perhaps) they may be reſerued aliue in priſon, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, yet in effect they are accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but for dead men.

               <pb facs="tcp:21260:16"/>
               <hi>dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue thee light: you hath he quickened, which were dead in your treſpaſſes and ſinnes.</hi> By this that hath bin ſpoken, we may ſee, not one, but all are ſubiect to the ſpirituall death, being full of ſinne and diſobedience, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, (thoſe onely excepted) which are quickened by Chriſt, and are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed by Baptiſme into his death, to die to ſinne, and liue to righteouſneſſe, to the glory of him that dooth quicken them. And as faith in Chriſt, is the lyfe of the ſoule being dead through ſinne: ſo no faith can quicken vs, which is not liuely in it ſelfe, namely which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth not Chriſt, which worketh not by loue, which flouriſheth not with fruites: for faith without good fruits, is dead. And therfore to the end we may be reuiued (being buried in our ſinnes) we muſt firſt beleeue in Chriſt, which is our lyfe. If our beliefe be liuely, we muſt ſhew it forth by our fruits: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we may haue a name to liue, and
<pb facs="tcp:21260:16"/>
yet be dead. Nowe to vnderſtand this pointe the better: learne what it is to be dead in ſinne. They are ſayd to be dead in their ſinnes, whom Death ſtill holdeth in the fetters and cordes of their ſinne, who cannot ſo much as mooue themſelues to any goodneſſe, who haue no ſence or feeling either of Gods mercie or their owne miſeries. Thoſe to whom all goodneſſe is vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, whoſe bodies and ſoules are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den captiues of the diuell, whom they ſerue as ſlaues, which are like the deafe Adder, that ſtoppeth her eares, and will not heare the voyce of the charmer, charme he neuer ſo wiſely: ſuch as are wedded to their owne wicked willes, whom the God of this worlde hath ſo blinded, that they can neither heare nor beleeue the truth: whoſe conuerſion is as hard, as to raiſe vp ſonnes of ſtones vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi> Here we ought to learne to lothe ſinne, which brings vs in ſuch thraldome to Death and diuell, which
<pb facs="tcp:21260:17"/>
cuts vs off from God, ſhuts vs out of heauen, robs vs of ſaluation, brings the wrath of God vpon vs: which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable and infinite, and neuer able to be fully ſatisfied, but by only Chriſt, who is infinite and of like maieſty with God his father. Nowe to the end that the goodneſſe of Chriſt, and his grace, (which hereafter I minde to ſpeake of) may more appeare, in ſo miraculouſlie deliuering vs from the power of death, and the deuils tyrranie; it will not be amiſſe to ſet out the force, ſtrength, &amp; ſting thereof, that the power of Chriſt in vanquiſhing the ſame, may more be magnified. The originall you haue heard already, as alſo the diſcription, who be ſubiect to it, and their ſtate in this their thraldome: Now therefore marke, that as the diuell, and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether brought in death, by ſinning, ſo it now being entred, is become the very kingdome of Satan, wherin he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth his tyrranny. By this death he
<pb facs="tcp:21260:17"/>
ſheweth his triumphing ouer man, whome he ſo ſeduced in holding him ſo faſt fettered in the linkes of his owne ſinnes, and ſo hath him as his ſlaue, is counted as his Prince, and ruleth ouer him as a head. God did renounce vs, although he created vs, and caſt vs of, whom he had made: euen to the forme of his Image. And as through ſinne, he gaue vs ouer to the deuill: ſo he iuſtly appointed the meanes to hamper vs: neither was this his doing contrarie to his iuſtice; nay rather if he had not ſo done, he ſhould haue ſeemed to deny himſelfe, and to be repugnant to his worde pronounced. In the beginning he created man, in righteouſneſſe, and holineſſe, according to his owne ſhape and likeneſſe. So long as he kept this forme, he enioyed his bleſſed preſence, his protection and prouidence ruled ouer him. He wanted nothing that was neceſſary for him, all creatures were his ſeruants, they came at his call, &amp; bowed
<pb facs="tcp:21260:18"/>
at his beck, euen the beaſts of the fielde, the fowles of the ayre, and the fiſhes of the ſea, he put all things in ſubiection vnder his feete: ſo that it forceth the Prophet to cry out, and with a lowde voyce to exclaime. <hi>O Lord how excellent is thy name, in all the worlde? what is man that thou art ſo mindefull of him? or the ſonne of man that thou ſo regardeſt him? thou madeſt him lower then the Angels to crowne him with glorie, and great worſhip, he wanted nothing that harte could wiſhe, he was placed in Paradiſe amongst all paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing pleaſures.</hi> The ground of it ſelfe yeelded foorth her increaſe, without toyle or trauell. He was made Subiect to no creature, but was Lord of all (him onely excepted) who had ſo preferred him. This God, and this Lorde, for all theſe his graces and bleſſings vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, required no great homage or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at his hand, he exacted no high rente, he did not ouer charge him: But only this (to ſhewe his ſoueraigne authoritie
<pb facs="tcp:21260:18"/>
ouer him) he gaue him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, no weightie thing to be obſerued, but a matter eaſily to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: to wit (that he hauing aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of al things beſide, he ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyne (for his pleaſure) from taſting of the tree of good and euill: and all this he did, to trye his obedience. Marke now on the other ſide, this vnkinde creature: this vngratefull wretch, and wicked man, forgetting God, and what he had done for him, caſting all aſide behinde his backe, moſt traiterouſlye, villanouſly, and moſt lyke a monſter, rebels againſt his Lord, contemneth his Creator, and ſets his God at naught, &amp; ſo liſtens to the deuill, beleeue his lyes, following lyke a beaſt his ſenſuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: and euen in that one thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, ſpighteth his God, regardeth not his worde, feareth not Death that was threatned, but eateth of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tree, maugre the beard of God and his iudgements. See therefore the
<pb facs="tcp:21260:19"/>
greatneſſe of his ſinne, and the due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of this euerlaſting death (which I ſpake of) could any puniſhment bee great enough, or any bitter plague bad enough for ſuch a haynous fact, that whereas God had giuen him ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and freedome of all things, he would not ſo much as obey him in one. Againe, God did not onely binde him to obey him, but threatned his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. <hi>If thou eate thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> Notwithſtanding both Gods commaunding, and his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he is moſt careleſſe, and ſwiftly runnes headlong to ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo entred into ſuch a maſſe of miſeries, whence neither he himſelfe, or his poſteritie, could euer vnwinde themſelues. For ſo abuſing his owne freewill, he loſt it, and was made a ſlaue vnto himſelfe: defacing Gods image, he became like vnto the diuell: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning life, he found out death, euen death erernall. This was the wages of
<pb facs="tcp:21260:19"/>
his ſinne, this was the hyer of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, this great profit reaped he for his paines. Marke nowe the fruite of his diſobedience: God thruſt him out of Paradiſe, and being extruded, kept him out by Cherubins, ſo he ſawe his owne ſhame, and could not couer his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: his Figge leaues would not ſerue his turne, but God accurſed him, and his ſeede: he plagued the earth with barrenneſſe, &amp; made all creatures feele the ſmart of this fall: and as he diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God; ſo cauſed he diſobedience in the creatures towardes him. Hereof comes thefearceneſſe of Lions, Beares, Tygers, Wolues, and all wilde beaſts: hereof ariſed all rebellions, and warre, diſorder, ſcarcitie, dearth, hunger, cold, nakedneſſe, plagues, murther, and all kinde of miſeries that are in the world: all which, are fore-runners of this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, and ringleaders to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And to conuince vs of this our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed ſtate the better, God renewed
<pb facs="tcp:21260:20"/>
his law firſt written (as I ſaid) in nature: but blotted out by our fall, euen in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, to ſhew vs the hardneſſe of our hearts, that ſo (as in a glaſſe) we might ſee our owne condemnation. For amidſt the heapes of other ſinne, pride ſo poſſeſſed our hearts, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we were nothing but ſinne: yet we thought our ſelues cleane, holy, and righteous. We were ſo blinded, that we knew not ſinne, vntill the law layd it open, &amp; ſhewed vs our nakednes. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law (ſaith</hi> Paul) <hi>we had not knowen ſinne. I knew not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſinne, but by the law: for I had not knowen luſt, except the law had ſayd, Thou ſhalt not luſt. But ſinne tooke an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; wrought in me al maner of concupiſence: for without the law, ſin is dead.</hi> Not as though there were no ſinne in the world before the publiſhing of the law (for euen the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> them ſelues which had not the law written, ſhewed the effect of the law in their harts, their conſcience alſo bearing
<pb facs="tcp:21260:20"/>
witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing one another, or excuſing) and therfore being conuinced of ſin in their ſoules without the lawe written, are a lawe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelues: and ſinning without the lawe, ſhall periſh without the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by the lawe of nature ingrafted in their hearts. This is prooued by many morrall vertues, that they naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and by many vices which they naturally hated. This knowledge of the lawe of nature (though vnperfect) yet ſufficient to confound them. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it ſinne indeed was then hidden in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and their beſt knowledge of the lawe ſo ouerſhadowed, and well nigh blotted, that ſinne could not appeare in his nature. But when the lawe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, ſinne (that ſeemed to be dead) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, and ſhewed it ſelfe: all our ſpots did then appeare, which before were darkened, by ignorance of Gods lawe, which we gained by our fall. The lawe then conuinced vs of ſinne, &amp; reuealed
<pb facs="tcp:21260:21"/>
our nakedneſſe, which our Fig leaues had hidden, it opened the inward man with all his concupiſcence, it ſhewed vs our ſhame and confuſion, our vgel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſhape, moſt monſtrous to behold, how wee were tranſformed from the Image of God, to the ſimilitude of the diuell: it put vs in remembrance of our deuine nature, which wee had loſt: it ſhewed vs hell and the wrath of God. Nothing but condemnation appeared by it: it let vs vnderſtand how farre we were falne from God, how all things both within vs and without vs, were corrupted: it painted out God in his nature, according to his moſt pure ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and iuſtice: how he requireth all our heart, all our ſoule, all our mynde, all our might, all our ſtrength, all our force, in this his ſeruice. All our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, both head, handes, and heart (yea all partes that we poſſeſſe) are tyde to his obedience. The leaſt ſinne could not ſhadowe it ſelfe, but it ſhewed it in
<pb facs="tcp:21260:21"/>
vs, not condempning only our outward actes, but geuing ſentence againſt our wicked thoughtes: yea, all our idle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without conſent. And therefore ſince all fleſh (created of God) is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo that the verie imaginations of mans hart, are onely euill continually, ſince that by the Law it is co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>inced, that there is none that doth good, no not one, but all are concluded vnder ſinne, and ſubiect to the ſame guilt of damnation. Since by the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the knowledge of ſinne, and that it ſtoppes euery mans mouth, and makes all the worlde ſubiect to Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and ſummons them to appeare before his ſeate: ſince it was added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of tranſgreſſions, &amp; that our ſinnes might more appeare and abound: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called (to the vnregenerat man) an importable yoke: the occaſion of ſinne, hence it is called the law of ſinne, and of wrath, the adminiſtration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation, &amp; the oldnes of the letter,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:22"/>
which can not giue life, but pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all our workes accurſed.</p>
            <p>And here beholde the ſtrength and ſting of death. How did death enter? By ſinne. How did ſinne appeare? and what is the ſtrength of the ſame? The Law of God, which giueth ſentence of condempnation agaynſt all fleſh, and leaueth not one iuſtified in his ſight: And yet notwithſtanding all this, the Law of God is holy, iuſt, and good, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his very will, ſetting a bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes as well as a curſſe. It was not contrary to our nature before it was corrupted, but agreeable for the Image of man, in which he was firſt created. It teacheth the very patterne of true obedience, what is agreeable to God and his nature, how much he hateth ſinne, and delighteth in goodnes. It of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth both lyfe and death: lyfe to the obeyers, death to the breakers.</p>
            <p>Therefore let vs all glorifie God, let euery mans mouth be ſtopped from accuſing
<pb facs="tcp:21260:22"/>
him or his Law. Let vs confeſſe againſt our ſelues our ſinnes, and ſay vnto him: Shame and confuſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longes vnto vs, Death and dampnation is our due: the heauie anger, wrath, and hell, are our deſartes: And thou O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, art iuſt, righteous, good, and gratious, in all thy doinges for euer. Let vs thus (I ſay) giue ſentence againſt our ſelues, that God may be founde cleare (euen to the moſt wickedſt men) when he is iudged. Well then, let vs beare in minde that God is not too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in puniſhing vs with eternall death, by reaſon of our ſinnes ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by his lawe: and that Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite iuſtice thus broken &amp; diſobeyed, coulde not otherwyſe be anſwered of man, but by infinite ſuſteyning of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death.</p>
            <p>Marke therefore (I pray you) the whole kingdome of the Deuil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He firſt fighteth and warreth with temptations, which are as dartes to wounde our
<pb facs="tcp:21260:23"/>
ſoules to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if we reſiſt not, (being ſo tempted, but yeelde to ſinne) then comes the Law againſt vs with his force, and by vertue of the Law, death entreth and triumpheth. For the ſting of death is ſinne, and the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law: for it ſheweth vs Hel, which is the pallace of Death, &amp; leaues vs in perdition. So that you ſee (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my promiſe) what Death is it ſelfe, what Prince it hath, and what ſtrong Souldiers it hath to keepe his kingdome: to wit, the Deuill him ſelfe, ſinne, lawe, wrath of God, and all to vpholde it: Wherefore it is no maruel yf the remembraunce of death be bitter to many, and that they abhor and hate it. I ſay it is no wonder if all their ioyntes do tremble and ſhake a ſunder: for the horror thereof made the Sonne of God oft to pray againſt it, to ſweate droppes of bood for the agonie of it, and to cry out to his Father as a man forelorne. <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21260:23"/>
Neither yet was this ſo ſtrange a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to ſee the Sonne of God ſo amazed at death: for it ſet both Deuill, Lawe, Sinne, Hell, Graue, and wrath of God againſt him: all theſe were armed to ouerthrow him: all theſe were Death his Souldiers, and appoynted captaynes to conquer Chriſt. And any, or the leaſt of theſe without him, will quite deſtroy vs.</p>
            <p>But now (to your comfortes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) let vs ſee who got the victorie, whether Chriſt or Death, or which of them was ſpoyled: that ſo we may learne to confirme our fayth in the middeſt of our conflictes? You haue heard already what death is in it owne nature, &amp; now heare what it is through Chriſt. Our eſtate without him we know: we are euen holden in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, being fettered in our finnes. The weight of our finnes is the Law of God layde vpon vs. Hel is our priſon, &amp; death is our Iaylor to hold vs.
<pb facs="tcp:21260:24"/>
See how we are locked from God: yet moſt iuſtly (as I noted.) In this diſtreſſe and deepe dungion, Ieſus Chriſt came to viſite vs, euen God and Man a right redeemer for vs: he takes our cauſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, and he reaſons and wraſtles with the Deuill, that helde vs captiues. This mightie Sauiour tooke fleſh and blood, to take our part, that he might deſtroy through death, him that had power of death, that is to ſay, the Deuil, and that he myght delyuer all them which for feare of death, were all their lyfe time ſubiect to bondage. He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our ſinnes, the Iuſt for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, that he might bring vs to God, and was put to death concerning the fleſh, but qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kened in the ſpirite, that he might be our ranſome.</p>
            <p>Marke therefore diligently (I beſeech you) this his combat and conflict. For, he had to deale with the Deuill, who helde vs captiues. The Deuill for his defence had the Law, euen the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:21260:24"/>
law of God: which man had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, and therefore now worthely ſubiect to his power. The obiections therefore that he made againſt man to Chriſt, are theſe. <hi>Whoſoeuer breaketh the Law of God, ſhall die the death: but man hath broken the Law of God, therefore he ſhall die the death: and by the vertue of the Law</hi> (ſayth the Deuill) <hi>I will holde him in death.</hi> Againe, the Law of God is according to his nature good, holy, and righteous. And therfore the death of man pronounced by the Lawe, is iuſt, and his damnation righteous. God the Law giuer, is infinite and eternall: therefore his death muſt be endles and euerlaſting. God is iuſt, and can not denie himſelfe. He ſayd, that man (yf he ſhould breake his lawe) ſhould die the death: and therefore death ſhal hold him. God is perfect &amp; pure: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſatiſfaction muſt be according to his nature. His law bindes both ſoule and body, euen thought, worde, and
<pb facs="tcp:21260:25"/>
deede: and therefore let man performe this, and he ſhall liue. Theſe, and many more are the dartes of the Deuil, which he throweth agaynſt our foules to wound vs to death: the leaſt of which, aſſuredly will pearſe vs thorow, were it not that the ſtrength of Ieſus Chriſt rebounded them backe, and bluntens them. He is our ſheilde &amp; our buckler, our helmet of ſaluation, our caſtle, and houſe of defence: he couereth vs with his winges, and we are ſafe vnder his feathers: his faithfulneſſe and his trueth doth ſtill preſerue vs. For all theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous dartes, and a thouſande more, are nothing to his power, their force is leſſe, and their violence is weaker then ſtraw or ſtubble to the furnace.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, marke now theſe darts are dasſhed. Gods iuſtice in deede was gon out, it could not be reuoked. Man muſt keepe his law, or man muſt die an eternall death. Hereupon it pleaſed Chriſt to become man for our
<pb facs="tcp:21260:25"/>
ſakes, and ſo as man, to ſatiſfie the Law of God for our ſinnes, that Gods trueth might not be altered. No Angell or Saint could be our ſauiour in this caſe, but man who had offended God. Now man of him ſelfe being too weake to beare this heauie burthen, Chriſt was God and man, that ſo he might ſuffer as man, and ſaue as God. Our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour was God and man. Man and God were foes: and therefore, being God and man, he reconciled man to God. And as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by tranſgreſſing, brought death vpon all: ſo the ſeconde <hi>Adam</hi> through obeying, brought life to all beleeuers. Gods pureſt iuſtice could not exact the thing which he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled not: it required the fulfilling of the Law. This he accompliſhed, being the ende of the Law and the Prophets. He was the very ſubſtaunce of all the Ceremonies, and the body of all their ſhadowes of the Law. He was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, he payd tribute, he was obedient
<pb facs="tcp:21260:26"/>
in all thinges, and was vnder the Law: ſo that his comming was not to breake, but to fulfill the Law. It required per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſſe in man: he therefore was a man without ſinne, conceaued by the holy ghoſt. And therefore he is not afrayde to ſay to the faces of his foes, <hi>Which of you can rebuke mee of ſinne?</hi> Yea, the Iudge him ſelfe that condemned him, waſhed his handes, as a witneſſe of his cleanneſſe, <hi>I finde no fault in this iuſt man.</hi> True therefore is the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>That he was made ſinne for vs, that knew not ſinne, that we ſhould be made the righteouſneſſe of God through him.</hi> He is truely called the <hi>Paſcall Lambe,</hi> moſt pure and vnſpotted, that taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde. To him al the Prophetes beare witneſſe, that iuſtly through his name is preached the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, and that there is no other name vnder heauen by which we can be ſaued. Thus he fulfilled the law for man, being man him ſelfe: his obedience
<pb facs="tcp:21260:26"/>
was moſt perfect, he left nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfulfilled. And as he kept the Law, which man had broken, ſo likewiſe he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21260:28"/>
in light. To conclude, By his death and paſſion, he deſtroyed ſinne, and ſo was death in the ſame victory maymed. For ſinne is the ſting of death. And when death had loſt his ſting, &amp; was conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Chriſts reſurrection from death; Satan alſo loſt his ſtrength and power, which reſted onely on them which through ſinne were in danger of death: For the wages of ſinne is death. Finally, becauſe hell only deuoureth them that through ſinne and death are ſlaues to Satan: It foloweth that the other three, were by him ſo mightely vanquiſhed, that hell alſo with all the danger thereof was ſubdued, and we deliuered from al their tirrany, according to the ſaying of <hi>Zacharie, He hath performed the oth which he ſware, to deliuer vs from our enemies, that we might ſerue him without feare.</hi> Now then, all we which beleeue, are freed from the ſlauerie of ſinne, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the deuill, gulfe of hell, and chaynes of death. So that hencefoorth
<pb facs="tcp:21260:29"/>
death is no death to Gods chyldren through Chriſt, but great aduantage: and appoynted for a paſſage to a better lyfe. And therefore though wicked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates tremble at the name of death, (to whom they are in thraldome) yet Gods chyldren (being conquerours through Chriſt) may well triumph: for now through him, we haue an entrance made to heauen, and death is the very doore to life, a paſſage out of this world to the Father, from the priſon of this body to goe to Chriſt. It is a returning to our heauenly countrey: from which we were exiled. And this is the cauſe why the godly ſigh and ſorrow, to be looſed, and to be with Chriſt, being ſubiect to ſinne. And heere let vs note, that whereas death is a diſſolution of the ſoule from the body: that therefore the body is nothing els but a priſon, in which our ſoules are bound. And he that deſireth to liue, is like a madde Priſoner, that is delighted in his giues,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:29"/>
that may be free from his fetters, and cares not: that may go out of the Iayle and will not. Wherefore we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of Death, not as it ſeemes in it ſelfe, but as it is Chriſt, naturally we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to be, and conſequently we ſhunne Death, which depriues vs of our being. Death is horrible to the beſt, for a while, becauſe it is repugnant to their nature: but on the other ſide, we ſee how we are held as in a priſon, ſo long as this body of ſinne compaſſeth vs about. Therefore wee ought to long for the euerlaſting life which is promiſed vs after death (for when wee drawe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards death, then come we nigh vnto it, and Death is the very gate of life) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring our ſelues, that for aſmuch as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath paſſed the ſame way, we neede not be afraide that Death ſhall ouercome vs, for it is through him, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed and blunted ſword, whoſe point is broken, whoſe edge is taken off, ſo that it cannot hurt vs: and although it
<pb facs="tcp:21260:30"/>
drawe ſome bloud of vs: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſame ſhall be but to purge vs, and rid vs of all our diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Since therefore wee haue learned what Death is in it ſelfe, and what in Chriſt, and knowe the worſte: ſince Death is aduantage to the faithfull, and the very high waye to heauen: let vs learne how to prepare our ſelues there to, which is the laſt thing which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to performe.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore in this our preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let vs arme our ſelues againſt theſe temptations, with which both diuell, world, and fleſh, will mightily aſſaile vs. What man (ſaith the deuill) wilt thou dye? why then, beholde the company of thy ſinnes, the wrath of God, the graue, and hell are ready to deuoure thee: the Law is thy Iudge which doth condemne thee. To theſe temptations of the deuill we muſt oppoſe Chriſtes righteouſneſſe, ſatiſfactions, and merits, in which God holdeth himſelfe fullye
<pb facs="tcp:21260:30"/>
appeaſed. The world it ſetteth abroche his baites. What, wilt thou dy (O man) why ſee thy goodly buildings, thy bags of golde, thy landes and liuings, thy rents and reuenues, thy paſtime and thy pleaſures, thy Iewels, and thy treaſures, thy delights, and all that thy heart deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. In deed, O worlde, this felicitie is good: but yet no otherwiſe then it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the fauour of God, it is to be kept; but yet ſo farre foorth, as by the keeping of it we looſe not God: and yet we ſee the vanitie of thy pleaſures, the frailtie of thy glory, and the fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy goods, are therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reſpect of the ioyes of heauen, and happy lyfe, which after death I am ſure to haue. Wherefore I deſire to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt: in whom, are hidden all the treaſures of God, who is the keeper of our life. For, this our life which now we lead, is no life in deed (but a death) for wee are dead, and our lyfe is hid with God in
<pb facs="tcp:21260:31"/>
Chriſt, we walke by faith, and not by ſight: yea, ſo long as we are at home in this our body, we wander and go aſtray from God our Lorde.</p>
            <p>And O thou worlde (which allureſt me ſo to loue this life) What is thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? If I ſhould ſerue thee, I am ſure to be a foe to Chriſt, who loues thee not, who prayeth not for thee, whoſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of thee: and therefore to loue thee, is to hate my God: which to doe, is worſe then death. Thy rewarde I knowe is nothing but nakedneſſe: for naked I came vnto thee, and naked I ſhall goe from thee. And therefore I am willing to forſake thee, and deſire to be loſed, and to be with Chriſt; who will couer my nakedneſſe with the robes of his righteouſneſſe: laſtlye comes the fleſh with trembling and quaking.</p>
            <p>And wilt thou die (O man?) why, ſee thy friends and thy family, thy wife and thy children, thy father, and thy mother
<pb facs="tcp:21260:31"/>
weepe and wayle, crye and call vnto thee, and wilte thou depart thus? wilte thou needs go from them? But O thou fleſh, fight not thus againſt my ſoule; it is good in deede to tarry ſtill amongſt our friends, yet ſo that wee abide not there in Gods diſpleaſure, and hereafter to dwell in hell with the diuels, in fyre euerlaſting. There is nothing vnder God, but it may be kept, ſo that God (being aboue all thinges which wee haue) be not loſt. He that loues, father or mother, wife or children, &amp;c. better then Chriſt, is not worthy of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And therefore though they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the loſſe of my life, yet can they not redeeme it: for what man is he that liueth, and ſhall not ſee death. And ſhall hedeliuer his ſoule from hell; No, no, neither riches, nor ſtrength, neither power, nor pollicie, can preuaile in this point: for whether we ſleepe, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we wake, we drawe towards death. God hath ſet vs our bounds, which we
<pb facs="tcp:21260:32"/>
cannot paſſe: and as the greene leaues in a thicke tree, ſome fall, and ſome growe: ſo is the generation of fleſhe and bloud, one commeth to his ende, and another is borne: wee came not altogether, neither muſt wee returne altogether.</p>
            <p>Therefore (O fleſh) be content. O my friends be quiet, for needes vvee muſt departe: yet to meete againe vvee are ſure. And in going from you (my fleſhly friends) I goe to the Saintes of heauen, to the mounte <hi>Sion,</hi> and to the cittie of the liuing God, the celeſtiall Ieruſalem, to the companie of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Angels, to the aſſemblye and congregation of the firſt borne, and to God the Iudge of all, and to the ſpirites of iuſt and perfect men: I know that ſo long as I am in this fleſh, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God: and therefore I deſire to be loſed, and to be with Chriſt. We haue heere no continuing cittie, wee looke for one of God. And I know, if
<pb facs="tcp:21260:32"/>
this my earthly houſe of this taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, be once deſtroyed: I ſhall haue a building giuen me of God, a houſe not made with handes, but eternall with God in heauen. Marke, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes be earthly houſes: <hi>Dust thou art, and into dust thou ſhalt returne againe.</hi> They are as Innes, wherein wee ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne for a ſeaſon: they are as taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles ſet vp for a time, and quicklye to be remooued: (being without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation) our bodies are like an olde rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous cottage, ſtill in danger to fall. <hi>Dauid</hi> counted himſelfe a ſtranger vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and a ſoiournour, as all his fathers were.</p>
            <p>Hereof <hi>Abraham</hi> obeyed God, to go whither hee would: hee abode in the lande of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric, as one that dwelte in Tents. For hee looked for a cittie hauing a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whoſe builder and maker is God. <hi>Iob</hi> called this our body a houſe of claye: therefore the godly grone in
<pb facs="tcp:21260:33"/>
this tabernacle (being loded with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) that this mortalitie may bee ſwallowed vp of lyfe: fleſh, and bloud cannot enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Gods children therefore are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (not becauſe they beare about their bodies, (for it is a greefe to them to lay them downe) no, they ſigh for this, to be clenſed from their ſinnes. <hi>Wretched man that I am</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from this bodye of ſinne.</hi> And therefore we ought not to long for this preſent lyfe, which indeed is but an Image of Death: but rather loathe it, that wee may bee vnloden of our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>This preparation to dye, perteyneth vnto all: for neither riche, nor poore: olde, nor yonge: Prince, nor people: Death lets eſcape. It reſpecteth no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no ſexe, no age, no condition, no eſtate whatſoeuer, no power, no riches, no learning, no pollicie, can reſiſt it. There is no remedie for this ſickneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:33"/>
no phiſicke to be found againſt it. It is the way of all the worlde: it is an Axe that heweth downe, not onely the low ſhrubs and Oſiers, but alſo the great Elmes and Okes: yea, all the high and tall trees of <hi>Lebanon.</hi> The dayes of man are but as Graſſe, and as a flower of the fielde: in the morning it is greene, and flouriſheth: but in the euening it is cut downe, dryed vp, and withered. Wee bring our yeares to an end, as a tale that is tolde. Our life is like a ſtage, on which men play theyr partes, and paſſe away.</p>
            <p>Man is like a thing of naught, his dayes are lyke a ſhadowe. God biddeth <hi>Eſay</hi> to crye, that all fleſh is graſſe, and all the grace and goodlineſſe thereof, is but as a flower of the field. O that the Lorde would open the eyes of all, to ſee themſelues in this bright Glaſſe. What? are we all but graſſe? and ſhall we wither as Haye? alas wee cannot ſo perſwade our ſelues: for if we could,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:34"/>
it would plucke downe our pride, and ſet our loftie lookes aſide. It woulde then ſhorten ſoone our ruffes ſo long, and make our monſtrous attire more modeſt. It would mittigate our mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and make vs humble mynded: we would then throwe downe our ſelues with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſay to God, <hi>We are but duſt, and aſhes:</hi> this is a common caſe, that all fleſh is duſt. Now for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extreame ſorrowe, (vvhich at the houre of death will mightily aſſayle vs) Let vs againſt that time bee euen with the vvorlde, at agreement with our brethren, &amp; eſpecially with our owne conſcience, which then moſt ſtraightly will accuſe vs. The conſience is lyke a Chryſtall Glaſſe, wherein (if vve vvill) vvee may lyuely viewe our ſelues. It vvill ſhewe euery thing that is amiſſe in ſoule and body.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore take our ſpundg in hand, to clenſe our ſpots: to wit, true faith in Chriſt, and good fruites that
<pb facs="tcp:21260:34"/>
followe it, that ſo being at one vvith the vvorlde, in charitie with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and cleane in our conſcience through Chriſt: vve may be ready to goe the waye of all the vvorlde. And that this our iourney may bee more eaſie, and this rough waye (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the fleſh) more plaine: let vs arme our ſelues with theſe contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vvhich ſhall followe; let vs ſaye vnto our ſoule: Why art thou ſo ſad, and why art thou ſo diſquieted within mee. Put thy truſt in God, which is the helpe of my countenance, and my God.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould a Chriſtian man ſo feare the force of Death, whoſe ſting is quite deſtroyed? Can Death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue him of Chriſte, which is all his comforte, ioye, and lyfe? No, but Death ſhall delyuer him from this mortall bodye full of ſinne and wickedneſſe, which beateth downe the ſpirite. Faine would this fleſhe make
<pb facs="tcp:21260:35"/>
ſtrange of that which the ſpirite doth imbrace.</p>
            <p>O (ſaith a godly martyr) how lothe is this loytering ſluggard to paſſe forth, and goe forwarde in Gods pathe to heauen. So that were it not through the force of faith, plucking it forward: and the bridle of Gods moſt ſweete promiſes, and of hope pricking on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, great aduenture there were of fainting by the way. Who would bee ſorry to forſake this lyfe, which cannot but bee moſt certaine of eternall lyſe? Who loueth the ſhadowe better then the body? Who can loue this lyfe, but they that regarde not the life to come? Who can deſire the droſſe of this worlde, but ſuch as be ignorant of the treaſures of euerlaſting ioy in heauen? I meane, who is afraide to die, but ſuch as hope not to liue eternally.</p>
            <p>A greater token (next faith in Chriſt) there is not of our election, then not to ſtand in feare of Death, which lyke a
<pb facs="tcp:21260:35"/>
Tayler putteth off our ragges, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayeth vs with the royall robes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallitie, incorruption, and glorye. Shall the brute beaſtes, and ſenceleſſe creatures (being ſubiect to vanitie) grone in their kinde for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſonnes of God (at what time they ſhall be freed from their ſlauerie, and ſhall wee, which are indued with reaſon (yea and aboue reaſon inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened) with Gods holy ſpirite (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when it ſtandeth vpon a ioyfull being, and euerlaſting dwelling with God in heauen) ſhall wee not, I ſay, lift vp our mindes beyond this rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of earth.</p>
            <p>And therefore, that theſe thinges may pearce the deeper: let vs brieflye conſider (for a concluſion of all) what this lyfe is that we ſo loue: what death is that we ſo feare: and vvhat is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs after death, vvhich vvee ſo little regarde. Which three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations (for the moſt part) I haue rather
<pb facs="tcp:21260:36"/>
partly collected out of others, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of mine owne: for that they are ſo ready at hand, and fit for my purpoſe: yea and ſo exquiſite in themſelues, as that my paines ſhould be but ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to trouble my ſelfe with ſtudying any further for this concluſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, concerning this life, you know it is full of miſery, vanitie, vexation and vvoe. It is a plaine exile from God: for if heauen be our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, vvhat is this earth, but a place of baniſhment?</p>
            <p>If the departing out of this vvorld, bee an entring into lyfe: vvhat is this worlde, but a graue wherein wee are buried? vvhat is it elſe but to bee drowned in Death? If to bee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of this body, is to be ſet at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect libertie: what is this body elſe, but a priſon, a Iayle, and a dungeon? If to enioy the ſweete preſence of God, be the higheſt felicitie: why then, to bee kepte from it, is it not the extreameſt
<pb facs="tcp:21260:36"/>
miſerie? And certainlye till wee bee eſcaped out of this lyfe, vve vvander abrode from the Lorde.</p>
            <p>If vvee conſider, that this vnſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, faultie, corruptible, frayle, wythe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and rotten Tabernacle of ourbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, is therefore diſſoluted by Death, that it afterwardes maye bee reſtored againe, into a ſtedfaſt, perfect, vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and heauenly glorye: ſhall not faith compell vs feruentlye to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that vvhich nature feareth? If we conſider that by Death vvee are called out of baniſhment, to inhabite our Countrey: yea, our heauenly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: ſhall vve obteyne no comforte thereby?</p>
            <p>Alas, this our vvretched lyfe, is a vapoure, a ſmoake, a ſhadowe, a warre-fare, a Wilderneſſe, a vayle of vvretchedneſſe: wherewith wee are compaſſed about on euerye ſide, vvith moſte fyerce and fearefull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21260:37"/>
And ſhould vve deſire to dwell heere? ſhould vvee luſt to lyue in this lothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and laborious lyfe? ſhould vvee vviſhe to tarry in this vvretchedneſſe? ſhould vve haue pleaſure to remaine in this perilous eſtate? <hi>Daniels Den</hi> is not ſo dreadfull, as is this dungeon vvee dwell in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning death (as you haue partly heard) vvhat is it now elſe, then a Waſpe vvithout a ſting, a ſword without an edge, a dagger vvithout a pointe? What is it elſe now to all Gods children, then the diſpatcher of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures: the ende of all our trauels, the doore of heauen, the gate of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the porte of Paradiſe, the hauen of health, the rayle of reſt, the entrance of felicitie, the ende of all miſeryes, and the beginning of all bleſſedneſſe. It is the very bed of Downe (faieth a godly Father) and therfore vvell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a ſleepe for the dolefull bodies of Gods people to reſt in: out of the
<pb facs="tcp:21260:37"/>
which they ſhall ariſe and awake moſt freſh and luſtie, to lyfe euerlaſting. It is a paſſage to the father, a chariot to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Lordes meſſenger, a leader vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, a going to our home, a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from bondage and priſon, a demiſſion from warre, a ſecuritie from all ſorrowes, and a manumiſſion from all miſeries: So that the very Heathen in ſome places, did cauſe the day of their death to be celebrated with mirth, melodie, and minſtrelſie. And ſhall we, which are Chriſtians, be diſmaide at it: ſhould we be afrayde of it? Shoulde ſuch a friende as it is be vnwelcomed? ſhould the fouleneſſe of his face feare vs from his good conditions? ſhould the hardneſſe of his huske hinder vs from his ſweete curnell? ſhould the roughneſſe of the tyde, tye vs to the banke and ſhore? there to bee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, rather then the deſire of our home driue vs to goe aboard? ſhoulde the
<pb facs="tcp:21260:38"/>
hardneſſe of the ſaddle, ſet vs on our feete to perriſhe by the waye, rather then to leape vp, and endure the ſame a little, and ſo bee where wee woulde bee.</p>
            <p>Laſtlye, touching the lyfe prepared for vs after death: if I ſhould go about to expreſſe it, the more I ſhould ſo doe, the further I ſhould be from it. For the eye hath neuer ſeene, nor the eare heard, nor the heart of man can euer conceiue, the ioye, mirthe, melodye, pleaſure, power, wealth, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, beautie, fellowſhip, dainties, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, glorye, wiſdome, knowledge, treaſures, ſecuritie, peace, quietneſſe, and eternall felicitie, which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhall haue, and enioye, worlde without ende: with God the Father, the Sonne, and the holye Ghoſt, with Angels and Arche-angels, Patriarches, and Prophets, with Apoſtels and Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, the martyrs, and confeſſors, and
<pb facs="tcp:21260:38"/>
with all the Saintes of God in the Pallace of the Lorde, in heauen the kingdome of God, the glorye of the Father.</p>
            <p>O woe to the blyndneſſe of our eyes, that wee ſee not this: woe to the hardneſſe of our hearts, that feele not this: woe to the deafeneſſe of our eares, that heare not this in ſuch wiſe as wee ſhould doe: where through wee might bee ſo farre from fearing Death, that rather wee ſhould wiſhe it, crying with <hi>Simeon: Nowe let thy ſeruante departe in peace.</hi> And with <hi>Dauid: When ſhall I come and appeare before thee? Woe is me, that my babitation is thus prolonged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas, great is our vnbeliefe, full fainte and weake is our fayth: or elſe nighte and daye, teares and cryings ſhoulde bee our Breade and Drinke, whileſt it is ſayde vnto vs: Where is your God? We ſhould rather wiſh
<pb facs="tcp:21260:39"/>
to bee doore keepers in the houſe of the Lord, then to dwell in theſe vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye tents: for one daye in his courte, is better then a thouſand.</p>
            <p>It is a token of little loue to God, to be ſo lothe to goe vnto him when hee calleth. Heerein wee ought to lament the weakeneſſe of our faith: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our neede, to prepare for remedye againſt the time of neede, and to begge of God his ayde, ſtrength, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotre, againſt the pinche: which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, (If wee aske with faith) we ſhall obteyne, and fynde his promiſe true.</p>
            <p>Thus to knitte vp all, (leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to tyre you) my promiſe (I truſt) in ſome ſorte is performed, touching this ſhorte diſcourſe: wherein I haue rather tyed my ſelfe to the matter, then my methode. I alwayes preferre the ſubſtance before the ſhadowe: and thus I commende you to the Lorde,
<pb facs="tcp:21260:39"/>
beſeeching him for Chriſtes ſake, to keep vs, ſoules and bodies to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glorye: and to leade vs, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs, and diſpoſe vs, as he will in all thinges, in all places, and for euer: that at the length we may come whither we would: that is, into his owne bleſſed preſence and fruition of immortallitye, with Chriſt and his Saints, worlde without ende.</p>
