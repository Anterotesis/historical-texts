         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST had fed many with a few <hi>Loves,</hi> he commanded his Diſciples to gather up the <hi>Fragments,</hi> that nothing he loſt, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 12. And when God was pleaſed to poure out of his Spirit upon ſome of his faithful <hi>Servants</hi> in our Generation, he had alſo ſome of his <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides,</hi> who gathered up the <hi>Crumes</hi> of that ſpiritual Bread, which the Lord bleſſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed among his Diſciples: Of which Number this holy <hi>Marron</hi> was one. Now there are three Arguments where by it may appear, that God would not have theſe <hi>Fragments</hi> (which she hath gathered into her Basket) to be loſt, viz. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe, God made them (by his Bl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

holy One, and is taught of God. In the Reading of her Book, thou wilt meet with ſome ſuddain and unexſpected Tranſition from one thing to another, (and thou mayeſt think it to be ſome what abruptly) yet Cenſure not too rashly, but rather conſider, that even this alſo may, yea doth hold ſome proportion unto the courſe of Heaven and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communications. The Husbandman will not wonder to ſee showers and shinings, bright and dark Clouds ſucceed each other, knowing that the Rain which comes from Heaven hath its ſeaſons and its meaſure too. Will the Marriner marvel to ſee the ſeas ſwell and rage in a great ſtorme, or admire the ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſs and ſmoothneſs of the deep watters in a great calme. Or will any who liv supon the ſea coaſt think the frequent Ebbing &amp; flowing of the tyde a ſtrange thing. Neither will any experienced Chriſtian marvel at the ſuddain Ebbing and flowing of joyes, and ſorrowes in the hearts of Saints. The operations and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Spirit are various, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 4, 5, 6, 7. Some times the Spirit is poured out upon the ſoules of Believers <hi>(as floods upon the dry ground)</hi> And thoſe ſpiritual showers and shinings do make a ſpring of Grace in the wilderneſs of their hearts. Where of the Lord hath ſpoaken by his Prophets. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51: 3. and 44: 3, 4. and 32: 15, 16, 17. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: v. 12. But at other time the glory of the Saints comforts, joyes, and light is ſo cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eclipſed, that they are under great deſertions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54: verſ. 7, 8, 11. Yea and may for ſome time walk in dakneſs and have no light, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50: 10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing I judge worthy the Readers obſervation in this Book, is this Chriſtian womans Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the preſence and power of God, accompanying her conſciencious endeavours to do good unto the ſouls of others both in her own family eſpecially, and alſo in ſome other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, where she ſo journed ſome time. I mention not this for her praiſe, who deſires that God alone may have all the Glory of whatſoever he hath done for her or by her; <hi>(she needs no Epist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es of Commendation from men)</hi> But ſeeing her Experiences are made ſo publicke, my hearts deſire is, that Parents and Governours of families would follow her Example therein: Endeavouring (as she did) the Converſion and ſanctification of them, whom God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, by Inſtructions, councel, and reprooſe, which she adminiſtred, with ſo much love, wiſdome, zeal, and tenter heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dneſs, that they proved by Gods bleſſing an effectual means of the converſion of many, ſome of whom are yet living witneſſes of the truth hereof, and alſo of many other her Experiences related in this her Book. She was not onely a Governeſſe, but (as it were) a Propheteſs in her family, for she prayed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with her children and Maidens, she alſo read the holy Scriptures daily unto them, and ſo ſpake from them, that many of them, who heard her <hi>(in her family duties)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and turned to the Lord. She opened her mouth with wiſdome, and in her tongue was the Law of kindneſs, a Solomon ſpake of the virtuous woman, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31: 26, 27, 28, 29. She did ſo Chatechiſe the young children, and inſtruct the elder maidens, that they all learned to know, and many of them to do their duty to God and man. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is yet one thing more, which I would have thee, <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi> to ponder in thy heart, <hi>to vvit,</hi> the gift of ſinging ſpiritual Songs and Hymnes, whih she pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad a prayer out of it, or to ſay a prayer without the Book, is not to pray in the Spirit, ſo to read a Pſalme in a Book, and ſing it, or to ſing the ſame Pſalme without the Book is

not to ſing in the Spirit: If the ſinging of Pſalmes be a part of Gods worship (as doubtleſs it is) then it ought to be performed by aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, for the true worshippers ought to worship God in ſpirit and truth, John. 4: 23, 24. 2.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had once hard thoughts of the people of God, yet being on a time perſwaded to go to hear them, I went though not out of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to them, but to vvatch vvhat I could obſerve; and being then over perſwaded againſt them, and the Miniſters Text (that then preacht) was Rom. 2: 4, 5, 6. or <hi>Diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance, and long ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee unto repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; but after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart treaſurest up to thy ſelf wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily at this opportunity the dread of God did much ſmite upon my heart, that I had ſo long ſinnend againſt his patience and goodneſz. He had this paſſage, that the ſword of the Lord hung as in a twine threed, to cut of all pitty ſwearers; and I having been one that durſt not ſwear great oathes, (but ſmall ones I was addicted to) I thought it met with my particular condition: Then had I little acquaintance with any that feared the Lord; unleſs it were one family, and they were much afraid of me for a ſeaſon, becauſe I had been ſo vain.</p>
            <p>Then was I caſt upon the Lord alone, who did much ſupport mee by his grace, bleſſed be his name; yet the very firſt night after he began to work upon my heart, I fell under this temptation, that I should not eat any more, but rather die, and then I should ceaſe from ſinning againſt the Lords goodneſs; I then caſt away my prayer-book, for it did not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37438:4"/>
reach my neceſſities, and I cried unto the Lord alone to teach mee to pray; Then did I endeavour to keep cloſe to the beſt teaching mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery I could find; I was very ignorant, yet did ſearch the Scriptures dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently: but found them very dark to mee, I dayly ſaw a more clear diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of my ſinful nature, and then began to be ſorely perplexed with feavs that I could not be a child of God, becauſe I knew not how to get victory over my ſin, and though I uſed all meanes I could, yet my corruptions would ſometimes break forth, which made mee often times ready to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and to caſt of all.</p>
            <p>But one day amongſt the reſt the Lord made mee reſolve, though he kild mee, yet I would truſt in him; he made mee alſo deſire of him that if he would not ſave mee, yet that he would not let mee go back again into ſin (for the ſence of Gods goodneſs was much upon my heart.)</p>
            <p>Then in ſeveral Sermons God was pleaſed to ſpeak peace to my poor ſoul, yet after through the violence of temptations, I often queſtioned my condition; ſometimes I was tempted to murder my ſelf, ſometimes to ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve my ſelf; yet the Lord upheld mee, for I could not make my caſe known to any but God for the ſpace of two years, all which ſeaſon I was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully kept by the power of God alone. In this time was I called by my friends into a darck corner of the land full of ignorance, yet I was ſorely troubled, eſpecially when I was overtaken with any ſin, ſtill I fell down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Lord bewailing my ſins; then did the Lord give mee much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from this place of Scripture. Jer. 31: 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon is he a pleaſant child, for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him.</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now in the place where I was were many Papiſts, and they much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to have mee of their judgment: But God kept mee in a thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame of ſpirit after the preaching of the word, and often caſt in my mind, that I should, Matt. 6: 33. <hi>First ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, and all other things should be added.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee had in that place a bad Miniſter, but to God I made my ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and uſed what means I could to obtain a better, and God was pleaſed to anſwer my deſires, and ſent a better to that very place, who remained there the time that I ſtayed,. under whoſe honneſt teachings I often met with ſweet refreshing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37438:4"/>
Then was ſtirred up by my friends to change my condition, to be married to an husband; upon which I did earneſtly begg of God that I might have one that did fear the Lord, that he might be a furtherance to heaven, and indeed ſo hee was. For I married with a man that was much in practical diuties, yet ſome difference there was in our judgments, which often cauſed no ſmall trouble in my ſpirit: but it had this effect, it cauſed mee to cry to God, and to ſearch the Scriptures, ſo much the more, uſing all means for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight underſtanding in the things and wayes of God, and it became helpful to mee. And in this time of my earneſt ſeeking of God alone, he was pleaſed to diſcover to mee by dreames and viſions of the night, the ugglineſs of ſin in a far greater manner then ever I ſaw it before: and in dreams brought many Scriptures to mind that did anſwer ſome queſtions, and ſatisfy ſome doubts, that were in my heart: and ſo did cauſe darkneſs to become light before mee at that time: and this did the Lord do in the abſence of other meanes, ſoon after I gained information where the word was powerfully preached: but it being ſomething far from mee, I had ſome difficulty to get to it; yet it being (through grace) more to mee then my ordinary food: I keept cloſe to opportunities of the word there preached; which in an eſpecial manner God was pleaſed to make very uſeful unto mee. And I injoying often many ſweet taſts of the preſence of God in his ordinances, was carried out through all weathers to wait upon him; and this I can truely ſay from real experience that the worſt wheather I went through the more of God, I met within his ordinances, I remember one very wet day, I had much comfort from theſe words; (let this incourage others,) Joh. 1: 2, 3. <hi>Now are wee the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall bee:</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards while my meditations were ſomething upon Hebrews 6: 5, 6. <hi>I was much ſtirred up to mind, how far an Hypocrite might go in Religion:</hi> And I began to conſider, whether or no I had gone any further then ſuch a one might go, for I ſaw plainly that a perſon might go very far, and yet be in a ſad ſtate, though they may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nlightened and taſt of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giſt, and be partakers of the holy Spirit, yea and taſt of the good word, and alſo hear the beſt Preachers gladly, as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and as <hi>Agrippa</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet be but almoſt a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Then I being at a Sermon, the words of the Text were: Marc. 6: vers 20. <hi>And he did many things:</hi> That Miniſter then shewed, that an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite or a reprobate might do many things: but yet a true child of God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37438:5"/>
can do more; he named two things in which a child of God goeth beyond an Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that he doth as much deſire to be holy as happy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he doth as earneſtly fet himſelf againſt all ſin as ſome.</p>
            <p>Then was I exceedingly taken up in my thoughts about this thing; but being carried out to ſeek the Lord earneſtly, he was pleaſed to give in this anſwer; Thou tumbleſt ſo much at the ſtone of aſſurance that thou forgeteſt to build, then did God let me ſee that the foundation and top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is Jeſus Chriſt, and that I muſt ceaſe from my own workes, and take Chriſt upon his own termes, and then entred I into ſome reſt.</p>
            <p>Oh, what a knotty piece was I to work upon! for until he put forth his mighty power I could not believe; and I found nothing ſtronger then free grace to ſtricke at the root of my ſin.</p>
            <p>Alſo on another ſnowy day I going many miles to hear, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed much from theſe words, 2 Cor. 12: 9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on another day from theſe words: Luke 10: 20. <hi>But rather rejoyce, becauſe your names are written in heaven.</hi> And another time aboundance of comfort from that Scripture: 1 Cor. 2: 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath it entred into the heart of man, to conceive the things which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him.</hi> It was a very ſore day when I went to this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and a very bitter Journey I had, but God made it exceeding ſweet unto mee.</p>
            <p>Alſo I had a very great fit of a feaver, by reaſon of the trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I was under; and in the time of that great feaver, the Lord was pleaſed to ſet that Scripture upon my heart: Rev. 22: 17. <hi>The Spirit and the bride ſaid comm, and let him that heareth ſay, come; and let him that is a thirst come; and whoſoever will, let him come, and take of the watters of Life freely:</hi> Which did adminiſter ſo much comfort &amp; refreshing to mee from a ſence of the freeneſs of Gods grace, being ſet upon my heart, with ſo much power of the Spirit that I was (contrary to the Judgement of Phyſicians) ſoon raiſed to my health again. For indeed I had at that time been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly troubled in my ſpirit about my ſins, which I had been looking back upon; for I had made a Catalogue of them, and ſpread them before the Lord for pardon: But thinking them to be ſo many, that God would not pardon them; I did much deſire I might die, and go out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not live any Longer in it, to encreaſe mine iniquities. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37438:5"/>
although at this time a good Miniſter did endeavour to comfort mee, yet I put comfort from mee, and ſaid, it did not belong to mee till the God of all grace was pleaſed to give it in by the power of his Spirit, as beſore mentioned, and then after our good God had given mee a taſt of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his pardonning love and grace in Chriſt Jeſus: I was alſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to pitty others, and begge that God would let them alſo taſt of the ſame; and a particular perſon was ſet upon my heart to begge of God for, and in a short time the Lord was pleaſed to anſwer my deſire in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a work of grace in that ſoul.</p>
            <p>Then I was called by providence to remove into a dark family, where I had lived ſome time beofore; and I then finding much oppoſition againſt mee, was not willing to go thither again, but ſet my ſelf to pray, not that I might be willing to ſubmit to the will of God, but that I might not remove into that family, though had I then underſtood it, my call was clear enough, being earneſtly deſired there unto by my husband, and invited by the family, who now profeſſed they could not be without mee, though (when I was there before) they did not affect mee well, being lofty, and could not bear ſuch admonitions that ſometime letting fall among them, but upon the importunity of my husband and this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; I then at length ſet my ſelf to ſeek the Lord, that my heart might be made to ſubmit to his will, what ever it were; and that if I did go, I might ſome way or other be uſeful to him in that place. Now that which made mee ſo unwilling to go unto that family, was becauſe of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that I had met with before in the wayes of God, and then a want of the means, both of preaching the word and fellowship with the Saints.</p>
            <p>But upon my earneſt ſeeking, to know the mind of God, and to be brought to ſubmit unto it, my heart was ſoon made willing to go, which accordingly I did; and I had not been long there before, it pleaſed the Lord to worke upon one of the family (to my great comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing) who was one that I looked upon as unlike as any in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Lord was pleaſed by death to take away a child from mee, which was to my caſting down, and for ſome time I was under a cloud, and queſtioned whither I were a child of God? and whither my child were ſaved? In that time a good man laboured to comfort mee, telling mee before, the Lord gave mee a ſon, he gave mee his own ſon; Oh, ſaid I, that I could ſee that!
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37438:6"/>
why ſaid hee, if you will ſee that, take head of a curſting law, a ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring devil, and an accuſing conſcience; all which the Lord hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you from, and therefore now wait upon the Lord I am confident the Lord will appear in this thing.</p>
            <p>And the Lord was pleaſed after ſeeking of him, to ſet it upon my heart, that that child was well with him, and that he had ſuch another mercy for mee on earth, which he gave mee faith in, notwithſtanding great oppoſitions againſt at that preſent: yet after ſome half a years waiting upon the Lord I was aſſured of it.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>A fit of deſertion.</head>
               <p>After this the God of comfort was pleaſed to withdraw and leave mee in a deſerted condition, which I found to be very ſad, and I was very much perplexed in my ſpirit, but could not ſpeak of it unto any: But going to hear a Sermon, the Miniſter was upon that Text: <hi>Lord forſake mee not utterly</hi> (that is to ſay) <hi>not overlong leaſt the ſpirit should fail before thee:</hi> hee then shewed what deſertion was; and why God doth ſometime ſeem to leave his own people.</p>
               <p>Becauſe (ſaid he) throug ſome pride, they thougt they could walk alone, and ſo neglected their watch, then God hide his face, that they might ſee their own inſufficiency: and know that all their peace, ſtrength and comfort is in and from him: And this (through mercy) was a great help unto mee at that time.</p>
               <p>Further, while I was under that miniſtry, God was pleaſed to convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce mee of the falſneſs of their Worship, which in that place then was uſed, and having an opportunity to go with others to the communion (as they call it) I could not kneell as the reſt did, but ſat down as if I had kneeled; and as I there ſat, it came upon my heart to think thus (as if it had been ſpoken to mee) why diſſembleſt thou a worship before the Lord, hee that commands thee to kneel there, may as well command thee to kneel at an Altar, (although at that time there was nothing known of ſetting up of Altars) which thing I made known to that Miniſter, and did warn him that if Altars should be ſet up, that he would not (for filthy lucre ſake kneell at them himſelf, nor compel others ſo to do: But he told mee he could not believe any ſuch thing should be: but if it should bee ſo he promiſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37438:6"/>
mee he would not conform to them. But in a short time after he found il too true, for Altarts were reared up, and he poor man (contrary to his promiſe) did comform himſelf in that thing, and compelled others ſo to do: but the firſt time he did ſo, it pleaſed the Lord to ſmite him with a ſore languishing diſeaſe, that he went out no more.</p>
               <p>Soon after I was at the Chriſtenig of a child (as they call it) at which time God was pleaſed to convince mee of the evil and falſeneſs of that piece of Worship alſo.</p>
               <p>Then was there in the nation a publique faſt proclamed, and by mans invention there was a form of prayer made and appointed to bo read in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very aſſembly that faſt-day, &amp; this was a third conviction that I had about their formal outſide way of worship; I had then an opportunity to come into one of thoſe aſſemblies that faſt-day while that prayer was reading, at which preſent this thought came ſtrongly upon mee: Is this a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in ſpirit and truth which thy ſoul (when it is upon the wing with God) cannot joyn with all; for I could not joyn with the words then read in that formoſt prayer.</p>
               <p>Upon which I even melted in my ſpirit, and fell into shedding of tears, reſolving to ſeperate from, and come no more to joyn in ſuch a way of worship until I had very diligently ſearched into the true way of Gods worship, as it is written in his bleſſed word; and in order there unto I made uſe of all the beſt books I could get, that were then published to that purpoſe, and alſo called in the help of many Godly Miniſters of ſeveral judgment: but when all this was done I was ſtill unſatisfied in that behalf: And then did I cry unto the Lord to teach mee, and it was by the Lord ſet upon my heart, that I muſt not do any thing in the way of his worship but what I had ground for in his holy word; &amp; that Gods Servants were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to obſerve his pattern in all that they do to him, and that Scripture was much ſet upon my heart. Rev. 22. vers 18, 19. For I teſtify unto every man that heareth the words of the propheſy of this book, if any man shall adde unto theſe things, God shall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this book; and if any man shall take away from the words of the Book of this Propheſy, God shall take away his part out of the Book of life, and out of the holy Citty, and from the things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book: well ſtill I was put upon it to continue ſeeking the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof, and the promiſe that all other t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37438:7"/>
Then did I with ſome others ſeek the Lord by faſting and prayer, for councel what we should do, and wheter we should go to injoy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Lord, in the way of his pure worship, and the Lord was pleaſed in love to anſwer my deſirs in a wonderful manner, for being then intangled with a houſe of which my Husband had a leaſe for ſome years; and upon that account was unwilling to remove, not knowing how to diſpoſe of that houſe: But yet the Lord was pleaſed in a short time to make him willing that I should remove if I could get of that leaſe, and ſome goods I had; which the Lord ſoon holp mee in, by ſending one unexpectedly the very next day, after my Husband declared his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligneſs for my removal upon thoſe conditions, who took of the leaſe of the houſe of our hands with thoſe goods, and ſo I was made free; So forth with I removed to a place where I did injoy the heating of a good man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and had the ſweet benefit of ſome private meetings, which was much refreshing unto mee: but yet two things I was very earneſt with God for.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One that I might be filled with the clear witneſs, and full aſſurance of the eternal Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Oh!

went to offer ſacrifice he was to drive away the fowles, Gen. 15. this work the Lord directed mee to do by laying hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, who had prayed for mee, though I could not now pray for my ſelf. Jo. 15: v. 17, 19. And ſo ſoon as my heart was brought to believe this, I was preſently delivered, and in all this temptation the Lord hid not his face from mee, bleſſed be his name.</p>
               <p>And then as the Lord carried mee over the Sea, where I did injoy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fuller communion with himſelf in his ordinances, he gave mee another occaſion for the exerciſe of ſaith and Patience.</p>
               <p>For whilſt I was upon that voyage, the veſſel that I was in was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with enemies, and troubled with contrary winds, ſo that we were in great ſtraits.</p>
               <p>But God gave me to believe that he that delivered <hi>Paul</hi> out of his ſtraits, would alſo deliver us out of ours, and ſo it was, bleſſed be his name; and ſo very ſafely was I carried unto that place that the Lord called mee unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>But preſently after I was there arrived the Lord was pleaſed to exerciſe mee with ſeveral afflictions.</p>
               <p>Firſt by taking away a child by death, and then by laying upon my ſelf ſuch a diſtemper that my joynts and ſinnews were by fits bound up, that I could not ſtirre them, nor take any reſt while it laſted, my pain was ſo great, no Doctor could do mee any good (though ſeveral phyſitians conſulted what to do for mee) But concluded, there was no help but I muſt dye.</p>
               <p>But when I heard that, I ſaid, there is yet help in God, and it was ſet upon me to believe, that if I could but touch the hemm of the garment of Jeſus Chriſt, that is believingly go to him, I should be healed, being alſo put in minde of that promiſe, that whoſoever forſake any thing for his ſake and the Goſpels, Mat. 19: 29. should receive an hundredfold; then I cryed, Lord give me to be healed of this diſtemper by thee ſeing thou art pleaſed to deny help by man.</p>
               <p>And one day our Paſtor called in to viſit me, as he was going to the meeting, whom I did deſire to pray for me, and to ſtirre up the brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to joyn with him, and I much incouraged him that they should pray in faith, believing for what they asked, telling him that by faith and prayer he would aſſuredly heal me, and verily according unto my faith it was done unto me, for ever bleſſed be God for J.

               </p>
               <p>Then our Paſtor coming again to viſit me, I asked him how we should know the mind of God in theſe many afflictions, he anſwered mee, that a man having an orchard or vineyard walkes therein, and among all the trees he makes choyce it may be of ſome one tree, whoſe ſtanding is more pleaſant and conveni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh! yes ſaid I: if that be the good will of my heavenly father; and bleſſed be God I did find it ſo; for though I have ſowed in tears, I have reaped in joy, and have found the times of greateſt outward trouble, and affliction have been the onely times of greateſt inward and ſpiritual joy and ſoul conſolation, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I cannot expreſs with tongue nor pen the large experience I have had upon this account.</p>
               <p>And this I have found, that when a poor ſoul is faithful and ſingle hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for God walking up to the light id hath received, this is the very way to injoy the preſence of God and his bleſſing upon him, in what ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo ever he is in; for this I can declare from mine own experience that loſe is the way to gain, troublet is the way to peace, ſorrow is the way to joy, and death is the way to life; he that looſeth his life for my ſake, ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame shall find it, through the valey of tears lieth the way to the mountain of joy; for whilſt I ſet my ſelfin good earneſt to ſeek the Lord for inſtruction into the truth as it is in Jeſus, I met with many difficulties; but yet out prayer hearing God was pleaſed to come in by degrees; having through his grace given me faith in his ſon (who was exalted as a Prince and a Sàviour to give me repentance) made mee alſo willing to be baptiſed for the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>Now that which made me willing to obey the Lord, in this Ordinance was the Command of Jeſus Chriſt in Mat. 28: 19. and Act. 10: 48. and the example of Chriſt and the practiſe of the Apoſtles, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

heart by the Lord, that though many difficulties lay in the way, yet the Lord carried me through them all: and after I had obeyed the Lord therein (in very faithſulneſs I muſt declare that I did injoy the incomes of God in a more plentiſul manner then before: But Satan for ſome time labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hinder mee in obeying the Lord in this piece of ſervice, with this temptation, that by this meanes a death (in all likelyhood and in an eye of reaſon) would fall upon my livelyhood, but God made it a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to mee and to others alſo, ſo that many of us were at that time (after waiting on God by faſting and prayer) baptized together.</p>

               <p>Next morning, about four of the clock, being in my bed, I had this laid before mee, that God would affict that nation with great afflictions: but I (not knowing what God would try the Nation with) did deſire this of the Lord, that I might chuſe with <hi>David,</hi> rather to fall into the hands of God, then into the hands of mercileſs men: it was much upon my heart at that time; that the Lord would turn a fruitful land into barreneſs, for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That great ſloathfulneſs, deadneſs, and unfruitfulneſs under the means of grace which we injoyed, for which the Lord threatened of old, Iſa. 5: vers 5, 6. <hi>To lay his vineyard wast, to plucke up the hedge and breake downe the wall there of.</hi>

                  <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed; for I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will up hold thee with the right-hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Iſaiah 41:10.</p>

               <p>Great things have I laid up for them that fear mee among the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>The next day I ſet my houſe in order, that I might go about this work that the Lord had called mee unto, and until I went about it, this word followed mee; <hi>be inſtructed least my Spirit depart from thee;</hi> and as ſoon as I ſet upon my work, it left mee, and I found the Lord (according to his promiſe) mightyly aſſiſting mee, in bringing things to my remembtance and I wrig them down, and had ſome thoughts to put them in print; but yet through the corruptions of my heart, and the advice of a friend, I was not willing they should be published whilſt I am living: my reaſon was, becauſe I am a poor weak worthleſs worm, and have not the parts and gifts that ſome others have.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I am an old fruitleſs branch, my memory failes, and my underſtanding is ſo dull, that I am (and was at the beſt) a poor empty one, which I cannot but acknowledg with tears and brokenneſs of heart.</p>

Oh, that the Lord should be ſo good to mee! and I can bring no more glory and honnour to him; but yet notwithſtanding I muſt give glory to God, for that he hath been pleaſed to poure out of his Spirit upon mee, and ſince that, to fill my ſoul with very ſweet choyce, and heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments from himſelf.</p>
               <p>The moſt large meaſure of the ſpirit of propheſy was upon mee at two particular times, the one in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five.</p>
               <p>And the other in the year 1658, but at many times God was pleaſed to give me much of the ſpirit of prayer and praiſe.</p>
               <p>Then by his hand of providence I was removed again out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> and I brought the papers of my experiences with mee: which (the Ship being caſt away) were loſt, with the trunck in which they were: Then was it much ſet upon my heart, that God was diſpleaſed with mee, for not putting them in print, and then the guift of ſinging and praiſing was much ceaſed, and I was troubled; for the which I ſought the Lord, and did begg', that if he were offended at mee, for not printing, and leaving them behind mee, that he would pardon it unto mee; and that, if it were his good pleaſure, I should write them again. I did pray, that he would let his Spirit come to inable mee again in ſinging and prayer, as it was wont to do, and be my remembrancer to write again: and indeed it did ſo, not long after, in the night; both in ſong, and in prayer.</p>
               <p>But then I having not time, was much hindered? yet notwithſtanding (according to the time I had) I ſet my ſelf to do it; and the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſiſt mee, in bringing again to my remembrance things of long ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Now before I departed from <hi>England,</hi> I was ſatisfied in my ſpirit, that I had a clear call from thee Lord ſo to do; for indeed more then a year I had ſuch a motion in my ſpirit, backed with many Scriptures for its furtherance.</p>
               <p>Yet nothwithſtanding in this Voyage we met wich ſome diffciulty, for the Ship I came over in was caſt away; but in the time of the greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Lord gave mee in theſe promiſes; that he would be with mee in ſix troubles, and in the ſeventh he would not forſake mee.</p>
               <p>Call upon mee in the day of trouble, I will hear thee, and deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify mee.</p>
               <p>With this ſweet word alſo, thou shalt not die, but live, to ſee the mercy I will shew unto thee.</p>

It was in the night, and after ſome time (the Ship being a ground, and in great danger, and ſo were all the perſons in it) one asked mee, if I were not afraid? I anſwered, the God of heaven my Father hath brought mee hither, and if he may have more honour in drowning of mee, then by preſerving mee, his will be done.</p>
               <p>Then, when the maſt was cut down, and the Maſter with ſome others ſaid, we are dead perſons, and like to looſe our lives, yet I had much hope in the Lord, becauſe of his promiſe, and after that I (and ſome others in the Ship with mee) had committed our ſelves unto God by prayer, I being in the Cabbon, laid me down to ſleep: but I had not (it ſeems) lien half an hour, but they called us, and ſaid, there was Land not far of, if wee would ſeek for help? vvhich accordingly vve did.</p>

               <p>And as our God (to whom we had committed ourſelves) guided us, we went another way on the ſands, and as I was going (looking to God to be my Pilot) not knowing whether vve vvent, for the ſea vvas one both ſides of us, and vvee had but a ſmall vvay on the ſands to vvalk in; and as I vvas begging of the Lord, to keep in the ſeastill vve found out a place, not onely for our ovvn eſcape, but that vve might ſee deliverance for our friends in the Ship alſo, the Lord vvas pleaſed to ſet this upon my heart.</p>

And now hereby do I know, that it was the Spirit of God and of truth that did work at this time, becauſe it did lay mee low, and flat before him, that is holy, and made me ſee my own inſufficiency, and his great al ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, which did much humble mee, and broak, and melted mee excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, then was this promiſe given in; <hi>That they that waiton the Lord shall renew their ſtrength, they shall mount up with wings as Eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And my heart was very much drawn out to wait upon God, in a way of believing, both for my ſelf and people of God, having that word as it were whiſpered in my ear: <hi>If thou canst believe, all things are poſsible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another time I was conſidering, that though I had been a Profeſſor many years, yet I though! indeed I was but a babe in Chriſt, then that word came upon mee: <hi>Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings thou haſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And indeed I can incourage the moſt ſimple and weak, to wait on the Lord, for his grace is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>At this time I was taught by the ſpirit, that prayer was another thing then ſome take it to be; it is of a divine nature, and they onely, whom God helpeth, can pray, for it is not words that is alwayes needfull, for a ſoul may pray and utter no words, and have ſweet communion with God by faith; yet words ſometimes affect the heart, and I have ſometimes found the voyce cannot be kept in, the heart may be ſo filled. Therefore I blame none, but deſire to be tender of all, for God accepts what himſelf gives, outward performances is as the shell without the kernel; if the ſpirit act not, but what of his own ſpirit is in any duty that God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. And we read of the poor woman in the Goſpel, who met with ſome diſcouragements, yet by the power of faith being inabled to hold on; oh! how greatly he commended her faith, and anſwered her deſire, though her words were but few, onely, <hi>Lord help mee, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Hannahs</hi> prayer was heard, who did but move her lips: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she was a woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit before, yet she went away believing, and alſo rejoycing that God had heard her prayer.</p>
               <p>So the deſires of them that fear him shall be anſwered, and he will hear their cry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel,</hi> before he made his ſupplication, was anſwered, the groaning of the ſpirit before the Lord is a loud cry, the prayer of faith doth ſave the ſick.</p>
               <p>The Lord is a very preſent help in the time of need.</p>

They that truſt in him, shall not be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>Nay he takes pleaſure in them that fear him, and that hopes in his mercy.</p>
               <p>Therefore let them that call on the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</p>

               <p>Yet I am much incouraged to believe that this work is of the Lord, for I have found the flesh exceeding oppoſet thereunto, and when I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected it, God hath withdrawn himſelf from mee, and when I ſet to it in good earneſt, then God returns and let mee injoy ſweet communion with himſelf: And the more, the Lord appeared at the firſt comings in of theſe things upon my ſoul, the more his love broake my heart, that I was wonderfully affected to behold the freeneſs of his grace to ſuch a one.</p>
               <p>And verily the more watchful I was againſt ſin and unto duty, the more of his divine preſence was affoarded, which is ſo gloriouſly ſweet to injoy, that the more I had, the more ſtill I would have, and ſtill longed for, not onely in the day, but in the night alſo, hearkening what God ſpake, and in the night his vvay to my ſoul hath been to come in vvith many ſvveet ſeaſonable and povverful inſtructions, ſtirring me up to pray, teaching me hovv to pray, and vvhat to pray for, encreaſing my faith and conſidence, to believe for that I have praied for, both for my ſelf and others (and alſo ſtirring mee up to prayſing him) and I find that giving my ſelf vvholy to the diſpoſing of God in prayer, is a very good thing: alſo this fear hath been upon mee ſometimes, that I should offer unto God that vvhich coſt mee nothing, that is, to lay ont the choiſeſt, and moſt of the day about the vvorld, and then bring the ſleepy head to God for a ſacrifice: I minding the ſpirituallity of true prayer, and my unfitneſs for it, I have found the councel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt very uſeful, vvhere he ſaith, <hi>VVatch and pray.</hi> Math. 26: 41.</p>

               <p>At other times when I have not found God coming in to help mee, I have gone a way and waited his time, for unleſs God enlarge our hearts, it is not good for us to en large in words, for God is in heaven and thou on the earth, therefore <hi>let thy words befew</hi> (thy words mark that) <hi>and bodily exerciſe proſiteth nothing, my ſon give mee thy heart,</hi> ſaith God.

               <p>The poor man that ſaid, God be merciful unto mee a Sinner, went a way more accepted or rather Juſtified then the Phariſe, in the time before the coming of Chriſt in the flesh, if Gods people could not bring a lamb fo ra ſacriffice, if they brought but two pigeons, or a little flower, if it were brought to the Prieſt, it was accepted, ſo if we come to him that Juſtifies the ungodly, and hath promiſed to do all our works in us, and for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his alſufficiency, and ſubmit to him, and be content with that he will give us, as well in ſpirit uals as in temperals, the Lord will accept of us, onely believing we muſt flee unto the hornes of the Althar.</p>
               <p>And I have found, when I have neglected prayer, my heart hath been very dead and full of unbelief: And again, I have found it no comfort to reſt upon duties, for that is a dangerous evil to ſet up ſuch an Idol in the heart; but here in lay my comfort, when I by faith could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vvith God, and coming near to him, could caſt my burthen upon him, and go avvay quiet in my mind, that Chriſt vvould do all for mee; and vvhen I vvas vvilling, God shtould do vvhat he pleaſed vvith mee, and my vvill vvas brought to his vvill; then have I had the mercy I have asked, and more alſo many times.</p>
               <p>I have found retired places and vvatchings, the beſt opportunities and greateſt advantages unto prayer.</p>
               <p>Alſo I have had many temptations againſt prayer, but the beſt vvay to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them, is to mind the command of Jeſus Chriſt, vvhich is that vve should vvatch unto prayer, and pray alvvayes, keep cloſe to the duty in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and looſe not the motions of the Spirit neither grieve the Spirit by ſin, but vvatch againſt all appearances of evil, for I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have

               <p>My ſelf ſought the Lord 20 years, for one thing, before I had an anſvver, but at laſt being at prayer, after I had done, God gave mee in a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious anſvver, and ſet dovvn the very time of deliverance, and did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly accomplish it at the very time; to him be the praiſe.</p>

It is alſo promiſed, that they who be planted in the houſe of the Lord like a watered Gardin shall they grow and florish, and bring forth fruit in their old age: Pſa. 92: 12, 13. Further, o! let all the beloved of the Lord take a ſpecialcare of every Goſpel ordinance and commandment of our Lord, to hold forth what light you have received, for there is non of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel to be ſlighted, for they hold out unto us thoſe choyce priviledges that vvere purchaſed for us vvith the precious blood of Jeſus Chriſt, I have found great peace, and injoyed much of Gods preſence in vvaiting upon him in the vvay of his appointments, and I have found the Lord (not leaving but) teaching of mee, vvhen I out of conſcience have forborn vvhere they vvere not tobe injoyed, according to the rule of the Goſpel, and expoſe my ſelf to any ſuffring to injoy them in the purity of them, and indeed God doth take ſpecial notice of them vvho they be, and vvhere they dvvell, Revel. 2: 13. that in ſore perſecuting and ſuffering times hold faſt his truths, and do not deny his name, Mal. 3: 16, and hath promiſed that they vvho keep the vvord of his patience shall be keept in the hour of temptation.</p>

what word of comfort she could find there, and it pleaſed God to hand to her that place, Rom. 8: 13. <hi>For if ye live after the flesh ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortiſy the deeds of the body, ye shall live:</hi> which word God did make very powerful and effectual to help forward his work upon her ſoul.</p>

               <p>For if God ſees affliction to be good for mee, I deſire not to diſpiſe his chaſtizements; for I have found more ſtrength in a great affliction then in a little one, and my ſoul hath been filled with joy out of meaſure.</p>
               <p>Therefore if we be brought to this, take joyfully the ſpoiling of our goods, knowing we have a better inheritance, and the giving up all to the will of God, who gave all to us, we shall have all given to us with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, oh! the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all, but I am nothing, and can do nothing, no longer then he doth aſſiſt, therefore praiſe him for ever more.</p>
               <p>And ſince I was taken of from my incumbrances in the world, and had more time to ſpend in the wayes and work of God: waiting on him for more of himſelf, the Lord (according to his promiſe) hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more abundantly, and I have found that a chearfull watchful diligent ſpirit in ones general and particular calling is a great help to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending time, for of idleneſs comes no good, therefore it hath been my practice, that if I can do no good, nor receive good, not to ſtay in that place long.</p>
               <p>Oh! let us be wary how we ſpend our precious time, for it hat a lock before, but none behind: I am of a fearful timerous ſpirit naturally, but I find it a great help to dash Babilons brats in the firſt rice.</p>
               <p>I was about 14 years in the pangs of the new birth before I received the witneſs of the ſpirit, in which time I was exceeding troubled with my unbelieving heart through entertaining falſe fears: and indeed ſome thing of Jeſus Chriſt was in mee all that while: Althoug ſometimes I could not

               <p>And now friends, give me leave to tell you theſe are mine experiences, and I fear it would be burthen ſome to you, if I should be larger, which I could be: but give me leave to tell you the concluſion of all what I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after, which is to preſs after the mark of the high calling, to deny my ſelf, and look up to him that is perfect, and who preſents all his perfect without ſpot or wrinkle.</p>

               <p>It is a meek and a quiet ſpirit, it hates pride and lifting up; it ſees enough in it ſelf dayly to humble it; Its full of love to all that God loves, though differing from them; by this shall all men knovv that you are my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if you have love one to another. Joh. 13: 35</p>
               <p>We know that vve are paſſed from death to life; becauſe we love the brethren. 1. Joh. 3: 14.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why we should cherish this grace of love to God, his people, and all men are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe without love, which is charity, we are but as ſounding braſs or tinckeling Cymbals, all we do without this is nothing. 2 Cor. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:37438:20"/>
Secondly, becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid, becauſe Iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold in the laſt dayes. Mat. 24. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe it is one of Chriſts laſt and great Commandments. John. 13: 34. 1. of Joh. 2. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it renders us much like unto our Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, Acts. 10: 38. who went about doing good to all; let us labour to follow his example, shevv pitty to them, that God hath not yet shewed ſo much pitty to, as he hath done unto us; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that diſpitefully uſe you. Mat. 5. 44: 45.</p>
               <p>Theſe were Gods teachings to mee in the abſence of faithful Teachers, when they were removed into corners; Which was a ſore affliction to mee, but I look at what mercy God afoards mee in all afflictions, ſeing I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorthy of the leaſt mercy, for it vvere a righteous thing vvith God to cut us of, and I marvailed at his patience and long ſuffering vvith mee, and all others.</p>
               <p>I find by experience that reading the Scripture before prayer many times quickeneth the heart to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And to meditate on Gods mercies to our ſoules and bodyes; and what great things Chriſt hath ſuffered to purchaſe theſe mercies for us: is a great help to ſtir up to that heavenly duty of praiſing and thankfulneſs: which is a maine duty I would ſtir up my ſelf and others unto, becauſe our hearts are apt to be very backward unto it; and ſecondly, becauſe it is a duty to be done at all times. In all things give thankes, yea in afflictions: For God hath promiſed, all shall worke together for good to them that love God. Thirdly, to be filled with the Spirit of praiſes, makes the ſoul to live in heaven while it is on earth: verily, we had need be ſtirred up to this duty; for he that offers praiſe glorifies God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>last verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Ieſus Chriſt complaines againſt the neglect of it, in that place where the ten Leppers were clenſed, and but one did returne thankes: ſaith Chriſt, was there not ten cleuſed, but where are the nine? O! athank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame doth compoſe the heart to great contentedneſs in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is of a divine nature: it ſtirres up the graces of God in the ſoul, as love and faith with hope in God and charity to others.</p>
               <p>Therefore pray for the Spirit of God, to put the heart into a praiſing frame for there's need of the exerciſe of much heavenly wiſdome in the performance of this duty: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Proſperity hath made many to glory in the flesh; and exalt themſelves, in, which vain glory ſome ſtill do continue: although the great Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God hath and doth teſtify from heaven againſt it, but if it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, and departed from, God wil turn it into shame, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4: 7. As they were increaſed, ſo they ſinned againſt me, therefore will I change their glory into shame: its now a trying time, and all perſons by their converſations will diſcover what they are, and were ever the deeds and workes of the flesh appear, and are alowed, 't is evident there is not the Spirit of God in them: And they who have not the Spirit of Chriſt are none of his: And 't is not a talking of, but walking in the Spirit, will help againſt the fulfilling the luſts of the flesh, and manifeſt who are the true Children of God. Oh! that perſons were wiſe, to conſider their latter end, then ſurely they would not neglect the knowledg of thoſe things that belong to their peace: but chuſe that better part, that shall never be taken from them. Which would make them happy for ever.</p>
               <p>Oh! that all would be perſuaded to commune with their own hearts, and conſider their own wayes: And to mind the dreadful Judgments of God, and his vials of wrath that shall be powred out againſt ſin and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſurely they would ſee it is high time to departe from pride, vain glory, coveteouſneſs, oppreſſion, hypocriſy, mallice, and all ſin: For verily, God is viſiting for theſe things, and for perſons ſtill to continue therein, may it not be feared and juſtly exſpected, that God should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Judgments, and punish ſeaven times more: Leit. 26: 21, 24. <hi>They who departe not from ſin God will departe from them:</hi> and hovv ſad that is let ſoules conſider: read <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9: 11, 12, 14.</p>

Therefore who ever vvould not be eternally ſeperated from God, let them in time ſeperate from all ſin: And let poor ſoules take ſpeciall heed they live not in any knovvn evil, nor neglect any knovvn duty, but put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make no proviſion for the flesh to fulfil the luſts thereof; for if ye live after the flesh ye shall dye: But if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8: 13. let me propound but this on queſtion, and I vvish all young and old, Rich and poor to mind it, vvhether or no it is not better to ſeparate from ſin, then that ſin should ſeperate thee from God for ever.</p>
               <p>Oh! vvhat need is there, that all vvho love God and their ovvn ſoules, should hate, abhorre, and depart from all ſin, becauſe 't is that vvhich God doth ſo hate, as he vvill punish it vvhere ever he finds it. Yea, if a <hi>David,</hi> a Man after Gods ovvn heart do commit any ſin, he muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for it; and God vvill ſo frovvne as it may coſt many ſigths, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and tears, before God reſtore unto him the joy of his ſalvation, and though ſecretly committed, yet God vvill punish openly that others may hear and fear. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12: 12.</p>
               <p>Oh! hovv have I found by ſad experience, that pride is a breeding ſin, and ſpiritual pride is indeed the very vvorſt, vvhen perſons come to have a little knovvledg of the things of God, and have ſet a fevv ſteeps in his vvayes: Many be too prone, then to be puffed up vvith ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, and to judg all others to be in errors, vvho are not juſt of their perſwaſion; and ſo to judge cenſure, and condemne them for Heretikes: and to perſecute them at leaſt vvith the tonge, but though ſometimes Paul did thus; he acknovvledgeth it vvas from a Phariſaical ſpirit, which vve had all need to take heed of: and judg not; and ye shall not be judged.

And vvhat ever their perſwaſion be all vvho are humble and holy, and do faithfully vvalke up to the light they have received, let them be beloved for the Fathers ſake.

               <p>And I vvould have all to endeavor diligently for the injoyment of the Spirit, and hearken every one that hath an ear: vvhat it ſpeaks, for the teachings thereof are very glorious; it makes a ſoul live as it vvere in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vvhile on earth.

               <p>This good Spirit of God is that vvhich vvill enable us to chuſe to ſuffer rather then to ſin, and in all our ſuffering it vvill vvonderfully aſſiſt and uphold us, and carry through the foreſt firy tryals, and if vve be throvvn into ſufferings for Chriſt ſake, be ſure he vvil make one vvith us to uphold us in the furnis; and vve need not ſtudy hovv vve shall be delivered from our ennemies, for God vvill deal vvith them as he did vvith <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three Children; for he will recompence the wickedneſs of the wicked upon their ovvn heads; therefore fear not, but ſtand ſtill and vvait, and yovv shall ſee the ſalvation of God. And I do not think that theſe things be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in to me from the Lord for my ovvne ſake only, but for your benefit, to vvhom it may come; and I hope I am ſo far from having high thoughts of my ſelf, that the more I ſee of God, and injoy from God, ſo much the more cauſe I have to be humble; and if others find theirhearts as bad as I have found mine, they vvill ſee cauſe enough to uſe all means vvith them; and vvhen allis done; it muſt be faith in Jeſus Chriſt muſt remove this mountain; faith vvill carry us out of ourſelves unto Chriſt, and cauſe us to reſt on him to do all our vvorkes for us, and in us, do ye cherish a holy fear againſt ſin, and an holy bouldneſs to come to God, and a holy confidence in him for vvhat we come for, and let not the fear of man hinder from any duty God calls thee unto; to conclude, I only commend unto you that vvord in <hi>Micha</hi> 6: 8.
