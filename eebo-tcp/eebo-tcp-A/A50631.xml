            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>This favour bears the lovely brown,</l>

               <l>The Maſter of a great and goodly Ship was he,</l>
               <l>Who there was waiting in the Hall,</l>

               <l>Sighing to her ſelf moſt piteouſly,</l>
               <l>She thus to him did make her mone.</l>
               <l>She falls upon her bended knée,</l>
               <l>Good ſir, ſaid ſhe, now pitty you a womans woe,</l>
               <l>And prove a faithful friend to me,</l>

               <l>Full fain I would my brother ſee,</l>
               <l>But that my father will not yield to let me go,</l>
               <l>Therefore good Sir, be good to me,</l>
               <l>And unto me this favour ſhow;</l>
               <l>Some Ship-boys garment bring to me,</l>
               <l>That I diſguis'd may go unknown,</l>
               <l>And unto Sea I'le go with thée,</l>
               <l>If ſo much favour might be ſhown,</l>

               <l>And ſeek him out in every part,</l>
               <l>Until his ſight I do obtain:</l>
               <l>And I (quoth he) will not forſake,</l>
               <l>Sweet <hi>Maudlin</hi> in her ſorrows up and down,</l>
               <l>In wealth or woe thy parti'le take,</l>
               <l>And bring thee ſafe to <hi>Padua</hi> Town:</l>
               <l>And after many weary ſteps,</l>
               <l>In <hi>Padua</hi> they ſafe arrived at the laſt,</l>
               <l>For very joy her heart it leaps;</l>
               <l>She thinks not on her ſorrows paſt.</l>
               <l>Condemn'd he was to dye alas,</l>
               <l>Except he would from his Religion turn,</l>
               <l>But rather then he would to Maſſe,</l>
               <l>In fiery flames he vow'd to burn.</l>
               <l>Now doth ſwéet <hi>Maudlin</hi> weep and wail</l>
               <l>Her joy is turn'd to weeping ſorrow grief and care</l>
               <l>For nothing could her plaints prevail.</l>
               <l>For death alone muſt be his ſhare.</l>
               <l>She walks under the Priſon walls</l>
               <l>Where her true love did lye &amp; languiſh in diſtreſs</l>
               <l>When wofully for food he calls,</l>
               <l>When hunger did his heart oppreſſe.</l>
               <l>He ſighs and ſobs and makes great moan,</l>
               <l>Farewel ſwéet love for evermore;</l>
               <l>And all my friends that have me known</l>
               <l>In <hi>Briſtow</hi> town with wealth and ſtore:</l>
               <l>But moſt of all farewel (quoth he)</l>
               <l>My own ſweet <hi>Maudlin</hi> whom I left behind;</l>
               <l>For never more thou ſhalt me ſee,</l>
               <l>Woe to thy father moſt unkind;</l>
               <l>How well I were if thou wert here</l>
               <l>With thy fair hands to cloſe theſe my Wretched eyes</l>
               <l>My torments eaſie would appear,</l>
               <l>My ſoul with joy would ſcale the Skies.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Maudlin</hi> heard her lovers moan,</l>
               <l>Her eyes with tears her heart with ſorrow filled was</l>
               <l>To ſpeak with him no means was known,</l>
               <l>Such grieveus doom on him did paſſe.</l>
               <l>Then ſhe put off her Lads attire,</l>
               <l>Her Maidens wéed upon her back ſhe ſéemly ſet</l>
               <l>To the judges houſe ſhe did enquire,</l>
               <l>And there ſhe did a ſervice get:</l>
               <l>She did her duty there ſo well,</l>
               <l>And eke ſo prudently ſhe did her ſelf behave,</l>
               <l>With her in love her Maſter fell,</l>
               <l>His ſervants favour he did crave</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Maudlin</hi> (quoth he) my hearts delight.</l>
               <l>To whom my heart in affection is ty'd,</l>
               <l>Breed not my death through thy diſpight,</l>
               <l>A faithful friend thou ſhalt me find.</l>
               <l>O grant me thy love fair Maid (quoth he)</l>
               <l>And at my hands deſire what thou canſt deviſe,</l>
               <l>And I will grant it unto thee,</l>
               <l>Whereby thy credit may ariſe.</l>
               <l>I have a Brother, Sir, ſaid ſhe,</l>
               <l>For his Religion is now condemn'd to dye,</l>
               <l>In loathſom Priſon he is caſt,</l>
               <l>Oppreſt with grief and miſery:</l>
               <l>Grant me my Brothers life (ſhe ſaid)</l>
               <l>And now to you my love and liking I will give</l>
               <l>That may not be (quoth he) fair Maid,</l>
               <l>Except he turn he cannot live:</l>
               <l>An Engliſh Fryer there is (ſhe ſaid)</l>
               <l>Of learning great and paſſing pure of life,</l>
               <l>Let him to my brother be ſent,</l>
               <l>And he will finiſh ſoon the ſtrife:</l>
               <l>Her Maſter granted her requeſt,</l>
               <l>The Marriner in Fryers weeds ſhe did array,</l>
               <l>And to her love that lay diſtreſt,</l>
               <l>She did a Letter ſoon convey.</l>
               <l>When he had read theſe gentle lines,</l>
               <l>His heart was raviſht with pleaſant joy;</l>
               <l>Where now ſhe is full well he knew,</l>
               <l>The Fryer likewiſe was not coy;</l>
               <l>But did declare to him at large,</l>
               <l>the enterprize his love for him had taken in hand</l>
               <l>The young-man did the Fryer charge,</l>
               <l>His love ſhould ſtreight depart the Land.</l>
               <l>Here is no place for her (he ſaid)</l>
               <l>But woful death and danger of her life,</l>
               <l>Profeſſing truth I was betray'd</l>
               <l>And fearful flames must end the ſtrife.</l>
               <l>For e're I will my faith deny,</l>
               <l>And ſwear my ſelf to follow damned Antichriſt</l>
               <l>I'le yield my body for to dye,</l>
               <l>To live in Heaven with the higheſt.</l>
               <l>O Sir the gentle Fryer ſaid,</l>
               <l>Conſent thereto and end the ſtrife,</l>
               <l>A woful match (quoth he) is made,</l>
               <l>Where Chriſt is left to win a wife.</l>
               <l>When ſhe had us'd all means ſhe might,</l>
               <l>To ſave his life, and yet all would not be;</l>
               <l>Then of the judge ſhe claim'd her right,</l>
               <l>To dye the death as well as he.</l>
               <l>When no perſwaſions could prevail,</l>
               <l>Nor change her mind in any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe had ſaid</l>
               <l>She was with him condemn'd to dye,</l>
               <l>And for them both one fire was made.</l>
               <l>Yea arm in arm moſt joyfully,</l>
               <l>Theſe Lovers twain unto the fire did go,</l>
               <l>The Marriner moſt faithfully,</l>
               <l>Was likewiſe Partner of their woe.</l>
               <l>But when the judges underſtood,</l>
               <l>The faithful friendſhip did in them remain:</l>
               <l>They ſav'd their lives and afterwards</l>
               <l>To <hi>England</hi> ſent them back again.</l>
               <l>Now was their ſorrow turn'd to joy,</l>
               <l>And faithful Lovers have their hearts deſire,</l>
               <l>Their pains ſo well they did imploy,</l>
               <l>God granted that they did deſire,</l>
               <l>And when they did to <hi>England</hi> come,</l>
               <l>And in merry <hi>Briſtow</hi> arrived at the laſt;</l>
               <l>Great joy there was to all and ſome</l>
               <l>That heard the dangers they had paſt.</l>
               <l>Her father he was dead God wot,</l>
               <l>And eke her Mother was joyful at her ſight</l>
               <l>Their wiſhes ſhe denyed not,</l>
               <l>But wedded them to hearts delight:</l>
               <l>Her gentle Maſter ſhe deſired,</l>
               <l>To be her father, and at Church to give her then:</l>
               <l>It was fulfilled as ſhe required,</l>
               <l>Unto the joys of all good men.</l>
