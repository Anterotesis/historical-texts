            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PRINCESSE
OF
CLEVE.</head>
            <p>GRandeur and Gallantry never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in greater splendour in
<hi>France,</hi> than in the Declension of
the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second.
To the Person and Bravery of this Prince,
Nature had added warm inclinations to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the amorous Fire she had originally kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in him: That the passion he had for <hi>Diana</hi>
of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> Duchess of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> under
which he had labour'd upwards of twenty
years, was so far from being able to abate of
its violence, it rather seem'd to add Fewel to
the Flame.</p>
            <p>He had the happiness to excel in all those
noble Exercises, he judg'd might merit a place
in his Royal thoughts, amongst the number
of which he was particularly devoted to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53905:3"/>
Hunting, Tennis-Balls, Running at the
Ring, and such other generous Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as might suit with the Honour of
his Presence.</p>
            <p>Their Appointments were seldom made,
but colourably, to give the King an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to recruit the passion the Duchesses
beauty had so many years since created in
him. She seem'd to parallel, if not exceed,
the fair Model of Madam <hi>de la March,</hi> her
Daughter, then unmarried, in those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Nature had been prodigal of to them
both. The Queens presence still seem'd to
authorise hers.</p>
            <p>This Princes, though she had out-worn
her youthful years, her Face yet seem'd to
retain the ruines of a Noble Beauty. She
was pleased to set a value on State, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
and her pleasures; but to such only
she allowed the honour of her presence, as
might not contribute to any diminution of
her greatness. She was married to the King
when he was Duke of <hi>Orleans:</hi> The Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,
his elder Brother, being then living,
and who since dyed at <hi>Tournon,</hi> a Prince
whose Birth and Merit had design'd him for
the succession of <hi>Francis</hi> the First, his Royal
Father.</p>
            <p>The ambitious humour of the Queen made
him keep a straiter Rein upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53905:3"/>
He thought she would not so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
her resentment of his passion for the
Duchess, that the Symptomes of her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
might fall under his notice. She was
so well read in the practice of dissimulation,
that it was impossible to pierce further into
the Cabinet of her heart, than she was pleas'd
to allow the Inquisitor. Policy obliged her
to interpose the Person of this Duchess, that
she might the more easily insinuate her self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that of the King. This Prince was pleased
to divert himself in the conversation of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and not always of those for whom he
had a kindness. He was ever ready to wait
upon the Queen at the usual hour, they
took the <hi>Tour,</hi> which was always honoured
with the presence of the greatest and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving.</p>
            <p>Never was a Court furnisht with a fairer
stock of either Sex. Nature seem'd to have
taken pleasure to be most lavish of her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Graces to the greatest Persons. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who had the honour to marry
with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to the admiration of the Court, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Beauty, that prov'd afterwards
so fatal to her. The Lady <hi>Mary Steward,</hi>
Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who being designed to
marry the Dauphin, had the honour to wear
the Title of the Dauphin-Queen. Nature
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53905:4"/>
had made her fair Model inferior in no part to
that of the Princess; she received her Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>France,</hi> and had taken up an Ambition
from her Infancy (that in despite of her green
years) she was resolved, not only to love,
but understand all such things as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to her improvement. The Queen her
Mother-in-law, and the Princess the Kings
Sister, were much devoted to Musick and
Poetry. The Veneration King <hi>Francis</hi> had
for those Sciences, was not yet extinguisht in
<hi>France:</hi> and the King, who affected all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of the Body, made the Court the
Theatre he perform'd them in. But that which
render'd it so splendid, was the presence of
so many great Princes and Persons of Merit.
Those I shall presume to name here, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
its Ornament, and its Admiration.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had ingross'd the
greatest Respect, as pretending to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Rank, which, joyn'd to the Merit of his
Person, justly allow'd him the Honour of it.
He was so great a General, that the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> had an Ambition to serve under him in
the quality of a private Volunteer. 'Tis
Truth, the Duke had given so great proofs of
his Vallour and Conduct, that there was not
a great Captain that could allow his Merit
its due Character without Envy. His Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
was bound up with other great Vertues;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53905:4"/>
he had a Soul as brave as generous, and a
Capacity so great, as if Nature had fitted
him <hi>Tam</hi> Marti, <hi>quam</hi> Mercurio, either for
War or Counsel. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi>
his Brother, brought into the World so insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
an Ambition with him, he seem'd to
have a Design wholly to ingross her to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Nature had added to it, for its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
a Tongue whose Eloquence was made
up of Charms. His Studies and Sedulity
had furnisht him with a stupendious stock of
Learning, which he was not wanting on all
occasions to imploy in the defence of the
Church. The Chevalier of <hi>Guise,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
called the Grand Prior, was a Prince,
whose Affability and Sweetness had justly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
him the respect of all that had the
happiness to know him. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>
under the small dimension Nature had mold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, by which she testified the little regard
she had for his Person, had a Soul as haughty
as great; and the briskness of his Wit had
amply supply'd Nature's unkind usage; which
could not, with all her envy, rob him of the
Honour that was due to his Merit and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
The Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
his Age venerable by the Honour of his
Actions. These composed the nobler part of
the glorious Train of the Court: He had
three Sons as equally as nobly accomplisht, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53905:5"/>
second was called the Prince of <hi>Cleve,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
that truly deserved to support the
greatness of his Family, he was as good as
great; and he had so large a stock of Prudence
and Discretion, such as Nature seldom lodges
in green heads. The viscount of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
descended from the illustrious Family of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
(whose name the Princes of the Blood
think no dishonour to wear) presum'd to share
in their Gallantry with them: He was inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
to none either in his Person or his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
or any other rich Endowment, that
can render a Gentleman truly noble. By
which he had purchas'd himself so great an
esteem in the Court, that they thought he
might deserve the Honour (if any Man might
presume to it) of having his Merit thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Ballance with that of the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi>
This Prince seem'd to have been the
chief work of Nature; that which was the
least to be admired in him was his Person, than
which the World could not produce a nobler.
That which lodg'd him above the common
Sphere of others, was not only his Courage,
which had not it's equal, but the sweet Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that was observed in all his other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:
they seem'd to have conspired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to render him the Worlds wonder. The
sweetness of his Converse made him equally
the ambition of both Sexes; and he was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53905:5"/>
pleased to express that Majesty in all his Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
that it still purchased him the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his beholders. The gayety of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
had made him the mode of the Court,
though all his followers had the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to fall short of their Pattern. In fine
there was that Contexture of worth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in the rich Frame, that wheresoever he
came, he had the happiness to ingross to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the respect of the whole Company.
There was not a Lady in the Court, whose
coyness would not abate upon his approach;
neither was there any could boast her heart
proof against his Charms; and as few that
could forbear to discover a passion for him,
though he had not the inclination to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
the flame. He had so great a passion
for Honour, he thought the greatest toils,
the noblest steps to mount up to her. He
had his choice of Mistresses, but only a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
could Divine which of them had the
happy Fate to entertain his heart. He was
often observed to make his visits to the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin-Queen.</hi>
The Beauty of this Princess,
the Sweetness of her disposition, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
she seemed to use to keep up the Honor
and Esteem the Court had for her, joyned
with the respect she was pleased to shew this
Prince, gave a suspition to some, that he
might as well love, as admire so deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53905:6"/>
a Lady. The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whose
Neece she was, had so far advanc'd the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Family by the Honour of this
Match, that his Ambition prompt him to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
it with the Princes of the Blood, and
share in the Power and Authority of the
Constable <hi>Montmorency.</hi> The management
of great Affairs the King left to the conduct
of the Constable; and was pleas'd to treat
the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Marshal of St.
<hi>Andre,</hi> as his Favourites; but as for that
Grace and Favour they were to expect from
his Royal Bounty, he never granted them
with that pleasure and content, as when they
came recommended from the Duchess of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinois;</hi>
and notwithstanding age had
robb'd her of her youth, which should main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Charms that first captivated him, she
yet retained that absolute Empire over his
Heart, she might be still said to be Mistress
both of his Royal Person and his Fortune.</p>
            <p>The King had so great a kindness for the
Constable, that the first moment of his
Reign enlarg'd him from that Exile, to which
<hi>Francis</hi> the First had condemn'd him. The
Court was divided between the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
and the Constable, who was supported by
the Princes of the Blood: Both Parties made
it their ambition to purchase an Interest in the
Duchess of <hi>Valentinois.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53905:6"/>
Brother to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> had
married one of her Daughters, the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seem'd to aspire at the same Alliance. He
was not satisfied that his eldest Son had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Madam <hi>Diana,</hi> the Kings Daughter by
a Lady of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who had no sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd
her self of that mutual Pledge,
between his Majesty and her, but was pleas'd
to retire into a Cloyster. This Marriage meets
with several difficulties, occasioned by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> had made to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Piennes,</hi> one of her Majesties Maids
of Honour. And notwithstanding the King
was pleased to carry himself with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
between them, the Constable thought
himself not sufficiently propt without the
favour of the Duchess, whereby he might
divide the interest the House of <hi>Guise</hi> seem'd
by that Alliance to ingross to its self. Their
greatness had already given some disquiet and
uneasiness to her; she endeavour'd to retard
the Dauphin's Marriage with the Queen of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> The Beauty and discretion of this
young Queen, with the advantage this Match
must give the Family of <hi>Guise,</hi> she knew not
how to rellish: She had an inveteracy for the
Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who had taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to discourse her in a Dialect she could
by no means understand, by which she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
he had possessed the Queen to her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53905:7"/>
By this the Constable discover'd
a disposition in her, which gave him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of making an Alliance by a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of Madam <hi>la March,</hi> her Daughter, with
Monsieur <hi>d' Anvile,</hi> his second Son, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him in his Government under <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>9th.</hi> The Constable hop'd he should not
meet the same <hi>Remora</hi> in his second he had
unhappily found in his eldest: But alas, he
was mistaken: The Duke <hi>d' Anvile</hi> was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
in love with the Dauphin-Queen;
but what hopes he might have, that she
would vouchsafe to entertain the Flame, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soar'd
the Constable's apprehension. The
Marshal of St. <hi>Andre</hi> was the only Person in
the Court that seem'd to lean to neither side:
He was a Favourite whose interest seldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
any thing above his own advantage.
The King lov'd him from the time he was
Dauphin; and since he has been pleas'd to
make him a Marshal of <hi>France,</hi> in an Age
so raw, it could scarce intitle another to the
meanest Dignity. The Kings favour gave
him a great Lustre, which he was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to improve on all occasions, to endear
both his Merit and his Person; which he had
the happiness to do, under the advantages of
a splendid Table, to which his Majesty was a
constant Guest; the richness of his Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
and gayety of his Equipage, to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53905:7"/>
splendor whereof his Majesties Royal Bounty
was ever contributary. This Prince would
passionately espouse the interest of those he
loved. And notwithstanding he was not inrich't
with the noblest Qualities, he was not yet
barren in them all: As he was a great lover
of Arms, he was no Novice in them; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
still waited on him with success, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the battel of St. <hi>Quintine,</hi> his Reign was
no other than a continued series of Victory.
By his Personal Courage he shared in the
Honour of the Battel of <hi>Renty, Piedmont</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his Arms, to which he added the
greatest lustre in chasing the <hi>English</hi> out of
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5<hi>th.</hi> found a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clension
in his Fortune at the Siege of <hi>Metz,</hi>
before which he brought the strength both
of the Empire and <hi>Spain:</hi> But the disgrace
he received at St. <hi>Quintine</hi> had put so great a
stop to his glorious Carreer, he was inforc't
to suffer his Rival to share his Fortune with
him, and treat a Peace.</p>
            <p>The Duchess <hi>Dowager</hi> of <hi>Lorain,</hi> had
made the first Overture at the Dauphins Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
since which there has been held a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Negotiation. In fine, <hi>Cercan</hi> in <hi>Artois</hi>
was the place appointed for the Treaty. The
Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> the Constable of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi>
and the Marshal of St. <hi>Andre,</hi> were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53905:8"/>
Plenipotentiaries for the King; the Duke of
<hi>Alva,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for <hi>philip</hi> the
Second; the Duke and Duchess of <hi>Orleans</hi>
were the Mediators. The principal Articles
were, the Marriage of the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> with <hi>Don Carlos</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and his Majesties Sister with the Monsieur of
<hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King, during the Treaty, continued
upon the Frontiers, where he received the first
news of the Death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
His Majesty forthwith dispatcht the Earl of
<hi>Randan</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to congratulate
with her Majesty her Assumption to the
Crown; she received him honourably, her
affairs were in so ill a posture at that time, she
was not a little satisfied, that so great a Prince
was pleased to pay his first respects to her. The
Court discoursed she was well read in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and the merit
of those that had the honour to compose it.
But for none she seemed to express so great a
value, as the Duke of <hi>Nemours;</hi> she was
pleased to speak with that Honour of this
Prince, that the Ambassadour upon his return,
took the Liberty to declare, he thought no
Person more valuable in her esteem, than
the Duke. And did not question upon his
addresses, the Queen might do him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to entertain a Passion for him. The King
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53905:8"/>
the same Evening communicated it to the
Prince, where he commanded the Count <hi>de
Randan,</hi> to give him the Relation; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Duke in the respect the Queen had for
him: which he was pleased to conclude with
his advice, not to neglect the favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
that seemed to court him to so much
happiness. The Duke received it at first, as
a piece of raillery, till his Majesty was pleas'd
to undeceive him. <hi>If, Sir,</hi> (says the Duke)
<hi>in obedience to your Majesties commands, and
for your service, I shall embark my self upon so
extravagant a design, as to presume a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
(whom I have never yet had the honour to
know) should admit me to her Royal Bed, I hope
your Majesty will be pleased not to divulge the
vanity of the attempt, till the success may justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
me to the Publick.</hi> The King was pleas'd
to give him his Royal word, that he would
depose it in the knowledge of no other Breast,
but the Constable's, concluding with the
Duke, that Secresie might facilitate the design:
The Count advised the Duke to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for <hi>England,</hi> which he refused, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't
Monsieur <hi>Lignerolle,</hi> a sprightly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
his Favourite, to sound the Queens
inclinations, and to endeavour to fix some
obligation upon her. In the interim he takes
a Journey for <hi>Bruxells,</hi> to give a visit to the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was there with the King
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53905:9"/>
of <hi>Spain.</hi> The death of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> gave
several difficulties to the Treaty, which about
the end of <hi>November</hi> broke up, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last there broke forth a Beauty in the
Court which drew all its Eyes upon her, and
I cannot without injustice rank her amongst
the indifferent, that could purchase such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
in a place that was so richly stored.
She was of the Family of the Viscount <hi>de
Chartres,</hi> and one of the greatest Heiresses of
<hi>France.</hi> She had the misfortune to bury her
Father in her infancy, by which unhappy
accident, she was left to the Guardianship of
Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> her Mother. She was
a Lady of those great Accomplishments, that
Fortune, Vertue, and Merit seem'd to have
conspired to compleat her fair model. After
her Husbands death, she had for some years
made her recess from Court. During her
retirement, she was not wanting to give her
Daughter an Education suitable to her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in which she did not so much labour to
improve her Person as her better part, which
she endeavour'd to embellish with Vertue,
which renders a Lady truly noble. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Mothers imagin it sufficient to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to discourse of the vanity of Love; left
their Children should be invited to stray out
of the paths of Vertue. Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53905:9"/>
was of a contrary opinion. She was pleased
to paint out love to her Daughter in all its
shapes, that she might be the better able to
discern that part of her which might be the
most dangerous. She informs her of the
little Sincerity and Candor there is in Man.
Their Devices, their Infidelity, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
Discontents Marriage often plunges
those into, that alter their condition. On the
other side she declares the Happiness and
Tranquility that attends a Vertuous Wife;
and what Luster and Esteem Piety in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Birth and Beauty may purchase her.
And concludes in acquainting her with the
difficulty to preserve it; which cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
secured than by a diffidence in our selves,
and a serious application to those things that
can best contribute to our happiness, which
is to love our Husbands, and to merit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>This Lady was at that time one of the
greatest Matches of <hi>France;</hi> and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
she was but in her greener years, she
wanted not her choice of Proposals. Madam
<hi>de Chartres,</hi> who was an ambitious Lady,
scarce thought the noblest worthy her consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
She having now arrived to the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
year of her Age, she brought her to
Court. The first that paid his respects to her,
upon her arrival, was the Viscount, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53905:10"/>
was not a little surprised, and you cannot
blame him, at the Beauty of the fair Lady.
The delicacy of her Meen, (in which <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Lancaster</hi> seem'd to have contended which of
the two should be the most prodigal of his
Charms) was the Subject of his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Day following, the young Lady went
to a famous <hi>Italian</hi> to purchase a Set of
Jewels. This Gentleman came along with
the Queen from <hi>Florence;</hi> and he had raised
himself to that prodigious wealth by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
that his House appeared rather to be
the Palace of a Prince, than the Being of a
Merchant. When she was there, in comes
the Prince of <hi>Cleve:</hi> He was so transported
at the sight of this young Lady, that he could
not dissemble his surprise. Madam <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi>
could not forbear to answer the Princes
discomposure with a blush; after she had a
little composed her self, she pays her civility
to the Prince, suitable to the Character she
apprehended he might bear. The Prince
beheld her with admiration; but he was not
able to judge who this Lady should be, having
never had the honour to see her before. He
perceived by her Person, and the numerous
Retinue that waited on her, that she must be
of eminent Quality. Her youth perswaded
him she might be a Maid, but seeing no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53905:10"/>
with her, and the <hi>Italian</hi> giving her the
Title of Madam, he knew not what to think.
She seemed to receive his Addresses with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
more than usual with young Ladies,
who take no small vanity in the impression
their Beauty may happily make upon a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The Prince's applications to her, gave
her some impatience to retire; which she
suddenly did: Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was pleas'd,
notwithstanding her absence, to solace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with the hopes to have the happiness to
retrieve her again, when he should know who
she was. But upon the question put to the
<hi>Italian,</hi> he could receive no satisfaction: He
was notwithstanding so strangely captivated
with her Beauty, and that Grace and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that attended it, that from that moment
he entertained a passion for her that was not
ordinary. In the Evening he went to kiss
the Hands of his Majesties Sister.</p>
            <p>The Princess was a Lady of great value,
for the interest she had in the King, which
was so powerful with him, that his Majesty,
upon the Peace, was pleased to restore <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for her sake.
And notwithstanding she had a disposition to
marry, yet her Ambition would never stoop
to any thing below a Soveraign; which was
the reason she refused the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
when he was Duke of <hi>Vendome.</hi> The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53905:11"/>
at <hi>Nice,</hi> between <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and
<hi>Paul</hi> the third, gave birth to her inclinations
for the <hi>Savoyard;</hi> she was a person of great
Ingenuity, and a great Judge of the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
so that her Apartment was the Theatre
of the Virtuoso's and the Court was pleased
to spend some hours there for its Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Cleve</hi> was of the number of
the Visitants: He was so swell'd with the
admiration of young Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi>
that he could discourse upon no other Subject.
He made a publick Narrative of his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and could not forbear to be lavish of
his praises of the Lady (though <hi>incognita.</hi>)
Madam—was pleased to tell him, that she
believed there was no such Creature in being;
for if there were she must needs be known.
Madam <hi>Dampier,</hi> one of the Princesses La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Honour, and an Intimate of Madam
<hi>de Chartres,</hi> took the liberty to whisper her
Highness in the Ear, that it might be young
Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> whom the Prince had
seen: Madam—turning to the Prince,
told him, if he would afford her his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the day following, she would endeavour
to give him a sight of the fair Lady he seem'd
to have so great a passion for. The next day
the young Lady came; she had so obliging a
reception from both Queens, that it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53905:11"/>
demonstrated the value they had for
her; neither were there wanting to attend
it, both the admiration, and the praise of
the whole Court: She received their Grace
and Favour with so sweet a modesty, 'twas
hard to distinguish whether she seem'd to take
notice of them or value them most. This
young Lady was pleased to put her self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Madam's Train. The Princess, after
she had given a fair Character of her person,
could not forbear to acquaint her with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
it had made upon the Prince of
<hi>Cleve;</hi> she had no sooner concluded, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Prince. <hi>Come hither</hi> (says Madam)
<hi>behold I have made good my word to you, and
satisfie me, if in presenting Madam</hi> de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
<hi>to you, I have not given you a sight of the
fair Lady you are in quest of; I expect your
thanks for shewing you a Lesson by which you may
learn the more to admire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince was overjoyed when he found
the Lady, for whom he had so great a passion,
was of a Quality adequate with her Person.
He made his Addresses to her, and humbly
begg'd she would vouchsafe to remember he
was the first that laid his Heart at her Feet,
and before he had the happiness to be known
to her, he had an honour and respect for her
suitable to her merit.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Prince,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53905:12"/>
two bossome Friends, took their leave of
Madam together. They were no sooner out
but they began a fresh to lance forth into the
admiration of this fair Lady. At last, having
wasted their stock of praise, they were forc'd
to take up. The whole day following they
gave themselves the loose Rein again: This
fresh beauty continued a long subject for the
Courts discourse. The Queen was pleased to
ranck her self amongst the number of her
admirers, which she sufficiently evidenc'd by
the kindness she was pleased to shew her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dauphin</hi>-Queen made her her Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
laying her Commands upon Madam <hi>de
Chartres,</hi> her Mother, that she should often
make her visits to her: And the Princesses,
the Kings Daughters, to declare the Honour
they had for her, there was not any Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
they thought worthy their Royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
in which they made her not a sharer.
In fine, she had purchas'd all the Hearts of the
Court, except that of Madam the <hi>Valentinois:</hi>
not that this young Lady gave her any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
too long an Experience had confirmed
her, that she was not to be supplanted. She
had so great an inveteracy against the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<hi>de Chartres,</hi> that she wisht she could
intail it upon him by a Marriage with one
of her Daughters. She had already possest
the Queen, that she could not look kindly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53905:12"/>
upon a person that bore his Name, nor any
for whom he had a kindness.</p>
            <p>The Prince became a passionate admirer of
Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> and pursued his sute
with all the Zeal imaginable; but he fear'd
the haughtiness of Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> her
Mother, would never dispense with her
Daughters marriage with a Gentleman that
was not the head of his Family. This House
was yet so noble, that the Count <hi>d' Eu,</hi> who
was its Capital, had the honour to marry
with a Lady that was nearly related to the
Blood Royal. So that this seem'd rather the
timidity of Love, than any just subject for his
Jealousie: He had several Rivals: The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>de Guise,</hi> whose Birth, Merit, and the
Luster the Royal Favour gave him, rendered
him the most considerable. This Princes
heart became her Prisoner also at the first
sight. These two had discovered each others
passion. The distance pretensions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
create in Rivals, had interrupted their
usual Conversation: Their friendship began
to grow chill, and they had scarce the power
to disguise their several Resentments: The
happiness the Prince of <hi>Cleve</hi> had to be her
first admirer, appeared to be no ill presage; it
seem'd to give him some advantage over the
rest: The Duke was strongly leagued with
the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois;</hi> she was a mortla
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53905:13"/>
Enemy to the Viscount, and this was a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reason to divert the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi>
consent to the marriage of his Son with a Neece
of his.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> who had applyed
her self with so much zeal to infuse Virtue
into her Daughter, was not wanting to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
it here, where it was so necessary, and
where there were so many dangerous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Ambition and Gallantry were the soul
of this Court; they had equally diffused
themselves amongst both Sexes. There were
so many several Interests, and different Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
in which the Women bore a part, that
Affairs seem'd to mix with Love, and Love
with business. No man must be impartial or
indifferent: Their thoughts were either taken
up how to rise, to please, to serve, or to
offend: They knew not what it was to be
dull or lazy: They were either diverted with
Pleasures or Intrigues: The Ladies studied
how they might rivet themselves into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Queen, the Dauphin Queen, the
Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> Madam the Kings Sister,
or the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois;</hi> their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
their Deportment, and their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
made their Applications different.
Those, who had taken leave of their youth,
to embrace an austerer retirement, made their
addresses to her Majesty; those that had not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53905:13"/>
yet divested themselves of their aiery spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
to the Dauphin-Queen. The Queen
of <hi>Navarre</hi> wanted not her Favourites also,
she was young, and had a power over the
King her Husband, whose interest was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
in the same bottom with the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which gave him a Vogue. The beauty
of Madam, the Kings Sister, was a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
that had not lost its virtue; she attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also on her side her number of Admirers.
The Duchess of <hi>Valentinois</hi> received none
both those she thought worthy her regard;
few were welcome to her, and only such,
with whom she could converse with freedom
and confidence, and who sympathized with
her humour; she took a vanity to see her
Court could in its Luster rival with the
Queens: The different Cabals, had their
several emulations and envy; neither were
the Ladies that composed them exempted
from their jealousies either for their Love or
Favour. The interest of greatness, and the
ambition to rise, sometimes vouchsafed to
interfere with concerns of little importance.
There were some motions in this Court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disorder, which rendered it graceful,
though dangerous to youth. Madam <hi>de
Chartres</hi> was sensible of the peril, and made
it her care to find out an expedient to divert
her Daughter from it. She desired her, not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53905:14"/>
as a Mother, but a Friend, that she would
impart to her all the little Gallantries she could
meet withal, promising her in return to afford
her her conduct to carry her through all those
difficulties which imbarrass youth.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier of <hi>Guise</hi> had so far divulged
his affection for this Lady, that none could
pretend to be ignorant of it; but he finds
the way to compass her was not so even, but
there were some Rubs he might unlickily
stumble at: He was sensible that the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Fortune, which was not able to
support the honour of his quality, could not
render him so agreeable to this Lady, as the
Persons that were considerable; and he was
farther conscious to himself, that his Friends
would never consent to this Match, when
they considered, that the marriage of younger
Brothers must needs debate great Families.
The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> soon took an occasion
to undeceive him; he was pleased to express
his resentment, and that with no little heat
neither: He would rather have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to any other allyance than that with
the Viscount; and he did so far publish his
antipathy against it, that Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi>
was sensibly offended at it. She made it her
care to convince the Cardinal that it was not
her intention. The Viscount followed her
example, but seemed more to resent the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53905:14"/>
carriage, being sensible of the cause.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Cleve</hi> was not backward to
make known his passion to the World, as well
as the Chevalier <hi>de Guise</hi> had done before him.
The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> received the news of
this address, not without some tokens that
discovered how unwelcome it was to him.
He thought to remind his Son but of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
would oblige him to alter his inclination;
but he was mistaken, his Son had fixt so
strong a resolution upon this Match, no admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
could make any impression on him:
He condemns the design, and was so far
transported with passion at it, that his disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at last reach'd the knowledge of the
Court, and amongst the rest that of Madam
<hi>de Chartres;</hi> she doubted not but that the
Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> would not think this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
sufficiently advantagious for his Son; but
on the other side she could not forbear to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the Houses of <hi>Cleve</hi> and <hi>Guise</hi> should
rather seem to fear than covet her allyance.
The indignation she conceived at this affront,
put her upon a resolution to find out a person
that might exalt her Daughter above those
that thought her so much below them. After
she had consulted her thoughts, she fixes upon
the Prince Dauphin, Son to the Duke of
<hi>Montpensier.</hi> This was a Gentleman that held
one of the primest Ranks in the Court. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53905:15"/>
               <hi>de Chartres</hi> was a Lady of parts; she
was assisted by the Viscount, who was a person
of great abilities, and her Daughter a Lady
considerable. She managed her design with
that dexterity and success, and Monsieur had so
far embrac'd the motion, she seem'd almost
to have surmounted all its difficulties.</p>
            <p>The Viscount, knowing the power the
Dauphin Queen had over Monsieur <hi>de Anvile,</hi>
thought it not amiss to imploy the interest of
that Princess to engage him to serve <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle
d' Chartres,</hi> both with his Majesty and
the Prince of <hi>Montpensier,</hi> whose intimate
friend he was. Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> imparts
it to her Majesty; she was pleased to receive
it with a great deal of content and satisfaction,
when she understood it would contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the advancement of a person she had
so great a kindness for. She assured the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that notwithstanding she was sensible
it might disoblige the Cardinal her Uncle,
she was yet resolved to make good her Royal
Promise. Upon this just provocation, that
she observed, the Cardinal seem'd daily to be
more inclinable to the interest of the Queen
than hers.</p>
            <p>Persons, that are truly honourable, think
themselves happy in any opportunity that can
enable them to serve their Friends. The
Viscount had no sooner taken his leave, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53905:15"/>
she immediately dispatches Monsieur <hi>Castelart,</hi>
a Favourite of Monsieur <hi>de Anvile,</hi> and who
was privy to the passion he had for her, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
to him, that she expected him that night
at Court. <hi>Castelart</hi> received her commands
with joy and respect. This Gentleman was
of a good Family in the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> but had
a Soul and Spirit too great for his Birth: He
was well received by all the Grandees of the
Court; and the intimacy that was between
the Families of <hi>Montmorency</hi> and <hi>de Anvile,</hi>
had its Birth from him. He was a person well
accomplish'd, and graceful in his Actions:
In Musick and Poetry he did not the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel:
He had a humour so sweet and debonaire,
and it had so far indeared him in the esteem
of Monsieur <hi>de Anvile,</hi> that he made him
the Confident of his Amours, between the
Dauphin-Queen and him. This Confidence
recommended him to this Princess; and here
it was, by his often visits, that she took up
that unfortunate passion for him, that in the
end robb'd her both of her reason and her
life.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Anvile</hi> failed not to obey her
Majesties Commands; he thought himself
happy that Madam <hi>le Dauphin</hi> had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to impose the thing upon him he so
much coveted. He gave her Majesty his
word to serve her in it. Madam <hi>de Valentinois,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53905:16"/>
having discovered the design, was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to throw all the Rubs imaginable in the
way. She had so prepossest the King, that
when Monsieur <hi>de Anvile</hi> came to speak to
him in it, he was pleased to let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how little he approved of it. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him to signifie as much to the Prince
of <hi>Montpensier.</hi> You may easily judge how
poor Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> resented this sudden
Rupture, whose unfortunate success gave so
great an advantage to her Enemies, and so
much prejudice to her Daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Dauphin Queen was pleased to declare
to Madam</hi> de Chartres <hi>the discontent she had
that she could not serve her.</hi> You see Madam,
<hi>(says the Queen)</hi> that my Interest is but small.
I stand upon so ill terms with the Queen and
Madam <hi>Valentinois,</hi> that it is no wonder that
either they or their Dependents endeavour to
disappoint all my desires. I have made it my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to please them: 'Tis true, they hate
me not for my own sake, but my Mothers;
she has formerly given them some jealousie and
disquiet: The King had his passions before he
fixt them on the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois;</hi> and
in the first years of his Marriage, when he
had no Issue, and notwithstanding he loved the
Duchess, he was almost resolved to be divorc'd
from the Queen, to make room for the Queen
my Mother. Madam <hi>de Valentinois,</hi> who
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53905:16"/>
was jealous of a Lady whom he had formerly
loved, whose Wit and Beauty were able to lessen
her favour, joyns her interest with that of the
Constable, who never wisht it (as well as she) that
his Majesty should marry with the Sister of the
Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi> They possest his Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
with their Sentiments; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he mortally hated the Duchess of
<hi>Valentinois,</hi> and loved the Queen, yet he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
with them in the prevention of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.
But to divert all his thoughts of my
Mother, they married her into <hi>Scotland:</hi>
They did it as being nearest a Conclusion; by
which means they disappointed the King of
<hi>England,</hi> who the most coveted it. This preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation
of theirs had like to have made a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
between the two Crowns: <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth was unsatisfied that he was disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Queen my Mother, or some other
<hi>French</hi> Princess they had propounded to him:
He has been heard to say, that the Worth and
Beauty of this Lady was so firmly riveted in
his Royal heart, the fairest of the Sex must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
ever to remove it thence. 'Tis true, the
Queen my Mother was a great, but an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
Beauty; and that which rendered it the
more remarkable, was, That the Widow of
the Duke of <hi>Longuevile,</hi> had been the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of three Crowns; but her unhappy Fate
had appointed her the meanest Lot. She had
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53905:17"/>
plac'd her in a Kingdom where she converst
with nothing but misery and trouble: They are
pleased to say that I resemble her, but I fear in
nothing but her unhappy destiny; for what good
fortune has prepared for me; I have not faith to
believe I shall enjoy. Mademoiselle de Charters
<hi>was pleased to reply to the Queen, that these
sad sentiments were ill grounded, that she
must not two long dwell upon them, but
that she ought to hope that it would one day
answer its appearances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man durst farther pursue the thoughts
of Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> either fearing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
his Majesties displeasure, or despairing of
success in the Affair a Prince of the Blood has
miscarried in. The death of the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> his Father, which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
gave him an intire liberty to gratifie
his own inclinations; for as soon as he could
with modesty dispence with his appearance
in publick, he was resolved to resign up all
his thoughts towards the accomplishment of
this Marriage. He thought himself happy
that he could make his Proposals, in a season
that had given opportunities of disincourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to others, and some assurance to himself.
But that which discomposed his Joy, was,
that he feared that his Person had not Merit
enough to recommend him to her; and he
was resolved to prefer her happiness before
his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:53905:17"/>The Chevalier of <hi>Guise</hi> had given him
some jealousie; but when he considered that
it was rather grounded upon the Merit of that
Prince, than any Action of <hi>Mademoiselle de
Chartres,</hi> he resolved to endeavour to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if he were so happy but to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she was pleased to allow the passion he
had for her: He had not the happiness to see
her but in the Queens Apartment, or some
publick place; so that he found it difficult to
have the liberty of a free conversation. At
last he found out the means; he discovered
to her his design, and the passion that obliged
him first to take it up. He prest her to let
him have the happiness to know her Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of him; assuring her, that those he
had for her were of that nature, they would
render him eternally miserable, if she was
resolved wholly to resign up her obedience
to her Mothers Will.</p>
            <p>The young Lady had a generous Soul, she
was sensibly touch'd with the passion of the
Prince of <hi>Cleve:</hi> This acknowledgment ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so great a sweetness to her Words and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
that it gave him hopes, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to flatter himself with the success he so
much wisht for.</p>
            <p>She gave an account of it to her Mother,
Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> was pleased to tell her,
that there was that Grandeur and Worth in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53905:18"/>
that Prince, and he demonstrated that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and discretion in all his actions, that in
case she had an inclination for him, she should
not want her consent. <hi>Mademoiselle de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi>
answered her Mother, that she was of
the number of the admirers of his eminent
qualities, that she could marry him with less
reluctancy than another, but confest the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
she had for him was not singular.</p>
            <p>The day following the Prince signified his
intentions to Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> she was
pleased to consent, and told him she did not
doubt but that she gave her Daughter a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
that would love her when she bestowed
her upon him: the Articles were concluded, the
King acquainted, and the Match made publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prince of</hi> Cleve <hi>thought himself hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
but not content; it troubled him to see
that the sentiments of</hi> Mademoiselle de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
<hi>were no other than the common returns
due to civility and respect: He had not (as it is
usual with the enamoured) the vanity to
flatter himself, that she might have reserved
the more obliging for a better season. He
only considers the terms upon which he stands
with her, and thinks they may justly dispence
with the liberty to discover them, without
prejudice to her modesty. Within few days
he finds an opportunity to acquaint her with
his resentment.</hi> Is it possible <hi>(says the Prince)</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53905:18"/>
I may be once so happy as to be yours; at present
I cannot presume to think my self so fortunate;
you are pleased to treat me with a sort of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it neither gives me satisfaction nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
I cannot discover those convincing passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of impatience, disquiet, or disorder, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
a Lover's staggering Faith: You seem to
be as insensible of my Love, as you would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
his, whose Affection's only grounded upon
the advantages of your Fortune, not you Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
You will think it some injustice <hi>(replies
Mademoiselle de Chartres)</hi> should I chide you
now; I know not what further proofs you can
desire to receive, or me to give, than those I have
already done. Methinks you should believe as
well as I, my modesty ought to allow no greater.
I own it <hi>(says the Prince)</hi> that you are pleased
to give me some little Symptomes with which I
could rest satisfied, would greater but ensue:
But in lieu of those, you are pleased to interpose
a coyness, which prompts you to this cruelty: I
have not the happiness to make any impression,
either upon your Inclination or your Heart; and
my Company seems to be indifferently divided
between your trouble and content. You ought
not to question it, <hi>(replies Mademoiselle de
Chartres)</hi> those often blushes I cannot hide from
you, ought to be a sufficient Evidence of the
value I have set upon it. As for your blushes,
Madam, <hi>(says the Prince)</hi> they surprise me
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53905:19"/>
not, they are but modesties bashful discoverers,
not the hearts; but I assure you, I shall presume
to take no other advantage by them than what
I justly may.</p>
            <p>The young Lady was non-plust, she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not the distinctions the Prince had made.
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> on the otherside, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too well how far she was estranged from
any sentiment to his satisfaction. His passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was so unhappy, it could make no alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in her.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier of <hi>Guise</hi> return'd from a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
some few days before the Wedding; he,
having been made sensible of those insuperable
difficulties that attended his design upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiselle
de Chartres,</hi> resolved to flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
no longer with the vanity of any success
in it; yet at the same time he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to be sensibly toucht to see her in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Arms. His regret was so far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing
his passion, it rather enflamed it
more. <hi>Mademoiselle de Chartres</hi> was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the respect this Prince had for her;
he could not forbear at his return to let her
know she was the unhappy subject of his
torment, though he knew she was a person of
that worth and honour, she could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to make him miserable without some
pity for him, which he believed she could
scarce avoid, though he was conscious to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53905:19"/>
himself, her compassion could prompt him no
other thoughts, but that he was so. She could
not conceal from Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the trouble this Prince's passion gave
her: Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> admired (and that
justly too) the vertue of her Daughter, for never
Lady had either a greater or a more natural;
but her admiration did not exceed her wonder,
that the passion of the Prince of <hi>Cleve</hi> could
make no deeper an impression in her, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
seem'd to do. This made Madam <hi>de
Chartres</hi> the more zealous to endear her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to her, that she might make her sensible
what returns she ought to make the affection
he had for her, even when he knew her not;
and to the passion he had since declared, in
preferring her before the whole number of
her Sex, and that when no other durst har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
a thought for her.</p>
            <p>This Marriage was solemnized at the
<hi>Louvre;</hi> at night his Majesty and the two
Queens, attended with the whole Court,
were pleased to take a Treat from Madam <hi>de
Chartres.</hi> I need not tell you, its splendor
and magnificence was proportioned to the
honour of their Royal Guests. The Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
of <hi>Guise</hi> durst as little venture to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
himself from the rest, as not to afford
his assistance at the Ceremony. But, alas, he
could so little disguise his trouble and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53905:20"/>
it fell under the notice of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> discovered, that <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle
de Chartres</hi> had not changed her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
with her name. He was sensible the
quality of a Husband had given him the
greater priviledge, but not the greater place
in his Ladies heart. This obliged him (though
a Husband) to treat her as a Servant, for he
still seem'd to wish for something beyond the
bare enjoyment of her: And though he
seem'd to live perfectly contented, yet he
could not think himself intirely happy with
her. The passion he had for her was so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and troublesome, it disturbed his joy;
though he was yet happy in this, that his
jealousie had no share in his disquiet. Never
was Husband so far from taking, nor Wife
so far from giving it. Notwithstanding she
visited the Courts of both the Queens, and
that of Madam: where, and at her Brother-in-law's,
the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> whose House
was the general Rendezvous, she was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the admiration of all the brisk and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Youth of the Town: She had a Meen
that created her so great a respect, and which
seem'd so much a stranger to all manner of
Courtship, that the Marshal of St. <hi>Andre,</hi>
who had a passion for her, (notwithstanding
he was the most confident, and indeed the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53905:20"/>
best propt with his Majesties Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour)
durst not presume to shew it farther
than by his services. Many others lay under
the same unhappiness; for Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi>
had added to her Daughters discretion, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
a conduct in all her Actions and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that she convinc'd the Court, that that
young Lady had a Soul so vertuous, it would
allow of no ill tincture.</p>
            <p>The Duchess of <hi>Lorain,</hi> as she was pleased
to imploy her interest for the conclusion of
this peace, she was not wanting to contribute
her endeavours for the advantage of her Son.
There was a Marriage concluded between
him and Madam <hi>Claude,</hi> the Kings second
Daughter, and the Month of <hi>February</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Nuptials.</p>
            <p>In the interim the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> stays
at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> wholly taken up with his great
design for <hi>England,</hi> Dispatches, and Couri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
pass and re-pass daily; his hopes begin
more and more to swell upon him. In fine,
Monsieur <hi>Lignerolles</hi> advises him, it was now
time that his presence should endeavour to
accomplish the thing he had so happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun:
He received the news with all the joy
a young ambitious Soul was capable of, that
saw himself so nigh being handed up into a
Throne upon his single Merit. His Heart
was so immoveably fixt upon the Grandeur
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53905:21"/>
of this Fortune, that he would not as much
as vouchsafe to allow a thought towards the
difficulties that might interpose between it and
him.</p>
            <p>He sends immediately to <hi>Paris</hi> his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Orders for a splendid Equipage, that he
might appear in the Court of <hi>England</hi> in
luster suitable to the greatness of his design.
Not long after he follows himself, that he
might have the honour to be present at the
Wedding of the Duke of <hi>Lorain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He came the day before, and as soon as he
arrived, he went to pay his respects to the
King, to give him an account of this Affair,
and receive his Majesties order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
how to govern himself in it; he went
also to wait upon her Majesty; Madam <hi>Cleve</hi>
not being there, she had not the happiness
either to see him or to know of his arrival.
Report (which had been in every persons
mouth, so lavish of his praises, as of one
who was the mirrour of the Court, both in
his merit and his person) had amongst the
rest reacht her Ear. Madam, the Dauphin,
had spoken of him at that rate, and so often
to her, she had enflamed the Princess of
<hi>Cleve's</hi> curiosity, even to a degree of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to have the honour to see him.</p>
            <p>She imployed the Wedding-day in dressing
her self to her advantage, that she might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53905:21"/>
with the greater Luster at the Royal Ball
and Banquet that was to be made that Night
at the <hi>Louvre:</hi> When she came in, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
paid their usual admiration to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and her habit; the Ball began, and as
she was dancing with Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> there
was a noise heard at the Door which seem'd
to make room for the entrance of some great
person. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was just disengaged
from the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and was casting her
Eye about the noble Company, where to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
out one to supply his place, when the
King was pleased to oblige her to take him
that came in last; she turned upon him, and
beheld his person, which at first sight she
knew to be Monsieur <hi>de Nemours;</hi> he was
forc'd to walk over some Chairs before he
came to her. This Prince was cast in so fair
a Mold, that 'twas impossible not to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
with it at the first sight: The industry
he had used to set himself forth, very much
contributed to the gracefulness of his person;
and 'twas as hard to look on Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
without an equal admiration.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was so strangely cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
with her Beauty, that upon his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to her, and the return she paid the
respects he gave her, he could not forbear to
shew some tokens of his admiration; a soft
murmur of praises stole through the whole
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53905:22"/>
Company; the King and the two Queens
were all surprised, and their wonder was not
small, to see two persons dance with that
grace and franckness together, and yet were
strangers to each other. They had no sooner
done, but they were called; were they
were pleased to ask them if they had not a
reciprocal ambition to know each of other. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
for may part</hi> (says the Duke of <hi>Nemours)
I am satisfied; but if Madam</hi> de Cleve <hi>finds
not these fair Marks about me, as I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in her, to know her by, I be seech your
Majesty to do me the honour to inform her. I
believe</hi> (says Madam <hi>le Dauphin) you can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
as well as he. I assure you Madam</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
Madam <hi>deCleve) who seem'd to be a little
di sordered, I am not so good a Prophet as you are
pleased to think me. You guess well</hi> (says Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>la Dauphin) you have certainly some regard
more than ordinary for the Prince, that you are
not pleased to acknowledge that you can guess
as well at him as he has done at you.</hi> The
Queen was pleased to interrupt their disoourse
for the advantage of the Ball; Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> took out the Dauphin-Queen; this
Princess was a perfect Beauty, and such she
did appear in the Prince's Eye before his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> yet for all this he could not
but allow the whole night to the admiration
of this Lady.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53905:22"/>The Chevalier of <hi>Guise</hi> that did yet adore
her, sat at her Feet; there was not the least
thing past there which gave him not some
disquiet. He look'd upon it as ominous, that
Fortune should destine Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
to have a passion for Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> he
could scarce disguise his regret from being
discovered in his looks, and was as little able
to restrain his jealousie from reflections upon
her Honour. He thought she might be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
toucht with the merit of this Prince;
and he could not forbear to let her know, that
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was a happy man, that
could recommend himself to her knowledge
by an adventure, which, with so much
gracefulness and gallantry, had initiated him
into her acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> returns home swell'd
with the entertainment she had received at
Court; and, notwithstanding 'twas late, she
took the liberty to disturb her Mother, to
give her the Relation of it. She was pleased
to speak of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> with a
Countenance, that gave Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi>
the same jealousie the Chevalier <hi>de Guise</hi> had
entertain'd before.</p>
            <p>The day following the Ceremony of the
Nuptials was performed. There she saw him
with those advantages of Person and Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that they added to her former surprise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53905:23"/>The day after she saw him at the Dauphin-Queens,
she saw him play a set at Tennis
with the King, she saw him run at the Ring,
and she heard him discourse; but she obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he so far surpast all the rest, that he
ingrost the whole Company to himself, by
the gracefulness of his person and the brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his wit; this in a short time made no
small impression in her.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that Monsieur <hi>Nemours</hi> had an
inclination for her equally violent with hers,
which gave him that sweetness and delight
that inspire desires to oblige. He endeavour'd
to render himself more lovely and amiable
than he was used to do; insomuch, that by
often interviews they did discover something
in each other that was the most accomplisht
in the Court, so that it was hard if they
should not delight infinitely in each other.</p>
            <p>The Duchess of <hi>Valentinois</hi> was the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of all parties; and the King had as
great a care and fondness of her, as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of his passion: Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> that
was in an Age which thinks Women no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
amiable than under the years of five and
twenty, was not a little surprised at the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
his Majesty was still pleased to have for
the Duchess, who was a Grand-mother, and
now designing the Marriage of her youngest
Daughter: Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> did often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53905:23"/>
with her Mother of this Subject.
<q>How is it possible, (says she) Madam, that
his Majesty should yet retain a passion for the
Duchess; 'tis strange that he should fix his
Heart upon a Lady superior to him in years,
who has been the Mistress of his Father,
and, (if we may presume to credit report)
of others too. 'Tis true, (replies Madam <hi>de
Chartres</hi>) 'twas neither the Merit, nor yet
the Constancy of Madam <hi>de Valentinois,</hi> that
gave birth to his Majesties passion, nor yet
conserves it; and 'tis in this his Majesty is
the less excusable; for had this Lady had
Beauty, or Youth, suitable to her Birth, or
had she had so much worth as to have loved
no other, or that her love to his Majesty
had kept within the limits of Fidelity, or her
Affection had had no other regard than his
Royal Person, abstracted from the interest of
Grandeur and Fortune, and without imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that power but for things that were just
and honourable for the King, 'tis confest a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
could not (without some injustice) have
blamed the passion of this Prince. If I did
believe I should not lye under the unhappy
censure Women of my years undeservedly
do, which take pleasure to relate the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Age they dwell in. I would give
you the Relation of their Amours, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other intrigues of the Court of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53905:24"/>
King, which do not a little sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize
with those practicable at present. I
am far from those reflections (replyed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi>) that I am sorry, Madam,
that you have not been pleased to instruct
me in the present, and that you have not
learnt me the distinct Interests and Cabals
of the Court. I am so ill read in them,
that I believed there was not a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Constable was not in her Majesties
Favour. Your Opinion is infinitely remote
from the truth of it, (answers Madam <hi>de
Chartres</hi>) the Queen has a perfect Hatred for
the Constable, and if ever she has a power, he
will be sure both to know and feel it. She
is sensible that he has often informed the
King, that of all his Children, none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
him more than his natural ones. I
never suspected a misunderstanding here
(replies Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>) after I had been
an Eye-witness of the care her Majesty took
to solace him in his Confinement; the joy
she was pleased to express at his inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and especially after she had treated
him in the familiar phrase of Gossip with
the King. If you shall measure (says Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chartres</hi>) things by their appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
you will often lye under a mistake;
you must know, that Hearts and Tongues
keep here no correspence together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:53905:24"/>
               <q>Give me leave to assume my story of the
Duchess (says Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi>) and
proceed; You must understand that she is
called, <hi>The Diana of</hi> Poictiers; her Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is noble; she is descended from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Dukes of <hi>Acquitain;</hi> her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
was the Natural Son of <hi>Lewis</hi> the
Eleventh; in fine, her whole composition
is made up of greatness; her Father had
unfortunately engaged in the quarrel of the
Constable of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> of which you have
so often heard; he was condemned to lose
his Head, and in order to it was conducted
to the Scaffold; his Daughter, who had
a charming Beauty, and which had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
kindled a Flame in the Kings Breast,
interposed her interest, and obtained his
pardon. 'Twas brought him in the fatal
moment he expected the bloody stroke;
the fear and terror he lay under had so far
disordered his thoughts, he was not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his Majesties Grace and favour, so
that the day following put a period to his
life. His Daughter appeared at Court as
the Kings Mistress: the Expedition for <hi>Italy,</hi>
and the Kings Imprisonment, gave some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to this passion. After his Majesties
return from <hi>Spain,</hi> and that Madam the
Queen Regent went to meet him at <hi>Bayonne,</hi>
she took all her Daughters with her, amongst
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53905:25"/>
which number was <hi>Mademoiselle de Pisse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leu,</hi>
afterwards Duchess of <hi>d' Estampes.</hi>
The King saw her, and became her prize;
she was much inferiour, both in her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Wit, and Beauty, to Madam <hi>de Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>
and she had nothing but her youth to
recommend her to his Majesties favour: I
have often heard her say, that she was born
the same Day the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Poictiers</hi> was
married; but her mallice, not the truth,
obliged her to speak it: For, if I am not
mistaken, the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Monsieur <hi>de Breze,</hi> Grand-President of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> at the same time the King had
first a passion for Madam <hi>d' Estampes.</hi> There
was never a greater picque in Nature than
between these two Ladies: The Duchess of
<hi>Valentinois</hi> could not in her heart pardon
Madam <hi>de Estampes,</hi> notwithstanding she
had divested her of the Title of <hi>The Kings
Mistress,</hi> Madam <hi>de Estampes</hi> had an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracy
against the Duchess, because the
King still kept her company. This Prince
was not always constant to his Mistresses;
there was one, 'tis true, which wore the
Title and the Honour of it, but the Ladies
of the lesser Faction, as they stile them,
had the happiness sometimes to take their
turns in his favour. The death of the
Dauphin, who dyed at <hi>Tournon,</hi> and not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53905:25"/>
without a suspition of poyson, gave him no
small Disquiet: He had not that tenderness
and affection for his second Son, our present
King: He discovered not in him those incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to vigour and courage: He was
pleased to complain to Madam <hi>Valentinois,</hi>
and told her, he would endeavour to create
a passion in him for her, that she might infuse
into him something more noble and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
It had the success, you see, 'tis up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of twenty years this passion had its
Birth, and yet has stood the shock of all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and alterations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>His deceased Majesty endeavour'd to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it in its in fancy, and notwithstanding
he had a kindness for the Duchess, either
prompted by his jealousie, or Madam <hi>de
Estampes</hi> (who was now upon the point of
despair, seeing her Enemy in the Dauphin's
Arms) was pleased to look upon this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
with some indignation; of which he
was not wanting to give his symptomes;
his Son neither regarded his Anger nor his
Hatred; nothing could oblige him either
to lessen the value he had for her, nor yet
hide it: At last his Majesty was forc'd to
connive; the Dauphin's stubbornness much
abated of his Royal favour, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
in a greater measure upon the Duke
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> his third Son: He was a Prince
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53905:26"/>
on whom Nature had been lavish of her
Grace; but he was swelled with so much
heat and ambition, and of a spirit so fierce,
that it wanted a Curb. He had been a
Prince of great worth and honour, had his
Age been so kind as to have ripened his
understanding.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The quality the Dauphin held, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the King was pleased to shew the Duke
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> had created so great an envy
between them, it almost amounted to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of hatred: It took its being from their
infancy, and has continued to this day. The
Emperour, when he came through <hi>France,</hi>
gave the precedency to the Duke of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which so much incensed the Dauphin
that he would have obliged the Constable
to arrest him without his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
The Constable durst not obey; the
King blamed him that he took not his Sons
advice, and when he bannisht him the
Court, his reasons for it wanted not their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Interpreters.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The difference between these two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gave fresh thoughts to the Duchess
<hi>de Estampes,</hi> to endeavour to prop her self
with the interest of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>
against the Duchess: It had its success:
This Prince, without having the least pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for her, did as zealously espouse her
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53905:26"/>
quarrel, as the Dauphin had done the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess.
This created two Cabals in the
Court, such as you may easily imagine.
These Intrigues were not limited within the
management of the weaker Sex.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Emperour who had a great respect
for the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> had often offer'd
him the Duchy of <hi>Millan;</hi> and in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Peace that was afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
he gave him the hopes of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
Provinces, and his Daughter in
marriage with them: The Dauphin neither
inclined to the Match nor it; he employ'd
the Constable, whom he ever lov'd, to
make the King sensible of what importance
it would be, to leave his Successor a Brother
so powerful as the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> must be
with the advantage of the Imperial Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and these Countries. The Constable
yielded more easily to the Dauphins design,
in that it was opposite to that of Madam
<hi>d' Estampes,</hi> who was his declared Enemy,
and who so passionately desired the Dukes
advancement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Dauphin at that time commanded
his Majesties Army in <hi>Champagne,</hi> and
had reduc'd that of the Empire to those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
he had certainly ruin'd it, if the
Duchess <hi>d' Estampes</hi> (fearing these great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
might retard the Peace and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53905:27"/>
of the Dukes Allyance with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour)
had not advis'd the Enemy to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
<hi>Espernay,</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Rierry,</hi>
which was their Magazine; they attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, and succeeded, by which means they
preserved the Army.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This Duchess did not long enjoy the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of her Treason: Immediately after dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> at <hi>Farmoutiers</hi> of a
contagious disease. He was enamoured
with one of the greatest Beauties of the
Court, who was pleased to entertain the
flame. I shall forbear to name her, for she
has since lived under so close a retirement,
and has with so much prudence disguised
the passion she had for him, we ought in
justice to be tender of her honour. The
death of her Husband and the Duke bore
even date together, which gave her the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to shew those open marks of her grief
and sorrow, which otherwise she had been
enforc'd to hide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The King did not long survive the Prince
his Son, for he dyed within two years after.
He recommends to the Dauphin the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and the Admiral <hi>d' Annebault,</hi>
without the least mention of the Constable,
whom he had confined to <hi>Chantilly;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his Fathers commands, he calls
him home, and makes him the grand Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53905:27"/>
               <q>Madam <hi>d' Estampes</hi> was discarded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all the ill Treatment she could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from so powerful and inveterate an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
The Duchess of <hi>Valentinois</hi> was
not satisfied till she had glutted her self with
her revenge upon this Duchess, and the rest
who had faln under her displeasure. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
has been more absolute over the King
since he came to the Crown, than when he
was the Dauphin. These twelve years since
he has reign'd she has been the uncontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mistress of all his Actions, she has had
the disposal of all Governments and Affairs,
she has obliged him to bannish the Cardinal
of <hi>Tournon,</hi> the Chancellour, and <hi>Villeray;</hi>
all that have endeavour'd to eclypse her
power have perisht in the attempt. The
Count <hi>de Taix,</hi> Grand Master of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
who had no kindness for her, taking
the liberty to reflect upon her Gallants, and
particularly the Count <hi>de Brissac,</hi> of whom
the King had a jealousie, she so subtilly
plaid her Cards, that he was in disgrace
and divested of his emply: and what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the thing more strange, she procured
it for the Count <hi>de Brissac,</hi> who by her means
had the honour to be since created a Marshal
of <hi>France.</hi> The Kings jealousie began to
swell to that degree in him, he could no
longer endure the test of it: but that which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53905:28"/>
in another would have appeared more sharp
and violent, was strangely corrected in him,
by the great respect he had for this Lady;
In so much that he durst not (if we may
presume to use this saucy Dialect with a
Prince) remove his Rival, but under the
pretence of preferring him to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> He has lived there se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years, and only return'd this last Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
under a pretext of recruiting the
Troops under his command; and for other
necessary supplies for the Army. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to see the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois,</hi>
and the fear of being forgotten, had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the greatest share in that Journey. The
King was observed to receive him coldly;
the Family of <hi>Guise,</hi> who loves her not,
but yet dares not declare the cause, imploy'd
the Viscount, his mortal Enemy, to obstruct
the Grant of what he design'd himself by
his Journey. 'Twas no hard matter to
compass it; the King hated him, and his
presence gave him no small disquiet; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he was forc'd to return, without
having had the happiness to reap the fruits
of his Voyage, which was only to give
him an opportunity to re-kindle the Flame
his passion had made in the heart of the
Duchess, which he feared his absence
might extinguish: His Majesty wanted no
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53905:28"/>
other subjects of his jealousie, but they not
being known gave him no provocation to
complain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I know not, Daughter, (says Madam
<hi>de Chartres</hi>) if you may not find that I have
instructed you in some things more than
you are willing to know. I am so far from
complaining, (replyes Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>)
that did I not fear to be troublesom to you,
I would desire you to enlarge upon several
Circumstances which I am ignorant of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The passion that Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had
for Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was so violent in its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
that it seem'd to have robb'd him of
all his content, and the very thoughts of
those he had a kindness for; nay, even such
with whom he converst during her absence;
'twas his care to frame excuses to disingage
himself from them; he could not allow
himself the patience to give Ear to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
nor make returns to their reproaches.
Madam <hi>la Dauphin,</hi> for whom he had inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not ordinarily passionate, yet he was
scarce able to confine them within his Breast;
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> had made that impression
there. His impatience for <hi>England</hi> began
to cool, he seem'd not to pursue with much
Zeal his necessary dispatches for that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>He often made his visits to the Dauphin-Queen,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53905:29"/>
that he might have the happiness to
pay his respects to Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> who was
frequently there; neither was he concern'd
at the liberty some took to imagin (what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thought) of the passion he had for that
Princess. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was of that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
with him, he was resolved rather to hide
from her the sentiments of his heart, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
her honour to the publick. He forbore
even to communicate it to the Viscount <hi>de
Chartres,</hi> who was his Confident, and to
whom his Bosome lay ever open. He used
a Conduct so prudent, and which he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with so much care, that the <hi>Argus's</hi> of
the Court could not discover the least symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of any kindness for this Lady, but in
the Chevalier <hi>de Guise.</hi> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
her self had continued a stranger to them,
had not the inclination she had for that Prince
obliged her to keep a close Watch on all his
Actions, which at last convinc'd her.</p>
            <p>She seem'd not to have the same dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make an Overture of this adventure
to her Mother, as she had already done by all
the rest; she was resolved to lodge it in no
other Breast but her own; but alas, she was
mistaken; Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> was as sensible
of it as of her love for this Prince; the
knowledge of which gave her no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.
She understood the danger this poor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53905:29"/>
young Lady was exposed unto, by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
she had for a person of this Prince's
Merit: Her jealousie was afterwards unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed by a passage which suddenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.</p>
            <p>The Marshal of St. <hi>Andre,</hi> who courted
all opportunities to make his splendid Treats,
humbly begg'd of his Majesty, that he would
with the two Queens do him the honour to
take a Collation at his house, which was
newly finisht. 'Twas thought he did it colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,
that Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> might share in
the greatness of this Entertainment, in which
no man could possibly be more prodigal or
profuse.</p>
            <p>Some few days before that which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the Supper, the Dauphin King,
who had not his health, was indisposed and
admitted of no visits. The Queen, his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
had spent the whole day with him; the
Dauphin being better in the Evening, the
persons of quality, who came to wait upon
him, were introduc'd into his Bed-Chamber.
The Queen was pleased to withdraw into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chamber, where she found Madam <hi>de
Cleve,</hi> and some other Ladies, with whom she
was most familiarly pleased to converse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It being now late, and her Majesty not
drest, she went not to wait upon the Queen,
but obliged them to excuse her; she gives or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53905:30"/>
for her Jewels to be brought to her, that
she might give Madam</hi> de Cleve <hi>her choice of
them to wear at the Ball the Marshal was to
make. In the interim in comes the Prince
of</hi> Conde, <hi>his quality gave him a free entrance
every where.</hi> You come <hi>(says the Queen to
him)</hi> from the King my Husband, pray what
news have you there? They are maintaining,
Madam, <hi>(replyes the Prince)</hi> a strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and he
defends the Thesis with that heat and obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey,
as if he himself were the subject of it.
I believe he has a Mistress that may be uneasie
to him at a Ball, that he thinks is so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
a thing to find her there. How, <hi>(says
the Dauphin Queen)</hi> will Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
be so unkind as to impose upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress?
This Power me thinks might better sute
with the authority of a Husband, than the
obsequionsness of a Servant. Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours (answers the Prince)</hi> finds by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that they are the most insupportable
things in Nature to a poor Lover; for if he
be so happy that his Mistress has a passion for
him, he must be sure to stand the Test and
Tryal of her frowns for several days together.
He says there's not a Lady of them all but will
be so diverted with the vanity of the Habit she
must appear in; she cannot be at leisure as
much as to allow a thought towards him: And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53905:30"/>
concludes the folly epidemical: Nay he does not
rest here; he is sensible that when they are at
these Balls, they have no other thoughts but to
please in general: and if once they begin to
set a value on their own Beauties, he fears the
Servant has the least share in their admiration
of it. He argues yet farther, if it be a mans
unhappiness to be neglected, his torment is the
greater in one of these Assemblies, where his
Mistress takes no notice of them; for the
more they are honoured in publick, the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
does a man think himself that's slighted
by them: They are jealous that their Beauty
gives Birth to passions to their prejudice: And
affirms there is no greater torment than to see
her there.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> though she had given
Ear to what the Prince had said, yet seem'd
to take no notice of it. She was sensible
what interest she had in the opinion of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours;</hi> and above all the uneasie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the presence of his Mistress would give
him there where he could not be; the King
was dispatching him to the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Dauphin Queen could not forbear to
smile, as well as the Prince who condemned
the Dukes opinion.</hi> There is only one occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>(says the Prince)</hi> in which Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> can dispence with her presence there,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53905:31"/>
and that neither but when 'tis given by himself;
and he was pleased to tell us, that the last year
he gave one to your Majesty; and says, his
Mistress did him the honour to come, under a
pretence to wait on you. 'Tis an obligation a
Mistress lays upon a Servant, when she is pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to delight in the Divertiscments he makes
her. And your Majesty must think it not a
little pleasing to a Lover, that his Mistress
sees him Master of a Place, the Court is pleased
to do him the honour to compose, and which gives
her an opportunity to be an Eye-witness of the
Gallantry with which he acquits himself. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours (says the Dauphin-Queen)</hi>
had reason to allow it there, where the numbers
were so great of those who wear the Titles
of his Mistresses, that had they not been there,
the Ball had been but thin.</p>
            <p>The discourse the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> used in
giving her Majesty the sentiment of Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> concerning Balls, diverted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleves</hi> thoughts from that intended
by the Marshal <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Andre.</hi> She was easily
convinc'd it was unhandsome to receive a
Treat from one that lov'd her; and was
glad of the opportunity to decline it to oblige
the Prince. She accepted notwithstanding
of the favour of the Dauphin-Queen; and
in the Evening she shew'd them to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
she told her she had no design to use
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53905:31"/>
them, and that she was sensible the Marshal
<hi>de St. Andre</hi> made this splendid Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to give himself the occasion to shew
the honour he has for her, and questioned
not but he would have the vanity to boast his
happiness, that he made her a sharer in it;
<q>and I hear (says she) under that unhappy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
he may involve me in some trouble and
inconvenience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Chartes</hi> was pleased to oppose
her Daughters Opinion, as being singular;
but discovering her obstinacy, she yielded to
it; and advised her to feign her self indisposed,
for she believed no other excuse would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
but that, which she was obliged to
disguise with privacy and discretion too, lest
it should reach the knowledge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and expose her to its censure. Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> consents to pass the time away with
her Mother, she had no inclination for the
place, she thought not happy without the
Princes presence, who leaves the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the day that brought her heart to the
test.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours returns</hi> the day after
the Ball, and was informed she was not there;
but not knowing whether some might not
report to her the discourse he maintained in
the Dauphins Chamber, he began to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
if he was so happy as at first he thought
himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:53905:32"/>The day after his arrival he waited upon
the Queen, and as he was discoursing with
Madam the Dauphin, came in Madam <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi>
and Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> her Daughter, to
pay their Respects to their Majesties. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> was in a careless dress, that she
might the better palliate the indisposition she
had borrowed; but she had this unhappiness,
her Face did not correspond with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.
<hi>You look so well</hi> (says Madam the
Dauphin) <hi>nothing can convince my thoughts
that you have been otherwise. I fear the
Prince of</hi> Conde's <hi>repetition of the Argument
Monsieur</hi> de Nemours <hi>held in the Dauphin's
Bed-Chamber in prejudice of Balls, has had
an ill influence upon you; you thought you should
do the Marshal too great an honour in sharing
in the noble Treat he gave the Court, and
therefore vouchsafed us not your Company.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> could not forbear to blush, for
she was sensible of what Madam the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
guest so well at: And the more, because
she was pleased to hint it to her in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
presence.</p>
            <p>From hence her Mother judg'd the reason
why she declined the Ball; and to prevent
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> apprehension of it;
was pleased to reply to the Dauphin-Queen.
<hi>Madam,</hi> (says she) <hi>your Majesty does my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a greater honour than she deserves. She
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53905:32"/>
was unfeignedly ill, but I think had I not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
my authority, she had exposed her health
to wait on your Majesties, to have had the
pleasure to share in the last Nights Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Marshal was pleased to give you.</hi>
Madam the Dauphin was satisfied with what
Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> told her; but Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> was not a little concerned, that
there was a colour for it. Notwithstanding
that the blushes of Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> deserved
to justifie the truth: Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> was
sensibly offended that she had given Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> the vanity to believe he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
her appearance there; and Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> on the other side could scarce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
her resentment, that any should harbour
that opinion of her.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that the Congress at <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi>
was broken up, the Negotiations for a
Peace still continued, things at last were so
happily disposed, that towards the end of
<hi>February</hi> they met again at <hi>Catean Cambresis.</hi>
His Majesty was pleased to commission the
same Plenipotentiaries he had before. The
absence of the Marshal of St. <hi>Andre</hi> removed
a Rival, who was to be feared, not so much
for the impression his Merit could make upon
the heart of this Lady, as for the guard his
watchful Eye kept upon all those that made
their addresses to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53905:33"/>Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> was not willing her
Daughter should understand she had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her passion for the Prince, to prevent
her Jealousie of those things she had an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to discourse her in, she took an occasion
one day to enlarge (and passionately too) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Worth and Merit, but could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to mix some Venome with his Praise, to
make her sick with him. She told her he
had so great a stock of Prudence, it would
not allow him the vanity to be amorous, and
that his Conversation with Ladies was only
his divertisement. <hi>'Tis thought</hi> (says she) <hi>he
has a passion for the Dauphin-Queen, I meet
him oftenthere; and I advise you to decline his
company; for the Court, being an Eye-witness
of the kindness her Majesty is pleased to shew
you, will be apt to give you the Title of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident;
and you ought to be sensible what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
that will purchase you. If this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
continue long, my advise is farther, that
you pay not such often visits to that Queen, lest
you find your self embroil'd in one of the Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> (which was a stranger to
the Amours of the Dauphin-Queen and
him) was surprised at the knowledge of it;
and when she perceived how much she was
abased in her sentiments of this Prince, she
could not forbear to discover it in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53905:33"/>
which she did not well disguise,
but her Mother took notice of it. There
came some Ladies to give Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi>
a visit, Which interrupted the discourse, and
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> retired into her Closet.</p>
            <p>I am not able to express the sorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
she had at this Relation, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when it reflects upon the folly that gave
birth to her passion for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi>
She durst not hitherto discover it to her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
She was sensible the kindness she had
for him was the sole ambition of Monsieur
<hi>de Cleve;</hi> and you cannot blame her, if she
could not forbear to quarrel with her fond
inclinations, that she should harbour that
love for another, which was only due to the
Merit of her Husband. She was sensibly
toucht with a Jealousie that Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
did only interpose his pretence to her,
to facilitate his addresses to the Dauphin-Queen;
the apprehension of it encouraged
her to communicate it to her Mother.</p>
            <p>In the morning she enters her Mothers
Chamber, to execute the resolutions of the
night before, but finding her indisposed, she
deferred it to another opportunity. Her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
was so inconsiderable, that it divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> from waiting upon
the Dauphin-Queen in the Afternoon. Her
Majesty was retired into her Closet with two
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53905:34"/>
or three Ladies who had the greatest share
in her Bosome. <hi>We are, Madam,</hi> (says the
Queen, discovering Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>) <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of Monsieur</hi> de Nemours, <hi>and equally
admire the change we find in him since his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from</hi> Bruxelles. <hi>Before his Iourney he
had an infinity of Mistresses, and he can only
blame himself for it, for he was pleased to
divide himself equally between those of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and those of none; but since his return,
there is so great a Metamorphoses, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes
neither to regard the one nor other, I my
self perceive it in his humour, it has lost its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
gayety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> returns no answer: She
began to think, and not without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
that they had taken up this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the alteration in this Prince, only to
discover, if she was not mistaken, some
marks of her passion for him: This began to
create in her an antipathy against the Queen,
that she should impose upon her the reasons
of a thing which was best known to her self.
She was not able to hide her resentment from
her Majesty; the Ladies retiring, she took
the liberty to address her self to the Queen,
saying, <hi>Madam, are you pleased to point at me,
when you alone are the subject of this change in
the Prince? You are unkind,</hi> (replies the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin-Queen)
<hi>you must be sensible I can keep
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53905:34"/>
nothing from you. I confess the Duke before he
went to</hi> Bruxelles, <hi>might have some intention
to let me know he did not hate me; but since
his return, I believe he has forgotten his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
I declare I am impatient to know the
Author of this change. I admire he should
hide it from the Viscount</hi> de Chartres, <hi>who
keeps the Key of his heart. Had he a Passion for
a Person I bad a Power over, I might be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as to understand this Alteration.</hi> The
Dauphin-Queen delivered it in a Dialect
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> could have ill resented, but
that she would not cloud the Debonairness of
the humour she first received it in.</p>
            <p>Upon her return home to her Mothers,
she found her in a worse condition than when
she went to Court: Her Feaver was so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that it daily increased upon her; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
her Physitians judged it would be of
some continuance. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was so
sensibly afflicted, she quitted not her Mothers
Chamber. Mounsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> paid his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
daily to Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> not so much
for the interest he had in that Lady, or to
divert his Wifes Grief and Sorrow, as to have
the happiness to injoy her company; for his
Passion had abated none of its primitive Heat
and Vigour.</p>
            <p>Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> who had a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for Mounsieur <hi>de Cleve;</hi> took all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53905:35"/>
to demonstrate it to him, since his return
from <hi>Bruxelles;</hi> during the distemper of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Chartres.</hi> The Prince found several
opportunities of seeing Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a pretence of her Husbands company to
go abroad with him; he came not thither,
but at such hours he knew him not to be there;
and under an excuse of waiting for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
he spent some hours in the withdrawing
Room, where several Persons of Quality
came daily to pay their Complements of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence
to the Daughter, upon her Mothers
indisposition. The affliction she lay under
seemed to Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> to have
made no alteration in her Beauty. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make her sensible of the interest
he had in her Grief; but in a dialect so
passionate, it convin'd her that Madam <hi>la
Dauphin,</hi> was not the subject of his Change.</p>
            <p>She could scarce forbear to discover her
indignation in her countenance; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
she took pleasure in his company.
But when he forbore to visit her, and that
she considered the Charms her Person carried
with it, had given the first Flame to his
Passion, she was scarce able to forbear to
hate her self, upon the apprehension of it.</p>
            <p>Her Feaver got such footing of her daily,
that her Physitians began to despair of her
Health, she received the fatal Tidings with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53905:35"/>
a Courage worthy of her Piety and Vertue.
After they had taken their last leaves of her,
and the Chamber was cleared of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
she calls her Daughter to her.</p>
            <p>We must part Daughter (<hi>says Madam</hi> de
Chartres) <hi>taking her by the hand.</hi> The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that I leave you in, and the occasion you
have for me, add to the regret I have to leave
you. I am sensible you have a Passion for
Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> I ask you not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
me in it. I am no longer able to make
use of your sincerity, in your future conduct.
I have long since discoursed your inclination,
but I have hitherto forborn to speak to you of it,
that I might give you no jealousie, that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it. You must needs be sensible, that
you are upon the point of the Precipice. There
ought to be powerful endeavours used to stop
you in your carrear. Reflect upon the Duty you
owe your Husband, and forget not also that
that's due to me. Consider you are going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to Shipwrack the Reputation you have
gotten, and which I have so passionately wisht
you. Take up strength and courage to quit the
Court; Desire your Husband to take you thence.
Fear not to pursue those Paths which at first
may seem hard and uneasie to you. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
soever they may appear to you in the
beginning, you will find more sweetness in
them in the end, than in the Vanities of the
Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53905:36"/>
If any other Motives, than those of Piety and
Obedience, could oblige you to embrace the
thing I wish; I would tell you, if any thing
can disturb my happiness in a better World,
it will be the consideration of your Fall. But
if this mischief be inevitable, I shall welcome
Death with joy, that I am not the unhappy
witness of it.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> bathed her Mothers
hand, which she had inclosed in her own,
with a flood of Tears. <hi>Adue</hi> (says she) <hi>my
Child, let us put a Period to the discourse, that
will dissolve us both into Grief and Tears:
Forget not (I beseech you) the last Legacy of
your Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having concluded this short admonition;
she turns her self upon her Pillow, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
her Daughter to call in her Women,
she would not allow her the liberty to reply.
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> left the Chamber; and you
may easily conjecture in what condition too.
Madam <hi>de Chartres,</hi> gave up all the thoughts
of the little Remnant of her life, towards a
preparation for a happier being. She spun
out two days longer, in which time she
would not admit her Daughter into her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
though she was the only thing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
she left behind her.</p>
            <p>Poor Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was dissolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
trouble and tears. Her Husband never
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53905:36"/>
left her, and as soon as her Mothers eyes
were closed, he conducts her into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to remove her from a place which gave
her no other objects, but of grief and sorrow.
'Twas wonderful to observe, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the memory of her Love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
to her, ought to have had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
share in her discontent; the necessity of
her Mothers Conduct, to arm her against this
Prince's Charms, had also its part in it.
She begins to see her unhappiness to be thus
forlorn, in an Exigent wherein she was so
little Mistress of her thoughts, and in a season
she so much wanted one in whose Breast
she might deposit her complaints. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s carriage to her,
obliged her to wish more than ever, that
she might not be failing in any thing that
might answer her love and duty. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to repair her former errour, by
greater evidences of her kindness to him,
than she had shewn before. She could not
indure he should part from her, she seemed
(as it were) forcibly to fix her self upon him;
that he might shelter her from the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Addresses of the Duke of <hi>Nemours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke came to give a visit to Mounsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur
<hi>de Cleve</hi> in the Country, with design to
pay another to his Lady; which she refused.
And being sensible she could not avoid his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53905:37"/>
Courtship, she had taken a resolution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the occasion, and not see him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mounsieur</hi> de Cleve <hi>came to</hi> Paris <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
his Train, and promised his Lady to
return the next day; but he disappointed her,
for he came not till the day following.</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
you all yesterday (<hi>says Madam</hi> de Cleve)
And I ought to chide you for your breach of
Faith. You must believe, if I were capable of
any new affliction in the condition I am in,
the Death of Madam <hi>de Tournon,</hi> which
was brought me this very Morning, had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
given it me. I had been less concerned,
had I not had the happiness to know her; she
is a subject worthy our Pity, when we consider
that a young Lady of her Beauty should dye
so sudenly, as in two dayes. But it troubles
me most, when I reflect upon her as the only
Person in the world, that was dear to me for
her merit and discretion.</p>
            <p>I am very sorry I have disappointed you, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
Mounsieur</hi> de Cleve; My presence was
so necessary to contribute to the consolation of
a poor unfortunate Gentleman, that I could not
in honour leave him. As for Madam <hi>de Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
be not afflicted at her loss, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
it as of a Lady, whose prudence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
your value and esteem. You make me
admire you, (<hi>says Madam</hi> de Cleve) for I have
often heard you say, that there was not a Lady
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53905:37"/>
in the Court, for whom you had a greater
Honour. 'Tis true, (<hi>replies Mounsieur</hi> de
Cleve,) but you women are incomprehensible;
and when I have seen them all, I find my self so
happy in you alone, I cannot sufficiently value
my own content. You are pleased to esteem me
more than I deserve (<hi>says Madam</hi> de Cleve
<hi>fetching a sigh,</hi>) and if I have not hitherto
learnt the method to indear my self, give me the
Lesson Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> has taught you. 'Tis
long since that I learnt it, (<hi>replyes Mounsieur</hi>
de Cleve) and I was sensible she had a passion for
the Count <hi>de Sancerre,</hi> to whom she gave some
hopes. I cannot believe (<hi>says Madam</hi> de Cleve)
that Madam <hi>de Tournon,</hi> after the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
she had exprest for Marriage, when
she was a Widdow; and the publick declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
she made, never to have a thought for it,
should flattter Mounsieur <hi>de Sancerre.</hi> Had
she been so just (<hi>replies Mounsieur</hi> de Cleve)
as to have bounded her folly there, she had not
given the Court the subject of so much discourse
to her disadvantage; but that which surprized
it, was, at the same time she gave an equal as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
to Monsieur <hi>Estouteville.</hi> And I'll
give you the relation of it.</p>

            <p>YOU are not a stranger to the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
between <hi>Sancerre</hi> and me. Yet,
great as it was, when about two years since
he fell in love with Madam <hi>de Tournon,</hi> he
made it his business to conceal it as closely
from me, as from others; and had the dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
to keep it so private, that I never sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
any such thing. Madam <hi>Tournon</hi>
affected a way of living so extremely retir'd,
and appear'd afflicted to that degree, for the
death of her Husband, that it was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53905:38"/>
opinion, there was no comforting of her
after a loss she so much lamented. She
scarce admitted a visit from any person, but
<hi>Sancerre</hi>'s Sister, nor visited any other; and
at his Sisters Lodging, <hi>Sancerre</hi> fell in Love
with her.</p>
            <p>One Evening there was to be a Play at
Court; and all things being ready, the
Actors waited the coming of the King
and Madam <hi>de Valentinois;</hi> when News was
brought, she was not well, and the King
would not come: Every one guess'd her
indisposition was really nothing else but some
quarrel with the King: and though all the
Court knew how jealous he had been of the
Marshal of <hi>Brisac,</hi> while he continued at
Court, yet the Marshal being some days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
return'd for <hi>Piemont,</hi> we could not
imagine the cause of their falling out: As I
was discoursing of it to <hi>Sancerre,</hi> Mounsieur
<hi>d' Anville</hi> came into the Hall, and whisper'd
me in the Ear, that the King was so vex'd
and so angry it would make any one pity
him: that when the jars he lately had with
the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
<hi>Brisac,</hi> were compos'd a few days ago,
the King had given her a Ring, and pray'd
her to wear it. That as she was a dressing to
come to the Play, the King miss'd the Ring
on her Finger, and ask'd what was become of it.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53905:39"/>
She appear'd astonish'd she had it not, and
call'd to her Women for it; who unluckily,
or for want of instruction to the contrary,
presently answer'd, it was four or five days
since they saw it.</p>
            <p>'Tis precisely so long, continues Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Anville,</hi> since the Marshal <hi>Brisac</hi> left
the Court, and the King makes no doubt, but
as she bid him adieu, she gave him the Ring.
The thought of this cut the King to the
quick, and kindled afresh his late jealousie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so sudden and violent a flame, that it put
him in an extraordinary passion, and made
him break out into sharp expressions, and very
reproachful Language against her. He is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gone into his Lodgings extremely afflicted,
but whether more with the thought of the
Duchess having made a sacrifice of his Ring
to the Marshal <hi>Brisac,</hi> or with fear of having
displeas'd her by his passion, I cannot resolve
you.</p>
            <p>Mounsieur <hi>d' Anville</hi> had no sooner made
an end of telling me the News, but I went
to <hi>Sancerre</hi> to acquaint him with it. I told
it him as a secret, newly intrusted with me,
and charg'd him not to speak of it.</p>
            <p>The morrow betimes I went to my Sister-in-Law's,
and found at her Bed-side Madam
<hi>de Tournon,</hi> who had no great Kindness for
Madam <hi>de Valentinois,</hi> and knew well enough
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53905:39"/>
my Sister-in-Law had small reason to think
well of her: <hi>Sancerre,</hi> when the Play was
done, went to Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi>'s, and gave
her an account of the quarrel between the
King and the Duchess, which Madam <hi>de
Tournon</hi> was then come to relate to my Sister-in-Law,
not knowing <hi>Sancerre</hi> had had it
from me.</p>
            <p>Assoon as I came up to my Sister-in-Law,
she told Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> I might be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Relation she had newly made,
and, without further expecting permssion from
Madam <hi>de Tournon,</hi> my Sister-in-Law told me
word by word, all I had told <hi>Sancerre</hi> the
night before. This, you may believe, surpriz'd
me very much: I looked upon Madam <hi>de
Tournon,</hi> she appear'd disorder'd: Her disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
rais'd a suspition in me: I had not told
any but <hi>Sancerre</hi> the News: as we were
going from the Play he had quitted me,
without telling me the reason: It came into
my mind I had heard him speak much in
commendation of Madam <hi>de Tournon:</hi> All
this together open'd my Eyes, and made me
easily to discern an intrigue of Gallantry
between <hi>Sancerre</hi> and her, and that when
he left me, he went to see her.</p>
            <p>I was so vext to find he kept this Adventure
from me: I let fall some expressions that
made Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> sensible how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53905:40"/>
she had been: I brought her to her
Coach, and told her at parting, I envy'd his
happiness who had given her the News of
the quarrel between the King and Madam <hi>de
Valentinois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went presently in search of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him with his unkindness, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acquainting him how I made the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
I told him, I knew the passion he had for
Madam <hi>de Tournon:</hi> He was forc'd to confess
it, and then I told how I came to know it,
and he as frankly gave me an exact account
of their Adventure; adding, that though he
were a younger Brother, and could not pretend
to so great a Match, yet he had encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough from the Lady to try his fortune.
You cannot imagine the surprise I was in at
his discourse: I advis'd him to hasten the
conclusion of the Marriage, and told him he
must provide for the worst, having to deal
with a Woman that did so neatly impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the publick, by acting with that artifice a
part so different from what he knew she really
was: He answer'd, the death of her Husband
had really troubled her: but the inclination
she had for him dissipated that trouble, and
she was unwilling the world should on the
sudden be witness of the Change. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
other reasons in excuse of her, which gave
me light enough to see how deeply he was in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53905:40"/>
Love. He assur'd me he would procure her
consent, to let me know the passion he had
for her, since she had made the first discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
towards it: nor was he worse than his
word, though she was very loath to give way
to an open acknowledgement: and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
I was their Confident to a very high
measure.</p>
            <p>Never did I see a Woman carry her self
with a Civility so suitable to the Exigences of
her Servants condition, yet I confess I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
she still affected to appear troubled for
the death of her Husband. <hi>Sancerre</hi> was so
deeply in Love, and so pleas'd with her kind
usage of him; that he durst not press the
conclusion of the Marriage, for fear of making
her suspect he Courted her more for interest
than for Love. Yet he spoke to her of it, and she
appeared willing to be marry'd to him: With
that she began to quit her solitude, and appear
abroad to the World: She visited my Sister-in-Law
at such hours she was sure to find some
of the Court at her Lodgings. <hi>Sancerre</hi>
came seldom thither: but those who were at
my Sister-in-Laws every Night, and saw
Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> frequently there, thought
her very amiable.</p>
            <p>She had not long quitted her solitude, but
<hi>Sancerre</hi> fancy'd she coold in her passion for
him. He often told me so; though I made
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53905:41"/>
very light of it. At last when he inform'd
me, that instead of concluding the marriage,
she put it off, I thought he had ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for apprehension. I answer'd, it was no
wonder a passion two years old should be a little
abated; and were it still as high as ever, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it was not strong enough to oblige her
to marry him; yet he had not just cause of
complaint, being satisfy'd such a Marriage
would (as to the Publick) be much to her
prejudice, not only for that he was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Match for her, but that it would reflect
upon her Reputation: that all he could desire,
was, she should not deceive him, by giving
him false hopes. I added, that if she had not
the power to marry him, or if she declar'd she
was in Love with another, he must not be
angry nor complain, but continue the esteem,
and persevere to pay her the respect he had for
her: <hi>I give you,</hi> said I, <hi>the Counsel I would
take in the like Case; for I am so great a Friend
to sincerity, that I believe should my Mistress
or my wife confess to me ingeniously, another
better pleas'd them than I, it would trouble me
without making me angry: I would lay by the
Person of a Lover or a Husband, to be at liberty
only to advise her and to make my Complaint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleves</hi> blush'd at these Words,
wherein she discern'd something so nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateing
to her present condition, that very much
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53905:41"/>
surpriz'd her, and put her into a disorder, out
of which it was not in her power to recover
her self for some time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sancerre,</hi> continues Mounsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
acquainted Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I had given him. But she took that care to
satisfie him, and appear'd so much offended
at his suspitions, that she left him fully assur'd
of the reallity of her kindness for him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
she put off the Marriage till after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from a Long Journey he was to take,
yet she carry'd her self so well till his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and appear'd so afflicted at it, that I
thought as well as <hi>Sancerre</hi> she really lov'd
him. He hath been gone about three months,
and you have so wholly taken me up ever
since, I scarce had the opportunity to see
Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> in his absence, and knew
only that <hi>Sancerre</hi> was suddenly expected.</p>
            <p>Two days ago, when I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her death; I sent to <hi>Sancerre</hi>'s Lodgings,
to enquire what News of him: they sent me
Word he was arriv'd the Night before, being
the very same Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi> dyed on: I
went immediately to see him, doubting very
much what condition I should find him in,
but the trouble I saw him under exceeded my
imagination.</p>
            <p>Never did I see sorrow so deep, and so
Tender: Assoon as he saw me, he burst
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53905:42"/>
into Tears, and imbracing me. <hi>I shall never see
her more,</hi> says he, <hi>I shall never see her more:
she is dead; I was not worthy of her, but I shall
quickly follow her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having said this, he held his peace: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
from time to time, repeating, she
is gone, I shall see her no more: He fell again
into Tears and Lamentations; he was like
a Man distracted: He told me he had receiv'd
but few Letters from her in his absence,
but that he knew her so well he wonder'd not
at it, being sufficiently assur'd she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
very shye of sending Letters: yet he
made no doubt but she would have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to him at his return. He took her for the
most amiable and most faithful Person in the
World, and thought she lov'd him with a
great deal of tenderness, and lost her at the
time he hop'd to have made sure of her for
his own for ever. These thoughts plung'd
him into deep affliction, which, I confess,
mov'd my pity, and made me look upon him
as an object worthy serious Commiseration.</p>
            <p>I was forc'd to leave him to go to the King,
but promis'd to return in a very short time,
and accordingly did so; I was never so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
as when at my return I found him
quite another Man: He was in his Chamber
with fury in his face, sometimes going, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
standing still, as if he had been mad.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53905:42"/>
               <hi>Come, come,</hi> says he to me, <hi>Come see the
most desperate of Men: I am a thousand times
more unfortunate than I was a while ago, and
what I have newly heard of Madam</hi> de Tournon
<hi>is worse than her death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I look'd on this disorder as an effect of his
grief, and could not imagine any thing
could be worse than the death of a Mistress
one loves, and who loves him again. I
told him, while he kept within bounds, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
his passion, and pity'd his sorrow, but
he was not to expect I should bemoan him
any longer, if he gave himself up to despair,
and would run out of his Wits.</hi> Happy had
it been for me, <hi>crys he,</hi> had I long since
run out of my Wits, and my life too: Madam
<hi>de Tournon</hi> was false to me, and I am so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
as not to have discover'd her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
till the morrow after her death, at a
time when my heart is at once full of the most
passionate Love Man is capable of, and pierc'd
through and through with grief, the smartest that
ever was felt; I retain at this moment in my fancy
the impression of her Image as the model of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
not in my Eyes only, but in the Iudgment
of all Mankind, when the same instant I see
my self deceiv'd, and find she deserves not my
sorrow. Yet I am as much troubled at her
death as if she had been true to me, and resent
her infidelity as if she were Living: Had I
heard of her inconstancy before she had dy'd,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53905:43"/>
anger, jealousie, and rage would have harden'd
my heart against a sense of the loss of her, but
the misery of my condition is such, I am inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of comfort, yet know not how to hate her.</p>
            <p>Judge you whether I was not surpriz'd at
<hi>Sancerres</hi> expressions. I ask'd him how he
came to know she had been false to him. He
answer'd, I was no sooner gone out of his
Chamber, but <hi>Estouteville</hi> his intimate friend,
but altogethor a stranger to his Love for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Tournon,</hi> came in to see him; that as
soon as he sat down he fell a crying, and
begg'd his pardon for having conceal'd from
him what he was now come to tell him, that
he intreated his pity; that he was come to
open his very heart to him, and that of all
the men in the World, he was the most griev'd
at the death of Madam <hi>de Tournon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was so surpriz'd at his nameing her, that
though I was just upon answering, I was more
griev'd at it than he, yet I had not the power
to say so. He went on with his story, and
told me he had been six Months in love with
her: that he was still for making me acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, but she had expresly forbidden
it, and with so strict a charge he durst not
disobey her. That he had had the good
fortune to please her assoon almost as he had
fallen in love with her: that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
their passion from all the World: that
he had never been publickly at her house, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53905:43"/>
he had the pleasure to see himself effectually
capable of making her lay aside her sorrow
for the death of her Husband, and that just
as she dy'd he should have marry'd her, and
that their Marriage, which really was an
effect of love, was to have past in the world
as a pure effect of duty and obedience: that
in order to this she had prevail'd with her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to command her to marry him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Censures of the World, and stop
the Mouths of those who would have cry'd
out at the great alteration of her Conduct,
which had appear'd so averse from the
thoughts of a second Marriage.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Estouteville</hi> was speaking, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<hi>Sancerre,</hi> I believ'd all he said; his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
seem'd so probable, and the more for
that about the time he said he first fell in
Love with her, I first observ'd a change in
her. But the next moment I thought him a
Lyar or a Mad-man. I was going to tell him
so, but was prevail'd upon by the desire I
had of a fuller discovery, to question him
further, and to throw in objections against
what he said. I proceeded so far towards
convincing my self of my misfortune, that
he ask'd me if I knew Madam <hi>de Tournon</hi>'s
hand-writing. With that, he threw on my
Bed four Letters of hers, and her Picture.
At that very instant my Brother came in.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53905:44"/>
               <hi>Estouteville</hi> was so blubber'd with crying, he
was forc'd to go out to avoid being seen:
telling me he would come again in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
to fetch what he left with me. I
sent away my Brother, pretending my self
ill; so impatient was I to read those Letters,
in hopes to find something there, to make me
dis-believe what <hi>Estouteville</hi> had said. But
alas, what found I there? what tenderness,
what Oaths, what assurances of marrying
him. Never had she Writ such Letters to
me: Thus, adds he, am I assaulted at once
with grief for her death, and vexation for
her falsness: Two evils often compar'd, but
seldom felt by the same person at once. To
my shame be it spoken, the loss of her still
troubles me more than her inconstancy, and
I cannot find in my heart to think she deserv'd
death for her Treachery. Were she living
I should take pleasure in reproaching her, and
taking my Revenge of her, by letting her
know how unjust she was; <hi>But I shall never
see her more,</hi> says he again, <hi>I shall never see
her more. This is the greatest misfortune:
O that I could restore her to life, though with the
loss of my own! yet what do I wish for? were she
alive again, she would be</hi> Estouteville's: <hi>How
happy was I yesterday,</hi> crys he, <hi>how happy
was I when the most sorrowful of Men: Yet
my sorrow appear'd reasonable, and it was a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53905:44"/>
pleasure to think it my duty never to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted:
To day every thing I do me thinks is
unreasonable: I pay a passion she only feign'd
for me, that tribute of grief I thought justly
due to a sincere affection. It is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to hate or to love the memory of her: I am
incapable of comfort, yet know not how to
grieve for her. However,</hi> says he, turning
short towards me, <hi>I conjure you, take care</hi>
Estouteville <hi>come not in sight of me. I abhor
the very name of him. I know well enough
I have no cause to complain of—him, it was my
fault not to tell him I lov'd Madam</hi> de Tournon.
<hi>Had he known it, perhaps he would never have
made an address to her, nor she have been
false to me. He made it his business to find me
out, to communicate his sorrows to me. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but pity him. Ha,</hi> cryes he, <hi>has he
not reason to be sorry, he lov'd Madam</hi> de Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
<hi>was beloved of her, and shall never see her
more; yet I find by my self I cannot chuse but
hate him. However, I conjure you once more,
let me not see him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sancerre</hi> after this fell a crying again, he
was sorry for Madam <hi>de Tournon,</hi> he spoke to
her, and gave her the kindest expressions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
presently he hates her, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of her, he Reproaches and Curses
her: When I observed his Condition
I knew I should want some help to
quiet him. I sent for his Brother,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53905:45"/>
whom I had newly left with the King: I
gave him the meeting in the Anti-chamber, to
give him an account of <hi>Sancerres</hi> condition:
We gave order to prevent his seeing <hi>Estoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
and spent part of the Night in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bring him to himself. This morning
I found him more troubled than ever: I left
his Brother with him and came to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am extremely surpriz'd at the News,</hi> says
Madam <hi>de Cleves, I thought Madam</hi> de Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<hi>incapable either of Love or Deceit. 'Tis
not possible any one,</hi> replyes Mounsieur <hi>de
Cleve, should carry her self with greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation
or cunning.</hi> Observe, that when
<hi>Sancerre</hi> thought her alter'd as to him, she
really was so; and began to love <hi>Estouteville,</hi>
telling him he was the only Man could make
her forget the death of her Husband, and for
whose sake she quitted her Retirement, when
<hi>Sancerre</hi> thought the while it proceeded from
no other Cause but a Resolution to appear
less afflicted than formerly: she made it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of favour to <hi>Estouteville</hi> that she conceal'd
their correspondence, and seem'd oblig'd by
her Father to marry him, which she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
proceeded purely from the care of
her reputation, when it was in truth a
trick to put off <hi>Sancerre,</hi> without leaving him
just cause of complaint: <hi>I must needs return,</hi>
continues Mounsieur <hi>de Cleve, to see my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53905:45"/>
friend, and I think you may do well to go
with me to</hi> Paris: <hi>'Tis high time for you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
abroad, and Receive those visits you cannot
well dispence with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s agreed to the proposal,
and return'd on the Morrow: she found her
self more at ease as to Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
than she formerly had been: what Madam <hi>de
Chartres</hi> said on her death-Bed, and sorrow
for the loss of her, had so suspended her
thoughts of him, that she thought she should
be no more troubled with them.</p>
            <p>The same Evening she arriv'd, the Queen
Dauphin gave her a visit, and having told
her how much she shar'd in her afflictions, she
said, to divert her from those sad thoughts,
she would inform her of all that had past at
Court in her absence, and accordingly gave
her an account of several particulars. <hi>But
that I have most mind to acquaint you with,</hi>
adds she, <hi>is, that it is most certain Mounsieur</hi>
de Nemours <hi>is passionately in Love, and that
he is so far from making any the most intimate
friend he has his Confident in the case, there is
not one can guess who it is he is in love with:
Though he be so deeply in Love it makes him
neglect, if not quit the hopes of a Crown:</hi>
with that she gave her an account of what
concern'd the matter of <hi>England: What I
have told you,</hi> says she, <hi>I had from Mounsieur</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53905:46"/>
de Anville, <hi>who told me this morning the King
had yesterday, sent for Mounsieur</hi> de Nemours,
<hi>upon Letters receiv'd from</hi> Lignerolles, <hi>who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
leave to return, as not able any longer to
excuse to the Queen of</hi> England <hi>the delays of
Mounsieur</hi> de Nemours, <hi>that the Queen begins
to take it ill, and that though she had not made a
positive promise, she had said enough to encourage
the hazarding a Voyage.</hi> The King read this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> who, instead of
speaking seriously, as he had done at first, fell
a laughing and scoffing at <hi>Lignerolles</hi> hopes;
saying, all <hi>Europe</hi> would condemn his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
should he undertake a Voyage for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as pretending to Marriage with the
Queen, without assurance of success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides,</hi> adds he, <hi>I could not time my business
worse, than to take my Iourney at this Iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
when the King of</hi> Spain <hi>makes address
to that Queen for Marriage.</hi> In matter of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
I confess his Catholick Majesty were
no very considerable Rival, but in a Treaty
of Marriage I cannot think your Majesty
would advise me to stand in competition with
him. <q>I would on this occasion, replys the
King, for I know he is otherwise inclin'd;
and were he not, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> took so little
pleasure in the Yoke of <hi>Spain,</hi> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
her Sister will undergo it, or suffer her
self to be blinded with the Glittering of so
many Crowns on one Head: If she yield not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53905:46"/>
to the splendor of so many Crowns, says
Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> 'tis probable she
will seek her happiness in Love: She hath
for some years lov'd my Lord <hi>Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi>
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> too was in love with
him, and would have marry'd him, and with
publick consent of her Kingdom, but that
she knew him more taken with the youth
and beauty of her Sister <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> than am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of reigning. Your Majesty knows her
Jealousie of them made her clap them up Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and afterwards banish my Lord <hi>Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
and prevail'd with her at last to resolve to
marry with the King of <hi>Spain. Elizabeth,</hi>
who now possesses the Throne of her Sister,
will, I believe, shortly call home my Lord
<hi>Courteney,</hi> and will rather make choice of
him for her Husband, whom she hath lov'd,
and who is really amiable, and hath been a
great sufferer for her, than of a Man she hath
never seen: Were <hi>Courteney</hi> alive, says the
King, I should be of your mind, but I
have been certainly inform'd some days since
that he is dead at <hi>Padua,</hi> whither he was
banished: But I see, adds the King as he
left Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> your marriage
must be made up just as the Dauphins was,
and Embassadors must be sent to espouse the
Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mounsieur <hi>d' Anville</hi> and the <hi>Vidame,</hi> who
were with the King when he spoke to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53905:47"/>
are clearly of opinion, nothing could
divert him from so great a design, but the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he is so deeply ingag'd in. The <hi>Vidame,</hi>
who knows him best of any man living, hath
told Madam <hi>de Martignes,</hi> he finds such a
change in Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> he scarce
knows him. And, which he most wonders
at, he cannot observe he hath any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Correspondence; nor can he discover
any secret haunts he hath, or that he is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
at any time, which makes the <hi>Vidame</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he holds not correspondence with the
person he loves: and this is the reason he
thinks himself so much mistaken in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> to see him in love with a
Woman that does not love him again.</p>
            <p>What a poysonous discourse was this for
Madam <hi>de Cleves!</hi> How could she choose
but know her self the Person whose Name
was not known? How could she but be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected with gratitude and tenderness at
the News she received, by a way not at all
liable to suspition, that this Prince she had so
great an inclination for, conceal'd his passion
from all the World, and slighted for love of
her the hopes of a Crown: it is impossible
to describe her sentiments on this occasion,
and represent to the life the trouble it rais'd
in her. Had the Queen-Dauphin ey'd her
more closely, she would have easily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
she was concern'd at the discourse: But
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53905:47"/>
as she had not the least suspition of the truth,
she proceeded without taking notice of her;
Mounsieur <hi>d' Anville,</hi> adds she, who, as I
told you, acquainted me with all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
thinks I know the business better than
he, and hath so great an opinion of my
Charms, he believes me the sole person ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to cause so extraordinary alterations in
Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These last Words rais'd another kind of
trouble in Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s, very different
from that she was formerly in. <q>I am of his
mind, (answers she,) and 'tis very probable
that no less than such a Princesse as you
could make him despise the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
I would confess it, did I know it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
the Queen-Dauphin, and I should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know it, were it true: Passions of
this Nature seldom escape the discovery of
those who occasion them: They are the
first that discern them. Mounsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
never exprest for me other than slight
and superficial complaisance: yet I observe
so great difference between his present and
former deportment towards me, I dare assure
you I am not the cause of that indifference he
shews for the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> But I am
so taken with your company, I forget my
self, and mind not the obligation I am under
of seeing Madam: you know the peace is
in a manner concluded, but 'tis possible it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53905:48"/>
may be News to you, that the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> refuses to Sign the Articles, but upon
condition he shall marry that Princess, instead
of the Prince <hi>Don Carlos</hi> his Son. The King
was loath to consent to it, but hath done
it at last, and is newly gone to carry Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
the News: I believe it will much
trouble her: what pleasure can she expect
from Marrying a Man of the age and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> especially she so
jovial, so young, and so beautiful a Lady,
who expected to Marry a young Prince, for
whom unseen she had a strong inclination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I question whether the King will meet
with the obedience he desires in her. He
hath charg'd me to see her, because he knows
she loves me, and that I have some power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her: I shall from thence make another
visit (of a very different Nature,) to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the Kings Sister for the conclusion of
her Marriage with the Prince of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
is expected in few days: Never had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the age of this Princess so great cause
to rejoyce at her Marriage. The Court will
be more Numerous and Glorious than ever,
and in spight of all your affliction you must
come and help us to let the Strangers see we
are furnish'd with no mean Beauties.</p>
            <p>Having said this, the Queen-Dauphin left
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s, and on the morrow the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53905:48"/>
Marriage of Madam was in every ones Mouth.
The day after the King and Queens went to
see Madam <hi>de Cleve:</hi> Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
who had waited her return with extreme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
and wisht passionately he might
speak with her in private, put off going
to her, till the time all company broke
up, and probably none would return thither
that night. It fell out as he had wisht, and
he came in as the last Visiters were taking
their leaves.</p>
            <p>The Princess was on her Bed, the weather
hot, and the sight of Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
put her to a blush, that made her more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
He sat over against her, with a respect and
fearfulness incident only to a genuine Passion,
he was speechless for sometime: Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi>'s was as mute as he, so that they were
both silent a pretty while: At last Mounsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> complemented her, condoleing
her affliction. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s very glad
of discourse on that subject, spoke a good
while of the loss she had had: and told him
at last though time might abate the violence
of her grief, she should still retain so deep an
impression of it, it would alter her humour:
'Tis true, Madam, replyes M. <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
great troubles and violent passions, occasion
great alterations in our tempers: though I was
never actually sensible of it, but since my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53905:49"/>
from <hi>Flanders:</hi> 
               <q>Many have observed in
me a very great change, and the Queen-Dauphin
her self spoke to me of it yesterday.
She has indeed taken notice of it, says Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> and I think I have heard her
speak of it. I am not displeas'd Madam,
answers Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> that she hath
perceiv'd it, but should be very glad she were
not the only Person that did so. There are
Persons in the World to whom we dare give
no other evidences of the passion we have for
them, but by things that concern them not;
yet when we dare not make it appear we love
them, we are willing at least to let them see we
desire not the Love of any other; we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to let them know we look with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
on all other Beauties, though in the
highest sphere, and that a Crown may be too
dear, if to be purchas'd with no less a price
than absence from her we adore.</q> Ordinarily,
Ladies judge of the passion had for them, by
the care their Servants take to attend and
to please them: but be they never so little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
those are easie tasks to perform. There
is no great difficulty in giving our selves the
pleasure to wait on them: But to avoid their
company for fear of discovering to the World,
and almost to themselves, the passion we
have for them, that's a difficult point: the
truest evidence of being really in Love, is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53905:49"/>
when we become quite other men than we
were, when we renounce our ambition and
our pleasures, having all our Life pursu'd the
one and the other.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s easily understood how
far she was concern'd in this discourse, she
thought it her duty to cut it off by an answer.
Presently her mind alter'd, and she was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
it was better make as if she understood
it not, and give him no cause to think she
took it to her self; she thought she ought to
speak, and thought she ought to be silent;
this discourse did in a manner equally please
and displease her. It convinc'd her of the
truth of all the Queen-Dauphin made her
think of him, she could not but look upon it
as full of gallantry and respect, but withall
somewhat bold and a little too plain andintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible:
The inclination she had for that Prince
put her into a disorder it was not in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to master: the darkest expressions of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we love move more than the clearest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
of a person we have no inclination
for. She made him no answer. Mounsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> took notice of her silence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
would have taken it for no ill Omen. But
Mounsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s coming in, put an end
to their discourse and his visit.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Cleve</hi> came in to give his
Lady a further account of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> but she
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53905:50"/>
was not very curious to know the Issue of
that Adventure. Her thoughts were so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with what she had newly heard from
Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> she could scarce hide
the distraction she was under: Assoon as she
was at liberty to Muse of what was past, she
saw clearly how much she had been deceiv'd,
when she thought her self indifferent as to
Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours;</hi> his discourse had
made as deep Impression on her as he could
wish, and fully convinc'd her of the truth of
his passion, his actions agreeing too well
with his words to leave her the least shadow
of doubt. She no longer flatter'd her self
with hopes of not loving him; all her care
was not to let him Know it: she knew this
would prove a very hard task, having already
had experience of the difficulty of it: she
knew there was no way of doing it, but by
avoiding the presence of that Prince: Her
being in Mourning gave her occasion of living
more retyr'd than ordinary; and she took that
pretence not to frequent places where she
might see him: very sad and disconsolate she
was, but the death of her Mother appear'd to
be the cause of it, and no suspition was had
of any other.</p>
            <p>Mounsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was almost distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he could not have a sight of her, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was no finding her in Company,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53905:50"/>
and that she appeared not at any Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at Court, he could not prevail with
himself to be there, but pretended a great
love for Hunting, and made Matches for that
Sport upon the days the Ladies and the rest
of the Court us'd to meet at the Queen's
Lodgings. A slight indisposition serv'd him
a long time for a pretence to keep home, and
absent himself from those places he knew
there were no hopes to see Madam <hi>de Cleve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was sick much about
the same time. During his illness Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> stirred not out of his Chamber:
But when he grew better, and admitted Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
particularly Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> who
under pretence of being not yet fully reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
spent there the greatest part of the day;
she found it was not in her power to stay
there, yet at his first coming she could not
quit the Room. 'Twas so long since she had
seen him, she could not quickly resolve to see
him no more. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had the
address by discourses that appear'd altogether
general, (but she understood well enough
by the relation they had to what he had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
said to her in her Chamber,) to let her
know he went a Hunting only for more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to think of her; and that the reason
he quitted Meetings at Court, was her not
being there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:53905:51"/>At last, but with very much ado, she put
in execution the resolution she had taken to
quit her Husband's Chamber when Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> was there, who quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
she shunn'd him, and was very much
troubled at it.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> did not presently take
notice of his Lady's conduct in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but became sensible at length she went
out of his Chamber when company was
there. He told her of it: she answer'd, she
thought it not decent for her to be there eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Evening in company with the youngest of
the Court, that she intreated him to allow
her to live more retir'd than she had done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto:
that the virtue and presence of her
Mother, while she liv'd, had given her privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in some things she thought no longer
fit to be made use of by a Woman of her
age.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> who naturally had a
great deal of kindness and complaisance for
his Wife, exprest it not on this occasion, but
told her he could by no means consent she
should alter her Conduct. She was upon the
point of telling him, it was the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was in Love with
her, but she had not the power to mention
his Name; besides she thought it dis-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to disguise the truth, and make use of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53905:51"/>
pretences to a Person who really had a very
good opinion of her.</p>
            <p>A few days after, the King was at the
Queen's Lodgings about the time of going to
take the Ring; the discourse was of Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes
and Predictions: The Company was
divided in opinion what credit to be given
them. The Queen maintained, that after so
many things foretold, and afterwards come
accordingly to pass, it was not to be doubted
but there was some certainty in that Science:
others insisted, that of an infinite number of
Predictions so very few prov'd true, that the
truth of those few must be look'd upon as a
meer effect of Chance.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have heretofore, <hi>says the King,</hi> been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
curious and inquisitive of the future; but
they have told me things so false and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that I am convinc'd they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
certain. Not many years since there
came hither a Man famous for Astrology; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one went to see him, and I among the
rest, but did not let him know who I was:
I took with me Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> and <hi>Descars,</hi>
and made them go in first: Yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer
addrest himself to me, as if he had
judg'd me Master to the other two, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he knew me; but if he did, he told me
a thing no way suitable to me: His Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was, I should be kill'd in Duel. He told
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53905:52"/>
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> he should die of a Wound
given him behind; and <hi>Descars,</hi> that he
should have his Brains knockt out with the
kick of a Horse. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> was
offended at the Prediction, as if it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
he would run away: <hi>Descars</hi> was not
well pleas'd to hear he should end his days
by so unfortunate an Accident. In a word,
we went out all three very ill satisfied with
the Astrologer. What may happen to
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> and <hi>Descars</hi> I know not,
but 'tis very improbable I shall be kill'd in
Duel: The King of <hi>Spain</hi> and I have new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made peace; and had we not done so, I
question much if we should have fought,
or I have sent him a Challenge, as the King
my Father did to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the King had given this account of
the misfortune foretold should happen to
him, those who before defended Astrology
deserted it, and agreed there was no credit at
all to be given to it. <q>For my part, <hi>says
Monsieur</hi> de Nemours <hi>aloud,</hi> I of all Men
living have least cause to credit it;</q> and
turning himself towards Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
near whom he stood, <q>It has been told me,
<hi>says he to her very softly,</hi> I should be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in the kindness of a Person, for whom I
should have the most violent, and the most
respectful Passion imaginable. Judge you,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53905:52"/>
Madam, if I have cause for any Faith in
Predictions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen-Dauphin having heard what
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had said aloud, thought
what he said softly had been some false Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
told him, and ask'd him what it was
he had said to Madam <hi>de Cleve?</hi> Had his
Wit been less ready, the Question might have
surpris'd him, but he answer'd without any
hesitation, it had been foretold him he should
be exalted to a Fortune so high he durst not
pretend to. <q>If this be it hath been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
you, <hi>says the Queen-Dauphin, smiling
and thinking of the Affair with</hi> England, I
would not advise you to run down Astrology,
'tis possible you may have reasons to give
in defence of it.</q> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the Queen-Dauphin's meaning, but
knew withal that the Fortune Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> spoke of, was not that of being King
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now a long time since the death of
her Mother, and Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
abroad, and make her Court as she had
us'd. She had a sight of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
at the Queen-Dauphins, she had a
sight of him at Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s, where
he frequently came with other Persons of
Quality of his age, that no notice might be
taken of it; but where-ever she saw him, it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53905:53"/>
gave her trouble, and put her into some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
which he easily perceiv'd.</p>
            <p>As careful as she was to shun his looks, and
speak less to him than any other, she could
not prevent some sudden escapes of her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that gave Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> cause to
believe she had more than indifferent incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for him. A Man perhaps less discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than he could not have perceiv'd it, but
he had been already so often belov'd, it was
easie for him to know when one lov'd him.
He knew the Chevalier <hi>de Guise</hi> was his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and the Chevalier <hi>de Guise</hi> as clearly
saw Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was his. Not one
of the whole Court but the Chevalier <hi>de
Guise</hi> had made the discovery; his interest
render'd him more clear-sighted than the rest:
The knowledge they had of one anothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
made them cross one another in all
things, and they could not forbear expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their spight on every occasion, though it
broke not out into open enmity. At the
Runnings at the Ring, at Combats, at the
Barrier, and all Divertisements the King
call'd them to, they were always of different
Parties, and their emulation was so great it
could not be hid.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> could not forbear think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
frequently of the Affair with <hi>England,</hi>
she believ'd Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> would not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53905:53"/>
resist the King's Advice, and the Instances of
<hi>Lignerolles,</hi> it troubled her to see <hi>Lignerolles</hi>
was not yet return'd, and she expected him
every hour with the greatest impatience:
Her inclinations sway'd her strongly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her self exactly of the state of that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
but the same thought that rais'd her
Curiosity, immediately suggested to her she
was oblig'd to conceal it, and she enquir'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Beauty, the Wit and Humour of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The King had one of her
Pictures brought him. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
thought it far handsomer than she hop'd to
have found it, and she could not forbear say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Picture-drawer had flatter'd the
Queen, in drawing her so beautiful. <hi>I do not
think so,</hi> says the Queen-Dauphin, <hi>that
Princess is reputed extraordinary handsome,
and witty; and I am sure she hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to me for an Example all my Life: she
must be very lovely, if like</hi> Anne Bullen <hi>her
Mother: Never had a Lady so charming a
Person, or so bewitching a sweetness and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in her humour: I have heard say she
had a singular sprightliness in her Countenance,
and not like the common</hi> English <hi>Beauties.</hi> 
               <q>I
think, <hi>says Madam Cleve,</hi> I have been told
she was born in <hi>France.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>They that fancy so
are mistaken,</hi> replys the Queen-Dauphin,
<hi>and I will tell you the Story of her in a very
few words</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:53905:54"/>
She was of a good Family in <hi>England,
Henry</hi> the 8th had been in love with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Sister; and it was suspected she
might be his Daughter. She came into <hi>France</hi>
with <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th's Sister, who was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
being youthful and gallant, was loth to
leave the Court of <hi>France</hi> at the death of her
Husband: <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> whose love for the
<hi>French</hi> Court was equal to her Mistresses, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
not to quit it. The late King fell in
love with her, and she was made Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Queen <hi>Claudia:</hi> This Queen dying,
the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> the King's Sister, Duchess
of <hi>Alanson,</hi> and since Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> took
her into her Service, where she receiv'd some
Tincture of the reformed Religion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
she return'd into <hi>England,</hi> and charm'd
all that saw her; she sung well, and danc'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently:
They made her one of Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi>'s
Maids of Honour, and <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th fell desperately in love with her.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> his Favourite and prime
Minister, was ill satisfi'd with the Emperour,
for not having favour'd his pretensions to the
Papacy; and to be reveng'd of him, resolv'd
to unite the King his Master to the <hi>French.</hi>
To effect this, he suggested to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th
that his Marrriage with the Emperour's Aunt
was Null; and propos'd for a Wife to him
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53905:54"/>
the Duchess of <hi>Alanson,</hi> whose Husband
was lately dead. <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> had Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough to look upon the Divorce of King
<hi>Henry</hi> from <hi>Katherine,</hi> as a means to make
way for her into the Throne: She began to
give the King some Impressions of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
Perswasion, and engag'd the late King
here, to favour at <hi>Rome</hi> the Divorce of
<hi>Henry,</hi> in hopes of his marrying the Duchess
of <hi>Alanson.</hi> Cardinal <hi>wolsey,</hi> to have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to treat of this Affair, prevailed
with King <hi>Henry</hi> to send him into <hi>France</hi> on
other business; but he was so far from giving
him power to propose that Marriage, that he
sent him express Order to <hi>Calais</hi> not to speak
of it.</p>
            <p>At his return from <hi>France,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>
was receiv'd with honours equal to those
they would have done to the King: Never
did Favourite carry on Pride and Vanity to
so high a Pitch: He mannag'd an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
between the two Kings at <hi>Bulloigne.
Francis</hi> the 1st would have given the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, but he would not
take it: they treated one another by turns
with extraordinary Magnificence, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
each other with Habits equal to those
they had caus'd to be made for themselves:
I have heard it said, those the late King sent
the King of <hi>England</hi> were of Crimson-Sattin,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53905:55"/>
beset all over with Pearls and Diamonds,
and a Robe of white Velvet embroider'd
with Gold. After some days stay at <hi>Bulloigne,</hi>
they went to <hi>Callis; Anne Bullen</hi> was Lodg'd
in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's Court, with the Train of
a Queen, and <hi>Francis</hi> the 1st made her the
same Presents, and did her the same Honour,
as if she had been actually so. At last, after
a Passion of nine years continuance, <hi>Henry</hi>
the 8th married her, without staying for the
dissolution of his first Marriage, which he
had a long time demanded at <hi>Rome.</hi> The
Pope hastily thunder'd Excommunications
against him, which provok'd the King so
highly, that he declar'd himself Head of the
Religion, and drew <hi>England</hi> after him into the
Change ye now see.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> enjoy'd not her Grandeur
long; for when she thought it surest by the
death of Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> one day as she
was seeing, with the whole Court, a Match
made by the Viscount <hi>Rochfort</hi> her Brother,
to run at the Ring; the King was suddenly
struck with so furious a jealousie, that he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
left the Show, and went straight to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
having left order for arresting the
Queen, the Viscount <hi>Rochfort,</hi> and several
others whom he thought Lovers or Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of that Princess: though in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
this jealousie of the Kings seem'd to owe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53905:55"/>
its Birth to that moment, the truth is, it had
been inspir'd into him some time before by
the Viscountess <hi>Rochfort,</hi> who was not able to
bear with patience the great intimacy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Queen and her Husband the Vsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
represented it to the King as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and incestuous: So that he being already
in love with <hi>Iane Seymour,</hi> thought no more
of <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> but to get rid of her. In
less than three Weeks he caus'd the Queen
and her Brother to be try'd, had them both
beheaded, and marry'd <hi>Iane Seymour.</hi> He
had afterwards several other Wives, whom
he put away, or put to death; and among
the rest the Lady <hi>Katherine Howard,</hi> whose
Confident the Countess <hi>Rochfort</hi> was, and
shar'd in her Fate, having her Head cut off
with her Mistress's: Thus was she punish'd for
falsly accusing <hi>Anne Bullen;</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th dy'd, being grown prodigiously big and
fat.</p>
            <p>All the Ladies present thank'd the Queen-Dauphin
for the account she had given
them of the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and among
the rest Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> who could not
forbear asking her several Questions about
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen-Dauphin had Pictures in little
drawn for her of all the Beauties of the
Court, to be sent to the Queen her Mother.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53905:56"/>
One day as that of Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s was
finishing, the Queen-Dauphin spent the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
with her. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
who let slip no opportunity of seeing Madam
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> (yet without letting it appear he
sought it,) faild not being there: She was
that day so beautiful, it would have made him
in love with her, had he not been so; yet he
durst not fix his Eye upon her as her Picture
was a drawing, being fearful notice might
be taken of the pleasure he took to view her
now and then as she sat.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Dauphin ask'd Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve</hi> for a Picture in little he had of his
Wife, to compare it with that which was
newly drawn of her: Every one pass'd their
Judgment of the one and the other, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> order'd the Picture-drawer to
mend something in the Draught of the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geer
of that which Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had
brought in. The Picture-drawer, to satisfie
her, took it out of the Case; and having
mended it, laid it on the Table.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had long wish'd for
a Picture of Madam <hi>de Cleve:</hi> when he saw
that of her, which was Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s,
he could not resist the longing desire he had
to steal it from a Husband he believ'd she
tenderly lov'd; and thought among so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Persons in the Room he might be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53905:56"/>
suspected to have done it as another.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Dauphin was set on the Bed,
and whisper'd to Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> who stood
before her: Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> through the
Curtains which were but half drawn, spy'd
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> with his Back to the
Table at the Beds-feet; and perceiv'd him,
without turning his Face, steal something
slily that was on the Table: She quickly
guess'd it might be her Picture, and was so
troubled at it, that the Queen-Dauphin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
she heard her not, and ask'd her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
what it was she look'd at. At those
words Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> turn'd about,
and saw Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s Eye still fix'd
upon him, and thought it not impossible but
she might have seen what he had done.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was not a little perplext:
Reason would she should ask for her Picture,
yet to ask for it publickly, was to tell all the
World the kindness that Prince had for her;
and to ask for it privately, was to engage him
to declare to her the Passion he had for her:
At last she resolved it the best course to let
him carry it away, without taking notice of
it, and was glad to grant him a favour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing whether she had done it. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> having observ'd her disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and guessing at the Cause, came up and
whisper'd to her; <hi>If you have seen what I
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53905:57"/>
have ventur'd to do, Madam, be so good to let
me believe you are ignorant of it, which is all I
dare beg of you:</hi> With that he withdrew,
without expecting her Answer.</p>
            <p>The Queen-Dauphin went out a walking,
attended with all the Ladies, and Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> went home to lock himself in
his Closet, to enjoy the pleasure he took in
having a Picture of Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s,
which fill'd him with joy too great and too
delicate to be express'd in publick: It gave
him a taste of the highest sweetness Love
can afford; he was in love with the most
amiable Person of the Court, and saw she
lov'd him though against her will, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover'd in all her Actions that trouble
and disorder which Love produces in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
of Youth.</p>
            <p>That Evening great search was made for
the Picture: Having found the Case it was
us'd to be kept in, they never suspected it
had been stollen, but thought it might have
been fallen out by chance. Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve</hi> was much troubled at the loss of it,
and when they had long search'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
finding it, he told his Wife, (but in such
a manner as made it appear he did not think
so,) That she had without doubt some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Lover, to whom she had given that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
or who had stole it; and that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53905:57"/>
but one in love would not have been
content with the Picture without the Case.</p>
            <p>These words, though spoken in jeast, made
a deep impression in Madam <hi>de Cleve;</hi> they
troubled her extremely, and made her reflect
with regret on the violence of her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours:</hi> she found she
was no longer Mistress of her Words, or her
Countenance: She thought <hi>Lignerolles</hi> was
return'd, that there was no further fear of
the Affair with <hi>England,</hi> nor any cause to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Queen-Dauphin; that, in a word,
there was not any thing to help her against
the violence of her Passion; and that there
was no safety to be expected, but by absent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her self from Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi> But
leave being requested to be obtain'd for her
absence from Court, where her Husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided,
and a pretence wanting, she was in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great extremity, and ready to fall into that
she thought the worst of misfortunes, to let
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> see the inclination she
had for him. She thought of all Madam <hi>de
Chartres</hi> on her Death-bed had said to her,
and the Advice she had given her, to undergo
any difficulty, rather than engage in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
of Gallantry. She remember'd what
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had said to her of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
sincerity, when he spoke of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Tournon;</hi> and she thought it her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53905:58"/>
to confess to him the inclination she had
for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi> These thoughts
possess'd her a considerable time, at length
she was astonish'd she could entertain any
that appear'd so foolish, and relaps'd into her
former perplexity; not knowing what course
to take.</p>
            <p>The Peace was sign'd, and the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
after much resistance, resolv'd to obey
the King her Father: The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had
been appointed to Marry her in the Name of
His Catholick Majesty, and was shortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
They look'd every day for the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had newly marry'd the King's
Sister; the Nuptials being appointed to be
kept at the same time the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
should be marry'd to the Proxy of <hi>Spain.</hi> The
King's greatest care was to Grace these Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
with Sports and Divertisements,
wherein he might make appear the Address
and Magnificence of his Court. Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
were made for Balletts and Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but the King thought those Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
too private, and resolved to have such
as should be more Splendid and Noble.</p>
            <p>That which he made choice of was, a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Tournament, to which Strangers might
be invited, and the People be Spectators.
The Princes and young Lords approv'd high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the King's design, especially the Duke of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53905:58"/>
               <hi>Ferrara,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> who were the most excellent at
these sorts of Exercises; and the King made
choice of them to be with him the four Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of the Tournament.</p>
            <p>Proclamation was made throughout the
Kingdom, that the 15th of <hi>Iune,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi>
His most Christian Majesty, and the Princes,
<hi>Alphonso d'Est,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara, Francis</hi> of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> would hold an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Tourney against all comers: The first
Combat on Horseback in the Lists, doubly
Arm'd, to break four Lances, and one for
the Ladies: The second Combat with
Swords; one to one, or two to two, as the
Masters of the Camp should order: The
third Combat on Foot; three Pushes of Pike,
and six Hits with the Sword: The Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to furnish Lances, Pikes, and Swords,
at the Assailants choice: Whoever mannag'd
not his Horse in the Carreer, to be put out
of the Lists: That there should be four Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Camp, to give Orders; the Assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
who should break most Lances, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
best, to carry the Prize; the value
whereof to be at the discretion of the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
That all the Assailants, as well <hi>French</hi>
as Strangers, should be oblig'd openly, to lay
Hand on one, or more, (at their choice) of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53905:59"/>
the Shields that should hang at a Pillar at
the end of the Lists, where an Officer of
Arms should be ready to receive them, and
Inroll them according to their Quality, and
the Shields they had handled: That the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants
should be bound to cause their Shields,
and Arms, to be brought by a Gentleman,
and hung up at the Pillar three days before
the beginning of the Tourney, on pain of
not being received without the special leave
of the Defendants.</p>
            <p>A great List was made, reaching from the
<hi>Chate aude Tournells,</hi> cross S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Street
to the King's Stables. There were on both
sides Scaffolds, and Theatres, with cover'd
Galleries very pleasing to the sight, and that
would hold an infinite of People. The
Princes and great Lords, made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to provide what might be necessary, to
appear there in Splendor, and to have in their
Cyphers and Devises, something of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
relating to the Ladies they lov'd.</p>
            <p>A few days before the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
the King made a Match at Tennis
with Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de
Guise,</hi> and the Vidame <hi>de Chartres.</hi> The
Queen, attended with the Ladies of the
Court, and (among the rest) Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> went to see them play: The Game be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended, as they went out of the Tennis-Court,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53905:59"/>
               <hi>Chastelart</hi> came up to the Queen-Dauphin,
and told her he had by chance hit
upon a Letter of Gallantry fallen out of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi>'s Pocket. This Queen,
who always had a Curiosity for any thing
that concern'd Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> bid
<hi>Chastelart</hi> give it her: He did so, and she fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
the Queen her Mother-in-Law, who
was going with the King to see them work
at the Lists. They had not been long there,
but the King sent for some Horses he had
lately caus'd to be taken in, and though they
were not throughly mannag'd, the King
would Mount one of them, and order'd his
Attendants to Mount the rest: The fiery'st
and highest-mettl'd of them fell to the King's
share, and Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>'s: Their
Horses would have presently fallen fowl on
one another. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> for fear
of hurting the King, recoil'd briskly, and
ran back his Horse against a Post, with that
violence it made him stagger: The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ran in presently to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
thinking him grievously hurt. Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> was more sensible of it than any other,
and thought him worse hurt: She was so
much concern'd, she never thought of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the apprehension and trouble it put her
in; she went to him with the Queens, but
with a Countenance so chang'd, one less
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53905:60"/>
concern'd than the Chevalier <hi>de Guise</hi> might
have easily perceiv'd it. He quickly observ'd
it, and minded more the condition she was
in then, than that of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours'S.</hi>
The violence of the Justle had so stunn'd the
Prince, he stood a while leaning his Head on
those that supported him: When he held it
up, he presently spy'd Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and
discover'd in her looks the pity she had of
him; and look'd on her in such a manner,
as made her easily comprehend how sensible
he was of it. Afterwards he thank'd the
Queens for the goodness express'd towards
him, and excus'd the condition he had been
in before them. This done, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to go to rest.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> being recover'd of the
fright she had been in, reflected quickly on
the Evidence she had given of it. The Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>de Guise</hi> presently put her out of the
hopes she had no body had taken notice of
it, giving her his Hand to lead her out of
the Lists; <hi>I have more cause to complain,</hi> says
he, <hi>Madam, than Monsieur</hi> de Nemours:
<hi>Pardon me if, for a moment, I forget the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
respect I have always had for you, to let
you see how I grieve at Heart for what my
Eyes have but now discover'd: 'Tis the first
time I have taken the boldness to speak to you,
and it shall be the last: Death, or an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53905:60"/>
absence, will remove me from a place I can
no longer live in; having now lost the sorry
comfort I had, in believing all those who durst
look on you were as unfortunate as I.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> answer'd, as if she had
not understood him: She would have been
offended another time at any Declaration he
should have made of his affection for her,
but that moment her thoughts were wholly
drown'd in a deep affliction for the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he had made of her kindness for Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours.</hi> The Chevalier <hi>de Guise</hi> was so
throughly convinc'd of it, and so heartily
troubled at it, he took a resolution never to
think more of obtaining her love. But to
quit an Enterprize that appear'd so difficult
and glorious, he must pitch on another great
enough to fill the room the former had taken
up in his thoughts. He had formerly entertain'd
some thoughts of the taking of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> and
when Death took him out of the World in the
Flower of his Youth, when he had gain'd the
Reputation of one of the greatest Princes of
his time; the only grief he express'd for
leaving the World, was, he had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to put in execution so noble a Resolution,
the success whereof he thought infallible,
through the care he had taken for it.</p>
            <p>When Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was gone out of
the Lists, she went to the Queen's Lodgings,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53905:61"/>
full of the thoughts of what had newly
happen'd. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> came in
presently after, in a very Magnificent Habit,
and like one no way sensible of the late Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
but in appearance more gay and jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
than ordinary: His joy for what he
thought he had lately discover'd, gave his
Countenance an Air, made him appear hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer,
(if possible,) than formerly. The
Company was surpriz'd at his entrance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one ask'd him how he did, except Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> who staid near the Chimney,
as if she had not seen him: The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of his Closet saw him among the
rest, and call'd him to have some discourse
of his Adventure. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
passing by Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> said to her very
low, <hi>I have this day receiv'd some marks of
your pity, Madam; but they were not such as
I am most worthy of.</hi> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, that Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the concern she was in for him; and
his words sufficiently confirm'd the truth of
her thoughts. It troubled her extremely she
had been so little Mistress of her Sentiments,
as not to have been able to conceal them from
the Chevalier <hi>de Guise.</hi> It added to her grief
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had discover'd them,
yet this grief was not so pure, but it had a
mixture of pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:53905:61"/>
The Queen-Dauphin, impatiently desirous
to know the Contents of the Letter <hi>Chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lart</hi>
had given her, went to Madam <hi>de Cleve,
Go read this Letter,</hi> says she, <hi>it is address'd
to Monsieur</hi> de Nemours; <hi>and in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was sent him by the Mistress for whom
he hath quitted all others: If you cannot read
it at present, keep it, and bring it me at
Night as I go to Bed, and tell me if you know
the Hand.</hi> With that, the Queen-Dauphin
left Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> but so surpriz'd and
astonish'd, she could not a while stir out of
her place: It put her into that impatience
and trouble, she was not able to stay at the
Queen's Lodgings; but went home, though
long before her usual hour of retirement.
Her Hand trembled as she held the Letter,
her thoughts were perplext, and extremely
disorder'd; and the trouble she was in no
less new than insupportable: As soon as she
got into her Closet, she open'd the Letter,
and found it to this effect.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>The LETTER.</head>
                  <p>I have lov'd you too well, to let you believe
the change you observe in me is an effect of
Lightness; I am going to tell you, your Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
is the cause of it; you will be surpriz'd
I charge you with unfaithfulness: you have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53905:62"/>
kept it from me so cunningly, and I have been
at so much pains to conceal from you my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, you have reason enough to be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
at the discovery. I wonder at my self I
have been able so long, not to let you know
something of it. Never was affliction equal
to mine, I believ'd you had for me a violent
Passion; I scrupl'd as little the owning that I
had for you. The very time I made you a full
discovery of it, I found my self deceiv'd, that
you were in love with another, and in all
appearance made a Sacrifice of me to your new
Mistress: I came to the knowledge of it the
day you ran at the Ring, which was the cause
I was not at the Sight: To hide the disorder
of my mind, I feign'd my self sick, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
became really so; my Body being too weak to
support and endure the violent agitations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
me: when I began to recover, I still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
my self very ill, to furnish my self
with an Excuse for not seeing, or writing to
you. I was willing to have time to resolve how
to deal with you; I took, and I quitted, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times the same resolutions: At last I thought
you unworthy to be made acquainted with my
grief, and resolv'd you should not know it. I
was willing to bring down your pride, by letting
you see my Passion (of it self) grow weaker
and weaker: I thought it the way to lessen the
value of the Sacrifice you made of me, and was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53905:62"/>
loth you should have the pleasure of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more amiable in the Eyes of another, by
shewing her how deeply I lov'd you: I resolv'd
my Letters to you should be cold and indifferent,
that she you gave them to might perceive (or
imagine at least) my Love at an end: I was
unwilling she should have the pleasure to find I
knew she triumph'd over me, or the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to set off her triumph with my despair,
and my reproaches: To break with you, I
thought too small a punishment for you; and
that it would have troubled you but little to find
I lov'd you no longer, when you had first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
me. I knew it necessary you should love
me, to feel the smart of not being lov'd, which
afflicted me so sore. I was of opinion, if any
thing could make you love me as you had
done, it must be to let you see my affection was
chang'd; but so to let you see it as if I would
have hid it from you, and had not the power to
own it to you. This resolution I adher'd to,
I found it difficult to take, and (when I saw
you) I thought it impossible to execute. I was
an hundred times ready to break out into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and Lamentations: My indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
serv'd me for a disguise, to hide from you
the affliction and trouble I was in. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
I found pleasure in dissembling with you,
as you did with me: But it went so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Grain, to tell you, or write to you,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53905:63"/>
that I lov'd you; you quickly perceiv'd I had no
mind to let you see my affection was alter'd:
This touch'd you, you complain'd; I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to confirm you in an opinion of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
but it was in a way so strange, and so
forc'd, it convinc'd you the more I had no more
love for you. In a word, I did all I intended
to have done: the further I fled from you, the
more eagerly you sought me, so fantastical was
your humour; this gave me all the pleasure a
full revenge is capable to bestow: It was clear
to me you lov'd me more than ever, and I let
you see I had no love for you: you gave me
cause to believe you had entirely abandon'd her,
for whose sake you had forsaken me; and I had
some reason to think you had never spoke to her
of me, but your Repentance and Discretion
could not make amends for your Lightness and
Inconstancy: your affection hath been divided
between me and another, and you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
me: This is enough to take away all the
pleasure of being lov'd by you, as I thought I
deserv'd, and to make me persist in the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have taken never to see you more, which
so much surprises you.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> read the Letter again
and again, yet knew not what she read:
she perceiv'd only, Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
was not so in love with her as she had thought,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53905:63"/>
but lov'd others, who were no less deceiv'd
in him than she. What a Discovery was
this for a Person of her humour, who had a
violent Passion, who had newly given Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it to a Man she judg'd unworthy of
it; and to another she us'd ill for love of
him! Never was grief so cutting as hers;
she imputed the sharpness of it to that days
adventures, and that if Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
had not had occasion to believe she
lov'd him, she would not have car'd for his
loving another: Yet she did but deceive her
self, the Disease she was sick of, and thought
so intollerable, was Jealousie, with all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Attendants: This Letter discover'd to
her a piece of Gallantry Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
had long been engag'd in. She saw the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
who had written the Letter, was a Person
of Wit and Merit; she thought her one that
deserv'd his love, and of more courage than
her self; and envy'd the power she had to
conceal her Passion from Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:</hi>
The close of the Letter gave her
cause to believe that Person thought her self
lov'd; she was presently of opinion the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion
that Prince had made shew of to her,
and she had been so taken with, was perhaps
but the effect of his Passion for the other,
whom he fear'd to displease. In a word, all
her thoughts were so many torments, to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53905:64"/>
heighten her affliction, and occasion despair.
What Reflections did she make on her self,
and the Counsels her Mother had given her!
How did she repent her not having persisted
in her Resolution of quitting the World,
though without the leave of Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve;</hi> or her not having pursu'd the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
she had of confessing to him the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
she had for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours?</hi> She
thought she had better have discover'd it to a
Husband, whose goodness she was assur'd of,
and who would have been concern'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
it; than to have let a Man know it who
was altogether unworthy of it, who deceiv'd
her, and perhaps made a Sacrifice of her;
and car'd no more for her love, than to have
matter thence to feed his Pride and Vanity.
In a word, she thought no greater mischief
could befall her, nor she have done worse,
than to have given Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to believe she lov'd him; and to have
since found he was in love with another. All
the comfort she had, was, to believe, that
having discover'd his falseness, it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cure her of the inclination she had for
him.</p>
            <p>She never thought of the order the Queen-Dauphin
had given her, to be with her at
her going to Bed; but went to Bed her self,
pretending she was ill: so that when Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53905:64"/>
               <hi>de Cleve</hi> came from the King, they told
him she was asleep; but she was far enough
from being so well at rest, afflicting her self
all Night, and reading over the Letter she had
in her Hand.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was not the sole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
this Letter disturb'd. The <hi>Vidame de
Chartres,</hi> who in truth had lost it, was in no
small trouble for it: He had pass'd that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
at the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s, who had
treated at Supper, his Brother-in-Law, the
Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and all the young People
of the Court. As Fortune would have it,
they discours'd at Supper of Letters; the
<hi>Vidame</hi> told them, he had about him the
finest that ever was writ: They press'd him
to shew it, but he deny'd. Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
insisted he had no such Letter, and that
he talk'd vainly. The <hi>Vidame</hi> answer'd, he
put him very hard to't, yet he would not
shew him the Letter, but would read part of
it, which would give them cause to judge
few Men receiv'd the like. Having said this,
he would have taken out the Letter, but could
not find it: He search'd for it, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
the Company jear'd him as if he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any such; but he was so vex'd at the
loss, that they forbore speaking further of it.
He retir'd before the rest of the Company,
and with great impatience went home, to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53905:65"/>
search for the Letter he miss'd. As he was
in search of it, a Page of the Queens came to
tell him that the Viscountess <hi>d' Usez</hi> had
thought it necessary to give him speedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
that at the Queens Lodgings they
discours'd of a Letter of Gallantry dropp'd
out of his Pocket as he was at Tennis: That
they had recited part of what was written in
it; that the Queen seem'd very desirous to
see it; that she had sent to one of her Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
for it, but he answer'd he had given
it <hi>Chastelart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Page added other Particulars which
heighten'd the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s trouble. He went
presently to a Gentleman who was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
with <hi>Chastelart,</hi> and (though at a
very unseasonable hour) made him get up
out of Bed, to go ask <hi>Chastelart</hi> for the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
without letting him know who enquir'd
for it, or had lost it. <hi>Chastelart</hi> fully possest
the Letter belong'd to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
and that he was in love with the Queen-Dauphin,
made no doubt but he had sent in
search of it, and with a malicious joy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
he had deliver'd it to the Queen-Dauphin.
The Gentleman brought the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
this Answer, which added to his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
After long debate what course to take,
he saw Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was the only
Person could help him out of the trouble he
was in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53905:65"/>
He went to his House, and enter'd his
Chamber at peep of Day: The Prince was
fast asleep, the kindness of Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
the day before having given him such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thoughts, that he rested very sweetly
that Night. He was surpriz'd to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
awaken'd by the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
and ask'd him if it was to be reveng'd of
him for what he had said at Supper, that he
was come thus early to break his rest? The
<hi>Vidame</hi>'s looks gave him quickly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his business was very serious; <q>I am
come, <hi>says he,</hi> to trust you with the most
important Affair of my Life: I know very
well you are not oblig'd to me for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
because I do it in a time I stand in
need of your help; but I am satisfi'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
I should have lost your esteem, had I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
you with what I am going to tell
you, without being forc'd to it by absolute
necessity. I have dropp'd the Letter I spoke
of yesterday, it concerns me extremely, no
one should know it was address'd to me.
Several who were at the Tennis-Court ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday,
where I dropp'd it, have seen it.
You were there, and I beg the favour you
would own you have lost it. Sure, <hi>says
Monsieur</hi> de Nemours, <hi>smiling,</hi> you think
I have not such a thing as a Mistress in the
World, that you can make me a Proposal of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53905:66"/>
this Nature, as if there were not a Person
living would fall out with me upon notice
of my receiving Letters of that sort.</q> 
               <q>I
pray, Sir, <hi>says the Vidame,</hi> be serious: If
you have a Mistress, (as I question not but
you have, though I know her not,) you
will easily justifie your self, and I will put
you in an infallible way for it: If you should
not justifie your self, the worst you can
fear is a short falling out: My case is much
worse; by this unlucky Adventure, I shall
dishonour a Person who hath passionately
lov'd me, and is one of the most Enestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Women of the World; besides, I shall
procure my self her implacable hatred to the
certain ruine of my Fortune, and perhaps
something more.</q> 
               <q>I understand you not,
<hi>answers Monsieur de Nemours;</hi> but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
methinks to discover the reports we
have had of a great Princess being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for you, are not without ground.
They are not, <hi>replys the Vidame,</hi> but I
wish they had been so; I should not have
been then in the trouble you see me in. I
will tell you all, to convince you what a
condition I am in.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ever since I came to Court the Queen
hath been pleas'd to use me with particular
favour, and hath given me cause to believe
she hath kindness for me: Yet so, that I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53905:66"/>
never entertain'd any thought of her but
what was full of respect. I was deeply in
love with Madam <hi>de Themines;</hi> you who
have seen her, may easily judge it was not
strange any one should love her, if she lov'd
him as she did me. Near two years since,
the Court being at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> I was two
or three times in discourse with the Queen
when there was very little company: I
thought my sense pleas'd her, and that she
approv'd what-ever I said. One day she fell
into a Discourse of Confidence; I told her
there was not a Person in the World I could
entirely confide in, that I found many had
repented of having done it, and that I
knew several things I had never spoken of.
The Queen told me, she esteem'd me the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for't, that she had not found a Person
in <hi>France</hi> could keep a Secret; and that
nothing troubl'd her more, because it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
her of the pleasure of having a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident;
than which nothing more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
especially for those of her Quality:
She fell several times after into the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and made me acquainted with very
particular Passages: At last I thought she
had a mind to learn some Secret of mine,
and to trust me with hers: I was so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this distinguishing favour, it engag'd
me strictly to her, and I made my Court to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53905:67"/>
her with more assiduity than ordinary. One
Evening the King, and the Ladies, went on
Horseback into the Forrest to take the Air;
the Queen went not, being a little indispos'd,
I staid to wait on her, she walk'd down to
the Pond side, and to be at more liberty,
would not be handed by the Gentlemen-Ushers:
Having taken a turn or two, she
came to me and bid me follow her: <hi>I would
speak with you,</hi> says she, <hi>and by what I shall say
to you, you will find I am your Friend.</hi> She
stopp'd there, and look'd earnestly on me;
<hi>You are in love,</hi> says she, <hi>and because you have
made no one your Confident, you think your love
is not known; but it is, and to Persons who
are concern'd at it: You are observ'd, the place
where you see your Mistress is discover'd, and
there is a design to surprize you: I know not
your Mistress, nor do I ask you who she is; but
would arm you against the Plots that are laid
for you.</hi> Observe, Sir, what a Snare this
was from a Queen, and how hard to escape:
She had a mind to know if I was in love,
and not asking whom I lov'd, but letting me
see her pure intentions of doing me a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
she put it out of my thoughts to suspect
her of Curiosity, much less of Design.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But against all probability, I came to a
discovery of the truth, I was in love with
Madam <hi>de Themines;</hi> but though she lov'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53905:67"/>
me, I was not so happy to have particular
places to see her, or to fear a surprize. I
easily saw 'twas not she the Queen spoke of:
I knew well enough I had some concern of
Gallantry with a Woman less handsome,
and less severe than Madam <hi>de Themines,</hi>
and it was not impossible the place I us'd to
meet her might have been discover'd; but
that was a business I so little car'd for, I
could easily prevent any danger, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
to see her: Thus I resolv'd not to
confess any thing to the Queen, but assur'd
her I had long laid aside the desire of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the love of Women, where I might
hope for success, having found them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all unworthy the Engagement of an
honest Man; and that I was now altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for something above them.</q> 
               <hi>You do
not answer me truly,</hi> replys the Queen, <hi>I am
assur'd of the contrary. The manner of my
speaking to you, should oblige you to hide no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from me. I am willing,</hi> adds she, <hi>you
should be one of my Friends, but not willing
(having taken you into that Number) to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
how you are engag'd. See whether the
Place of being my Friend be too dear at the
Price of making me your Confident: I give you
two days to think on't, but after that time I
expect your answer; and remember, if I find
you deceive me, I shall never pardon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:53905:68"/>
               <q>Having said this, the Queen left me,
without expecting my answer: You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
she had said enough to employ my
thoughts: I did not think the two days she
had allowed me too long a time to come to
Resolution. I saw she was willing to know
if I was in love, and that she did not much
desire I should be so. I consider'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of the Engagement I was entring
into. My Vanity was tickl'd with the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of having a particular Intrigue with a
Queen, and a Queen whose Person is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
amiable: On the other side, I lov'd
Madam <hi>de Themines,</hi> and could not find
in my Heart to break with her quite; though
I committed a Petty-Treason against her, by
my Engagement with the other I formerly
told you of. I apprehended the danger I
should expose my self to, if I deceiv'd the
Queen, and how hard it would be to do it:
Yet I could not resolve to refuse what For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
offer'd me, but was willing to run the
hazard of any thing my ill Conduct might
bring upon me: I broke with that Woman
where I fear'd a discovery, and was in
hopes to conceal the intelligence I held
with Madam <hi>de Themines.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the two days end I enter'd the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where the Queen was with all the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
about her; she said aloud, and with a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53905:68"/>
Gravity that surpriz'd me,</hi> Have you thought
of the Business I gave you in Charge, and found
out the truth of it? <hi>Yes, Madam,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
I, <hi>and 'tis as I told your Majesty.</hi>
Come in the Evening when I am a writing, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
she,</hi> and you shall have further order.
<hi>Having made a profound Reverence, I
withdrew without further answer, and fail'd
not to attend at the hour assign'd: I found
her in the Gallery, with her Secretary and
one of her Women: As soon as she saw me,
she came to me and took me to the other
end of the Gallery:</hi> Well, <hi>says she,</hi> upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thoughts, have you nothing to say to me?
And my usage of you, doth it not deserve you
should deal sincerely with me? <hi>My sincerity,
Madam,</hi> reply'd I, <hi>is the cause I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say; and I swear to your Majesty,
with all the respect due to your Majesty, I
have no Engagement with any Woman of
the Court.</hi> I will believe it, <hi>says she,</hi> because I
wish it so; and I wish it, because I desire to have
you entirely mine, and that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
I should be satisfied with your Friendship
if you are in love: there is no trusting those
that are so, there's no relying on their secresie:
the Partiality they have for their Mistresses,
who still take up the first room in their thoughts,
suits not with the manner I would have you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
to me: Remember then that upon your giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53905:69"/>
me your word you are not otherwise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
I Chuse you for my Confident: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I would have you entirely mine, and that
you must have no Friend of either Sex, but
such as I please to allow you; and that you are
to quit all cares, but that of pleasing me. You
shall not lose your Fortune by it, I shall take
more care of it than you can your self; and
whatever I do for you I shall think it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd,
if you answer my expectation of you. I
have made choice of you to make you acquainted
with all my Griefs, and to help me out of them.
You may judge they are no mean ones: I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
in appearance, with very little pain, the
King's Engagement with the Duchess of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinois,</hi>
but 'tis insupportable. She Governs
the King, she deludes him, she cheats him;
she slights me, she hates me, she hath debauch'd
my Servants, they are all at her beck: The
Queen, my Daughter-in-Law, is so proud of her
Beauty, and the Credit of her Uncles, she pays
me no respect. The Constable <hi>Montmorency</hi> is
Master of the King, and his Kingdom: He
hates me, and hath given proofs of his hatred
I shall never forget. The Marshal <hi>St. Andre</hi>
is a fiery young Favourite, who uses me no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the rest; you would pity me, should I
give you a particular account of my misfortunes:
Till now I never durst trust any Man with
them; I trust you, give me no cause to repent
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53905:69"/>
it, and let me have comfort of you. <q>
                  <hi>As she
said these words, her Eyes redden'd: I was
so sensible of the goodness she had express'd
for me, I was going to throw my self at
her Feet. From that day she plac'd entire
confidence in me, and did nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
first advising with me; and I have
ever since maintain'd a Correspondence
which holds to this day.</hi>

PRINCESSE
OF
CLEVE.</head>
            <head>BOOK III.</head>
            <p>
               <q>BUsie as I was, and full of my new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
to the Queen, I held fair
and firm with Madam <hi>de Themines,</hi> by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclination it was not in my power to
vanquish: Yet methoughts she cool'd in
her love of me; and where, had I been
wise, I should have made use of the change
observ'd in her for my Cure; it doubled my
love, and I manag'd it so ill, that the
Queen had some knowledge of it. Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is natural to those of her Nation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that Princess had a greater affection for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53905:70"/>
me than she her self could imagine. At last
the report of my being in love disturb'd and
troubled her to that height, that I thought
my self an hundred times ruin'd in my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
with her: But diligence, submission, and
false Oaths brought me again into favour:
Yet it would not have been in my power to
have deceiv'd her long, had not Madam <hi>de
Themines,</hi> sore against my will, disengag'd
me from her. She made it appear her love
for me was at an end, and I was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of it, that I was forc'd to torment her
no further, but let her alone. A short time
after she writ me the Letter I have lost: by
it I perceiv'd she knew the Commerce I had
with that Woman I told you of, and that
her Change proceeded from thence. Thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
the Queen was well satisfied with
me, being no longer divided as formerly:
But the Sentiments I have for her being not
of a nature to render me incapable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
elsewhere, and Love being not a
thing depends on our Choice, I fell in love
with Madam <hi>de Martigues,</hi> for whom I had
no small inclination, when she was <hi>Villemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar's</hi>
Maid of Honour to the Queen-Dauphin.
I had reason to believe she did
not hate me. The discretion I made shew
of, (she not knowing all the Reasons of it,)
pleas'd her very well: The Queen hath no
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53905:71"/>
suspicion of me on that side, but has on
another account which proves no less trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome:
Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> being every
day at the Queen-Dauphin's, I frequent her
Lodgings oftner than ordinary: the Queen
fancy's I am in love with that Princess.
The quality of Madam <hi>La-Dauphine</hi> being
equal to the Queens, and her beauty and
youth above hers, have made the Queen
jealous even to fury, and fill'd her with a
hatred she can no longer conceal against her
Daughter-in-Law: The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi>
who (I have long thought) aspires the
Queen's favour, and sees me possess a place
he would willingly be in, under pretence of
reconciling the Queens, is become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in the differences between them. I
make no doubt but he hath discover'd the
true Cause of the Queen's anger, and I
believe he does me all kinds of ill Offices,
without letting her see he doth it on design:
This is the state of my present condition;
judge you what effect the Letter I have lost
may produce, which I unfortunately put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Pocket to restore it to Madam <hi>de
Themines.</hi> If the Queen see this Letter,
she will know I have deceiv'd her; and that
almost the same time I deceiv'd her by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Themines,</hi> I deceiv'd Madam <hi>de
Themines</hi> by another: Judge you what she
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53905:71"/>
will think of me then, and whether she
will ever trust my words more. If she see
not the Letter, what shall I say to her?
She knows it hath been given the Queen-Dauphin,
she will believe <hi>Chastelart</hi> knew
her Hand, and that the Letter was hers:
she will imagine her self perhaps the Person,
she that wrote the Letter declares her self
jealous of. In a word, she hath occasion
to think any thing, and there is nothing so
bad but I have cause to fear from her
thoughts: besides; I am heartily concern'd
for Madam <hi>de Martigues,</hi> the Queen-Dauphin
will certainly shew her this Letter,
which she will believe lately writ; thus
shall I be embroyl'd with the Person, whom
of all the World I love most, no less than
with the Person, whom of all the World I
have most cause to fear. See now whether
I have not reason to conjure you to own
the Letter as yours, and to beg the favour
of you to get it out of the Queen-Dauphin's
Hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am very well satisfi'd, <hi>answers Monsieur
de Nemours,</hi> you are sufficiently perplex'd;
and it cannot be deny'd but you very well
deserve it. I have been charg'd with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness
in my Amours, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
at the same time in several Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
but you have so far out-done me, I
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53905:72"/>
durst not have imagin'd what you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken:
Could you pretend to hold fair
with Madam <hi>de Themines,</hi> and keep her
firm to you, being engag'd to the Queen?
Could you hope to engage with the Queen,
and deceive her? She is an <hi>Italian,</hi> and a
Queen, and consequently full of suspicions
of Jealousie, and of Pride. When your
good Fortune, rather than your good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
had set you at liberty from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
you were formerly concern'd in,
you enter'd into new; and fancy'd that in
the midst of the Court you could be in love
with Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> and the Queen
not know it: You could not have been too
careful of taking from her the shame of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made the first motion: she has for you a
violent Passion; you have more discretion
than to tell it me, and I, than to ask you of
it: Certain it is she loves you, and intrusts
you; and the truth is, you are to be blam'd.
Is it your part, Sir, to chide me, <hi>says the
Vidame,</hi> interupting him; and are not you
concern'd to be indulgent to faults within
your Experience?</q> 
               <q>I confess I am to blame,
but think, I conjure you, how to get me
out of this Abyss: I think you must go see
the Queen-Dauphin as soon as she awakes,
and ask her for the Letter as if you had lost
it.</q> 
               <q>I have told you already, <hi>replys Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53905:72"/>
de Nemours,</hi> the thing you propose is
somewhat extraordinary, and there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in it, I am (upon my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
very loth to engage in. But if the
Letter hath been seen to drop out of your
Pocket, how shall I perswade them it
dropp'd out of mine? I thought I had
told you, <hi>says the Vidame,</hi> the Queen-Dauphin
hath been inform'd you had dropp'd
it. How, <hi>replys Monsieur de Nemours,</hi>
hastily, (apprehending the ill consequence
the mistake might be of to him with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve,)</hi> Have they told the Queen-Dauphin
I dropp'd the Letter?</q> 
               <q>Yes, <hi>says
the Vidame,</hi> they have told her so: And
the reason of the mistake is, there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Queen's Gentlemen in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
belonging to the Tennis-Court, where
our Clothes were put up, and your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and mine went together to fetch
them: Then it was the Letter was dropp'd,
those Gentlemen gather'd it up and read it
aloud; some thought it was yours, others
thought it mine: <hi>Chastelart,</hi> who took it,
told me just now, as I ask'd him for it, that
he had given it the Queen-Dauphin as a
Letter of yours: And those who spoke of it
to the Queen, have unfortunately said it
was mine: You may easily do what I desire,
and get me out of this trouble.</q>

Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had ever been a
great lover of the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and
his near relation to Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> made
him love him the more; yet he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
resolve to run the hazard of owning
that Letter: He fell into a deep study, and
the <hi>Vidame</hi> guessing the cause of his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<q>I see well enough, <hi>says he,</hi> you are
afraid of a Broil with you Mistress, and
would make me believe it is the Queen-Dauphin;
but you have so little jealousie
of Monsieur <hi>d' Anville,</hi> I cannot think it is
she. However, 'tis not reasonable you should
sacrifice your Repose to mine, and I will put
you in a way to convince your Mistress the
Letter was directed to me, and not you:
See here a Billet from Madam <hi>d' Amboise,</hi>
who is a Friend of Madam <hi>de Themines,</hi>
and her Confident in the Amours between
me and her: By this Billet Madam <hi>d' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise</hi>
desires me to send her her Friends Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I have lost; the Billet is address'd to me
by Name, and the Contents of it are an
infallible Proof the Letter she desires is
the same they have found. I am content
you should take the Billet and shew it your
Mistress for your justification. I conjure
you not to lose a moments time, but go pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to the Queen-Dauphin's Lodgings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53905:73"/>
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> promis'd to do so,
and took the Billet; yet he design'd not to
see the Queen-Dauphin, but thought he had
business concern'd him more: He made no
doubt but she had tole Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> of
the Letter, and he could not endure a Person
he lov'd so desperately, should have occasion
to believe him engag'd with another.</p>
            <p>He went to her as soon as he thought her
awake, and sent her word he would not have
desir'd the honour to see her at so unseasonable
an hour, but that he had extraordinary busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was a-Bed, troubled
with the sad thoughts she had had all that
Night: she was extremely surpriz'd to hear
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> ask'd for her; that
Nights trouble had made her so froward, she
presently answer'd she was not well, and
could not speak with him.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was not sorry for the
Repulse; he thought it no ill Omen she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
some coldness at a time she had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be jealous: He went to the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and told him he
came from his Ladys, and was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
he could not speak with her, upon busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of consequence that concern'd the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
of <hi>Chartres.</hi> He gave Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve</hi> a short account of the Affair, and he
took him along presently to his Lady's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53905:74"/>
Had she not been in the dark, she could
hardly have conceal'd her trouble and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
to see Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> led
into her Chamber, by her Husband. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Cleve</hi> told her the business was about
a Letter, wherein they wanted her help in
behalf of the <hi>Vidame,</hi> that she was to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> what was to
be done, as for him he must go to the King
who had newly sent for him.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to be alone with Madam <hi>de Cleve;</hi> 
               <q>I
am come to ask you, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> if
the Queen-Dauphin hath not spoken to you
of a Letter <hi>Chastelart</hi> gave her yesterday.</q>
               <hi>She said something to me of it,</hi> answers Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
de Cleve; <hi>but I do not see how my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
can be concern'd in it, being not so much as
nam'd in it.</hi> 
               <q>'Tis true, Madam, <hi>replys Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Nemours,</hi> he is not nam'd in it;
but it was address'd to him, and it highly
concerns him you should get it out of the
Queen-Dauphin's Hands.</q> 
               <hi>I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
says Madam de Cleve, <hi>how it should
concern him to have this Letter seen; and why
it should be ask'd for as his.</hi> 
               <q>If you please to
give me the hearing, Madam, <hi>replys Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Nemours,</hi> I will presently make
you acquainted with the truth; and inform
you of matters of so great importance to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53905:74"/>
the <hi>Vidame,</hi> that I would not have trusted
the Prince of <hi>Cleve</hi> with them, had I not
needed his assistance to have the honour to
see you.</q> 
               <hi>I suppose what you can say to me
will be to small purpose,</hi> says Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
very unconcernedly, <hi>you were better find out the
Queen-Dauphin, and without going so far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
tell her the interest you have in that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for she hath been inform'd it belongs to
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was never better
pleas'd, than to observe some peevishness and
frowardness in <hi>Madam de Cleve</hi>'s discourse; it
delighted him so, he was not very hasty to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself: <q>I know not, <hi>says he,</hi> Madam,
what the Queen-Dauphin hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
but I am not at all concern'd in the
Letter, it was address'd to the <hi>Vidame: I
believe it,</hi> replys Madam de Cleve, <hi>but the
Queen-Dauphin hath been told otherwise; and
it will not appear very probable to her, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the</hi> Vidame<hi>'s should drop out of your
Pocket; for that reason at least you have no
cause that I know of to conceal the truth from
the Queen-Dauphin: I advise you to confess it
to her.</hi> I have nothing to confess to her,
<hi>says he,</hi> the Letter was not address'd to me;
and if there be any one I desire should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
so, 'tis not the Queen-Dauphin. But,
Madam, since this business concerns the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:53905:75"/>
as much as his Fortune is worth, be
pleas'd to be made acquainted with Passages
in themselves worthy your Curiosity.</q> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> by her silence shew'd her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to hear him, and he with all possible
brevity gave her an account of what the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
had told him; though the Passages
were astonishing, and such as deserv'd any
ones attention, Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> heard them
with that coldness and indifferency as if she
had not believ'd them, or at least not been
any ways concern'd for them: she continu'd
in that temper till Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> told
her of the Billet from Madam <hi>d' Amboise</hi> to
the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> which prov'd all he
said to be true. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> knew that
Lady was Madam <hi>de Themines</hi> Friend, and
thought it probable, by what Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> said, the Letter was not address'd to
him. That very thought suddenly, and in
spight of her, put her out of that coldness
and indifferency she had till then been in.
The Prince having read to her the Billet to
justifie himself, presented it to her, telling
her she might know the Character. She
could not forbear taking it, and examining
the Superscription, if address'd to the <hi>Vidame,</hi>
and reading it all over, that she might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judge whether the Letter that was ask'd
for were the same she had. Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:53905:75"/>
added what he thought proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
her, and easily convinc'd her (of a
truth she was very desirous to find) that he
was not concern'd in the Letter.</p>
            <p>She began then to discourse with him of
the trouble and danger the <hi>Vidame</hi> was in, to
blame his ill Conduct, and find means to help
him. She was astonish'd at the Queens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
and confess'd to Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
she had the Letter. In a word, as soon
as she believ'd him innocent, she spoke with
freedom and quietness, of the things she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
scarce vouchsafed to hear; they agreed
the Letter should not be restor'd to the
Queen-Dauphin, for fear she should shew it
Madam <hi>de Martigues,</hi> who knew the Hand
of Madam <hi>de Themines,</hi> and was so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
for the <hi>Vidame,</hi> she would easily guess
it was address'd to him. Besides, they
thought it not proper to acquaint the Queen-Dauphin
with all that concern'd her Mother-in-Law,
the Queen. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was
not a little glad of the Pretence of her Uncle's
concern in the case, to be Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>'s
Confident of the Secrets he imparted
to her.</p>
            <p>The Prince would not have confin'd his
discourse to the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s concern, but from
the liberty he had to entertain her, would
have taken a boldness he never yet durst,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53905:76"/>
had not a Message been brought her, the
Queen-Dauphin had sent for her: Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> was forc'd to retire, and went to
tell the <hi>Vidame,</hi> that after he had left him he
thought it more for the purpose to address
himself to Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> his Niece, than
go directly to the Queen-Dauphin. He want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not Reasons to make him approve of what
he had done, and put him in hopes of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam</hi> de Cleve <hi>the mean time dress'd
her self in all haste to go to the Queen: she
scarce entred the Chamber, but the Queen
call'd her up to her, and whisper'd her she
had look'd for her two long hours, and was
never so perplex'd about disguising a truth as
she had been that Morning.</hi> The Queen, <hi>says
she,</hi> hath heard speak of the Letter I gave you
yesterday, and believes it is the <hi>Vidame de
Chartres</hi> let it fall. You know she may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concern'd on that account: she hath been
in search of the Letter, and caus'd <hi>Chastelart</hi>
to be ask'd for it; he told her he had given it
me: they ask'd me for it under pretence it was
a pretty Letter the Queen had a great mind to
see. I durst not tell her you had it, lest she
should imagine I had given it you on your Uncle
the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s account; and that there might be
a Correspondence betwen me and him. I was
satisfi'd it was a trouble to her he saw me so
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53905:76"/>
often, so that I said the Letter was in the Clothes
I had on yesterday, and that those who had them
in keeping were gone abroad. Give me the
Letter quickly, <hi>adds she,</hi> that I may send it
her, and read it before I send it, to see if I
know the Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam</hi> de Cleve <hi>found her self in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perplexity than she could have expected.</hi>
I know not what you shall do, Madam, <hi>says she;</hi>
for Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> to whom I gave it to
read, hath restor'd it to Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
who came early this Morning to desire
you to let him have it: Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had
so little wit to tell him he had it, and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to yield to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of having it again. You put me into the
greatest trouble I can be in, <hi>answers the Queen-Dauphin,</hi>
and have done very ill to give Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> the Letter you had received
of me, and should not have parted with with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my leave: what would you have me say to
the Queen, and what can she imagine? She
will believe, and not without reason, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concerns me, and that there is some great
matter between the <hi>Vidame</hi> and me: she will
never be perswaded the Letter belong'd to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours.</hi> I am very sorry, <hi>replys
Madam de Cleve,</hi> for the trouble I have caus'd
you, and believe it great as it is; but 'tis the
fault of Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and not mine.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53905:77"/>
'Tis your fault, <hi>says the Queen-Dauphin,</hi> in
giving him the Letter: No woman but your
self makes her Husband acquainted with all she
knows. I believe I did ill, Madam, <hi>answers
Madam de Cleve;</hi> but let us think of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fault, not of examining it. Do not
you remember, pretty near, what was in the
Letter, <hi>says the Queen-Dauphin?</hi> Yes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>replys Madam de Cleve,</hi> I do, having
read it several times over. If so, <hi>says the
Queen-Dauphin,</hi> we must presently have it
written in a strange Hand, and send it the
Queen. She will not shew it those who have
seen it; and if she do, I will maintain it the
same <hi>Chastelart</hi> gave me, and he dares not say
otherwise.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> approved of the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and the more, because it would give her
occasion of sending for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
to have the Letter again, to be Copied word
for word, and pretty near the Hand it was
written in, whereby she thought the Queen
would infallibly be deceiv'd. As soon as she
came home, she told her Husband the trouble
the Queen-Dauphin was in, and pray'd him
to send for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours:</hi> He was
sent for, and came presently. Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> told him all she had inform'd her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
of, and ask'd him for the Letter. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> answer'd he had restor'd it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53905:77"/>
to the <hi>Vidame,</hi> who was so glad of it, that
he sent it immediately to Madam <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>'s
Friend: Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was now
in fresh trouble; having consulted awhile,
they resolved to frame a Letter by memory,
they lock'd themselves up to do it; order was
given at the Gate no person should come in;
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> Attendants were all
sent home; such an appearance of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was no small Charm to Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> and even to Madam <hi>de Cleve:</hi>
Her Husband's being by, and her Uncle being
so deeply concern'd in the matter, satisfi'd all
her scruples: the sight of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
pleas'd her so well, it gave her a joy
so pure and sincere, she never had the like:
This made her so free, and so jovial, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> had never seen her so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and was more passionately in love with
her than ever: He never had a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
time, which made him more lively and
chearful; and when Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> would
begin to think of the Letter and write, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of helping her, in good earnest did but
interrupt her, and speak pleasantly to her:
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was gay as he, so that they
were long lock'd up together, and two Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
were come from the Queen-Dauphin
to bid Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> hasten, before they
had finish'd the Letter half.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:53905:78"/>
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was so willing to
prolong time that pleas'd him so well, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his Friends Interest. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
too was so far from being tyr'd with her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
she forgot the interest of her
Uncle. At last with much ado the Letter
was scarce ready by four a Clock, and so ill
done, and the Character so unlike the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
that the Queen must have taken small
care to find out the truth of it, if they could
have impos'd on her so: But as careful as
they were, and earnest to perswade her, the
Letter was addrest to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours;</hi>
she was not deceiv'd, but fully convinc'd it
belong'd to the <hi>Vidame:</hi> Besides, she believ'd
the Queen-Dauphin concern'd in it, and that
there was a Correspondence between them:
This heightned her hatred against that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to that degree, that she never pardon'd
her, or ceas'd persecuting her, till she had
driven her out of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Vidame</hi> it utterly ruin'd him;
and whether the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hit the way to please her, or that the
adventure of this Letter, having made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
she had been deceiv'd in the <hi>Vidame,</hi>
help'd her to find out other tricks he had
plaid her, certain it is, he never after could
recover her favour; their Correspondence
was broke, and at length she lost him in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53905:78"/>
Conspiracy of <hi>Amboise,</hi> wherein he had a
hand.</p>
            <p>When the Letter was sent to the Queen-Dauphin,
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> went their way. Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> being alone, and no longer supported
with the joy infus'd by the presence of one
she lov'd, was like one newly awak'd out of
a dream; she was astonish'd to consider the
prodigious difference between her condition
the night before, and that she was now in:
she remembred how sharp and how cold she
had appear'd to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> while
she thought the Letter from Madam <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
was addrest to him; and what a calm,
what a pleasure succeeded immediately, as
soon as he had perswaded her the Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
him not: When she reflected how she
reproach'd her self as Criminal, for having
the day before given him only some marks of
her pity, and that by her sharpness this
morning she gave him cause to believe her
jealous (the infallible proof of passion) she
thought she was not her self: when she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
further, Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> easily
saw she knew him in love with her; and
that notwithstanding that knowledge, she
had been so far from using him the worse for
it, even in her Husbands company, that on
the contrary, she had never look'd on him so
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53905:79"/>
favourably, which was the reason Monsieur
<hi>de Cleve</hi> had sent for him to pass the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
together in private: she found she had
something in her held intelligence with
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> that she deceiv'd a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
who of all men least deserv'd it, and
she was asham'd to appear to him that lov'd
her, so little worthy his Esteem; that which
troubled her most, was the thought of her
condition the night past, and what piercing
griefs she was under while she thought Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> was in love with another;
and that she was deceiv'd in him when she
fancy'd her self the object of his passion.</p>
            <p>Never till then had she been acquainted
with the mortal inquietudes of jealousie and
distrust; she had apply'd all her cares to save
her self from being in love with Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> and had not begun to fear his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in love with another: though the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Letter gave her were vanish'd, yet
they left her sensible she might be deceiv'd,
and gave her impressions of jealousie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
she had till then been altogether a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to: she was amaz'd she had not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
how improbable it was a Man so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
towards Women as Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> had always been, could be capable
of a sincere and durable ingagement; she
thought it next to impossible she could ever
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53905:79"/>
be satisfi'd of the truth of his passion, <hi>But
if I should,</hi> says she, <hi>what would I do? would I
endure it? would I answer it? would I ingage
in a piece of Gallantry? would I be false to
Monsieur</hi> de Cleve? <hi>would I be false to my
self? would I, in a word, expose my self to the
deadly sorrows, to the mortifying penitence
Love is attended with? I am vanquish'd, I am
conquer'd by an inclination which sways me,
which drags me along in spight of my heart;
my resolutions are vain; I thought yesterday
all I think now, and act to day quite contrary
to yesterdays resolutions; I must withdraw my
self from the presence of Monsieur</hi> de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<hi>I must go into the Country, how extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
soever my journey appear; and if Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
de Cleve <hi>be obstinate to the contrary, or
to know the reason of it, will it be any harm
to him or my self to let him know it.</hi> She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in this resolution, and staid all that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
at home, without going to enquire
of the Queen-Dauphin, what was become of
the false Letter of the <hi>Vidame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> return'd home,
she told him she had a desire to go into the
Country, that she was not very well, and it
would do her good to take the air: Monsieur
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> in whose eyes she appear'd so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
that he could not imagine her indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
considerable, laught at the proposal, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53905:80"/>
answer'd, she forgot the Marriage of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and the Turnament were night at hand;
and that she had not too much time for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
to appear there with magnificence
equal to that of other Ladies: Her Husbands
reasons alter'd not her mind, she intreated he
would be pleas'd, while he went with the
King to <hi>Compiegne,</hi> she might go to <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,</hi>
a fair House then a building, within
a days journey of <hi>Paris.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>
gave his consent; she went thither with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
not to return quickly; the King took
his Progress for <hi>Compiegne,</hi> intending a short
stay there.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was much griev'd he
had not seen Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> since the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
he had past so pleasantly in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to the strengthening of his hopes; he
was under that impatience to see her again,
that he could not rest; so that when the
King return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> he resolv'd to go to
his Sisters the Duchess of <hi>Mercoeur's</hi> in
<hi>Champagne,</hi> hard by <hi>Colonniers.</hi> He ask'd
the <hi>Vidame</hi> to go with him; he easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
in hopes to see Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> by
going with the <hi>Vidame</hi> to her house.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi> received them with a
great deal of joy, and made it her business to
give them all the pleasures and divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53905:80"/>
of the Country: One day as they
were a Hunting a Buck, Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
lost himself in the Forrest; and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the way, he was told, he was near <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonniers.</hi>
At that word, without further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
or knowing on what design, he
gallop'd away full speed towards <hi>Colonniers.</hi>
As he rode, he came to made. VVays, and
Walks which he thought led him toward the
Castle: At the end of those Walks he found
a Pavillion, with a large Bower on either
side, one whereof open'd towards a Garden
of Flowers, and was separated from the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
only by Pales, the other fac'd a great
VValk in the Park. He entered the Pavillion,
and would have spent time in observing the
beauty of it, but that he saw in the VValk
Monsieur and Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> attended with
a numerous Train of their Domesticks: He
expected not to have found Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve</hi> there, whom he had left with the
King; this made him think of hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
He entered the Bower opening to the
Flower-Garden, as having the convenience
of a door opening to the Forrest, at which,
upon occasion, he might get out: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
observ'd Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
set under the Pavillion, and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks
staying behind in the Park, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no way to come to him, without passing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53905:81"/>
through the place Monsieur and Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> were in, he could not forbear taking
the pleasure of a sight of the Princess, nor
resist the Curiosity of hearkening to her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with a Husband who gave him more
jealousie than any of his Rivals.</p>
            <p>He heard Mounsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> say to his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
<q>But why will you not return to <hi>Paris?</hi>
what is it can keep you here in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
You have of late an inclination for
solitude that amazes me, and troubles me
extremely, because it occasions our separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
besides I see you are more melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than ordinary, and I am afraid you have
some cause of grief.</q> 
               <q>I am not under any
trouble, <hi>says she as one very much perplex'd;</hi>
but there is such a bustle at Court, and such
a multitude of people always at your House,
it is impossible but it should tire both Body
and Soul, and I cannot but desire a place of
retirement and repose.</q> 
               <q>Repose, <hi>answers
he,</hi> is not proper for a Person of your age;
you are both at home and at Court in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that cannot occasion your weariness,
I rather fear you have a desire of living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me.</q> 
               <q>You would do me extreme
wrong, should you think so, <hi>says she, more
and more perplex'd;</hi> but let me beg of you
leave me here.</q> 
               <q>Could you stay here, and
without company, I should be very glad of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53905:81"/>
it; if you could be content not to have about
you that infinite of Visitants that almost ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave you to your self. Ah! Madam,
<hi>crys Monsieur de Cleve,</hi> your Countenance
and your Expressions tell me plainly, you
have reasons to desire to be alone, which I
do not know, but I conjure you to tell me
them: He press'd her long, but could not
prevail with her to tell him, having long
deny'd him in such a manner as still increas'd
his Curiosity: she continued silent a while,
with her Eyes to the Ground; and then
suddenly looking upon him,</q> 
               <q>Force me not,
<hi>says she,</hi> to confess to you a thing I have not the
power to declare, though I have often design'd
it: Think only 'tis not prudent a Woman of
my age, and Mistress of her Conduct should
remain expos'd in the middle of the Court.
What a Prospect have you given me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>crys Monsieur de Cleve,</hi> I do not tell
you what it is, for fear of giving you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?</q>
She answer'd not a word, and her
silence confirming the thoughts of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<q>You tell me nothing, <hi>says he</hi> and
that tells me clearly I am not mistaken. Ah!
Sir, <hi>says she,</hi> falling down on her Knees, I
am going to make a Confession no Woman
ever made to her Husband, yet the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of my Intentions and Conduct give
me power to do it: 'Tis true I have reasons
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53905:82"/>
to absent from Court, and to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Persons of my age are in there: I have
never been guilty of giving any Mark of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and I cannot fear I ever shall, if you allow
me the liberty to retire from Court, or if I
had still Madam <hi>de Chartres</hi> to assist me in
my Conduct: As dangerous as is the course
I take, I take it with joy to preserve my self
worthy of you: I ask your pardon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times if I have any Sentiments displease
you, assure your self my Actions never shall.
Think that to do as I do requires more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and esteem for a Husband than ever
Wife had. Dispose of me, direct me,
have pity on me; and if you can, still love
me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> all the while she spoke
lean'd his Head on his Hand, almost besides
himself, and never thought of making her
rise up from the posture she was in. When
she had done speaking, and he fix'd his Eyes
on her and saw her at his Feet, her Face no
less drown'd in tears, than admirable for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he was ready to dye for grief; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her up in his Arms, <q>Have you pity on
me, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> for I need and deserve
it; and pardon me if in the first Assault of
a grief so violent as mine is, I answer not as
I ought such a proceeding as yours: I think
you more worthy esteem and admiration,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53905:82"/>
than any Woman that ever was; and my
self the most unfortunate of Men. I have
been passionately in love with you from the
first moment I saw you: Neither your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
nor the enjoyment of you, was ever
able to abate it in the least; it continues
still at the height: It was never in my power
to make you in love with me, and I see
now you fear you have inclination for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Who, Madam, is the happy Man that
causes your fear? How long hath he had
the good fortune to please you; what was
it he did to please you; what way did he
find to gain your affection? It was some
comfort to me for my misfortune of failing
it, to think it was impossible for any one to
obtain. Another the while hath done what
I have not been able, and I have at once the
jealousie both of a Husband and a Lover.
But 'tis impossible to retain that of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
after a proceeding like yours; it is
too noble and generous not to give me an
entire assurance of your Virtue, it comforts
me as a Lover: The confidence and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
you have express'd for me, are of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
value: You esteem me sufficiently, to
believe I will not abuse your Confession:
You may, Madam, I will not abuse it, nor
love you the less for it. You render me
unfortunate, by the clearest Evidence of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53905:83"/>
that ever Woman gave a Husband:
But perfect what you begun, Madam, and
let me know who it is you would avoid.
I beseech you do not ask me, <hi>answers she,</hi>
I am resolv'd not to tell you; and I think it
prudent not to give you his Name.</q> 
               <q>Fear
not, Madam, <hi>replys Monsieur de Cleve,</hi> I
am too well vers'd in the World, not to
know Men may be in love with a Woman
though she have a Husband: We are to
hate those that are so, but not to complain
of it; and once more I conjure you to
tell me who it is.</q> 
               <q>'Tis to no purpose to
press me, Sir, <hi>says she,</hi> I have the power to
be silent where I think it my duty not to
speak: impute not to any weakness the
Confession I have made to you. And I had
need of more courage to declare to you that
truth, than to have conceal'd it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> heard every word of
this discourse, and what Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
had said, rais'd no less his jealousie than her
Husband's: He was so desperately in love
with her, he thought all the World was so
too: True it is, he had many Rivals, yet he
fancy'd them more; and he was wild to
know who it was Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> meant.
He had often thought she had some kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for him, but the grounds of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appear'd on this occasion so slight and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53905:83"/>
inconsiderable, that he could not imagine she
had so violent a passion for him, as to need
recourse to so extraordinary a Remedy: He
was so transported he scarce knew what he
saw, but he could not pardon Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve</hi> for not having press'd her home to tell
him the Name of the Person she conceal'd
from him.</p>
            <p>Yet Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> us'd his utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to know it, but finding it vain to
urge her further, desisted from troubling her;
who presently said; <q>Methinks you ought
to rest satisfi'd with my sincerity, pray ask
me no more, and give me not cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
what I have done: Content your self
with the assurance I give you once more,
my Sentiments have never appear'd by any
Action of mine, and that no address hath
been made to me that could give me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</q>
               <q>Ah, Madam, <hi>replys Monsieur de
Cleve,</hi> on the sudden, I cannot believe it:
I remember the trouble you were in the
day your Picture was lost; you have given,
Madam, you have given away that Picture
that was so dear to me, and so justly mine:
You have not been able to conceal your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
you are in love, it is known, your
Virtue hath hitherto sav'd you from the
rest.</q> 
               <q>Is it possible, <hi>crys the Princess,</hi> you
can imagine any diguisement in a Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53905:84"/>
as mine is, which I was no way oblig'd
to. Take my word, Sir, I buy at a dear
rate the confidence I desire of you; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you believe I never gave away my
Picture: True it is I saw it taken, but would
not take notice I saw it, for fear of exposing
my self on that occasion to be told what
none ever yet durst say to me.</q> 
               <q>How
know you then you are lov'd, <hi>says he,</hi>
what evidences has he given you of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?</q>
               <q>Spare me the pains and the trouble,
<hi>answers she,</hi> of telling you particulars I
am asham'd to have observ'd, being such as
have too much convinc'd me of my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>
               <q>You have reason, Madam, <hi>replys
he;</hi> I am unjust, and press you too far; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
me when ever I ask you such Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet be not offended with me for ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Just then came several of the Servants,
(who had staid in the Walks,) to acquaint
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> that a Gentleman was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
from the King, with Orders for him to
be at <hi>Paris</hi> that Evening: Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>
was forc'd to go, and was not able to say any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
to his Wife, but that he desir'd her to
come to <hi>Paris</hi> on the Morrow; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
her to believe that though he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
he had for her a tenderness and esteem,
with which she had reason to be abundantly
satisfi'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:53905:84"/>When the Prince was gone, and Madam
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> left alone, consider'd what she had
done; the thought of it so frighted her, she
could scarce believe the truth of it: She saw
she her self had put her self out of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and esteem of her Husband, and plung'd
her self into a Pit she should never get out of.
She ask'd her self why she had done so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
a thing, and perceiv'd she had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in it, having scarce form'd the design.
The singularity of her Confession, which she
conceiv'd without President, gave her a full
Prospect of her danger. On the other side,
when she consider'd this Remedy (as violent as
it was) was the sole effectual one she could
make use of against Monsieur <hi>de Nemours;</hi>
she thought she had no cause to repent, or to
believe she had ventur'd too far. She pass'd
that Night under a very great incertitude,
trouble, and fear: at last her Spirits were
calmed; she found pleasure in having given
that Evidence of Fidelity to a Husband who
deserv'd it so well, who had so great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
and kindness for her, and had given
fresh proof of both, in the manner of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the strange Confession she had made
him.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was in the mean
time got from the place he had heard the
discourse in, into the middle of the Forrest:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53905:85"/>
What Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> had said of her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
had reviv'd him, by letting him know
he was the Person she had inclination for.
The thought of this swell'd him with joy,
but the joy was short-liv'd: for when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
that what mov'd her to declare she
had inclination for him, convinc'd him the
same moment he should never receive any
Evidence of it, he thought it impossible to
engage a Person who made recourse to so
extraordinary a Remedy; yet he could not
but be very much pleas'd to have reduc'd
her to such an extremity: He glory'd in
himself that he gain'd the affection of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
so different from the rest of her Sex. In a
word, he thought himself a hundred times
happy, and unhappy all together. He was
benighted in the Forrest, and was much puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to find the way to his Sisters, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of <hi>Mercoeur:</hi> He arriv'd there about
break of day, and was very much to seek
what account to give of his absence: He
came off the best he could, and return'd the
same day with the <hi>Vidame</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince was so full of his passion, and
surpriz'd with what he had heard, that he
fell into the common imprudence of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in general terms his particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and relating his own Adventures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
borrow'd Names. In his return he fell
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53905:85"/>
into discourse of Love, and the extreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of being in Love with a person deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it. He spoke of the extravagant effects
of that passion; and not able to conceal the
astonishment he was in at the action of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> he made the <hi>Vidame</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, without naming the person, or
owning himself concern'd; but he spoke
with that heat and admiration, the <hi>Vidame</hi>
easily suspected him one of the parties in the
case, and press'd him to confess it: He told
him he was well assur'd he had a violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for a Lady, though he knew not who,
and that he had no reason to distrust him,
who had trusted him with his life: But
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was too deeply in love
to confess it, and had ever conceal'd his
passion from the <hi>Vidame,</hi> though he lov'd
him best of any man at Court: He answer'd,
that a Friend of his had told him this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;
and not only made him promise
not to speak of it, but conjur'd him to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie.
The <hi>Vidame</hi> assur'd him it should go
no further, but Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had told him so much.</p>
            <p>The mean time Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was
gone to the King, but with a heart mortally
afflicted: Never had Husband so violent a
passion for his Wife, nor so great an Esteem,
which was not diminish'd in the least by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53905:86"/>
what she had told him, but chang'd into a
sort different from the esteem he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had of her: His thoughts were most busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about guessing who it was had the secret
to please her: He thought of Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> as the most amiable of the Court,
and the Chevalier <hi>de Guise,</hi> and the Marshal
S. <hi>Andre,</hi> as persons who had apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to please her, and still continued their
endeavours; so that he was perswaded it
must be one of the three.</p>
            <p>He arriv'd at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and the King took
him into his Closet, to tell him he had made
choice of him to conduct <hi>Madam</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi>
and believed no man could perform it better,
and that no Lady could do <hi>France</hi> more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
than Madam <hi>de Cleve.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve</hi> receiv'd the honour of the Choice as
he ought, and look'd on it as an occasion for
his Wives absence from Court, without
giving suspition of any change of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
but the trouble he was in, needed a
speedier remedy than that Voyage (to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
for some Months) could afford him:
He presently writ Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> the news
of what the King had said to him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he expected she would not fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Paris.</hi> She came thither, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his order; and when they saw one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
they were both extraordinary sad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:53905:86"/>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> spoke to her like a man
of the greatest honour in the world, and
best deserving the confidence she had repos'd
in him: <q>It is not your Conduct, <hi>says he,</hi>
gives me trouble, you have more strength
and more vertue than you imagine: nor
am I troubled with fears of what may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
hereafter; that which troubles me is,
that I see you have that affection for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it has not been in my power to raise
in you: I know not what to answer you,
<hi>says she,</hi> I am mortally asham'd when I speak
to you; let me conjure you to spare this
cruel discourse, order my Conduct, and let
me never see any body: This is all I desire
of you; but take it not ill from me, if I
speak no more of a thing which makes me
appear so little worthy of you, and which
I think so unbecoming me: You have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Madam, <hi>replies he,</hi> I abuse your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and your confidence in me, yet pity
the condition you have brought me to,
and think, though you have told me the
substance of the matter, you conceal from
me a Name that fills me with a Curiosity,
which, if not satisfi'd, will bring me to my
Grave: however, I do not desire you to tell
it me, but I cannot forbear letting you
know, I believe the Man I am to envy is the
Marshal S. <hi>Andre,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Nemours,</hi> or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53905:87"/>
the Chevalier <hi>de Guise.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>I will not answer
you, <hi>says she, blushing;</hi> nor give you occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to diminish, or raise your suspicions:
But if you should try by watching and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
me, to discover the truth, you will
put me into a trouble all the World will take
notice of.</q> 
               <q>A Gods-name, <hi>continues she,</hi>
give me leave to pretend some Indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not to see any one.</q> 
               <q>No, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<hi>says he,</hi> it will quickly be discover'd
to be a feign'd business: Besides, I would
not rely on any thing but your self, my
Heart gives me that is the best course I
can take; and my Reason tells me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the humour you are of, I cannot
put a greater Restraint upon you, than by
leaving you to your liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was not mistaken:
The confidence he made appear he had in his
Wife, fortifi'd her the more against Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> and made her take more severe
Resolutions than any Restraint would have
brought her to: She went to the <hi>Louvre</hi> and
the Queen-Dauphin's Lodgings as she us'd
to do, but avoided the presence and sight of
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> with so much care, that
she robb'd him of almost all the joy he had
in thinking she lov'd him, all her Actions
perswading him the contrary: He could not
tell but what he had heard might have been
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53905:87"/>
in a dream, so little likelihood was there of
the truth of it: The only thing seem'd to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him he was not mistaken, was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
sadness of Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> appearing
in spight of all her care to conceal it: And
peradventure, the sweetest looks, and most
obliging expressions, would not have so
much heightned the love of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
as the severity of her Conduct effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
did.</p>
            <p>One Evening, as Monsieur and Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> were at the Queens Lodgings, it was
said there was a report the King would name
another great Lord at Court to wait on <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
into <hi>Spain.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had his
eye fixt on his Wife, when it was further
said, the Chevalier <hi>de Guise,</hi> or the Marshal
<hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Andre</hi> was to be the man: He observ'd
she was not at all mov'd at either of those
names, nor at the discourse of their going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with her; this made him believe he had
no reason to fear the presence of either of
them: To clear his suspitions, he went into
the Queens Closet where the King then was.
Having staid there a while, he return'd to
his Wife, and whisper'd her, he had but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been told Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was the
person design'd to go along with them into
<hi>Spain.</hi> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was so mov'd at the
name of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53905:88"/>
thought of being expos'd to see him every
day, during a very long journey, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of her Husband, that she could not
conceal the trouble she was in; and to cloak
it with other reasons, <hi>No choice,</hi> says she,
<hi>could have been made more disagreeable for you,
he will share all your Honours, and methinks
you are oblig'd to endeavour to procure another
choice: Madam,</hi> answers he, <hi>'tis not on any
account of State you are unwilling Monsieur</hi>
de Nemours <hi>should go with me, the trouble it
gives you proceeds from another cause; I learn
from that trouble in you, what I should have
discover'd in another Woman, by the joy she
would have exprest at the news: but fear not,
Madam, what I told you is not true, it was an
invention of mine, to be assur'd of a thing I
strongly believ'd.</hi> Having said so, he went
out, being loth by his presence to increase the
trouble he saw his Wife in.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> came in at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and presently observ'd the condition
she was in: He went up to her, and told her
softly, He had that respect for her, he durst
not ask her, what it was made her more
thoughtful and melancholly than ordinary.
The voice of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> brought
her to her self again, and looking on him,
without having heard what he had just then
said, (so full was she of her own thoughts,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53905:88"/>
and of fear her Husband might see him with
her) <hi>For Gods sake,</hi> says she, <hi>let me alone:
Alas, Madam,</hi> answers he, <hi>I do it too much;
what is it you can complain of? I dare not
speak to you, I dare not so much as look upon
you, I tremble when I come near you; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
have I deserv'd you should speak so to me?
why do you make it appear thus, I am in some
measure the cause of the trouble I see you in?</hi>
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was very sorry she had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him occasion to declare himself more
clearly than he had done before: she left him
without saying a word more, and went home
more troubled than ever: her Husband per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it, and that she was afraid he should
speak to her of what was past; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her into her Closet, <hi>Do not shun me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
says he, <hi>I will not say any thing shall
displease you, I beg your pardon for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
I put you to awhile, I am sufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
by what I have learnt by it; Monsieur</hi>
de Nemours <hi>was the man I most fear'd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
I see the danger you are in; have power
over your self for your own sake, and if you can
for mine; I ask it not as your Husband, but as
a man whose happiness wholly depends on you,
and who hath for you a passion more violent and
more tender than he whom your inclination
prefers before me.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at these words, he could scarce finish
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53905:89"/>
them: His Lady was so mov'd, she burst in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
tears, and imbrac'd him with a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sorrow, that put him into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
very different from hers: They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
silent a while, and parted, without having
been able to say a word one to the other.</p>
            <p>All things were ready for the Marriage of
<hi>Madam,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was arriv'd to
Espouse her: He was receiv'd with all the
Ceremony and Magnificence usual on such
occasions: The King sent to meet him by
the way, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Cardinals
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Guise,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,
Ferrara, Aumale, Bouillon, Guise</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:</hi>
They had a great number of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and many Pages in Livery: The King
in Person, attended with two hundred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
his Servants, with the Constable, at
the head of them, waited the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>'s
coming at the first Gate of the <hi>Louvre.</hi>
When the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was come up to
the King, he would have imbrac'd his knees;
the King would not suffer it, but made him
walk by his side to the Queens Lodgings, and
to <hi>Madam</hi>'s, for whom the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>
brought a magnificent Present from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
He went thence to the Lodgings of
Madam <hi>Margaret</hi> the Kings Sister, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
her on the part of Monsieur <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
and assure her he would arrive in few
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53905:89"/>
days. There were great Assemblies at the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> to let the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (who accompanied him,)
see the Beauties of the Court.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> durst not absent her self,
for fear of displeasing her Husband, who
commanded her to appear there, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
loth to do it. Yet she was the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to it by the absence of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:</hi>
He was gone to meet Monsieur <hi>de
Savoy,</hi> and after his arrival was oblig'd to be
in a manner always with him, to assist him
in what concern'd the Ceremonies of his
Marriage. This prevented her meeting him
as often as she us'd, which gave her some
satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> had not forgot
the discourse he had had with Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours.</hi> It ran in his mind that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
the Prince had told him, was his own;
and he watch'd him so narrowly, 'tis very
probable he would have found out the truth
of it, had not the arrival of the Duke of
<hi>Alva,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Savoy</hi> fill'd the Court
with so much business, that it took away the
opportunities of a discovery of that Nature:
The desire he had to know the truth of it, or
rather the natural disposition we have to
make those we love acquainted with all we
know, made him tell Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:53905:90"/>
the extraordinary Action of that Person, who
had confess'd to her Husband the passion she
had for another: He assur'd her Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> was the Man had inspir'd so violent
a passion, and conjur'd her to assist him in
observing that Prince. Madam <hi>de Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
was glad to hear what the <hi>Vidame</hi> told
her, and the Curiosity she had always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in the Queen-Dauphin for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> made her the
more desirous to know the bottom of the
Adventure.</p>
            <p>A short time before the day fix'd for the
Ceremony of the Marriage, the Queen-Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
invited the King her Father-in-Law,
and the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois</hi> to Supper.
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> had been so busie a dressing
her self, it was late e're she came to the <hi>Louvre:</hi>
By the way she met a Gentleman, who was
coming in search of her from the Queen-Dauphin.
As she enter'd her Chamber, that
Princess said aloud to her, from on her Bed,
where she then was; <hi>I have look'd for you
with the greatest impatience. I believe it,
Madam,</hi> answers she, <hi>yet perhaps I am not
oblig'd to you for it, the cause being doubtless
something else, and not your desire to see me.
You are right,</hi> answers the <hi>Queen-Dauphin,
yet you are oblig'd to me; for I will tell you an
Adventure you will be very glad to know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53905:90"/>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> kneel'd at her Bed side,
and (very luckily) with her Face from the
light: <hi>You know,</hi> says the <hi>Queen-Dauphin,
how desirous we were to find out who had caus'd
the great change observ'd in Monsieur</hi> de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
<hi>I believe I know the Party; you will
be surpriz'd at the Story: He is desperatrly in
love with one of the handsomest Ladys of the
Court, and she loves him again.</hi> You may
easily imagine what grief Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
felt at these words, which she could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to her self, as being of opinion no Person
knew of her love for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.
I see nothing in this, Madam,</hi> answers she,
<hi>that should occasion a surprize, if you consider
the age and the handsomness of Monsieur</hi> de
Nemours. <hi>True,</hi> says the <hi>Queen-Dauphin,
but that which will surprize you, is, to know
that the Lady in love with Monsieur</hi> de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<hi>hath never given him any Evidence of
it; and is so afraid she shall not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Mistress of her passion, that she hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
it to her Husband, that he may take her
from Court; and 'tis Monsieur</hi> de Nemours
<hi>hath related what I say to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was griev'd at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this discourse, when she thought her
self not concern'd in the Adventure, but she
was at her wits-end when she heard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of it, which too clearly made out, it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53905:91"/>
related to her: She could not answer a word,
but continued leaning her Head on the Bed
while the Queen was speaking; which she
did with that earnestness and concern, she
took not any notice of the confusion Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> was in. <hi>This Story,</hi> answers she,
<hi>seems very improbable, and I would very fain
know who it is hath told it you. 'Tis Madam</hi>
Martigues, says the <hi>Queen-Dauphin; and she
had it from the</hi> Vidame <hi>of</hi> Chartres. <hi>You
know he is in love with her, he told it to her
as a Secret, and he was told it by the Duke of</hi>
Nemours: <hi>'Tis true the Duke of</hi> Nemours
<hi>told him not the Name of the Lady, nor would
confess himself the other Party concern'd; but
the</hi> Vidame <hi>makes no doubt of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Queen-Dauphin had done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
one came up to the Bed: Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> had so turn'd her self about she could
not see who it was, but was quickly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd
of the Person, when she heard the Queen-Dauphin
cry out, with no less joy than sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<hi>Here he is himself, and I will know of
him the truth of it.</hi> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not turn about to know it was Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> as really it was, but went hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Queen-Dauphin, and told her soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
she must take heed of speaking of this
Adventure which Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had
told the <hi>Vidame</hi> as a Secret, and perhaps it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53905:91"/>
might make make them fall out. <hi>You are
too wise,</hi> says the Queen-Dauphin, laughing,
and turn'd towards Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi>
He was drest for the Court-meeting at Night,
and with a Grace natural to him, <hi>I believe,
Madam,</hi> says he, <hi>I may venture to think you
were speaking of me as I came in; that you
had a desire to ask me something, and that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
de Cleve <hi>was against it. 'Tis true,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the <hi>Queen-Dauphin, but I shall not be
so complaisant to her on this occasion, as I am
us'd to be. I would know of you, whether a
Story I have been told be true, and whether
you are not the Person in love with, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by a Lady at Court, who endeavours to
conceal her passion from you, and hath confess'd
it to her Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You cannot imagine the trouble and
perplexity Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was in, she would
have thought Death a very good exchange
for it. Yet Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was in
greater, if possible: The discourse of the
Queen (who he had reason to believe hated
him not) in presence of Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
in whom of all the Court she plac'd greatest
confidence, and had the greatest share of
hers in return, put him into so strange a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of extravagant thoughts, it was not
in his power to be Master of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
The trouble he saw Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:53905:92"/>
in by his fault, and the thought of his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given her just cause to hate him, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
him so that he could not answer a
word. Madam <hi>La Dauphin</hi> observing him
mute, <hi>Look upon him, says</hi> she to Madam <hi>de
Cleve; look upon him, and judge if he be not
concern'd in this Adventure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The mean time Monsieur</hi> de Nemours <hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consider'd how necessary it was to get out
of so dangerous a strait, and recover'd his
wit and his looks;</hi> I confess, Madam, says
<hi>he,</hi> no surprize or affliction could be greater
than mine, at the infidelity of the <hi>Vidame</hi>
of <hi>Chartres,</hi> in relating an Adventure I
had in confidence imparted to him, of one of
my Friends: I know how to be reveng'd of him,
<hi>continues he, (smiling very calmly, which
rais'd the suspicions the Queen-Dauphin had
entertain'd of him,)</hi> he hath made me his
Confident in matters of no small importance:
But I am to seek for the Reason, Madam, why
you make me concern'd in this Adventure:
The <hi>Vidame</hi> will not say it, for I have told
him the contrary. I may very well be taken to
be a Man in love, but I cannot believe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
you will think me of the number of those
who are lov'd again. <hi>Monsieur</hi> de Nemours
<hi>was glad to say any thing to the Queen-Dauphin,
that might relate to that affection
he had declar'd for her formerly, to divert
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53905:92"/>
her thoughts from the matter in hand. She
understood what he said, but instead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
continu'd reazing him for the
change in his looks when she began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
him.</hi> I was troubled, Madam, <hi>says
he,</hi> on my Friends account; and to think how
justly he would reproach me for telling a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
more dear to him than his Life. Yet he
imparted it but half, having kept from me the
Name of the Person he loves: All I know, is,
he is the most deply in love of any Man liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hath the most reason to complain.
Think you he hath any cause of complaint, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays
the Queen-Dauphin,</hi> when his passion is
so well answer'd again? Can you believe it
answer'd, Madam, <hi>says he;</hi> or that a Lady
having a true passion could have discover'd it
to her Husband? Doubtless this Lady is not
acquainted with Love, and hath taken small
notice of the kindness had for her. My Friend
cannot flatter himself with any hope, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
as he is, he esteems himself happy at
least, to make her afraid she should fall in love
with him, and he would not change his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with that of the happiest Lover in the
World. Your Friend hath a passion very easie
to be satisfi'd, <hi>says she,</hi> and I begin to think
you not concern'd in the Story; I am almost of
the mind of Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> who maintains
there's no truth in it. I cannot think it true,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53905:93"/>
               <hi>says Madam de Cleve, who had been silent
all this while;</hi> and could it have been true,
how should it have been known? 'Tis not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
a Woman capable of a Resolution so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
should have the weakness to speak
of it; and surely her Husband would not have
related it, or must have been very unworthy to
have been so well dealt with, as he had been by
his Lady in her unparallell'd Conduct. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
de Nemours <hi>perceiving the suspicions
Madam</hi> de Cleve <hi>seem'd to have of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
did all he could to confirm them,
knowing him the most formidable of his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals:</hi>
Iealousie, <hi>says he,</hi> and the desire of
finding out what a wife hath, it may be, not
thought fit to discover, are capable to make a
Husband guilty of indiscretion.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was at her last shifts, and
not able to endure the discourse any longer;
she would have said she was not well, when,
by good fortune for her, the Duchess of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinois</hi>
came in, who told the Queen-Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin
the King was just a coming. The
Queen-Dauphin went into her Closet to be
drest. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> drew up to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve as</hi> she follow'd her, <hi>I would give
my Life, Madam,</hi> says he, <hi>for a moments
discourse with you; yet I have not bing of more
importance to tell you, than that if I have said
any thing to the Queen-Dauphin wherein she
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53905:93"/>
may seem concern'd, I did it for Reasons that
relate not to her.</hi> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> made as
if she heard him not, but left him without
giving him a look, and follow'd the King,
who was newly come in. There was a great
deal of company. She trod on her own Coat,
and made a false step, which serv'd her for a
pretense to quit a place she had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to stay in; and she return'd home.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> came to the <hi>Louvre,</hi>
and was amaz'd not to find his Wife there;
they told him of the Accident befallen her:
He went presently home to enquire after her,
he found her a Bed, and easily knew her hurt
was not considerable. When he had been
with her some time, he perceiv'd her so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
sad that it surpriz'd him. <q>What
ails you, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> methinks you
are troubled with other grief than that
you complain of.</q> 
               <q>I am the most afflicted
I possibly can be, <hi>answers she,</hi> for the use
you have made of that extraordinary, or (to
name it right) foolish confidence I have had
in you. Did I not deserve secresie, or had I
not, did not your Interest engage you to it?
Must your Curiosity of knowing a Name,
(it was my duty not to tell you,) oblige
you to make a Confident to assist you in the
discovery? Nothing else could have made
you fall into so horrible an indiscretion, the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53905:94"/>
consequences of which are as bad as bad
may be: This Adventure is known, and I
have been just told the Story of it by them
who knew not I was principally concern'd
in it.</q> 
               <q>What say you Madam, <hi>answers he?</hi>
you accuse me to have told what pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and me, and that the matter is
known. I will not justifie my self not to
have spoken of it, you cannot believe I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did; and doubtless you have apply'd to
your self what was related of another.
Ah, Sir, <hi>says she,</hi> the World hath not an
Adventure like mine; there's not another
Woman capable of such a thing. The
Story I have heard could not have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by chance, none ever imagin'd the
like; an Action of this nature never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
any thoughts but mine: The Queen-dauphin
hath just told me the Story, she had
it from the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and he
from Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours, crys Monsieur</hi> de Cleve, <hi>like a
Man transported and desperate;</hi> Doth Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> know you love him, and
that I know it? You always Harp on that
String, and fix on Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other, <hi>replys she;</hi> I have told you
I would not answer your suspicions: I am
ignorant whether Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
knows that I am concern'd in the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53905:94"/>
and the Person you told him of; but
he told the <hi>Vidame</hi> the Story, and said he
had it from a Friend of his, who had
not nam'd the Lady: It cannot be but that
this Friend must be one of yours, whom you
trusted the Secret with, in order to discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of what I conceal'd.</q> 
               <q>Is there a Friend
in the World, <hi>says he,</hi> to be trusted with a
business of this nature? And would any
Man purchase the clearing his suspicions at
so dear a rate, as acquainting another with
that which he would have gladly had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from himself? I think rather, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
who it is you have spoken to, 'tis
more probable it came from you than me;
the trouble you were in was insupportable
to you, and to ease your self of the Burden
you have made use of a Confident who
hath betray'd you.</q> 
               <q>Destroy me not quite,
<hi>says she,</hi> and be not so hard hearted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
me of a fault you have committed.
Can you suspect me of such a thing, and
because I told it you, could I tell it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Confession Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> had made
to her Husband was so clear a proof of her
sincerity, and she deny'd so flatly she had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
any with it but himself, he knew
not what to think. On the other side, he
was sure he had never said a word of it, it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53905:95"/>
was not a matter to be guess'd at; yet it was
known, and it must be through one of them
two: what troubled him most, was the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
one or other was privy to the secret,
and in all probability it would be divulg'd.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s thoughts were much
the same with her Husbands; she thought it
impossible her Husband would have spoke of
it, and as impossible but it must be he had
spoken it; the intimation Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
had given what indiscretion a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
curiosity might make him guilty of,
appear'd to hit Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> so pat, she
could not believe it a thing said by chance:
this weigh'd with her so far, she was fully
perswaded Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had abus'd her
confidence: Both were so full of their own
thoughts, they were silent a confiderable
time; and when they spoke to one another,
they did but repeat what they had formerly
said, and continued more alter'd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strang'd
in opinion and affection than ever
they had been.</p>
            <p>You may easily imagine how they past
that night: Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s patience was
exhausted, to see a Lady he ador'd in love
with another: he was quite heartless; he
had not the courage to resent a matter
wherein his Reputation and Honour were so
deeply concern'd: he knew not what to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53905:95"/>
think of his Wife; he was to seek what
Conduct he should prescribe to her, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
he could discover on all hands nothing
but Precipices and Abysses. After long irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
considering he was shortly ingag'd
for <hi>Spain,</hi> he resolv'd to do nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the knowledge or suspition of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Estate: he went to Madam <hi>de
Cleve,</hi> and told her, their business was not to
find out which of them two had discover'd
the secret, but to endeavour to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the story was a Fable, and she no way
concern'd in it; that it was in her power to
perswade Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and others,
to that purpose, by using him with that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
and coldness she ought to express to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a man pretending to be in love with
her; that such a proceeding would easily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the opinion he had of her having inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for him; that she was not to trouble
her self for what he might have hitherto
thought, for that if for the future she avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
discovering any weakness to him, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
thoughts would vanish, and that especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
she must frequent the <hi>Louvre</hi> and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meetings
as she us'd to do.</p>
            <p>Having said this, he quitted her, without
expecting her answer: she thought him much
in the right, and was so angry with Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> she believ'd it an easie matter
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53905:96"/>
to put in execution her Husbands advice:
but it seem'd a hard task to appear at the
Marriage with that calm and tranquility,
that freedom and clearness of spirit the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
requir'd: But having been preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
several Princesses (ambitious of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
to carry the Queen-Dauphins Train,
she could not put it off without occasioning
much noise, and enquiry what had mov'd
her to it: she resolv'd to strain her self to
perform it, but spent the rest of the day in
preparing for the solemnity, and thinking
her own thoughts: she lock'd her self up in
her Closet: that which griev'd her most
was, the cause she had to complain of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> without an excuse to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in his favour: she made no doubt but
he had told the <hi>Vidame</hi> the story, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
as much in her hearing, and spoke in
that manner, she could not question but he
knew she was concern'd; what excuse for
such an imprudence so very unsuitable to the
discretion she admir'd him for? while he
thought himself unhappy, he continued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet;
he hath fanci'd himself happy,
(though on very uncertain grounds) and
hath dismiss'd his discretion: he could not
imagine I lov'd him, but he must make the
World acquainted with it: he hath said all
he could; I made no confession he was the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53905:96"/>
man I lov'd, but he hath believ'd it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
declar'd his belief, had he been sure
of it, I must have expected he would have
taken the same course, and us'd me with no
more respect than he hath now done: How
was I mistaken, to think him capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
any thing that flatter'd his vanity! Yet
this is the man I thought so different from
the rest, that for his sake I, who differ'd so
much from the rest of my Sex, find my self
subject to the weakness of other Women: I
have lost the affection and esteem of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who should have been my happiness.
All the World will shortly look on me as a
Woman under a foolish and violent passion:
he for whom I have it is not ignorant of it.
'Tis for avoiding these misfortunes I have
hazarded my Repose, and my life. These
sad Reflections ended in a torrent of tears;
but as great as her grief was, she found it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
if she could be but satisfi'd in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was not in a much better condition,
he was vex'd at the heart for his indiscretion,
in speaking as he had done to the</hi> Vidame,
<hi>and the ill consequences that attended it;
he was confounded to think what trouble,
perplexity, and grief he had seen Madam</hi> de
Cleve <hi>in. He could not excuse himself for
having said to her, about this Adventure,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53905:97"/>
things though innocently gallant in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet on this occasion too gross and
rude, since they made her sensible he knew
she was the Lady had that violent passion,
and he the Person for whom she had it. All
he could have wish'd for, was to discourse
her; but now he thought himself more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to avoid, than desire it.</hi> What should I
say to her, <hi>cry'd he?</hi> should I convince her
more plainly of what I have already given her
too much light? shall I tell her I know she loves
me, who never yet durst tell her I lov'd her?
shall I begin to own my passion to her, that she
may see my hopes have inspired me with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
can I entertain a thought of going near
her, and giving her new trouble by enduring a
sight of me? How shall I jusiifie my self? I
have no Excuse, I am unworthy she should look
on me, and I cannot hope she will ever do it.
I have by my faults furnish'd her with better
Exceptions against me, than any she could have
found: My indiscretion hath lost me the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and the glory of being belov'd by the most
amiable and most estimable Person in the
world. Yet had I lost it without giving her
trouble, it would have been some comfort. At
this very moment I am more sensible of the
harm I have done her, than that I have done
my self in forfeiting her favour.</p>
            <p>He continued a long time afflicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53905:97"/>
thus. Still his mind hanker'd to speak
with Madam <hi>de Cleve:</hi> He study'd how to
do it, he thought of writing to her; but
considering the fault he had committed, and
the humour she was of, he was of opinion
that the best course he could take, was, to
express a profound respect for her, by his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
and silence: to let her see he durst
not present himself before her, and to wait
patiently what time, Chance, and the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
she had for him might produce in his
favour. And for fear of confirming her
suspicion, he resolved to forbear reproaching
the <hi>Vidame</hi> for his unfaithfulness.</p>
            <p>The Court was so busied about the Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
of Madam on the Morrow, and her
Marriage to be the day after, that it was no
hard matter for Monsieur and Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> to conceal their sadness from publick
notice: The Queen-Dauphin spoke but by
the by to Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> of the discourse
they had had with Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> industriously shunn'd
speaking to his Wife of what was past, so
that her trouble prov'd less than she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>The Espousals were solemniz'd at the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> and after the Treat and the Ball, the
King's Houshold went to ly at the Bishop's
Palace according to Custom. In the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53905:98"/>
the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> having till then gone
very plain, appear'd in a Habit of Cloth of
Gold, mix'd with fire-colour, yellow and
black, all cover'd with Jewels, with a close
Crown on his Head. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
richly Apparell'd, with his Livery; and all the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> with theirs, came to attend the
Duke from the <hi>Hostel de Villeroy</hi> (where he
was lodg'd) and march'd four a-breast till
they came to the Palace. As soon as he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
they went in order to the Church:
The King led Madam, with a close Crown
on her Head, and her Train born up by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoiselles
<hi>de Montpensier</hi> and <hi>Longueville:</hi>
The Queen follow'd next, but without a
Crown: Next came the Queen-Dauphin,
Madam the King's Sister, Madam <hi>de Lorrain,</hi>
and the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> their Trains car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
by Princesses.</p>
            <p>The Maids of Honour belonging to the
Queens and Princesses, were all richly drest
in the same Colours the Queens and Princes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
had on: so that it was known by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of their Habits whose Maids they were.
They mounted the Scaffold prepared in the
Church, and there the Ceremony of the
Marriage was perform'd: They return'd to
Dinner at the Bishops, and went thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five a Clock to the great Palace, where
the Feast was, and the Parliament, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53905:98"/>
Courts, and the Corporation of the
City were desir'd to assist. The King, the
Queens, the Princes and Princesses eat at
the Marble Table in the great Hall of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace:
The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> sat by the new
Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> below the steps of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Table: At the King's right hand
there was a Table for Embassadors, Arch-Bishops,
and Knights of the Order; and on
the other hand a Table for those of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in a Robe of Cloth
of Gold Freez'd, serv'd the King as Lord
Steward of his Houshold; the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> as <hi>Parmetier,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
as Cup-bearer. When the Officers
had taken away, the Ball began, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by Ballets, and extraordinary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines:
then they resum'd the Ball, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Midnight the King and all the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> As sad as Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> was, all that saw her, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> thought her beauty
incomparable: Though the bustle of the
Ceremony offer'd him several opportunities,
he durst not speak to her. But he appear'd
so sad, and exprest so much fear to approach
her, that Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> looking on it as
proceeding from his respect for her, began to
think he was not so much to be blam'd,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53905:99"/>
though he had not said a word to justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
His Conduct was the same the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
days, and wrought the same effect on
Madam <hi>de Cleve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last the day of the Tournament came;
the Queens stood in the Galleries upon the
Scaffolds prepar'd for them. The four Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
appear'd at the end of the Lists, with a
number of Horses and Liveries, the most
magnificent sight ever seen in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King's Colours were Black and
White, which he always wore on the account
of Madam <hi>de Valentinois</hi> being a Widow.
Monsieur <hi>de Ferrara</hi> and his Retinue had Red
and Yellow; Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> Carnation
and White, being the Colours of a young
Lady whom he had lov'd when a Maid, and
lov'd her still though he durst not make it
appear. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had Black and
Yellow; why he wore them was not known,
but it was no hard matter for Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
to guess at it: she remember'd she had said
before him, she lov'd Yellow, and was sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it suited not with her Natural Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which was the reason he thought he
might appear in that Colour without indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion,
because Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> not wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, there could be no suspicion he wore it
on her account.</p>
            <p>The Champions perform'd with incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53905:99"/>
address. Though the King was the
best Horseman in his Kingdom, they knew
not who had the advantage. Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> had a Grace in all his Actions won
him the favour of Persons less interess'd than
Madam <hi>de Cleve:</hi> she no sooner discover'd
him at the end of the Lists, but she felt her
self under extraordinary Emotions; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Course he made, she could scarce hide
her joy when he had well finish'd his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer.</p>
            <p>In the Evening when all was almost over,
and the Company ready to break up, the
King, (provok'd only by the ill Fate of the
State), would needs break another Lance:
He commanded the Count <hi>de Mantgomery</hi>
(who was very dextrous at it) to appear in
the Lists; the Count begg'd his Majesty
would excuse him, alledging all the Reasons
he could think of; but the King, half angry,
sent him word he commanded him to do it.
The Queen conjur'd the King not to run any
more, that he had perform'd so well he
ought to rest satisfi'd, and that she intreated
him to come to her. He answer'd, it was for
love of her he would have another Course,
and enter'd the Barriere. She sent Monsieur
<hi>de Savoy</hi> to pray him the second time to come
back, but all to no purpose. They ran, the
Lances were broken, and a Splinter of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53905:100"/>
Count of <hi>Montgomery</hi>'s hit the King in the
Eye, and stuck there. The King fell: His
Gentlemen, and Monsieur <hi>de Montmorency,</hi>
Marshal of the Camp, ran to him. They were
astonish'd to see him so wounded, but the
King was hearty; he said it was a very slight
hurt, and pardon'd the Count. You may
judge the trouble and affliction so sad an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
occasion'd, at a time wholly dedicated
to Gayety and Mirth. As soon as the King
was laid in Bed, and the Chyrurgeons had
search'd the Wound, it appear'd very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
The Constable presently thought
of the Prediction (that the King should be
slain in Duel), and made no doubt but it
would be accomplish'd.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> then at <hi>Brussels,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
news of the Accident, sent his Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
a Man of Great Reputation; but he jug'd
the King past hope.</p>
            <p>A Court so divided, and full of contrary
Interests, could not but be in extraordinary
disorder, and factiously busie, in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture:
Yet all was conceal'd, and the
whole Court seem'd employ'd only about
the recovery of the King; the Queens, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Princesses scarce stirring out of his
Anti-Chamber.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> knowing her self oblig'd
to be there, that she should see Monsieur <hi>de
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53905:100"/>
Nemours</hi> there, and should not be able to
conceal from her Husband the disorder that
sight would put her to; and being sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the very presence of that Prince would
justifie and clear him in her thoughts, and
destroy the resolutions she had taken against
him, she pretended her self sick. The
Court was too busie to mind what she did,
or to enquire whether her indisposition were
real or feign'd. Only her Husband knew
the truth of it. That troubled her not: she
continu'd at home, little concern'd for the
great Change that was shortly expected,
and full of her own thoughts which she had
liberty enough to give her self up to. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ran to Court to enquire of the King.
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> came at certain hours to
bring her news: he observ'd the same method
of proceeding towards her he us'd to
do, save only when they were alone they
were a little less free, and more cold towards
one another than formerly. He said not a
word of what was past, and she had not
the power, nor thought it convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the discourse of it.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> who waited an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of speaking to Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
was surpriz'd and troubl'd he could not have
a sight of her. The King was so ill, that the
seventh day the Physicians gave him up.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53905:101"/>
Her receiv'd the news of the certainty of his
Death with extraordinary constancy, which
was the more admirable, in that he lost his
Life by so unfortunate an Accident, that he
was to die in the Flower of his Age, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
ador'd by his People, and belov'd by a
Mistress he was desperatly in love with: The
day before he dy'd he caus'd Madam, his
Sister, to be marry'd to Monsieur <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
without Ceremony. You may guess
the condition the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois</hi>
was in: The Queen would not permit her
to see the King, but sent to demand of her
the King's Signet, and the Jewels of the
Crown, she had in her Custody. The Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
enquir'd if the King were dead, and
being told no; <hi>I have no Master yet then,</hi>
says she, <hi>and no body can oblige me to part
with what he trusted in my Hands.</hi> As soon
as he expir'd at the <hi>Chasteau de Tournels,</hi>
the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara, Guise,</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi>
conducted the Queen-Mother, the King and
Queen-Consort to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> led the Queen-Mother: As they
began to walk, she step'd back a little, and
told the Queen, her Daughter-in-Law, it
was her place to go first; but it was easie to
see there was more sharpness, than civility in
the Complement.</p>

            <head>BOOK IV.</head>
            <p>THE Queen-Mother was now wholly
govern'd by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain:</hi>
the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> was quite out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with her; and the love he had for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Martigues,</hi> and for liberty, made him
less sensible of her displeasure than a matter of
that consequence might seem to deserve. The
Cardinal, the ten days the King continued ill,
had leisure to form his designs, and prevail with
the Queen to take Resolutions suitable to his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53905:102"/>
Projects: so that as soon as the King was
dead, the Queen order'd the Constable to stay
at the <hi>Tournels</hi> with the Corps, to perform
the usual Ceremonies: This kept him at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and out of the Scene of Action: He
dispatch'd a Courrier to the King of <hi>Navarr</hi>
to hasten him to Court, to join with him in
opposing the Rise of the House of <hi>Guise.</hi>
The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was made General of
the Armies, and the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi>
Sur-intendant of the <hi>Finances.</hi> The Duchess
of <hi>Valentinois</hi> was expell'd the Court. The
Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> the Constable's declar'd
Enemy, and the Chancellor <hi>Olivier</hi> declar'd
Enemy to the Duchess of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> were
both call'd to Court. In a word, the Court
had intirely chang'd Face: The Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> rank'd himself with the Princes of the
Blood, to carry the King's Cloak at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
He and his Brothers were absolute
Masters at Court, not only through the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
the Cardinal had with the Queen, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she thought it in her power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them if they should give her Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage,
and that she could not remove the
Constable who was upheld by the Princes of
the Blood.</p>
            <p>The days of mourning for the deceas'd
King being over, the Constable came to the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> but had a very cold reception from
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53905:102"/>
the King. He would have spoken with him
in private, but the King call'd for <hi>Messieurs
de Guise,</hi> and before them told him, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
him to take his ease; that the <hi>Finances</hi>
and the Command of the Armies were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
of, and when he should stand in need of
his Counsels, he would send for him to Court.
The Queen-Mother receiv'd him more cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the King had done, and did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to reproach him, with his having said to
the late King, his Children were not like
him. The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> arriv'd, and was
no better receiv'd. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
more impatient than his Brother, complain'd
of it aloud, but all to no purpose. He was
remov'd from Court, under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sent into <hi>Flanders</hi> to sign the Ratification
of the Peace. They shew'd the King of <hi>Navarr</hi>
a forg'd Letter from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was charg'd with designs to surprize
some strong places belonging to that King:
they told him it was high time to look about
him, and prepare for defence: and, in a
word, perswaded him to resolve going for
<hi>Bearn.</hi> The Queen-Mother, to furnish him
with a pretence, gave him in Charge the
Conduct of Madam <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
made him take his Journey before her: so
that there was not a Person left at Court to
ballance the Power of the House of <hi>Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:53905:103"/>Though it fell out unluckily for Monsieur
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> he had not the Conducting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> yet the greatness of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
preferr'd before him, took from him all
cause of complaint. But the loss of the
Employ griev'd him not so much for depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him of the honour he should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by it, as for robbing him of so fair an
opportunity to remove his Wife from Court,
without suspicion, or the least appearance of
design.</p>
            <p>Soon after the decease of the late King, a
Resolution was taken the King should go to
<hi>Rhemes</hi> to be anointed. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
having all this while kept home, on pretence
of being ill, no sooner heard this news, but
she pray'd her Husband to dispence with her
following the Court, and to give her leave
to go take the Air at <hi>Colonniers</hi> for her health.
He told her he would not enquire whether
she desir'd it on the account of her health,
but he was ready to consent to what she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd;
and it was no hard Task to consent to
what he had already resolv'd. As good an
Opinion as he had of his Wife's Virtue, he
thought it imprudent to expose her longer to
the view of a Man she was in love with.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> quickly knew she
would not go along with the Court, and
could not find in his heart to be gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53905:103"/>
seeing her. The Night before the Court
was to remove he went to her House, as late as
in decency he could, that he might find her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Fortune favour'd his Intention, as he
enter'd the Court he met Madam <hi>Nevers,</hi> and
Madam <hi>Martigues</hi> coming out, they told him
they had left her alone. He went up under
an agitation and trouble, parallell'd only by
that Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was in, when told
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was come to see her:
the fear of his speaking to her of his passion,
her apprehension she might give him too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
an answer, the disturbance this
Visit might occasion to her Husband, the
difficulty of giving him an account of it, or
concealing it, presented themselves to her
imagination all in a moment, and put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a perplexity that made her resolve avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the thing, than which peradventure she
desir'd none more. She sent one of her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> who was in
her Anti-Chamber, to tell him she had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been very ill, and was extremely sorry she
could not receive the honour he would have
done her. What a grief was this to him,
not to see Madam <hi>de Cleve;</hi> and therefore
not to see her, because she had no mind he
should? He was to be gone on the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
he could not expoct from Fortune a
more favourable opportunity. He had not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53905:104"/>
spoken to her since the discourse at the
Queen-Dauphin's, and had reason to believe
his telling the <hi>Vidame</hi> had destroy'd all his
hopes. In a word, he went away vex'd to
the very Heart.</p>
            <p>As soon as Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> had recover'd
her self a little, out of the trouble she was in
at the thoughts of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
being come to visit her, she was so far from
approving the reasons that induc'd her to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
her self from seeing him, that she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
her self for having refus'd his Visit;
and if it had not been too late, she would have
had him call'd back.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Nevers,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi>
went directly from Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
to the Queen-Dauphins; Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>
was there. The Queen-Dauphin ask'd them
where they had been? they answer'd they
came from Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> where they had
spent part of the Afternoon, with a great
deal of company, and left no body there
but Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi> These words,
though harmless and indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
pass'd not as such with Monsieur <hi>de
Cleve:</hi> he had reason to imagine Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> might have several opportunities
of speaking to Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> but to
think he was alone with her at her Lodgings,
where he might declare to her his passion,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53905:104"/>
appear'd that moment a thing so strange and
intollerable, he was more jealous than ever.
It was not in his power to stay at the Queen-Dauphin's,
he went thence not knowing
why, nor whether it were with design to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours:</hi> When he drew
near home, he look'd about to see what signs
he might discover of that Prince's being
still there. It was some comfort to find
he was gone, and it pleas'd him to find he
could not have been long there. He fancy'd,
peradventure, it was not Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
he had reason to be jealous of. And
though he could not doubt it, yet he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to perswade himself he ought to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it. But he had been already so clearly
convinc'd to the contrary, it was not in his
power to continue long in that uncertainty
he so earnestly desir'd. He went straight into
his Wife's Chamber, and after some general
discourse, he could not forbear asking her
what she had done in his absence, and who
had been to see her. She gave him account
of both, but finding she mention'd not Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> he ask'd, trembling, if
those were all she had seen, that she might
have occasion to name Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
and he have the comfort to find she put no
tricks upon him. She had not seen him,
therefore she nam'd him not. Monsieur <hi>de
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53905:105"/>
Cleve,</hi> with a sorrowful tone, replys, <hi>Have
you not seen Monsieur</hi> de Nemours, <hi>or have
you forgot him? I have not seen him indeed,</hi>
says she; <hi>I was ill, and sent one of my Women
to make my Excuse. You were not ill, but for
him then,</hi> replys he; <hi>you admitted all other
Visits, why not his as the rest? What reason
have you to fear a sight of him? Why should
he know by you that you are afraid to see him?
Why should you make it appear to him you make
use of the Power his Passion gives you over him?
Durst you refuse to see him, but that you know
him sensible it proceeded not from Incivility,
but Rigour; And what reason have you to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
to him? From a Person like you, Madam,
any thing but indifference is a favour. I did
not think,</hi> says she, <hi>you had any such suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Monsieur</hi> de Nemours, <hi>that you could
have reproached me for not admitting a Visit
from him. Yet I reproach you, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
he, <hi>and have ground enough for it: Why
should you not see him, if he never spoke to you
of his love? But he hath declar'd it, Madam;
'tis not possible it could have made so deep an
impression in you, had you perceiv'd it only by
his silence: It was not in your power to tell me
the whole trugh, you have conceal'd from me
the greater, and more considerable part; you
have repented that little you confess'd to me,
you were not able to finish your Confession: I am
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53905:105"/>
more unhappy than I thought I was, and the
unhappyest of Men. You are my Wife, I love
you as my Mistress, and the same time see you
in love with another; and he the most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the Court: He sees you every day, and
knows you are in love with him. Ha,</hi> crys he,
<hi>I believ'd you might overcome the Passion you
had for him, but sure I had lost my Reason to
think it. I know not,</hi> replys she very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully,
<hi>whether you did ill to judge favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
of a proceeding so extraordinary as mine;
nor do I know but I might be mistaken, when I
thought you would do me Iustice. Never doubt
it, Madam,</hi> says he; <hi>you were mistaken, you
expected from me things as impossible as those
I expected from you: How could you think I
should do you right, or act according to reason?
You had sure forgot I was desperately in love
with you, and that I was your Husband. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these were enough to run a Man into
extremities, what cannot both do when thus
met in one? Ha, what do they not? My sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
my thoughts are uncertain and
violent, I cannot master them. I no longer
think my self worthy of you, nor do I think
you are worthy of me. I adore you, I hate you:
I offend you, I beg your pardon: I admire
you, I <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I do so. In a word, I have
lost both <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and my reason; I wonder I

                     <desc>〈◊◊◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> since you spoke to me at</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:53905:106"/>
Colonniers, <hi>and the Queen-Dauphin told you
the Adventure was known. I cannot disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
how it came abroad, nor what pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Monsieur</hi> de Nemours <hi>and you on that
account. You will never acquaint me with it,
nor do I desire you should: I beg only you will
remember you have made me the most unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
the most wretched of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> having said this, left his
Wife, and departed on the morrow without
seeing her; but he writ her a Letter full of
trouble, civility, and kindness: she sent him
an answer so moving, so full of assurance of
her Conduct past and to come, that being
grounded on truth, and lively expressions of
the thoughts of her heart, the Letter made
impression on Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and restor'd,
in some measure, the former tranquility and
calm of his spirits: Besides, his knowing
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was to go to the King,
and could not be with Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
not a little to his repose: when-ever
this Lady spoke to her Husband, the love he
exprest for her, the handsomness of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
the kindness he had for her, and
what she ow'd him as her Husband, had that
strong operation on her, capable, one would
think, to deface the Idea's she had of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours;</hi> but it was but for a time,
and presently after the same Idea's came
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53905:106"/>
fresh into her mind, and made deeper impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
than ever.</p>
            <p>The first days after Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
was gone, she was scarce sensible of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
at length it troubled her sore: from
the hour she fell in love with him, not a day
had past but she had fear'd or hop'd to meet
him, and it was no small grief to her to
think it was not in the power of Fortune to
make them now meet one another.</p>
            <p>She went to <hi>Colonniers,</hi> and order'd to be
carri'd thither the great Pictures she had
caus'd to be copied out of the Originals Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Valentinois</hi> had bought for her fine
House at <hi>Amet.</hi> All the remarkable actions
of the Kings Reign were represented in those
Pieces: amongst the rest, was the Siege of
<hi>Metz,</hi> and those who had signaliz'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were drawn there much to the Life;
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was of the number,
which perhaps made her desirous of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> having not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to go with the Court, promis'd to spend
some days with Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> at <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers.</hi>
Though both shar'd the Queens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
yet it was without envy or strangeness
to one another: they continued good friends,
yet neither was the others Confident of the
Darling Thoughts. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> knew
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53905:107"/>
Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> lov'd the <hi>Vidame,</hi> but
Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> knew nothing of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi>'s being in love with Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> nor of his love for her, Madam
<hi>de Martigues</hi> lov'd her the better, as being
Neece to the <hi>Vidame;</hi> and Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
lov'd Madam <hi>de Martigues,</hi> as being in love
as she her self was, and in love with the most
intimate Friend of him who had a passion
for her.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> came to <hi>Colonniers</hi>
as she promis'd, and found Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
led a very desolate life, she affected solitude,
and to pass the Evenings in the Gardens
without the company of her Domesticks:
she frequented the Pavillion where Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> had heard her, she entred the
Bour that open'd to the Forrest: her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and other Servants, staid in the other,
or under the Pavillion, and came not to her
unless she call'd them.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> having never seen
<hi>Colonniers</hi> before, was surpriz'd at the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it, particularly at the pleasantness of
the Pavillion. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> and she usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
past the Evenings there: Two young
Ladies (as they) both passionately in love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at liberty, to pass the night in the finest
place in the world, knew not how to make
an end of discoursing one another, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53905:107"/>
pleas'd with the Conversation,
though neither made the other her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> could hardly
have left <hi>Colonniers,</hi> but that she was to go
where the <hi>Vidame</hi> was: she took her leave,
and went for <hi>Chambort,</hi> where the Court
then was.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had anointed
the King at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and the design was to
pass the rest of the Summer at the Castle of
<hi>Chambort,</hi> which was newly built. The
Queen express'd great joy to see Madam <hi>de
Martigues</hi> at Court, and after several Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of it, she enquir'd what news of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve,</hi> and what she did in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>de Cleve</hi> were both with the Queen that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time. Madam <hi>Martigues</hi> had been so
taken with <hi>Colonniers,</hi> she gave the Queen
an account of the beauties of it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd
upon the Description of the Pavillion
in the Forrest, and the pleasure Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> took to walk alone there some part of
the Night. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> who
knew the place well enough to understand
Madam <hi>Martigues</hi>'s discourse, thought it
not impossible to have a sight of Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> there, without being seen by any but
her self. He ask'd her some questions for
his better direction, and Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:53905:108"/>
who look'd earnestly on Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
while Madam <hi>Martigues</hi> was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
fancy'd he knew what was his design:
the questions he ask'd confirm'd him the
more, so that he made no doubt but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to go see his Wife. Nor was he mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was so set
upon't, that having spent the Night in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how to execute his design, he went
betimes on the morrow to ask the King leave
to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> on a pretended occasion.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> question'd not the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the Journey, but resolv'd to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself of his Wife's Conduct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
no longer under an uncertainty so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome:
He had a desire to go the same
time Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> set out, and hide
himself where he might discover the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the Journey; but fearing dis depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would be thought extraordinary, and
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> upon notice might
take other measures, he resolv'd to trust a
Gentleman that belong'd to him, whose faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and wit he was fully assur'd of: he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him with the trouble he was in,
and how virtuous his Wife had been till
then; and order'd him to follow Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> watch him narrowly, and see
whether he went to <hi>Colonniers,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he enter'd the Garden by Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:53905:108"/>The Gentleman, very capable of such a
Commission, discharg'd it with a great deal
of exactness: he follow'd Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
to a Village within half a league of <hi>Colonniers,</hi>
where Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> made a halt;
which the Gentleman easily guess'd was for
no other end, but to stay there till Night.
But he thought it best for him to pass through
the Village, and enter the Forrest the way
he thought Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> must pass.
He took his measures very right, for it was
no sooner Night but he heard some walk,
and though it were dark he easily knew
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours:</hi> He saw him go round
the Garden to hearken if he could discover
any Person, and spy out a place convenient
to pass over. There were double Pales, and
very high, on purpose to prevent entrance,
so that it was hard getting over; yet Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> made a shift to get in, and
was no sooner enter'd the Garden, but he
quickly knew where Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was:
He saw a great light in the Bower, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
all open, and slipping along by the
Pales side got close to the Bower; you may
imagine in what trouble and Emotion he took
his station behind a Window which serv'd
him conveniently to see what Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> was doing. He saw she was alone,
but thought her beauty so admirable he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53905:109"/>
could scarce master the transport it put him
in. It was hot, and she had nothing on her
Head and her Neck, but her Hair hanging
carelesly down. She was on a Bed of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
with several Baskets full of Ribbands
before her, out of which she made choice of
some; and he observ'd she pick'd out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Colours he wore at the Tourney. He
could see her make them up into Knots for an
<hi>Indian</hi> Cane, which had once been his, and
he had given it his Sister: Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
took it from her, as if she had never known it
had been his: When she had ty'd on the
Knots, with a grace and sweetness suitable
to the delicacy of the Sentiments in her
Heart, she took a great Wax Candle in her
Hand, and went to the Table over-against the
Picture of the Siege of <hi>Metz,</hi> wherein was
the Pourtraict of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours:</hi> She
sat her down, and fell a looking on that Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict
with that attention and thoughtfulness,
which could proceed only from a passionate
love.</p>
            <p>'Tis impossible to express the Sentiments
of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> that moment; to
see by Night, in the finest place of the World,
a Person he ador'd; to see her and she not
know it, to see her wholly taken up with
things relating to him, and the passion she
hid from him, was a pleasure no other Lover
ever tasted, or imagin'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:53905:109"/>He was so transported he stood gazing at
her, without considering how precious his
time was: having bethought himself a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
he believ'd it best not to speak to her till
she came into the Garden, where he might
do it with more safety at greater distance
from her Women. Yet seeing she continu'd
in the Bower, he resolv'd to enter: When
about to do it, what trouble was he in?
how fearful to displease her, and make her
change her Countenance so full of sweetness
and love, into looks full of anger and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!</p>
            <p>Presently he thought he had done very
unwisely (not to come see Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
but) to think of appearing to her: He look'd
on it as an extravagant boldness, to surprize,
at midnight, a Person to whom he never
durst declare his passion for her: He could
not see how he could pretend to audience
from her, but believ'd she might justly be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with him, for the danger he expos'd
her to by the Accidents might happen. His
courage quite fail'd him, and he was several
times upon the point of returning without
letting her see him: Yet push'd on with the
desire he had to speak to her, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
by the hopes given him by what he had
newly seen, he advanc'd a few steps, but in
such disorder, that a Scarf he wore catch'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53905:110"/>
at the Window and made a noise. Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> turn'd about, and whether her Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was full of him, or that she stood in a
place so directly to the light that she might
know him, she thought it was he; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least hesitation, or once looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, went into the place where her
Women were. She was so disorder'd, that
to conceal it from them, she told them she
was ill: Which she did to give them employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about her, and him an opportunity of
escaping unseen. Reflecting on what was
past, she thought her self deceiv'd, and that
she did but fancy she had seen him: she knew
he was at <hi>Chambort,</hi> and could not perswade
her self he would have undertaken so hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
a Journey. She had a mind several
times to return into the Garden, to see if any
one were there; and perhaps she no less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd,
than fear'd, to find Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
there: At last reason prevail'd, and she
thought it more prudent to continue in
doubt, than to run the hazard of clearing
the matter; yet she could not of a long time
resolve to quit a place she thought him so
near to, and it was almost day e're she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to the Castle.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> staid in the Garden
while there was any light, in hopes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sight of Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> though he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53905:110"/>
was perswaded she knew him, and was gone
out of purpose to shun him; but hearing the
Doors lock'd, his hopes were at an end. He
went to take Horse near the place where
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s Gentleman was watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. This Gentleman follow'd him to
the same Village, where he left him in the
Evening. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> resolv'd to
spend the rest of the Day there, and return
at Night to <hi>Colonniers,</hi> to see if Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> would have the cruelty to shun him,
or not expose her self to view. He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad to find himself so much in her
thoughts, yet it could not but trouble him
to see her so bent to avoid him.</p>
            <p>Never was passion so tender and violent as
that of this Prince: He went under the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
along a little Brook that ran behind
the House, where he hid himself, that no
notice might be taken of him. He gave
himself up to the transports of his Love, which
were so vehement he let fall some tears; not
those of pure grief, but mingled with the
pleasure and charms Love only is acquainted
with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was now at leisure to reflect on all the
Actions of Madam</hi> de Cleve, <hi>since he had been
in love with her. What a modest rigour she
had always us'd him with, though she lov'd
him.</hi> For 'tis certain, <hi>says he,</hi> she loves me,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53905:111"/>
I cannot doubt of it; the deepest engagements,
the highest favours, are not so infallible Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of it, as those I have seen: yet she uses
me as if she hated me. I hoped time would
have produc'd in her some change in my favour,
but now I must not expect it; I find her still
upon her Guard against me, and her self: If
she did not love me I would apply my self to
please her; but I please her, she loves me, and
yet hides it from me: What am I to expect?
what change can I hope of my Fate? What,
shall I have the love of the most amiable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World, and be under that excess of
passion that proceeds from the certainty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lov'd by her, only to make me more sensible
of being ill us'd? Let me see you love me, fair
Princess, <hi>crys he,</hi> declare to me your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
let me once in my Life be assur'd of
them by you; I am content you should resume
your rigour, and use me ever after with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
that so mortifies me: Look on me at
least with those Eyes you look'd last Night on my
Picture in my sight. Can you look with so
much kindness on my Picture, yet shun me so
cruelly? What are you afraid of? You love
me, and 'tis in vain to conceal it from me;
you have, against your will, given me Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it. I know my good fortune, permit
me to enjoy it, and do not make me unhappy.
Is't possible Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> should love me,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53905:111"/>
yet I be unhappy? How beautiful she appear'd
in the Night? how did I forbear throwing my
self at her Feet? Had I done it, perhaps the
respect I express'd for her would have kept her
from shunning me: Yet peradventure she did not
know me, I trouble my self more than I need:
the sight of a Man at an hour so extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
would have frighten'd her. <hi>These thoughts
took up his time all the Day, he wish'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
for the Night; and as soon as it
came he went for</hi> Colonniers. <hi>Monsieur</hi> de
Cleve<hi>'s Gentleman, being disguis'd, that he
might be less observ'd, follow'd him to the
place he had follow'd him the Night before,
and saw him enter the Garden again. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi>
de Nemours <hi>quickly found Madam</hi> de
Cleve <hi>had not expos'd her self to a second
view, the Garden-Doors being all shut, he
turn'd him every way about to discover light,
but saw none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> apprehending he might
return, kept her Chamber, fearing she might
not still have the power to shun him; and
unwilling to expose her self to the hazard of
speaking to him in a manner so unsuitable to
her Conduct hitherto.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> though out of
hopes of seeing her, could not resolve to
quit presently a place she frequented. He
pass'd that Night in the Garden, and had the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53905:112"/>
pleasure of seeing the Objects she beheld eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day. It was Sun-rising e're he thought of
retiring, which he did at last for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discover'd.</p>
            <p>He had not the power to go for Court,
without having seen Madam <hi>de Cleve.</hi> He
went to his Sisters, the Duchess of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi>
at her House near <hi>Colonniers:</hi> She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
surpriz'd at her Brother's arrival, but
he invented so probable a Pretence for his
Journey, and order'd his business so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly,
that she made the first Proposal of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting
Madam <hi>de Cleve.</hi> This design was to
be executed that very day, Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
having told his Sister, he would leave
her at <hi>Colonniers,</hi> and go directly thence to
the King. This he did in hopes she would
take her leave before his departure from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonniers,</hi>
and afford him an infallible oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of speaking to Madam <hi>de Cleve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At their arrival she was walking in the
Garden: The sight of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>
troubled her not a little, and silenc'd all
doubts of her having seen him the Night
before: It anger'd her to find him guilty of
so much boldness, and impudence. He was
heartily troubled to observe in her Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
an Air of Coldness towards him.
Their discourse was general, yet he had the
address to shew so much wit, so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53905:112"/>
and admiration for Madam <hi>de
Cleve,</hi> that he dissipated in some measure
the coldness she had express'd towards him
at first.</p>
            <p>His first fear being over, he seem'd very
curious to see the Pavillion in the Forrest:
He spoke of it as the most pleasant place in
the World, and describ'd it so particualrly,
that Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi> told him, he must
needs have been often there, to be so well
acquainted with all the beauties of it. <hi>I do not
think for all that,</hi> says Madam de Cleve,
<hi>Monsieur</hi> de Nemours <hi>has ever been there:
it has been finish'd but a while since. 'Tis not
long since I have been there,</hi> says he, looking
on her; <hi>and I cannot tell whether I have not
reason to be glad you have forgot seeing me
there.</hi> Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi> was so taken up
with viewing the beauty of the Gardens, she
minded not what her Brother said. Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> blush'd, and with her Eyes to the
Ground, without looking on Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
I do not remember,</hi> says she, <hi>I ever
saw you there; and if you were ever there, it
was without my knowledge. 'Tis true, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
says he, <hi>I was there without order, and
pass'd there the most cruel, as well as the most
pleasant moments of my Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> understood very well what
he said, but made him no answer: Her care
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53905:113"/>
was to prevent Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi>'s going
into the Bower where Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi>'s
Picture was, which she had no mind should
be seen. She kept her in discourse, and the
time pass'd away so insensibly, that Madam <hi>de
Mercoeur</hi> began to talk of going homewards:
But when Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> saw Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> and his Sister were not to go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
she quickly guess'd what she might be
expos'd to, and was in the same straight she
had been in at <hi>Paris,</hi> and made use of the
same Expedient: The fear she had this Visit
might confirm her Husbands suspicions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
much to the resolution she took.
That Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> might not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
alone with her, she told Madam <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur</hi>
she would bring her as far as the edge
of the Forrest, and order'd her Coach to be
made ready. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> turn'd
pale as Ashes, at the rigour of Madam <hi>de
Cleve.</hi> Madam <hi>de Mercoeur</hi> ask'd him if he
were ill. He look'd on Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
(though no body perceiv'd it,) and convinc'd
her by his looks, his illness was a pure effect
of his despair. However, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedy
but he must leave her in his Sisters
company, without daring to follow her;
and having told his Sister he would return to
Court directly from <hi>Colonniers,</hi> there was
no going back with her. He went for <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:53905:113"/>
and thence on the morrow for <hi>Chambort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s Gentleman had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
him all this while. He followd him
to <hi>Paris,</hi> and when he found Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> was gone for <hi>Chambort,</hi> he took
Post to get thither before him, and give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Journey. His Master expected
his return with impatience, as if the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or unhappiness of his Life depended
upon it.</p>
            <p>As soon as he saw him, he gather'd from
his Countenance, and his silence, he had no
good news for him: He continued some time
astonish'd, with his Face dejected, and not
able to speak to him; at last he made signs
with his hand he should withdraw. <hi>Go,</hi> says
he, <hi>I know what you have to say to me; but I
have not the power to hear it. I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you any thing,</hi> says the Gentleman, <hi>on
which to ground a sure Iudgment. 'Tis true,
Monsieur</hi> de Nemours <hi>went two Nights suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
into the Garden in the Forrest, and
the Day after he was at</hi> Colonniers <hi>with the
Duchess of</hi> Mercoeur. <hi>'Tis enough,</hi> replys
Monsieur de Cleve, <hi>'tis enough,</hi> making signs
to him to withdraw; <hi>I need no further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi>
The Gentleman was forc'd to leave
his Master abandon'd to his despair, which
was perhaps the most violent of any hath
been known: few men of his courage, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53905:114"/>
so deeply in love as he, having felt the same
time the grief caus'd by the unfaithfulness
of a Mistress, and the same occasion'd by
being deceiv'd by a Wife.</p>
            <p>His trouble was so great, it presently cast
him into a Fever; and with such ill Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
it was thought very dangerous. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> was inform'd of it, and came
away in all haste to him. When she arriv'd
he was worse: besides, she found him in
such a strangeness and coldness for her, she
was equally surpriz'd and afflicted at it: She
saw it was a pain to him to receive the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
she did him in his sickness, but she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it to his Malady.</p>
            <p>When she was come to the Court at <hi>Blois,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> could not forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
his joy at her being in the same place
where he was: He endeavour'd to see her,
and went every day to Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s
under pretence of enquiring after his health,
but all to no purpose: she stirr'd not out of
her Husband's Chamber, and was sorry at
the heart for the condition he was in. It
madded Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> to see her so
afflicted, as an Evidence of her kindness for
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and a dangerous diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the affection she had for Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours.</hi> But Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was sick
to that extremity, it gave him new hopes:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53905:114"/>
He saw it very probable Mad. <hi>de Cleve</hi> should
be shortly at liberty to follow her inclination,
and that he might expect some durable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and happiness for the future. But these
thoughts were too full of trouble and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to last, and the fear of further misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
by being frustrated of his hopes, put
them quite out of his Head.</p>
            <p>Monsieur de <hi>Cleve</hi> the mean time was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
given up by the Physicians. One Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(having had a very ill Night) he said
he would rest: Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
with him in the Chamber, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of taking any Repose, thought him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
restless. She fell on her Knees by his Bed-side,
and though Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had set
up a resolution never to acquaint her with
the violent displeasure he had conceiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her, yet the care she took of him, and
her great affliction (which he could not but
sometimes think real, as at other times he
look'd on it as an Evidence of dissimulation
and perfideousness) distracted him so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
with contrary Sentiments, that it was
not in his power not to give them vent.</p>
            <p>You shed many tears, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi>
for a Death you are the cause of, and cannot
give you the trouble you pretend to be in. I am
no longer in a condition to reproach you, <hi>adds he,
with a Voice weakened with sickness and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53905:115"/>
grief;</hi> but I die with the cruel and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
displeasure you occasion'd me: Was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
an Action so extraordinary as that you
told me of at <hi>Colonniers</hi> should have Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
so very unsuitable? Why would you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to me your passion for Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
if your Vertue could hold out no longer
to resist it? I lov'd you to that extremity, I
would have been glad to have been deceiv'd, I
confess it to my shame: I have lamented my
loss of that false repose you robb'd me of; why
did you not leave me in that quiet blindness so
many Husbands live in? peradventure I had
never known you had been in love with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours:</hi> I shall die, <hi>says he,</hi> but
know, you have made Death welcom and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to me; and having depriv'd me of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
and tenderness I had for you, you have
render'd my life a trouble, I cannot but abhor
it: What should I live for, <hi>continues he,</hi> to
spend my days with a Person I have lov'd so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
and as cruelly been deceiv'd by, or to
live apart from the same person, and to break
out openly into violences so opposite to my humor,
and the love I had for you? a love greater than
it appear'd to you; <hi>Madam,</hi> I hid a great part of
it from you, for fear of being troublesome to
you and forfeiting your Esteem by actions and
expressions of it not becoming a Husband. In
a word, I deserv'd your affection more than
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53905:115"/>
once; yet I die without regret, since I could not
have it, nor can desire it any longer. Adieu,
<hi>Madam:</hi> you will one day be sorry for a Man
that lov'd you with a true and honest passion:
You will feel the smart of your Engagements,
and know the difference between being lov'd as
I lov'd you, and their love, who pretending af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for you, seek only the honour of sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
you: But my death will set you at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and you may without a Crime make Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> happy. What matters it
what happens when I am no more, must I have
the weakness to trouble my head with those
things?</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was so far from imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Husband suspected her, she under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not what he meant, and fancied only
he reproach'd her for the Inclination she had
for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi> At last, awak'd on
the sudden; <q>A Crime, <hi>says she,</hi> I am a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the thoughts of it; the severest Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
could not have prescrib'd any Conduct
but that I have follow'd; I never did any
thing but I wish'd you a Witness of it:
Could you have wish'd me a Witness, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
he, (looking on her with disdain</hi>) the
Nights you spent with Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours?</hi>
Ah, Madam, is it you I speak of,
when I speak of a Lady that hath spent
Nights with a Man not her Husband! No,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53905:116"/>
Sir, <hi>says she,</hi> I am not the Person you speak
of; I never spent a Night, nor a moment
with Monsieur <hi>de Nemours;</hi> he never saw
me in private, I never endur'd he should do
it, I never gave him the hearing, I would
take all the Oaths—No more, Madam,
I pray, <hi>says he,</hi> a false Oath, or a Confession,
would perhaps trouble me alike.</q> Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> had not the power to answer, her
tears and her grief took away her speech:
Striving at last, <q>Look on me, <hi>says she,</hi> at
least give me the hearing; were it only my
Concern, I would bear your Reproaches,
but your Life is in the case: Hear me for
your own sake, I am so Innocent, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but I shall convince you of the
truth. Would to God you could perswade
me to it, <hi>crys he,</hi> but what is't you can say?
Hath not Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> been at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonniers</hi>
with his Sister? Had he not spent
the two Nights before with you in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Garden? If that be my Crime, <hi>replies
she,</hi> I can easily justifie my self: I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you should take my word; ask all your
Domesticks, and they will tell you whether
I went into the Garden the Night before
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> came to <hi>Colonniers;</hi>
and whether the Night before, that I went
not out of the Garden two hours sooner
than ordinary:</q> She told him, she thought
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53905:116"/>
she had seen one in the Garden, and confest
she believ'd it was Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi>
She spoke with that confidence, and truth,
though improbable, is naturally so perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
that Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of her Innocence: <q>I cannot tell, <hi>says
he,</hi> whether I ought to believe you; but I
find my self so near death, I would not
know any thing should make me unwilling
to die; you have convinc'd me too late,
yet it will ever be a comfort to me, to go
away with the thought of your being still
worthy the Esteem I have had for you: Let
me intreat you I may be assur'd of this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
comfort, that my Memory shall be dear
to you; and that if it had been in your
power, you would have had for me the
kindness you have for another.</q> He would
have gone on, but was so weak, his speech
fail'd him. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> call'd in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
who found him at the point of
death; yet he languish'd some days, and dy'd
at last with admirable Constancy.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was so afflicted, she was
almost beside her self. The Queen came to
see her, and took her into a Covent, yet she
was not sensible of it: her Sisters-in-Law
brought her back to <hi>Paris,</hi> when she was not
yet in a condition to give an account of her
grief: But when she began to have the power
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53905:117"/>
to consider what a Husband she had lost, that
she had been the cause of his death, and by a
passion she had had for another, the horrour
she had for her self, and for Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
surpasses expression.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> at first durst pay her
no other Respects but what decency requir'd:
He knew her too well to think any other
would be acceptable, and found afterwards
he must observe the same Conduct a very
long time.</p>
            <p>A Servant of his told him, that Monsieur
<hi>de Cleve</hi>'s Gentleman, being his intimate
Friend, and lamenting to him the loss of his
Master, said to him, that Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>'s
Journey to <hi>Colonniers</hi> had caus'd his
death. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was extermely
surpriz'd at the discourse; yet after some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
he could guess partly at the truth of
it, and judg'd presently what Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
would think of him, and what a distance it
would occasion between them, if she once
believ'd her Husbands distemper proceeded
from his jealousie of him: He thought it not
best to put her in mind so quickly of his
Name, and stuck to that resolution, though
it went against the heart of him.</p>
            <p>He took a journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> and could not
forbear calling at her Gate to ask how she
did: He was told she admitted no Visit, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53905:117"/>
had commanded they should not trouble her
with an account of any that came to see
her; an Order given perhaps on purpose to
prvent her hearing of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:</hi>
but he was too deeply in love to live
absolutely depriv'd of the sight of her, and
resolv'd to find means, how difficult soever,
to get out of a condition he thought so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> afflicted her self beyond
Reason; the Death of her Husband, and
caus'd by her, a Huband dying with such
tenderness for her, still ran in her mind, she
could not forbear reflecting every moment
on the duty she ought him, and condemning
her self she had not had the affection for him
he deserv'd, as if it had depended on her
power: All the comfort she had, was to
know she lamented the loss of him as his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
requir'd, and was resolv'd the rest of her
life to do nothing but what, had he liv'd, he
would have been certainly pleas'd with.</p>
            <p>She had often been thinking how he came
to know Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> had been at
<hi>Colonniers:</hi> She could not suspect he had told
him; yet if he had, she valued it little, she
thought her self so perfectly cur'd of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
she had had for him: but she was griev'd
at the heart to think him the cause of her
Husbands Death, and was troubled at the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53905:118"/>
thought of the fear Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> had
exprest at his Death she would marry him:
But these griefs were drown'd all together in
that of the loss of her Husband, which was
so great, she seem'd to have no other.</p>
            <p>After several Months the violence of her
affliction began to abate, and she fell into a
state of sadness and melancholly, being seiz'd
with a pining and languishing grief: Madam
<hi>de Martigues</hi> made a journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
during her stay there visited her often;
she entertain'd her with discourse of the
Court, and the passages there; and though
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> appear'd unconcern'd, yet
Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> continued that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
in hopes to divert her.</p>
            <p>She told her news of the <hi>Vidame,</hi> of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Guise,</hi> and all others any way remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for their Persons or Merit. As for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> says she, I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
business hath not dispossest his heart of
the Gallantry he was so much addicted to:
sure I am he is not gay and jovial as he us'd
to be, and he seems not to affect the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Ladies; he goes often to <hi>Paris,</hi> and I
believe is there now. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was
so surpriz'd at the name of <hi>Nemours,</hi> that she
blush'd: But she chang'd the discourse, and
Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> perceiv'd not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
she was in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:53905:118"/>The morrow Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> being in
search of business suitable to her condition,
went to a Neighbours house, who was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for having a particular Excellency in
weaving of Silks, and she design'd to have
some done to her fancy. Having seen several
pieces of his work, she spy'd a Chamber-door
where she thought there were more Silks, and
spoke to them to open it: The Master an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
he had not the Key, and that the
Chamber was taken by a man who came at
certain hours of the day to take the Prospect
and Plat-form of the fair houses and Gardens
to be seen from his Windows. He is, adds
he, the handsomest man I ever saw, and looks
not like one that works for his living; when
ever he comes, I observe he looks still to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the houses and Gardens, but I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see him work.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> heard this discourse very
attentively; what Madam <hi>de Martigues</hi> had
told her (that Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was now
and then at <hi>Paris</hi>) she apply'd in her fancy to
that handsom man coming so near her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and grew up into an Idea of Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> labouring for a sight of her, which
gave her a confus'd trouble which she knew
not the cause of: she went towards the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to see where they look'd, and found
they fac'd the Garden, and her Apartment.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53905:119"/>
When she went to her Chamber, she could
easily see the Window where she was told
that man used to stand in for taking his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
The thought that it was Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> produc'd a great alteration in her:
she presently lost that melancholly repose she
had begun to enjoy, and fell into great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
and disturbance of spirit: Not able to
stay at home, she went to take the air in a
Garden in the Suburbs, where she hop'd to be
alone: At her arrival she thought she was
not deceiv'd, and walk'd a pretty while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
seeing the appearance of any one.</p>
            <p>Having cross'd a little Wilderness, she
perceiv'd at the end of a Walk, in the further
part of the Garden, a kind of Bower open on
all sides, and made towards it. When she
came near, she saw a man laid on the Bank
who seem'd sunk into deep meditation, and
upon stricter view appear'd to be Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours:</hi> she stopt immediately, but her
people who waited on her made some noise,
which rouz'd Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> out of
the study he was in. He to avoid the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he thought was coming towards him,
started out of his place, without so much as
looking about who had made the noise, and
turn'd away into an Alley, having made a
low Reverence, which hinder'd him to see
those he saluted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:53905:119"/>Had he known whom he avoided, how
quickly would he have return'd? But he
went on along the Alley, and Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>
saw him go out at a back-door, where his
Coach waited for him. What an effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
this sight in the heart of Madam <hi>de
Cleve?</hi> What passions did it raise there? what
a flame did it kindle out of the Embers of
love? and with what violence it burnt?
She went and sat her down in the place Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> was newly risen from; her
fancy immediately represented him the most
amiable Person in the World, and one who
had long lov'd her with a passion full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and fidelity, slighting all for her, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
even to his torment, labouring to see her
without a thought of being seen by her,
quitting the Court (whose Darling he was)
to come and look on the Walls where she
had inclos'd her self, and spend his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
hours in places where he had no hopes
to meet her. In a word, a man who deserv'd
love for the manner of his Engagement, and
for whom she had an inclination so violent,
she could not have chosen but have lov'd
him, though he had not lov'd her; besides,
a man of high Quality, and suitable to hers:
All the obstacles from Duty or Vertue were
now remov'd; and of their former Estate,
there remain'd now only the passion Monsieur
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53905:120"/>
               <hi>de Nemours</hi> had for her, and the passion she
had for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Idea's were all new (her affliction for
the death of Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> having so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her up, that she had not of a long time
entertain'd a thought of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
but) at the sight of him they croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into her head and her heart.</p>
            <p>But having taken her fill of these thoughts,
when she remembred that the man she look'd
upon as a fit Husband for her, was the same
she had lov'd in her late Husbands life, and
had been the cause of his death, who as he
was dying exprest a fear she would marry
him, it so shock'd the severity of her Vertue,
she thought it equally criminal to marry
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> now her Husband was
dead, as it was to love him while he lived.
She yielded her self up to these Reflections
so pernicious to her happiness, and fortified
them with many Reasons that concern'd her
repose, and the inconveniences she foresaw
would attend her Marriage with Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours.</hi> At last, after two hours stay in
the place where she was, she return'd home,
under a perswasion she was to avoid the sight
of him, as a thing absolutely contrary to her
duty.</p>
            <p>Yet this perswasion being a pure effect of
her Reason and Vertue, master'd not her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53905:120"/>
Her heart was still for Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours,</hi> inclining to him with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
it brought her into a condition to be
pitied, having quite robb'd her of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
never had she Nights more restless
and tormenting. In the morning, the first
step she made, was to see if any one were at
the Window that look'd towards her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
she went, she saw Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
and return'd with that haste, he had
reason to judge she knew him. He had long
wish'd she might take notice of his being
there, since his passion had put him upon
finding that way of seeing her; and when he
was out of hopes of that pleasure, his
course was to go muse in the Garden where
she found him.</p>
            <p>Tir'd at last with a condition so unhappy
and uncertain, he resolv'd to try some way
of knowing his Fortune: <q>What would I
stay for, <hi>said he,</hi> I have known long enough
she loves me; she is at liberty, and hath
now no Duty to plead against me: why
should I be reduc'd to see her, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seen by her, and speaking to her? Is it
possible Love should so absolutely take away
my Reason, and my Courage, and make me
differ so much from what I have been in my
other Amours? 'Twas fit I should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
a respect for the grief she was under,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53905:121"/>
but I express it too long, and give her time
to Master the Inclination she had for me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After these Reflections, he thought of the
means of seeing her; he thought he had no
reason to conceal his passion any longer from
the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> he resolv'd to tell
him of it, and the design he had for his
Neece.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vidame</hi> was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Town
being very full of company who came to fit
their Equipage to attend the King, who was
going to conduct the Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> went to the <hi>Vidame</hi>'s, and
made an Ingenous Confession of what he
had till then conceal'd from him, except only
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s inclinations for him, which
he would not own he knew.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vidame</hi> receiv'd all he said with a
great deal of joy, and assur'd him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he knew his mind, he had often thought
(since Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> had been a Widdow)
she was the only Lady worthy of him. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> pray'd him to help him to
the speech of her, and let him know the same
time how he found her dispos'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vidame</hi> propos'd to bring him to her
house; Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> thought it
might offend her, who had not yet admitted
any Visit. They agreed the <hi>Vidame</hi> should
pray her to come to his house, on some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53905:121"/>
or other, and that Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
should come to them by a Back-stair,
that no notice might be taken of it. Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> came, the <hi>Vidame</hi> went to receive
her, and led her into a great Closet at the end
of his Apartment: A while after Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours</hi> came in, as by chance: Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> was extremely surpriz'd to see him;
she blush'd, and endeavour'd to hide it. The
<hi>Vidame</hi> spoke of other matters, and went out
as if he had been to give order about some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
He pray'd Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> to use no
Ceremony at his house, and told her, he
would return presently.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to express the Sentiments
of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and Madam <hi>de
Cleve,</hi> seeing themselves alone, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to speak to one another, as they had
never been before. Both continued silent
a while: At length, <hi>Will you pardon the</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
<hi>Madam, says</hi> Monsieur de Nemours,
<hi>that he hath given me an opportunity of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you, which you have always so cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
me? I ought not to pardon him,</hi> replied
she, <hi>for having forgot the condition I am in,
and how much he exposes my Reputation by this
proceeding.</hi> Having said so, she would have
gone away; Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> staid her,
and said, <hi>Fear nothing, Madam, there's no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at all, no Body living but the</hi> Vidame <hi>knows
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53905:122"/>
I am here. But hear me, Madam, hear, if
not out of any kindness you have for me, yet
for your own sake, that you may be rid of the
extravagancies I shall infallibly run into,
through a passion I can no longer master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> yielded for once to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
she had for Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
and looking on him with eyes full of kindness
and Charms: <q>But what is't you hope for,
<hi>says she,</hi> from the Complaisance you desire of
me? you will perhaps repent you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
it, and I shall certainly repent I have
granted it: You deserve better fortune than
you have hitherto had, or can have for the
future, unless you seek it elsewhere. I seek
it elsewhere, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> is there any
other happiness to be found but in your
love? Though I never spoke of it before,
Madam, yet I could not believe you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of my passion, nor imagine but you
knew it the truest and the most violent that
ever was, or will be: what tryals hath it
been proof against, that you know not of?
what tryals have you put it to by your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are minded to hear me speak, and I
am resolv'd to do it, <hi>answers Madam de
Cleve,</hi> and with that sincerity and clearness
you shall rarely meet with in those of my
Sex; I will not tell you I have not had that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53905:122"/>
inclination for you, you have had for me;
perhaps, should I say it, you would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it: I will confess to you, I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been sensible of yours for me, but as sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of it as you could wish: And were
you sensible of it, Madam, yet not affected
with it at all? May I presume to ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it made not some impression upon you?
You may judge of that by my Conduct,
<hi>says she,</hi> but I would know what you
thought of it? I must be in a happier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than I am, <hi>says he,</hi> before I dare answer
you; all I can tell you is, I heartily wish'd you
had not confest to Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> what
you hid from me, and that you would have
conceal'd from him, what you made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me: How came you to know, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
she blushing,</hi> that I confest any thing to
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve?</hi> I knew it from your
self, Madam, <hi>says he:</hi> but that you may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my boldness in listening to your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
I appeal to your memory, whether
I made ill use of what I heard, whether my
hopes were rais'd by it in the least, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I had any greater boldness to speak to
you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He began to give her an account how he
heard he discourse with Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi>
but she interrupted him, saying, <q>No more
of that, I see how you came to be so well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53905:123"/>
I thought you knew it too well,
when the Queen-Dauphin told me the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
which she had learnt from those
you had made acquainted with it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> gave her a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
relation of it: <q>You may spare your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
<hi>says she,</hi> you have my pardon long
since, though you gave me no reason for it:
but since I have told you what I design'd to
conceal from you while I liv'd, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to you, you have inspir'd me with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
I was altogether a stranger to till I
saw you; and so far from imagining my self
capable of them, that the surprize height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the trouble that always attends them.
I am the less asham'd to make you this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
because it is made at a time I can do
it without Crime, and that you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
my Conduct was contrary to my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Can you believe, Madam, <hi>says he, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself at her feet,</hi> but I shall die here
in a transport of joy? I have told you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>says she smiling,</hi> but what you knew
too well before: Ah Madam, what a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
there is between learning it by
chance, and knowing it from your self, and
seeing withall you are willing I should
know it: 'Tis true, <hi>replies she,</hi> I am willing
you should know it, and I find pleasure in
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53905:123"/>
telling it you; yet I cannot tell but I may
tell it you more for my own sake, than
yours; for when all is done, you are not to
expect any effect suitable to the confession I
have made: I am resolv'd to follow the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
Rules my duty prescribes: You are
at liberty, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> and under no
obligation of duty, or if under any (if I
may be allow'd to say so) 'tis in your power
to make it your duty to preserve those Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
you have had for me: My duty, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
she,</hi> forbids me ever to think of any
man, but particularly of you, for reasons
unknown to you: They may be unknown
to me, Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> but they cannot be
good; I believe Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> thought
me more happy than I was, and that you
had approv'd those extravagancies my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
put me upon without your consent:
Let us talk no more of that Adventure, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
she,</hi> I cannot endure the thoughts of
it, I am asham'd of it; and the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have been so fatal, it grieves me at the
heart: 'tis but too true you were the cause
of Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi>'s death; the suspitions
your inconsiderate Conduct rais'd in him,
cost him his life, no less than if you had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it from him with your own hands:
Consider what I ought to have done, had
you two come to the extremity of a Duel,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53905:124"/>
and he had been kill'd;'tis not the same
thing in the eye of the World, but in mine
there's no difference, since I know 'tis you
have been the cause of his death, and on
my account: Ah Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> what a
shadow of duty do you raise against my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?
shall a vain and groundless fancy
hinder you to render a man happy, whom
you have no unkindness for? what, have I
had some ground to hope I might pass my
life with you? hath my fate led me to love
the most Estimable Person in the World?
have I observ'd in her all that can make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
adorable? has she had no unkindness
for me? have I found in her Conduct no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what I would desire in my Wife?
(for, Madam, you are perhaps the sole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in whom these two things have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd,
to the degree they are in you; they
that marry Mistresses who have lov'd them,
cannot but fear they may use the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
towards others they have done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; but in you, Madam, I can
fear nothing, I see nothing in you but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of admiration) have I had a prospect of
so much felicity for no other end, but to see
it obstructed by you? Ah Madam, you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
you have distinguish'd me from the rest
of men, or rather you have not distinguish'd
me, you have deceiv'd your self, I have flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
my self.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:53905:124"/>
               <q>You have not flatter'd your self, <hi>says she,</hi>
the Reasons of my duty would perhaps not
appear so strong to me, had I not made that
distinction of which you seem to doubt;
and 'tis it gives me a Prospect of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Consequences of a nearer Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with you. I have nothing to answer,
Madam, <hi>replies he,</hi> when you tell me you
are afraid of unfortunate Consequences;
but I confess, after all you have been pleas'd
to say to me, I did not expect from you so
cruel a Reason. It is so far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any way offensive to you, <hi>answers
she,</hi> I had much a do to tell it you. Alas,
Madam, <hi>says he,</hi> how can you imagine me
so vain, to flatter my self with any thing you
shall say to me, having heard what you
have already told me. I will speak to you
again, <hi>answer she,</hi> with the same sincerity
as before, and without those Reserves and
Niceties I ought to have in my first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to you of this kind; but I conjure
you hear me without interruption.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think my self oblig'd to give the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
you have for me the poor recompence
of letting you see what my Sentiments are:
This probably will be the only time of my
life I shall do it in; yet I cannot without
blushing confess to you, that the certainty
of being no more lov'd by you, as I am, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53905:125"/>
to me so dreadful a misfortune, that
had I not invincible Reasons, grounded on
my duty, I doubt very much whether it
would be in my power to expose my self to
that unhappiness. I know you are free, and
that I am so, and that the condition of
things is such, that the Publick perhaps
should have no cause to blame you or me,
should we be ingag'd to one another for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
But are men us'd to continue their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
during those long Engagements?
or am I to expect a Miracle in my favour!
And shall I put my self in a condition to see
that passion at an end, in which I place all
my felicity? Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> was perhaps
the only man in the World capable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and maintain a passion for his Wife;
it was my ill fate I was not able to reap the
advantage of that happiness; and perhaps
his passion had not lasted, but that he found
I had none, but I should not have the same
means to preserve yours: I believe you owe
your constancy to the obstacles you have
met with; you saw enough to ingage you
to encounter and overcome them, and my
actions against my will, or what you learnt
by chance, gave you too great hopes to be
discourag'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ah Madam, says Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi>
I am not able to keep the silence you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53905:125"/>
me; you do me too much inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and make it appear too clearly, you
are far from being prepossest in my favour:
I confess, <hi>says she,</hi> my passions may lead me,
but they cannot blind me; nothing can
hinder me to know you have a natural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
to Gallantry, and all the qualities
requisite to give you success; you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
been in love with several, and you
will be so again: I should be no longer she
you plac'd your happiness in, I should see
you as much for another as you had been
for me: this would mortally grieve me, and
I am not sure I could save my self from the
torment of Jealousie: I have said already
too much to conceal from you, that you
have made me know what Jealousie is,
and that it tormented me so cruelly the
night the Queen gave me Madam <hi>de The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
Letter, which it was said was addrest
to you, that I have to this moment an Idea
of it, makes me believe it the greatest of
evils: There's not a woman, but out of
vanity or inclination hath a mind to ingage
you; there are very few but you please;
my experience would make me believe
there is not any but it is in your power to
please: I should think you always in love,
and belov'd, and I should not be often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
yet in this case, what remedy for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53905:126"/>
me but patience? I question much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I should dare complain: a Lover may
be reproach'd, but shall a Husband be so,
for no other cause but that he loves one no
longer? Could I use my self to bear a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
of this nature, should it ever be in
my power to bear that of imagining I saw
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> every hour accuse you of
his death, and reproach me I had lov'd you,
I had marry'd you, and make me sensible of
the difference between his kindness and
yours? 'Tis impossible for me to overcome
the strength of these Reasons; I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the condition I am in, and the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
I have taken never to alter it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Ha, do you think you can do it, Madam,
cryes Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> do you believe
you can hold that resolution against a man
that adores you, and hath the happiness to
please you? 'Tis more difficult than you
think, Madam, to resist that which pleases
and loves us; you have done it by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd
severity of vertue, but that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
no longer opposes your affections, and I
hope you will follow your inclination,
though against your will: I know, <hi>says she,</hi>
there's nothing more difficult than what I
undertake, I mistrust my own strength in
the midst of my Reasons; the duty I owe
the memory of Monsieur <hi>de Cleve</hi> would be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53905:126"/>
too weak, if not supported by Reasons
drawn from the concern of my repose, and
the interest of my repose hath need of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from Reasons grounded on my duty to
his memory: yet though I distrust my self,
I believe I shall never overcome my scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
nor have I any hopes to overcome the
inclination I have for you; it will make
me unhappy, and I must deny my self the
sight of you, how hard soever I strain for't.
I conjure you by all the power I have over
you, never more seek an occasion to see
me: I am in a condition makes that Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
which were allowable another time;
Decency forbids me all Commerce with
you.</q> Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> threw himself
at her feet, and by his words, and his tears,
exprest the tenderest and liveliest passion that
ever heart was affected with: Madam <hi>de
Cleve</hi> was not insensible, and with eyes swell'd
with tears, <hi>why must it be,</hi> cries she, <hi>that I
should charge you with the death of Monsieur</hi>
de Cleve? <hi>why did not my first acquaintance
with you begin since I have been at liberty, or
why did I not know you before I was ingag'd?
why did Fate separate us by such invincible
obstacles? There is no obstacle at all, Madam,</hi>
replies he, <hi>you, and you only obstruct all my
happiness; you impose upon your self a Law
which neither Vertue nor Reason require you
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53905:127"/>
to do: 'Tis true,</hi> says she, <hi>I sacrifice much
to a duty which subsists only in my imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
have patience, and expect what time may
produce; Monsieur</hi> de Cleve <hi>is but newly
dead; the sad Object is so near, and so fresh,
it cannot as yet but dazle my eye-sight, I see not
things clearly and distinctly as before; the
mean time enjoy the pleasure to know you have
gain'd the Heart of a Person, who would never
have lov'd any man had she not seen you: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Sentiments I have for you will last
for ever, and whatever becomes of me, they
will still be the same. Farewel,</hi> says she, <hi>I am
asham'd of this discourse; I am willing you
should give the</hi> Vidame <hi>an account of it, and
I pray you to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was not in his power to stay her any
longer: As she was going out, she found the
<hi>Vidame</hi> in the next Room; he saw her so
troubled he durst not speak to her, and led
her into her Coach without saying a word
to her. He came back to Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
who was so full of Joy, of Grief, of
Astonishment, of Admiration, of all those
affections that attend a passion full of hope,
and of fear, that he had not the use of his
Reason. It was a long time e're the <hi>Vidame</hi>
could get from him an account of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
He had it at last, and (setting Love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side)
Monsieur <hi>de Chartres</hi> no less admir'd the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53905:127"/>
Vertue, the Wit, and Merit of Madam <hi>de
Cleve,</hi> than Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> did: They
consider'd what he was reasonably to hope
for; and as fearful as his Love made him, he
agreed with the <hi>Vidame</hi> it was impossible she
should hold long in that resolution; yet
they thought it necessary to obey her Orders,
lest if the Publick should take notice of his
inclination for her, and she should declare her
self, and enter into Engagements before the
World, which she would afterwards stick to
for fear it should be thought she lov'd him in
her Husbands life-time.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> resolv'd to follow
the King, without so much as endeavouring
to have sight of Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> from the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
place, before he went. He pray'd the
<hi>Vidame</hi> to speak to her in his favour: What
an infinite number of Reasons did he furnish
him with to perswade her against her scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?
The <hi>Vidame</hi> thought he would never
make an end, having made it late in the
night before he ended his discourse.</p>
            <p>As for Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> it was a matter so
new to her, to have been out of the restraint
she had impos'd on her self, to have endur'd
the first Declaration of Love ever made to
her, and to have declar'd her self to be in
Love, that she scarce knew her self: she was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53905:128"/>
amaz'd at what she had done, she repented
it, she was glad of it, all her thoughts were
full of trouble and passion: she examin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Reasons of her duty which obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her happiness; she was sorry to find them
so strong, and repented she had made them
out so clear to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> though
the first moment she saw him in the Garden
she presently had a thought of marrying him;
but that thought had not made such impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as the discourse had since with him;
and sometimes she could not comprehend
how she could be unhappy in marrying him:
She could have wisht with all her heart she
had had no grounds for her past scruples, nor
future: At other times, Reason and her Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shewed her so many things to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that carried her violently into a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to marry again, nor ever to see Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours;</hi> yet this was a resolution
hard to be establish'd in a Heart so mov'd as
hers, and so newly abandon'd to the Charms
of Love. At last, to be at some ease, she
thought it was not yet necessary to force her
self to take these violent resolutions: She had
in decency a long time to consider of it; yet
she was fully resolv'd to hold no further Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with Monsieur <hi>de Nemours.</hi> The
<hi>Vidame</hi> came to see her, and serv'd Monsieur
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53905:128"/>
               <hi>de Nemours</hi> with all the wit and industry
imaginable; but he could not perswade her
to alter her Conduct, nor to revoke her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Orders to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> not
to see her. She told the <hi>Vidame</hi> her design
was not to alter her condition; that she knew
she should meet with some difficulty in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it in Execution, but hop'd she should be
able to do it. She made him so sensible how
much she was concern'd at the opinion of
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> having caus'd the death
of her Husband, and how fully she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
it was against her duty to marry him,
that the <hi>Vidame</hi> was afraid it would be very
difficult to take away those impressions. He
did not acquaint Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> with
his Apprehensions, but gave him an account
of their discourse, and all the hopes a man
who is belov'd can reasonably have. They
went away on the morrow to meet the King.
The <hi>Vidame</hi> writ to Madam <hi>de Cleve,</hi> at the
request of Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> to speak in
his behalf: in a second Letter from the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
to her, Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> writ a
line or two with his own hand; but Madam
<hi>de Cleve</hi> resolv'd to observe strictly the Rules
she had prescrib'd her self, and fearing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
Letters are subject to, writ to the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
she would not receive any more Letters
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53905:129"/>
from him, if he continued to mention Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Nemours;</hi> and added such Assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> made it his
request to the <hi>Vidame,</hi> not to name him any
more.</p>
            <p>The Court went to conduct the Queen of
<hi>Spain</hi> as far as <hi>Poitou;</hi> Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
at home: the more distant she was
from Monsieur <hi>de Nemours,</hi> and every thing
that might put her in mind of him, the more
she remembred Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> whose
memory she made it her business to honour.
The Reasons for her not marrying Monsieur
<hi>de Nemours,</hi> appear'd very strong on the
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of her Duty, but altogether invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when she consulted her Repose: The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
she had, Marriage would put an end
to his Love, and the torments of Jealousie be
the infallible Consequent, gave her the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of inevitable unhappiness if she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his desires: On the other side, she
thought it impossible to refuse (if he were
present) the most amiable Man in the World,
who lov'd her, and whom she lov'd, and to
refuse him in a thing that shock'd neither
Vertue nor Honour; she thought nothing
but absence and distance could give her the
power to do it; she found she stood in need
of it, not only to maintain her resolution to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53905:129"/>
be no further ingag'd, but to keep her from
seeing Monsieur <hi>de Nemours:</hi> she resolv'd to
take a long Journey to pass away the time
she was oblig'd in decency to live retir'd:
the large Possessions in Lands she had towards
the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> she thought the most proper
place she could pick out. She set out a few
days before the Court return'd, and writ at
parting to the <hi>Vidame,</hi> to conjure him not to
think of once enquiring after her, nor wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to her.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was more troubled
at this Journey, than another would have
been at the death of his Mistress: the thought
of being depriv'd a long time of the sight of
Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> griev'd him extremely, and
the more in that it happen'd when he had
lately enjoy'd the pleasure of seeing her, and
seeing her affected with his passion; his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
increas'd daily. Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> was
no sooner arriv'd at her house near the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renees,</hi>
but she fell desperately ill. The news
was brought to Court: Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
was inconsolable, his grief proceeded
to despair and extravagance: The <hi>Vidame</hi>
had much ado to make him forbear shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his passion in publick, and was scarce
able to keep him from going in Person to
enquire how she did. The kindness and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53905:130"/>
near Relation between her and the <hi>Vidame,</hi>
was a very good pretence to send several
Courriers to her. At last they brought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
news she was out of that extremity of
danger she had been in, but had still a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
malady that took away the hopes of
life.</p>
            <p>This gave her a sight of Death, both near
and at distance, and represented to her the
things of this World quite otherwise than
they appear to those in health. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of dying she saw her self so near to,
wean'd her from the World; and her mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was so lingring, it accustom'd her to it,
and made it habitual; yet when she was a
little recover'd, she found Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
was not quite defac'd out of her heart;
but to defend her self against him, she call'd
to her aid all the Reasons she thought she
had against marrying again. After long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
she subdued the relicks of that passion,
which had been weakned by the Sentiments
she had in her sickness; the thoughts of death
having reproach'd her with the memory of
Monsieur <hi>de Cleve,</hi> and being agreeable to
her duty, made deep impression in her heart.
She saw clearly the vanity of the passions
and Engagements of the World, her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Body contributed much to her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53905:130"/>
yet being sensible what power op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
hath over the sagest resolutions, she
was unwilling to hazard the breach of those
she had taken, by returning into any place
where she might see him she lov'd. Under
pretence of changing the Air she retir'd into
a Religious House, without declaring a setled
resolution of quitting the Court.</p>
            <p>At the first news of it, Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
felt the weight of her retreat, and saw
the importance of it. He believed presently
his hopes were at end, but omitted not any
thing that might obliege her to return to
Court: He prevail'd with the Queen to write;
he made the Vidame not only write but go
to her, but all to no purpose: the Vidame
saw her, but she told him she had settled her
resolution. Yet he was of opinion she would
not return to Court. At last Monsieur <hi>de
Nemours</hi> went himself to her, under pretence
of going to the Waters; she was extremely
surpriz'd and troubled at the news of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
she sent him word by a person of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whom she lov'd, that she desir'd him not
to take it ill if she did not expose her self to
the danger of seeing him, &amp; destroying by his
presence those sentiments she was in duty
obliged to preserve: that she desir'd he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53905:131"/>
should know she found it both against her
duty and repose, to yield to the inclination
she had to be his, and that therefore all things
else in the world were become so indifferent
to her, she had renounc'd them for ever, and
taken her leave of the world; that her
thoughts were wholly imploy'd about the
things of another life; but as to this, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
nothing else, but to see him so dispos'd as
she was.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> was like to have
dy'd in the presence of her who brought him
the news: Madam <hi>de Cleves</hi> had not only
absolutely forbidden her to carry any mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from him, but to give her account of
their discourse upon her delivering him the
message from Madam <hi>de Cleve:</hi> thus was
Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> forc'd to part opprest
with the heaviest grief a man is capable of,
who hath lost all hopes of ever seeing again
a person he lov'd, not only with the most
violent, but the most natural and best
grounded passion that ever was. Yet he
was not so discourag'd, but he us'd all means
imaginable to induce her to alter her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
At last after several years, time and
absence abated his grief and extinguish'd his
flame: Madam <hi>de Cleve</hi> liv'd a life that took
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53905:131"/>
away all appearance she would ever return
to Court: One part of the year she spent in
the Religious House, and the other part at
her own, but retyr'd, and imploy'd constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Exercises more holy than the severest
Covents can pretend to: Her life, though
short, having left us a multitude of examples
of inimitable Vertues.</p>
