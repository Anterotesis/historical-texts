            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:41747:7"/>
pleadings and power of holding Plea, in that Court of Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene partie and partie, as now they doe.</p>
            <p>There is a Statute made in the 23. <hi>H.</hi> 6.10. which giveth every man from whom any money is extorted, by an Officer, other then the Statutes do allow, power to sue the Extortioner in action of Debt for fortie pounds which he shall recover by tryall at Law, and twentie pounds thereof his Majesty is to have, and the other twentie pounds the partie wronged, and that sueth for the same is to receive, this I shall shew all men that are wronged and desire reliefe, and restitution of their injury, if they will be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to me, to be satisfied in it, with severall other benefits the Law hath provided for, our good and quiet living, and enjoyment of our owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Estates and Liberties, and there is provided in them, punishment for those vile and unsufferable creatures, called ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting Bayliffes, Marshalls men, and Jaylers.</p>
            <p>Now having here shewed the Jurisdiction of the Marshalls Court and their just Fees and priviledges, and wherefore ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I am very confident that you are and may be satisfied, that that Court which usually sitts every Friday in Southwark is of no validety, nor hath any power or Jurisdiction to execute that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they wrongfully and unjustly doe, upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people every day, and that no processe issuing out of that Court, ought to have obedience yeilded to it, but is onely a collour for their rapines and cheating the people, for what money soever is by pretence of Law forced from the Subject contrary to Law, is a meere cheat, and no better then plaine English Theevery.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Fees usually taken by the Court and their Officers, as many as I know I will herein set downe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, viz. Their Writ two shillings and six pence, whereof there is Eighteene pence paid, and the Marshalls man coseneth the other twelve pence, which he calleth the advantage of the Writ and then this Writ must be executed, the Marshalls man for doing it, must have ten or twenty shillings, otherwise he will not doe it, nay hee shall sweare a hundred Oathes in an hower, that the Defendant which is to be Arrested is a man very seldome to be seene, and a dangerous man and this hee shall sweare over and over againe,
<pb facs="tcp:41747:7"/>
that if it were not for the Plaintiffe whom he takes to be his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friend, he would not execute it for that money, no if it were for his owne Father, and that he shall spend more in waiting for him, then he doth aske for serving the Writ, all which is false, for no sooner is the Plaintiffe gone, but he goes and fetcheth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and so they two go to an Alehouse, and drink lustily, and so the Marshalls man getteth money of him, and sometime tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Bayle, but if it be one of his acquaintance, then he taketh a bribe and letteth him goe, or if a Begger then to the Goale, he is presently carryed, and you see the first extorted Twelve pence is as much as is due, if he did Arrest one the full twelve miles, from the sitting place of the Court; And when they Arrest one, and deteyne him for want of Bayle, hee must presently give two suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient House-keepers, bound with him in a Bond of fortie pounds, or more, according as the Marshalls man pleaseth, for his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall appearance the next Court, and this Bond is taken in the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors name, and not in the Knight Marshalls name which ought to be done, and must presently pay five shillings and six pence, for the Knight Marshalls Fee, and bayle bound when there is but six pence due, that is two pence for admitting him to <hi>Manucaptors,</hi> and foure pence for the bayle Bond, there is you see five shillings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted; And if for want of Bayle the Arrested be committed, his Prison his Fees are eighteen shillings foure pence for the turne Key, (<hi>alias Dictus</hi> turned extorting knave) &amp; there is but foure pence due and (the eighteene shillings is extorted) to be paid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prisoners discharge out of Prison, two shillings for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Garden, to take the Ayre, which makes the Jaylor Heire, of an estate gathered by compulsive extortion out of both Heires, young Brothers, and beggers Estates; Two shillings and six pence the Garnish, which is to be spent in Beere, in the Seller of the Prison, this makes the Tapster rich, giving so much <hi>per</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to the Jaylor for drawing the Beere, five shillings a week for a Chamber, when the King commands Lodgings, Bedding, Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, Chamber-pot, Bason, and foure pence a day in all his Prisons, to be given to the Prisoner, otherwise the Prisoner for Debt (which is an honest mans case, or a Prisoner upon a commitment
<pb facs="tcp:41747:8"/>
by a court of Iustice, and commonly not deserved) is in a worse and sadder condition, and case then a Theefe or Fellon, who is allowed so much, and shall a poor Debtor or an imagined mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor have no thing, then the fellon is farre before a Debtor or misdemeanor in respect he is at every Sessions following, his commitment, (except in some speciall cases) either condemned to dy for his fact, if proved or set at iiberty, and the others must ly and starve by degrees, a lingring death, and one of the cruelest for hunger compelleth passion in a man, and to attempt almost a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny thing, even to kill himself, to cry out against King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for want of releefe and Justice, yea, sweare, curse and blaspheeme their God, the mother in such case to eate her owne Children, as in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to eate their owne Dunge, their shoes their owne flesh, and what not, this is a pitifull punishment for nothing that a poore prisoner is forced to, so horrible, is a star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving life, till the grave cures, yet <hi>Magna Charta</hi> doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell any to ly and dy in prison, for debt or misdemeanor, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise provides reliefe and succour, if it were put in execution And <hi>I</hi> never heard of any man hanged for debt, and in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it were better hang debtors then starve them, A multitude of other just demands, the poore prisoner is forced to pay, or else to lye and starve, as it is a usuall thing with Jaylors, for prison sees, be the parties never so poore, and not one penny so deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded due, to deteyne them in this kind, and when he comes to Court to give bayle, he must pay five shilings ten pence, when there is but two pence due, This is the nature of their proceedings in that Court, by which meanes they pillage and rob the poore Countrey of at least two hundred thousand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> amongst them all.</p>
            <p>And to further dispute the Cause with them, they pretend that the Court they now keepe is not the Marshalls Court, but the Court of the Kings Palace of <hi>Westminster,</hi> granted to them by Pattent bearing date at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the twelfe day of Iuly, in the sixt yeare of King <hi>Charles</hi> his raigne, which his Majesty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the good of the Subjects (of which <hi>I</hi> am very confident his Majesty conceived so, but the contrivers got it past for the
<pb facs="tcp:41747:8"/>
goods of the Subject) as by them is practised and reported) to be gotten by the advice of the then Judges of the Kings Bench, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas, the Barrons of the Exchequer, and Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestifs then Atorney.</p>
            <p>To which specious pretence of theirs I answer that the Kings bench where the King sits himselfe Cheife Justice, held in <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Hall</hi>; where other Iudges of that Court, sit as assistants to his Majesty for the matter of Law, is the Court of the Kings pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Westminster,</hi> held, in the pallace of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the greate Hall there (formerly the Court for his Majesties house) and that the Kings Bench <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Court of the Kings Pallace of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> is evident by all the Statutes concerning that court in the Statutes at large, to be seen and read. And the then Judges, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Mr Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> were no Parliament and therefore could not repeale the severall acts of Parliament that setled the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalls Court of the Kings paliace of Westminster, thereby to take away the power and Jurisdiction of them two courts to make a cleare power in the King to dispose of them by this new Pattent, and all the World knowes that King and Parliament must repeale Acts of Parliament otherwise they are still in force and where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any thing is by his, Majesty granted; and confirmed by Act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Iurisdiction of that guift be it just or unjust is good untill repealed by Act of Parliament. Provided it be not against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Chapters of <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be ommitted in this Case what <hi>Nagna charta</hi> sayes, that is the City of London and all other cities, Townes, and Ports shall enjoy all their free charters, and customes, without encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any power whatsoever, and this was long before the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of <hi>Sexto Car.</hi> and therefore by the way of goods advice let me intreat you good <hi>Mr. Win,</hi> and your servitures by vertue of that pattent not to infringe Liberties and corporations, any more for if ie be any longer continued, some body must accompt for it.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the manner of their proceedings, which are as hereafter according to my knowledge I will declare.</p>
            <p>First their originall Processe, is an odd Writ called a <hi>Non omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41747:9"/>
which put spirit into the heart of the Marshalls man (as in this case is requisite to put a good face upon a bad matter) that he hath more power then the Sheriffe of each County upon an originall Proces by which he can enter into and arrest in five Counties, <hi>viz. Essex, Kent, Middlesex, Surry,</hi> and <hi>Hartfordshire</hi> which makes him desperate with his Sword by his side, and sweare and drink, and dominere, that he is a brave fellow, and he hath a <hi>non omittas,</hi> and sweares 40. or 50 Oathes one after another, that he will enter any liberty within them, five Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies within twelve mile round, their Court in Southwark, and doth so, and Arrests within them all and the writ is his warrant, and the Court will beare him out in it, and the Sheriffe durst not doe soe, and why will not every one sue within their Court and veirge (when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is neither veirge nor power, and not at Common-Law, for there they shall be sure to recover, this is the Marshalls mans carriage with his Writ.</p>

            <p>To give you an Accompt of some of the Erronious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of that Court in the writ and Exordium of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formerly by me set downe, and how all their Arrests are false imprisonment trespasse and batteries, and the &amp; fees mony so taken extorted and forced from the Arrested, I intended to satisfie you in some thing, but not in all part lye in respect, I cannot here in my Iron Cage procure the yeare bookes, <hi>Dyer, Cooke,</hi> and such as you should have Cited, and partly I hould it sufficient to tell my enemy, I will fight with him, and that <hi>I</hi> challenge him as I do now againe the Marshalls Court, or that Court Mr. <hi>Henry Wyn</hi> is Steward of, if they durst come to a faire Tryall with me at the Common Pleas Barre, concerning the Jurisdiction of that Court, to hold plea in actions betwixt party and party not being of the Kings house, &amp; how by them as yet I have suffered out of purse above 2300. l. besides my credit no man knows whether or no by all the wayes or meanes I can use, though it be by many costly &amp; troublesome Law, Suits or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise receave one peny thereof, for if I should set forth all that I know, and can make appeare of that Court, it were to arme my enemies being Rich and numerous, and leave my selfe in a kind of naked condition, my estate being most in other mens hands, and a stranger in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and friendlesse <hi>Gomorah,</hi> yet I feare them not, for my heart is good, and just, my Actions honest, and my wayes streight, and one that have not done any wrong, but can bouldly dare that man who ever he be, or ever soe rich to meet him in any place, and with the spirit of truth tell him thou liest, if so be shall devulge any thing that may carry the least species of dishonesty, or scandall against me, I
<pb facs="tcp:41747:11"/>
serve and feare my God, and love all honest people, and know not to day whether I shall see to morrow, and love Heaven better then money, not fearing death, counting him an insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting knavish Scicophant that knowes any dishonest act by me done and is silent, not procuring just punishment to be insflcted on me for it, which is all the comfort I have, in my fortified Castle garded more then regarded, and watched both night and day, where my selfe with many more causelesly gaze away our time, thinking what Law hath produced such a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in the bowells of one house, and when to be delivered, into the new part of the ould City, there to be rebaptized, by the name of Goale Birds, amongst our scandalous enemies, to the honour of our Nation, that Gentlemen shall have new Titles, in this time of Reformation.</p>
            <p>But to returne to my ould work, of the Marshalls Court, I will satisfie you every one, if you will repaire to mee, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever point you conceave dubions concerning the jurisdiction of that Court, and in what manner you shall ground your Actions for Recovery which shall be so fixt as upon a Rock, and also make it appeare so cleare as the Sun at noone day, that every one that hath beene sued in that Court shall recover da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for his false imprisonment.</p>
            <p>First what Fees are allowed in the Statutes, you have read them, and what they have received, to whom, when, and where paid is best knowne to your selfe, and how long you have been imprisoned, or in custody, by whom and when, where to find their Estates, <hi>I</hi> am very well satisfied and can let you know it, and for their extortions in what nature to be punished, and what restitution you may recover, <hi>I</hi> will give you an accompt of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, note the nature of the Writ of such power and force, being directed to the Carryers of the Rodds of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Ministers of the Court of the Kings Pallace of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:41747:12"/>
where <hi>ipse facto</hi> there is no such Officie (but they that make this Writ tollerate, signe, seale, and execute, it had need of A Thousand Rodde Carryers, and beadells to whip them out of this peece, which may bee would put some better law into their heades, or beat them into more wisdome and honesty) and to let you understand a little more, the court of the Kings palace of <hi>Westminster</hi> is the court of the Kings Bench, and they have noe such offices as rodd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, but tippstaves, &amp; the carriers of the Rodds, are the Knight Marshalls men (as <hi>I</hi> have formerly proved by the statutes) depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him to serve the processe of that court, by virtue of their capias with their roddes in their hands, livery coates upon their backs, and cognizances upon their sleeves, this should be their garbe, and by this they are known to be officers, and every one who is by him arrested, ought to yeeld obedience, and to defend themselves in due course of law, but contrary to this rule, or any good rule, they issue forth their writs, with a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiums quod non omittatis propter aliquam libertutem infra jur. curie predict</hi> (when neither themselves, or any one else knowes the jurisdiction of that court, caled the court of the Kings pallace of Westminster which they hold in Southwarke) <hi>quin capiatis &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>By vertue of this writ being a dangerous on, &amp; clean contrary to law they euter, and break into the foresaid several Counties and the ancient charters and liberties thereof, they impudence,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and insolent violence infringe, break and enter, taking to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by this illegall Writ of <hi>Non ommittas,</hi> full power and authority to justifie any arrest within twelve miles about their Court in any Corporation or Liberty in these sive Counties, as in <hi>London,</hi> wher one <hi>Edward Gunsmith</hi> did arrest M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Landgridge,</hi> and carried her to the Marshalsey, from Shoe-Lane, and in Westminster, where be at least forty Arrests every weeke in the liberties of the Tower, White Chappell, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

Clinke, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Giles, and many others; <hi>I</hi> am confident you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how that no inferiour Court can grant proces out of one County into another, as this Court doth (except the Marshalls Coutt for the Kings house, which Court is alwaies to attend his person wheresoever he goeth, and this is by speciall Act of Parliament and not by Pattent or Common Law) And none of the Kings superiour courts at Westminster. can do it but with special direction to'th Sheriff of of each County, who is to make returne of all such writs, and here they arrest in generall, in the five severall counties by one writ, and the Sheriffe never hath any knowledge of it, or of any such Writ (a horrid boldnesse) and carry away the arrested whether they please, out of one County into another, let all men consider what an infringement of liberties this is, and with so much impudence Justified, and not one officer who live in such infringed l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:41747:13"/>
by so many Kings confirmed upon us utterly overthrowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wholy in his Majesty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the test their writs from the last session of their court before they take it forth and make it returnable, <hi>in fra tres septimanas tunc prox. sequen.</hi> what a false and erronious writ is this, the Law cannot any way warrant such a returne, but there a turne must be the next court after the test, and they keep their court every Friday, and so the returne cannot bee, but from Friday to Friday.</p>
            <p>If this returne of theirs were law why cannot the Kings bench or common pleas issue forth writs beareing test in Trinity Term to be retornable in Easter terme following, tis all one and the same law, and if an inferiour court can doe this, why not a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Court, if any Atturney. Be it of the Kings bench or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pleas should make such a writ, he would be thrown over Barr, and imprisoned for it, as he should well deserve, and so consequently if this were law, an Attorney might make a writ tested last terme, and returnable seaven yeares since, and arrest any one by vertue of it presently after the writ issued for upon a pretended account of ten thousand pound, and for want of bayle the arrested must lye in prison, untill the returne of the writ,</p>
            <p>Fourthly they command the body of the arrested to be brought before the Judges of the Court, of the Kings pallace of <hi>Westminster</hi> which is a strange power in my opinion, that the Knight Marshall by vertue of his writ out of that court held in Southwarke should command any man to be arrested and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to prison, and his appearance to be before justice <hi>Bacon</hi> or justice <hi>Roll</hi> at the Terme, which is the court time of the court of the Kings Pallace of <hi>Westminster,</hi> when their tests are not to the writs, they being the Judges of the Court, of the Kings pallace of <hi>Westminster,</hi> but the test of this writ is by Sir
<pb facs="tcp:41747:13"/>
               <hi>Edward Sidenham,</hi> he having nothing to doe there, or in any other Court, neither hath he taken the oath of a Judge in any Court, and if he had taken such an oath, yet he is a Delinquent, and the Office of Knight Marshall, as much as concerneth him in that Court, and the benefit thereof long since sequestred, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him by the Committee of Sequestrations in the County of Surrey, and let to another for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirtie pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> And Sir <hi>Edward Siddenham</hi> hath not yet made his Composition, yet the Test of the Writ is still in his name, which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuats the writ in it selfe, for by the Votes of the 20. of MAY, 1642. and by the Statutes of the 11. R. 2.1. H. 4. the same is confirmed, all Delinquents are declared Traytors, and he being a Delinquent, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be within compasse of the Votes, which if he be, let all Lawyers and wise men give their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon, whether or no the Test of the Writ be in a Traytors name, and if tested by a Traytor, then the Writ is cleerely void and of none effect, and what man will be so base and unworthie a fellow, to yeeld obedience to Traytors test or command, thereby confederating with him, It will be objected that the Chancery, Kings Bench, and Common-Pleas writes bear the Test of the Keeper, and Chiefe Justice after they be came Delinquents, which is true, but not after their Offices were sequestred and taken from them, for then the Committee for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, Justice Bacon, and Justice Reeve bore the Tests of the Writts, Moreover Sir Edward Siden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
<pb facs="tcp:41747:14"/>
Pattent is void into severall waies, by which he is made Knight Marshall, first his Pattent is not inrolled in the Rowles here in due time, and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it is past under the ould Great Seale at OXFORD, which by vertue of the Ordinance of both Houses of Parliament is void, that Ordinance declaring all Graunts, Pattents, &amp;c. past under the ould Great Seale since the twentieth second of <hi>May</hi> 1642. void, which was the time Littleton the Keeper Run away to York with the seal, and at that time, and sinre Sir Edmond Varney was Knight Marshall, who was at Edgehill, the twentie third of <hi>October</hi> following kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, after whose death Sir Edward Sidenham had his Pattent to be Knight Marshall sealed with the ould Great Seale. So the whole foundation of the Court is destroyed, the Knight Marshall not being Knight Marshall whose Test is to the Writts, and also the Marshalls men have no Deputaion from the Knight Marshall, which must of necessity be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they are no Marshalls men, and so all their Arrests every way false imprisonment, and let all men judge if that Court hath not ruined it selfe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, their writts run to Arrest John Doe, and Richard Roe in an action of Trespas, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare some times in debt, sometimes in Trover in Action <hi>sur le</hi> Case, and the like which is repugnant to Law, for wherefore shall I Answer to any other action according to the Common Pleas proceedings which is Law, then that I was Arrested for and put in Bayle to, and wherefore shall not I have
<pb facs="tcp:41747:14"/>
Costs upon that Action by nonsuit if not declared against, according to the first Proces, and Arrest.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, by what Law or rule, I must be bound to answer to an Incippitur, such a one as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, I know not, but sure I am that such an Incippitur is a peece of non sence and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere the name of a Declaration, the Steward if he were a just Steward ought to grant a <hi>non pros.</hi> upon it for want of a Declaration, but for the Courts benefit, that lawfull proceeding is slighted, and instead thereof puts the poore Defendant by lawlesse and irregular rules and other by blowes, to a very long attendance, and much cost, and lately one Gilbert Barrell one of the Attorneys of that Court hath found out a quirk which he pretends to be Law, to preserve the Plaintiffe from paying the Defendant Costs, when there is no cause of Action, that is to declare in a good Declaration, and when the Defendant answereth, to demurre to the Answer, and so the Judgement shall passe against the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, and that Court gives no cost upon a demurrer, this was his client Bowers his case against Mrs. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thus in an odd erronious way, and kind of proceedings they go on, and when they are to enter Iudgement in any Case, this is their Exordium which I have litteratly set downe formerly, out of which have observed one pritty passage, and the like is in their VVrit, which I will onely mention, and so endeavour a Conclusion.</p>
            <p>Note they make their writ retournable before the
<pb facs="tcp:41747:15"/>
Judges of the Court of the Kings Palace at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, of which Court Mr. Win pretends to be Steward, and Tests it with Sir <hi>Edward Sydenhams</hi> Test, Knight Marshall, and so Ioyn both the Court and Steward, and Knight Marshall together.</p>
            <p>And for their Judgement they begin with <hi>Curia Domini Regis Palatii Regis Westm</hi>: &amp;c. Which Court is not the Court of the Kings Pallace at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> but the Kings Bench is the Court of the KINGS Pallace of VVESTMINSTER, as I have formerly Declared and cannot be held in Surrey as aforesaid, unles by special adjournment is <hi>tenta coram Edw. Sidenham milite Marescallo Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitii Domini Regis et Henerico Win. Ar. Senlo. cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pred.</hi> and so in all their proceedings joyne their two courts in owne to make as they say a <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> and need they have to if that would helpe, but the worst is, neither of their courts hath jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the King come, and then but one, and that is the Marshalsey for his Majesties house, and is not this able to trouble Mr. Win, that the power of two Courts cannot make one, yet neverthelesse he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth them both together by which meanes mony e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough will begotten if the Spawnes of that Court, the Marshalls men, be carefull to sow Sedition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, between the Scoulds, Bawdes, and Whores, within their Veirge, from whom most of their living and benefit comes.</p>
            <p>The last of my exceptions that I intend at this time in this Booke to set forth; is to intreat you to take
<pb facs="tcp:41747:15"/>
notice of their executions retornable within a yeare and a day, within which time there is 52 Courts, one every week held, wherefore shall not the Common Law make forth an execution returnable 52 Terms after the Test of the Writ, and so that Writ will not be out of Date, or the return past in 52. Terms, which is about Thirteen yeares, I do not thinke but it is false imprisonment in any one to execute such a writ when the Law will not allow them to make it retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but from court to Court, as the Common Law doth from Terme to Terme.</p>
            <p>If a man could but have the full view of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, I am verie confident he should discover more errors in one day then he could with his penne devulge in a Yeare.</p>
