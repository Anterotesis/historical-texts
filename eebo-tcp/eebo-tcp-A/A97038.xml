            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Mr. WALLERS Speech in the Houſe of
Commons this preſent Parliament.
1641.</head>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> J will uſe no Preface as they doe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
men to ſomething to which they would perſwade
them and move their affections, I will onely propoſe
what I thinke fit for the Houſe to conſider, and ſhall
be no more concerned in the event then they that ſhall heare me.
Two things are conſiderable which I obſerve in his Majeſties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
Firſt, the Supply: Secondly, our ſpeedy diſpatch thereof,
touching the firſt his Majeſties occaſions for Money are too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
For (to ſay nothing) how are we neglected abroad, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
at home, the calling of this Parliament and our ſitting
heere is an effect which no light cauſe could in thoſe times have
produced, and enough to make any reaſonable man beleeve that
the <hi>Exchequer</hi> abounds not ſo much in money as the <hi>State</hi> doth
in occaſions to uſe it, and I hope we ſhall appeare willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thoſe who thought to diſſwade his Majeſty from this way
of Parliaments, as doubting it uncertaine, and to let him ſee it is
as ready and more ſafe for the advancement of his Affaires then
any new (or pretended old way) whatſoever.</p>
            <p>2. Now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> for the ſpeedy diſpatch required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
was the ſecond thing, which not onely his Majeſty but <hi>(Res ipſa
loquitur)</hi> the occaſion ſeemes to importune no leſſe, nec<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſity is
come upon us like an armed man, and yet the uſe of Parliaments
heretofore (as appeares by the <hi>Writs</hi> which call us hither) was
to adviſe with his Maieſty of things concerning the <hi>Church</hi> and
<hi>Common-wealth;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it hath ever been the Cuſtome
of Parliaments by good and wholſome Lawes to refreſh the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>
in generall, yea to deſcend into the Remedies of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
grievances before any mention made of ſupply, looke back
on the beſt Parliaments and ſtill you ſhall find that the laſt Acts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111136:3"/>
are for the free gift of the Subjects on the peoples part, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
pardons on the Kings part, even the wiſeſt of Kings have
firſt acquainted their Parliaments, with their deſignes and the
reaſons thereof, and then demanded the aſſiſtance both of their
counſels and purſes.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Phyſitians though they be called of the lateſt,
muſt not ſtomack it or talke what might have beene but apply
themſelves roundly to the cure. Let us not ſtand too nicely upon
circumſtances, nor to rigidly poſt the matter of ſupply to the
healing of our lighter wounds, let us doe what may be ſupplya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
done with reaſon and honeſty on our parts, to comply with
his M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jeſties deſires, and to prevent the eminent evills that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
us.</p>
            <p>But conſider Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> that they who thinke themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
undone can never apprehend themſelves in danger, and they
that have nothing left can never give freely; nor ſhall we ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the truſt of thoſe that ſent us hither, or make them beleeve
that they contribute to their owne defence and ſafety, vnleſſe his
Majeſty be plea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed firſt to reſtore them to the propriety of their
good and lawfull liberties, wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reof they eſteeme themſelves now
out of poſſeſſion. I need not tell you, that the propriety of our goods
is the mother of courage and nurſe of Induſtry, which makes us
valiant in warre and good husbands in peace, the experience I have
of former Parliaments, and my preſent obſervations of the care
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Country hath had to chooſe perſons of worth &amp; courage makes
me thinke this Houſe like the <hi>Spartans</hi> whoſe forward valours
required ſome faſter Muſique to allay and quiet their ſpirits, too
much moved with the ſound of Martiall Inſtruments. It is not
the feare of impriſonment or (if need be) of death it ſelfe that can
keepe a true hearted <hi>Engliſhman</hi> from the care to leave his part
of the Inheritance as intire to poſterity as he received it from his
Anceſtors. This therefore let us firſt doe (and the more ſpeedily)
that we may come to the matter of ſupply, let us give new force to
the many Lawes which have beene heretofore made for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of Rights and Priviledges, and to reſtore this Nation to
the fundamentall and vitall liberties, the propriety of our goods
and freedome of our perſons; no way doubting but that wee ſhall
find his Majeſty as gracious and ready as any of his Royall proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors
have been to grant our juſt deſires therein, for not onely 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111136:3"/>
the ſimpleſt doe thinke but the wiſeſt doe know; that what we
have ſuffered, we have ſuffered for his Miniſters, but the perſon
of no King was ever better beloved of his people, and that no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were ever better ſatisfied with the wayes of levying of monies
are two truths which may ſerve to demonſtrate the other, for ſuch
is their occaſion to the preſent courſes, that neither the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they have of his Majeſties inclination to Juſtice and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor the pretended cont<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of the Iudges could willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to this late tax, and ſuch is their naturall love and
juſt eſteeme of his Majeſties goodneſſe, that no late preſſure could
provoke them nor any example invite them to diſloyalty or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
But what is it that hath bred this miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King and the people, how is it that having ſo good a
King we have ſo much to complaine of? Why Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> we are
told of the Sonne of <hi>Solomon</hi> that he was a Prince of a tender
heart, and yet by the advice of violent Counſellors, how rough an
anſwer he gave his people, <hi>that his finger ſhould be heavier then
his Fathers Loynes.</hi> I dare ſay, that it was not his owne but the
voyce of ſome perſons about him, that wanted the gravity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
requiſite for the Counſellors of a young King. I love not
to preſſe Allegories too farre, but the Reſemblance of <hi>Iobes</hi> ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with ours holds ſo well, that I can not but obſerve it to you: it
pleaſed God to give his enemies to afflict him, and yet he was no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
provoked to rebell againſt him ſo much as with his tongue (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had no good example of one that lay neere him) and
felt not the halfe which he ſuffered. I hope his Majeſty will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
God in being neere it too, and as he was ſevere to <hi>Iob</hi> onely
whilſt he diſcourſed with another concerning him, but when he
vouchſafed himſelfe to ſpeake to him, began to rebuke thoſe who
had miſtaken and miſjudged his caſe, and to reſtore the patient
man to his former proſperity: ſo now his Majeſty hath admitted
us his preſence and ſpoken face to face with us, I doubt not but
we ſhall have fairer dayes and be as rich in the poſſeſſion of our
owne, as ever we were I cannot but wonder at thoſe who ſeeme
to doubt the ſucceſſe of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the miſunderſtanding
betwixt the King and the people ſhould laſt any longer now we
are ſo happily met.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties wants are not ſo great but that we may finde

               </gap>
to ſhun, and how neceſſary the uſe of moderation is, and for his
Majeſty he hath had experience enough, how that proſpereth
which is gotten without the concurrent good will of the people,
for never more money was taken from the Subject, nor never more
want in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> if we looke upon what we have payd it is
more then the people of <hi>England</hi> ever did in ſuch a time, if wee
looke upon what hath beene effected therewith, it ſeemes wee
have acted the <hi>Belides</hi> part, whoſe puniſhment was the filling of
a ſive with water: whoſoever gave adviſe for theſe courſes hath
made good the ſaying of the wiſe man, <hi>Qui conturbat domum
ſuam poſſidebit ventum,</hi> by new wayes they thinke to accompliſh
wonders, but in truth they graſe the wind and are in the meane
time <hi>ambobus Achilles,</hi> cruell to us and to the King too, for let the
Common wealth flouriſh and then, he that hath the Soveraignty
can never want or doe amiſſe ſo as he governes not according to
the intereſt of others, but goe the ſhorteſt and ſafeſt wayes to his
owne and the Common good with regard how they ſtand in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to any private mans deſires or preſervation,</p>
            <p>The Kings of this Nation have alwayes governed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
if wee looke upon the ſucceſſe of things ſince Parliaments
were layd by, it reſembles that of the <hi>Grecians, Ex illo fluere &amp;
retro ſublapſa referri Res Danaum,</hi> eſpecially in the Subjects
part, for though the King hath gotten little the ſubjects have loſt
all; but his Majeſty ſhall now heare the truth from us, and we
ſhall make to appeare the errours and wandrings up and downe
of our Divines, who would perſwade us that a Monarch can be
abſolute, and that the King may doe all things <hi>ad libidinem;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
not onely from their text, though that be a wandering
too but from the way which their owne profeſſion might teach

               <hi>Stare ſuper vias antiquas,</hi> &amp; remoove not the ancient bounds
and land markes which our Fathers have ſet. If to be abſolute
were to be reſtrained by no Lawes, then can no King in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
be ſo, for they all ſtand obliged to the Lawes of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
and we aſke no more, for to this Pillar are our Priviledges fixt,
our Kings at their Coronation taking a ſolemne Oath, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring

them. I am ſorry theſe men take no more care of informing
our faith of thoſe things which they told us for our ſoules health
whilſt we know them manifeſtly in the wrong, in that which
concernes the libertie, and priviledges of the Subjects of <hi>Engl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

but they get promotion and preferment, and then it is no matter
though they neither beleeve themſelves nor are beleeved of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
but ſince they are ſo ready to let looſe the conſciences of
our Kings, we muſt be the more carefull to provide for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

municipall Lawes of this Kingdome. It is worth the obſerving,
how now this opinion or rather this way of riſing is ever amongſt
themſelves &amp;, yet Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> who ſure was no refractory man (as
they tearme him) thinkes that the firſt government was arbrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

cauſe of all mens miſeries, and that this was the originall of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Lawes;</hi> And Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if we looke further back, our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
will tell us that the <hi>Prelates</hi> of this Kingdome, have often
been the mediators betweene the King and his Subjects and to
preſent and pray for redreſſe to their grievances, and had then as
much love and reverence from the people as now they want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
theſe Preachers are more active then their predeceſſours, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
then the Lawes, who have found out a better forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
The King muſt be a more abſolute Monarch then any of his
predeceſſours, and to them he muſt owe it though in the meane
time they hazard the hearts of his people and involve him into a
thouſand difficulties; For ſuppoſe the forme of government were
convenient (yet this is but a ſuppoſition) for theſe 500 yeares it
hath not onely maintained us in ſafety, but hath made us victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
over other Nations: but, I ſay, ſuppoſe they have another
<hi>Idea</hi> of one more convenient, we all know <hi>how dangerous Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
are, though to the better, and what hazard thoſe Princes
run that enterpriſe the change of long eſtabliſhed government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> of all our Kings that have gone before, and
of all that are to ſucceed in this happy Race, why ſhould ſo good
and ſo pious a King be expoſed to this trouble and hazard beſides
that <hi>Kings ſo diverted can never doe any great things abroad.</hi> But
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> whilſt theſe men have bent their wits againſt the
Lawes of their Country, whether they have neglected their owne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111136:6"/>
charge, and what Tares are growne up in the field, which they
ſhould have tilled, I leave it to a ſecond conſideration, not but that
Religion ought to be the firſt thing in our purpoſes and deſires;
but that which is firſt in dignity is not alwaies to preceed in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for well being ſuppoſed a being, and the firſt impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which men naturally endeavour to remove, is the want of
thoſe things without which they cannot ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God firſt aſſigned unto</hi> Adam <hi>maintainance of life, and</hi> gave him
a title above the reſt of the creatures before he appointed him a
Law to obſerve, and let me tell you, that if our Adverſaries have
any ſuch deſigne, as there is nothing more eaſie then to impoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
on people deprived of their liberties, ſo there is nothing
more hard then to doe it upon Free-men; <hi>and therefore (Mr,</hi> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<hi>I conclude with this motion, that</hi> an order may be preſently
made, that the firſt things this Houſe will conſider of, ſhall be the
reſtoring this Nation in generall to its fundamentall liberties, the
propriety of our goods, and the Freedome of our perſons, and that
then we will forthwith conſider of the ſupply ſo much deſired, and
thus we ſhall diſcharge the truſt repoſed in us by thoſe that ſent
us hither, <hi>his Majeſty will ſee that we will make more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
