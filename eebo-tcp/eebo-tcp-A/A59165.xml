            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat pass'd in Heaven before the third day of the Ides of <hi>October, Asinius Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Acilius Aviola</hi> being Consuls, in that New year which gave beginning to a most happy Age, I will now declare: nor shall any thing proceed either from Injury or Favour. But if I be ask'd, how I know it to be true: First, unlesse I please, I will not answer. Who shall constrain me? I know I recover'd my liberty when he dy'd, who verifi'd the Proverb, <hi>He must be born a Tyrant or a Fool.</hi> If I list to answer, I'll speak what comes in my head: Who ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Oath of an Historian? But if I must needs produce my Authour, ask him who saw <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla</hi> ascend to Heaven: the same saw <hi>Claudius</hi> take his journey thither, though not with equal pace. Whether he will or not, he must see what's done in Heaven. He is the Supervisor of the <hi>Appian</hi> way, which thou knowest <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> took when they went to the Gods. If thou enquir'st of him, he'll whisper to thee alone, but if others be present, will not speak a word; for since he swore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36859:5"/>
in the Senate he saw <hi>Drusilla</hi> ascend to Heaven, and no man gave any credit to so good news, he affirm'd in plain terms, that if he saw a man kill'd in the very Market-place, he for his part would not tell it. What I heard from this man, I relate for truth, so happy and sincere do I esteem him.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Now <hi>Phoebus</hi> had abridg'd his rising light,</l>
               <l>And the time sooner did to sleep invite.</l>
               <l>And now prevailing <hi>Cynthia</hi> her reign</l>

            </q>
            <p>I think it would be better understood, if I said the Month of <hi>October,</hi> or the third day of the Ides thereof. I cannot tell justly the hour; Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers agree more easily then Clocks: but it was between Six and Seven. Poets are too tedious in their descriptions; they cannot be content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the rising and setting of the Sun, but they will also disturb Mid-day. Wilt thou also thus pass over so good an hour?</p>

                  <hi>Sol</hi> now had pass'd the middle part of Heaven,</l>
               <l>And to his bending Steeds the reins had given,</l>
               <l>And towards Night his flaming Charriot driven.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Soul of <hi>Claudius</hi> began to forsake his Body, but could not find the way out: when <hi>Mercury,</hi>

who ever delighted in his Wit, calling forth one of the Three Fatal Sisters, said, Why, cruel VVoman, dost thou suffer this wretched man to be so torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who, alas, never deserv'd it? It is now the sixty and fourth year since he struggled with his Soul. VVhy does thy envy deny him death? Permit Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers to tell at last the truth, who from the time he was made Prince, every year, every month, have been carrying him to his grave. And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they err'd; no man knew the hour of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: For, indeed, no man ever thought him born. Do what ought to be done.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Give him to Death, and in a better sort</l>
               <l>To reign permit him in an empty Court.</l>
            </q>

               <l>The task was easy, with small labour done:</l>

                  <hi>Phoebus</hi> assisted with his songs, and joy'd</l>
               <l>At future good; his hands were oft imploy'd,</l>

               <l>And while they heard him sweetly sing and play,</l>

In the mean time they all bid <hi>Claudius</hi> adieu, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him good luck, pray'd him to hasten out of his Palace. So he stirted out his Soul in a fit of Wind, and seemed to live no longer. He dy'd whilest he was hearing Comoedians, that thou mayst know I have some reason to fear them. The last words he was heard to utter, when he sent out a great sound from that part where he could more readily speak, were, <hi>Out alas! I think I have bewray'd my self.</hi> I know not what he then did; but I am sure he bewray'd all things else. What was afterward done
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36859:7"/>
upon Earth is needless to declare, you know it sufficiently; publick joy hath deeply imprinted it in our memories: no man can forget his own felicity. Hear now what was done in Heaven: Let the Author's credit gain belief. It was told <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that a certain person was come, of a good stature, somewhat gray, and threatned I know not what, for he continually shook his head, and drew his right leg after him: and being ask'd of what Nation he was, answer'd in such a confus'd tone, and with so disturb'd a voice, his language could not be understood; and that he was neither <hi>Graecian</hi> nor <hi>Roman,</hi> nor of any known Countrey. <hi>Iupiter</hi> commanded <hi>Hercules</hi> (who had travail'd all the World over, and seem'd to know all Nations) to go and inquire what kind of man he was. <hi>Hercules</hi> went; and indeed was somewhat troubled at first sight of him, though he fear'd no Monster; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding an unusual countenance, and a gate seldom seen, and hearing a voice not like any earthly creature, but like some Sea-monster, hoarse and inward, he look'd for a Thirteenth Labour to be impos'd upon him: but eying more strictly, he seem'd to be as it were a man. He therefore accosted him, and, what was easie to one that understood a little <hi>Greek,</hi> said, What art thou? whence come'st thou? what is thy name? When <hi>Claudius</hi> heard this, he rejoyc'd to find there men that lov'd Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36859:7"/>
and began to hope the Histories he writ would be in some esteem: and intimating himself to be <hi>Caesar,</hi> utter'd this Verse of <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Into <hi>Ciconia</hi> by a furious blast</l>
                  <l>I driven was, when I from <hi>Troy</hi> had past.</l>
               </q>
But what follows is as much <hi>Homer,</hi> &amp; is more true;
<q>
                  <l>Where I the City and the State</l>
                  <l>Did both together ruinate.</l>
               </q>
And indeed he had put <hi>Hercules</hi> to his <hi>non-plus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a person little skilful in retorts, had not <hi>Febris</hi> been there, who leaving her Temple came alone with him: all the rest of the Gods and Goddesses he left at <hi>Rome.</hi> This man, said she, tells meet Fables. I who liv'd with him many years assure you he was born at <hi>Lions,</hi> and owes his privilege to <hi>Munatius.</hi> What I tell ye is true, he was born at <hi>Lions,</hi> fifteen miles from <hi>Vienna:</hi> He is a right <hi>French-man,</hi> and therefore as became a <hi>French-man</hi> he took <hi>Rome.</hi> I present him for the same born at <hi>Lions</hi> where <hi>Licinius</hi> rul'd long. And thou <hi>Hercules,</hi> who hast trod over more Countreys then an ordinary Mule, must needs know men of <hi>Lions,</hi> and that <hi>Xanthus</hi> and <hi>Rhodanus</hi> are many miles distant. <hi>Claudius</hi> here grew angry, and with as much murmuring as he could make began to chafe. What he said no man understood; but he commanded <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

away, and with his hands opened, being strong enough to do what was usual with him when he caus'd mens heads to be struck off, he commanded them to cut off her head. Thou would'st have thought them all his enfranchis'd creatures, so little did they regard what he said. Then <hi>Hercules,</hi> Hear me, said he, thou Fellow; leave playing the fool: thou come'st hither where Mice eat iron. Tell me the truth quickly, or I'll dash out thy shallow brains. And that he might seem more terrible, he became a Tragoedian, and said,
<q>
                  <l>What place, speak quickly, gave thee birth?</l>
                  <l>This club shall pound thee else to earth,</l>
                  <l>Which many a cruel King hath slain.</l>

                  <l>And let me know what clime hath bred,</l>
                  <l>What land produc'd that shaking head.</l>
                  <l>When I went far the Realms to view</l>
                  <l>Of that three-body'd King I slew,</l>
                  <l>And brought from <hi>Spain</hi> with great renown</l>
                  <l>The noble herd to <hi>Argos</hi> Town,</l>
                  <l>I saw a Mountain which the Sun</l>
                  <l>From East beholds, from whose foot run</l>
                  <l>Two rivers, <hi>Rhone</hi> so fam'd for force,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Soane</hi> uncertain of the course</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36859:8"/>This he utter'd stoutly and boldly enough, but had some doubt he might be flapt by a fool. But <hi>Claudius,</hi> when he saw this couragious man, left trifling, for he knew well there was never his like in <hi>Rome</hi>; and also found that he himself had not such power and favour there: A Cock may doe much upon his own dunghil. Therefore, as far as he could be understood, he seem'd to say thus, I did hope (O <hi>Hercules,</hi> who art the most valiant God) to have had thy assistance: And if I were put to find Surety of the knowledge of me, I did expect thy Testimony, who know'st me very well: for thou may'st remember, I was he who in thy honour did daily administer Justice before thy Temple in the Months of <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>October</hi>: and thou know'st how much misery I endured, in sitting to hear the Lawyers plead night and day; into whose hands hadst thou fallen, though thou beest very stout, thou wouldst rather have cleans'd again the <hi>Augean</hi> Stables, so much more dung did I rake up. Well, said <hi>Hercules,</hi> I am content to be thy Patron, because I will: and then brake into the Assembly of Demi-gods who were consulting about <hi>Claudius</hi>: who murmuring at it, said, It is no wonder thou rushest into the Court, no place is shut from thee. But tell us now what God thou would'st have him. An <hi>Epicurean</hi> he cannot be, for he has no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himself, nor gives any to others. A <hi>Stoick</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:36859:9"/>
God? how can he be, as <hi>Varro</hi> says, round and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, having neither head nor prepuce? 'Tis true, he hath something of a <hi>Stoick,</hi> for we see he hath neither brains nor head: yet he might justly have desired this favour of <hi>Saturn,</hi> whose feast he cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated all the year long. But <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> would never endure it, in regard he sought what he could to kill <hi>Lucius Syllanus</hi> his Son in Law, whom he condemned of Incest. And why, I pray? Because he desir'd that his Sister (being one of the spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full'st women in the City, and was therefore called <hi>Venus</hi>) should be styl'd <hi>Iuno.</hi> He would not seem to tolerate Incest at <hi>Rome,</hi> though it were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the half degree at <hi>Athens,</hi> and in the whole at <hi>Alexandria</hi>; because, as he said, at <hi>Rome Mice lick Mil-stones.</hi> This man would teach us to make crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things straight. What he does in his Chamber we know not; but he searches all the corners of heaven, and would be made a God: He thinks it a small matter to have a Temple in <hi>Britain,</hi> where the Barbarians give him Divine honour, erecting, as it were, an Altar to his eternal Dominion. At length <hi>Iupiter</hi> finding the matter agitated with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd interlocutions among inferiour Gods, advis'd them to dispute no longer, and wish'd every one that had interest in that Assembly to declare his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. I, Fathers Conscript, saith he, have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to deliver your judgements in this sublime
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36859:9"/>
Court, which you have made no better then a Thatch'd house. I will have the ancient discipline observ'd. This man, whatsoever he is, what will he think of us? <hi>Claudius</hi> being withdrawn, first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ianus</hi> was ask'd his opinion; who being very subtle, was made Afternoon-Consul in the Calends of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and alwayes looks both before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind at once. He having been conversant in Courts of Justice, was very Eloquent, and spake so much that the Scribe of the Court could not set down all, and therefore I do not repeat it, lest I should put what he said into other words. He spake much of the Greatness of the Gods, and that so high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ought not to be given promiscuously. It was wont to be counted a great matter to be made a God; you have lessened the reputation of it. And therefore, said he, that I may not in my sentence look so much upon the person as the matter, I advise that none henceforth be made a God that eats the fruits of the earth, or whom the fertile earth in any sort nourishes. Whosoever, contrary to this Act, shall be made, feign'd, or be painted a God, let him be thrown to Hobgoblins, and at the next Prize to be play'd by the new Fencers, let him be soundly whipt. The next that delivered his judgement was the Son of <hi>Vica Pota,</hi> who was also design'd a small Bankier Consul; formerly he subsisted by Traffique, and in petty Cities sold Jars of Oyle. <hi>Hercules</hi> stept
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36859:10"/>
handsomely to him, and rounded him in the ear. He then said, Since divine <hi>Claudius</hi> was near in blood to divine <hi>Augustus,</hi> who no less then he did sollicit the Deification of his Grandmother <hi>
                  <unclear>Augustae</unclear>
               </hi> and did indeed far excel all mortal men in wisdome; and that it is expedient for the common good, to have one who can with <hi>Romulus</hi> devour boyling turneps; My judgement is, that <hi>Claudius</hi> be made a God in as ample manner and with as good right as others were made before him; and that this miracle be added to the <hi>Metamorphoses</hi> of <hi>Ovid.</hi> The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were various, and <hi>Claudius</hi> seemed to have most votes. For <hi>Hercules,</hi> who saw his own iron in the fire, ran up and down from one to another, saying, <hi>Envy not me the honour of this work; I am concern'd in it: when you have occasion I shall requite the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie: one hand washes another.</hi> Then stood up sacred <hi>Augustus</hi> to deliver his opinion; which he did with very much Eloquence. <hi>Fathers Conscript,</hi> said he, <hi>I call you to witnesse that since I was made a God, I have not spoken a word here: I always mind my owne busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But I can no longer dissemble nor contain my sorrow which my modesty makes greater. For this cause I made peace at Land and Sea, furnish'd the City with Laws, and adorn'd it with stately Buildings. What to say, grave Fathers, I cannot tell: no words are <unclear>sufficient</unclear> to d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>clare my indignation. I must make use of the expression of</hi> Messala Corvinus <hi>an eloquent man:</hi> He hath cut in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36859:10"/>
sunder the Majesty and Jurisdiction of the Empire. <hi>This man, Fathers Conscript, that seems to us scarce able to fright away a fly, has chopt off mens heads with as much facility as a dog eats tripes. But how can I relate his many cruelties? I have not leisure to lament pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick calamities when I look upon my own domestick miseries. Those therefore I will omit, and these rehearse. Though</hi> Phormea <hi>understands little</hi> Greek, <hi>yet I doe, and remember the Proverb,</hi> Indignation hardly grows old. <hi>He whom you see lurking so many years under my name, in requital hath kill'd two</hi> Julia's <hi>my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew's Daughters, the one with the sword, the other with famine: and also my Nephew's Nephew</hi> Lucius Syllanus. <hi>Consider,</hi> Jupiter, <hi>the cause being so wicked, and which concerns you near, whether this man shall remain with us. Tell me, divine</hi> Claudius, <hi>why thou didst condemn any of these of either sex without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or taking cognizance of the cause. Has this been usually done in heaven? Certainly it was never done. We know that</hi> Jupiter, <hi>who hath reign'd here so many years, only broke the thigh of one</hi> Vulcan, <hi>and taking him by the foot threw him out of heaven, and being angry with his Wife, hung her between heaven and earth to punish her. But did he kill her? Thou slew'st</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salina, <hi>to whom I was great Vncle as well as to thee. Thou wilt say thou</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">After he had put her to death, he sent for her to Supper,</note> 
               <hi>know'st not. The curse of the Gods light on thee: so much more shameful it is that thou know'st not then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36859:11"/>
that thou didst it. This man ceased not to prosecute</hi> Caius Caesar <hi>after his death: he slew his Father in law, this his Son in law.</hi> Caius Caesar <hi>would not permit the Son of</hi> Crassus <hi>to be styled the Great: This man restor'd his name and took off his head. He slew in one house</hi> Crassus <hi>the Great,</hi> Scribonia, Tristonia, <hi>and</hi> Assario, <hi>all Nobles: But</hi> Crassus <hi>such a fool, as he might have reigned as well as he. Consider, Fathers Conscript, what a Monster sues to be made a God: will you now make him? Behold his body form'd to despight the Gods. In brief, let him pronounce but three words together, in any reasonable sort, and I will be content to become his slave. Who will adore this God? who will believe him to be so? In conclusion, while you make such Gods, you your selves are not thought to be Gods. The summe of all is, grave Fathers, if I have behaved my self honestly among you, if I have not been uncivil to any, revenge my wrongs; I for my part pronounce this as my opinion,</hi> [and then read out of a Table-book] <hi>Since divine</hi> Claudius <hi>hath slain</hi> Appius Syllanus <hi>his Father in law, his two Nephews,</hi> Pompey <hi>the Great, and</hi> Lucius Syllanus, Crassus <hi>Father in law to his Daughter, an honest man, and as like him as one egge is to another,</hi> Scribonia <hi>Mother in law to his Daughter, and</hi> Messalina <hi>his Wife, and so many beside that it is endlesse to recount them; he ought to be severely punished, and to be allowed no appeal, but to be carried hence, and within thirty dayes to leave Heaven, and within three Olympus.</hi> All

               <hi>Claudius</hi> was much delighted with his praise, and would fain have heard more: But <hi>Talthybius,</hi> Messenger of the Gods, laid hands on him, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his head that he might not be known, led him by <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and between <hi>Tiber</hi> and the close way descended towards Hell. <hi>Narcissus,</hi> his enfranchis'd Servant, went before the direct way to entertain his Patron; and when he came near, he ran to him all neat and trim as out of a Bath, and said, <hi>What? do Gods mix with Men? Hasten</hi> (said <hi>Mercury</hi>) <hi>and give advertisement of our coming. Narcissus</hi> would have complemented long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with his Lord, but <hi>Mercury</hi> admonished him with

his Rod, and again bid him make hast. No sooner had he spoken, but <hi>Narcissus</hi> hastned as if he ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> flown. The passage is steep and easie of descent, and therefore though he were gouty, he came in a moment to the Gates of <hi>Plut<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </hi>; where lay (as <hi>Horace</hi> sayes) that hundred-headed Beast, which presently rose and shook his bristled crest. <hi>Narcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> who used to play with a little white Beagle, was in a kind of fear when he saw a Dog so black and shaggy, that one would be loath to meet him in the dark, and cry'd, <hi>Claudius Caesar is come.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a multitude came singing with acclamations, <hi>We have him, let us rejoyce.</hi> In this Company were <hi>C. Silius,</hi> design'd Consul, <hi>Iunius Praetorius, Sextus Trullus, Marcus Helvius, Trogus, Cotta, Teclus, Valens Tabius,</hi> whom <hi>Narcissus</hi> had caused to be Executed. In the midst of this troop of Singers was <hi>Maestor</hi> the <hi>Pantomime,</hi> whom <hi>Claudius</hi> for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse sake had made leaner. The news was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently carry'd to <hi>Messalina,</hi> that <hi>Claudius</hi> was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. First of all came flocking his freed-men, <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Miron, Harpocras, Ampheus,</hi> and <hi>Pheronactes,</hi> whom he had sent before, that he might not want Servants in any place. After them came two Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, <hi>Iustus Catonius,</hi> and <hi>Ruffus, Pompey</hi>'s Son. Then came his friends, <hi>Saturnius Luscius, Pedo Pompeius, Lupus,</hi> and <hi>Celer Asinius,</hi> who had been Consuls. And last of all, his Brother's Daughter,

his Sister's Daughter, his Father in law, his Mother <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Come let us go, I'll shew thee the Iudgement-Seat:</hi> and then brought him to the Tribunal of <hi>Aeacus.</hi> He it was who, by virtue of the <hi>Cornelian</hi> Law enacted against mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, inform'd against them, and made their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; and now desir'd to have his name Register'd as the accuser of <hi>Claudius</hi>; that he had murdered thirty Senators, three hundred and fifteen <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, and of other People,
<q>
                  <l>The number infinite, like Sand or Dust.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claudius</hi> being much dismay'd, cast his eyes about to find an Advocate to speak for him, but found at present none. At length <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Petronius,</hi> who was wont to eat at his Table, a man well vers'd in the <hi>Claudian</hi> language, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and desir'd to be admitted his defender, but was refus'd. <hi>Pedo Pompeius</hi> accus'd him with great vehemency; <hi>Petronius</hi> seemed willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for him. <hi>Aeacus,</hi> a most just man, having heard but one side, condemned him, and said, <hi>If he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what he hath done to others, the judgement is just.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:36859:13"/>
A great silence was made. All were astonish'd and wondred at the newnesse of the thing, saying, the like was never done. <hi>Claudius</hi> thought it more just then new. It was long debated what kind of Punishment should be inflicted. Some mov'd, that if the Gods would be pleased to release the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one, either <hi>Tantalus</hi> might be freed of his Thirst, whereof he would else die, or <hi>Sisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> of the burthen of his Stone, or <hi>Ixion</hi> have his Wheel stopt. But it was resolv'd that none of the Condemned persons should be discharg'd, lest <hi>Claudius</hi> himself might afterwards expect like favour. They agreed that a new punishment should be devis'd, That some fruitlesse labour should be impos'd upon him, and a kind of Desire, without End or Effect. Then <hi>Aeacus</hi> pronounced that he should play at Dice with a bottomlesse Box: And now he began to cast Dice to no purpose, for they still dropt out at the wrong end.</p>
            <q>
               <l>As oft as he prepared was to cast,</l>
               <l>Shaking the Box, the Dice fell out as fast.</l>
               <l>And putting them into the Box again,</l>
               <l>Like one that play'd, he found he play'd in vain:</l>
               <l>For still the Dice slipt thorough and were gone.</l>
               <l>So <hi>Sisyphus</hi> with many a heavy grone</l>
               <l>To the Hill-top bears his returning Stone.</l>
