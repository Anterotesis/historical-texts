            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>LUKE X. 42.</bibl>
               <q>But one thing is needfull.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the accounts of Wise men, one of the
first Rules and Measures of human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is this, <hi>To regard every thing more or
less, according to the degree of its consequence
and importance to our happiness.</hi> That which
is most necessary to that End ought in all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95503:4"/>
reason to be minded by us in the first place,
and other things onely so far as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with that great End, and subservient
to it.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> here tells us that <hi>there is
one thing needfull,</hi> that is, one thing which
ought first and principally to be regarded by
us: And what <hi>that</hi> is, it is of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to us all to know, that we may mind
and pursue it as it deserves.</p>
            <p>And we may easily understand what it is
by considering the Context, and the occasion
of these Words, which was briefly this: Our
<hi>Saviour,</hi> as He went about preaching the
Kingdom of God, came into a certain Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
where He was entertain'd at the house
of two devout Sisters. The <hi>elder,</hi> who had
the care and management of the Family and
the affairs of it, was imployed in making en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
for such a <hi>Guest:</hi> The <hi>other</hi> sate
at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s feet, attending to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Salvation which he preach'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>elder</hi> finding her self not able to do all
the business alone, desires of our <hi>Saviour</hi> that
he would command her Sister <hi>to come and
help her.</hi> Upon this our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives her this
gentle reprehension, <hi>Martha, Martha, Thou
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95503:4"/>
art carefull and troubled about many things, but
one thing is needfull.</hi> And what <hi>that</hi> is he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
in the next words, <hi>And</hi> Mary <hi>hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
that good part, which shall not be taken away
from her;</hi> that is, she hath chosen to take care
of her Salvation, which is infinitely more
considerable than any thing else.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth not altogether blame
<hi>Martha</hi> for her respectfull care of Him, but
commends her <hi>Sister</hi> for her greater care of
her Soul; which made her either wholly to
forget, or unwilling to mind other things at
that time. So that, upon the whole matter,
He highly approves her wise choice, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
an attentive regard to His <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
even before that which might be thought a
necessary civility to His <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Words</hi> thus explain'd the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which I shall make is this.</p>
            <p>That the care of Religion and of our Souls
is <hi>the one thing necessary,</hi> and that which every
man is concern'd in the first place and above
all other things to mind and regard.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Observation</hi> seems to be plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the <hi>Text.</hi> I shall handle it as briefly
as I can; and then by way of Application shall
endeavour to persuade You and my self to mind
this <hi>one thing necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95503:5"/>
And in speaking to this serious and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Argument I shall do these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I shall endeavour to shew wherein
this care of Religion and of our Souls does
consist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> to convince men of the necessity
of taking this care.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. I shall shew wherein this care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and of our Souls doth consist. And this
I shall endeavour to do with all the plainness
I can, and so as every one that hears me may
understand and be sufficiently directed what is
necessary for him to do in order to his eternal
Salvation.</p>
            <p>And of this I shall give an account in the
<hi>five</hi> following <hi>Particulars,</hi> in which I think
the main business of Religion and the due care
of our Souls does consist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> in the distinct knowledge, and in
the firm belief and persuasion of those things
which are necessary to be known and believed
by us in order to our eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the frequent Examination of
our lives and actions, and in a sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for all the errours and miscarriages of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95503:5"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in the constant and daily exercise
of Piety and Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in avoiding those things which
are pernicious to our Salvation, and whereby
men do often hazard their Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> in the even and constant practice
of the several Graces and Vertues of a good
Life.</p>
            <p>I. The due care of Religion and our Souls
does consist in the distinct knowledge, and in
the firm belief and persuasion of those things
which are necessary to be known and believ'd
by us in order to our eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>For this knowledge of the necessary Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Duties of Religion is the foundation
of all good Practice, wherein the life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
doth consist. And without this no man
can be truly Religious.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Without faith,</hi> saith the
Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is <hi>impossible to please
God: For he that cometh to God, must believe
that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them
that diligently seek Him.</hi> Now these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of <hi>pleasing God</hi> and <hi>seeking Him,</hi> are
plainly of the same importance, and do both
of them signifie <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Worship</hi> and
Service of God; which doth antecedently
suppose our firm belief and persuasion of these
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95503:6"/>
               <hi>two</hi> fundamental <hi>Principles</hi> of all Religion,
That <hi>there is a God,</hi> and, That <hi>He will reward
those that serve Him:</hi> Because unless a man
do first believe these, there would neither be
ground nor encouragement for any such
thing as Religion.</p>
            <p>And this knowledge of the necessary <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of Religion our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> calls <hi>eternal
Life,</hi> because it is so fundamentally necessary
in order to our attaining of it:<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 3.</note> 
               <hi>This is life
eternal,</hi> says <hi>He, to know thee, the onely true
God; and Him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ,</hi>
that is, to be rightly instructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>the onely true God,</hi> and <hi>of his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ our Lord:</hi> Under which <hi>two</hi> general
<hi>Heads</hi> are comprehended all the necessary
Principles both of the <hi>Natural</hi> and of the
<hi>Christian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>And to the attaining of this knowledge
which is absolutely necessary to Salvation, no
such extraordinary pains and study is requir'd;
but onely a teachable disposition, and a due
application of mind. For whatever in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is necessary to be known by all, must in
all reason be plain and easie, and lye level to
all capacities; otherwise we must say, that
God <hi>who would have all men to be saved</hi> hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95503:6"/>
not provided for the Salvation of all men.
And therefore, now that the knowledge of
the true God and the light of Christianity are
shed abroad in the world, all that enjoy the
Gospel are, or may be, sufficiently instructed
in all things necessary to their happiness:
unless such care be used, as is in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>take away the key of knowledge,</hi> and
to lock up the Scriptures from the People in
an unknown Tongue; and this, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
upon a very charitable consideration,
onely it is to be hop'd that it is not true, that
the generality of Mankind are mad and have
need to be kept in the dark. But supposing
men to be allowed those means of knowledge
which God affords, and hath appointed for
us, the great difficulty doth not commonly
lye in mens Understandings, but in their Wills:
Onely when men know these things, they
must attend to them and consider them;
that the light which is in their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
may warm their Hearts, and have its due
influence upon their Lives.</p>
            <p>II. The due care of our Souls consists in
the frequent Examination of our lives and
actions, and in a sincere Repentance for all
the errours and miscarriages of them: In a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95503:7"/>
more <hi>particular</hi> and deep humiliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for deliberate and wilfull sins, so far
as we can call them to our remembrance;
and in a <hi>general</hi> repentance for sins of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
and <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and <hi>Surprize.</hi> In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
whereof we are always to remember,
that the nature of true Repentance doth not
consist onely in an humble confession of our
sins to God, and a hearty trouble and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for them; but chiefly in the stedfast pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and resolution of a better life, and in
prosecution of this resolution, in actual refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and amendment.</p>
            <p>By the constant exercise hereof, we are put
into a safe condition; provided that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe
in this holy resolution and course:
But if we still retain the love and practice of
any known sin, or if after we have taken up
these good resolutions we return again to an
evil course; this is a clear evidence, either
that our Repentance was not sincere at first,
or that we are relaps'd into our former state:
And then our Souls are still in apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being lost, and will continue in that
dangerous state, till we have renew'd our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and made it good in the following
course of our lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95503:7"/>
III. The due care of our Souls consists in
the constant and daily exercise of piety and
devotion, both in private, and in publick if
there be opportunity for it, especially at pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
times and upon more solemn occasions:
By servent prayer to God, and by hearing and
reading the Word of God with reverence and
godly fear: By frequenting his publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and demeaning our selves in it with that
solemnity and seriousness which becomes the
prefence and service of the great and glorious
Majesty of God, who observes our behaviour
and sees into our hearts: And by receiving
the B. Sacrament, as often as we have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
with due preparation and devotion of
mind.</p>
            <p>For these are not onely outward testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of our inward piety, but they are means
likewise appointed by God to improve and
confirm us in holiness and goodness. And
whoever neglects these Duties of Religion, or
performs them in a slight and superficial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
doth plainly shew that he hath neither a
due sense of God, nor care of himself: For in
vain does any man pretend that he does in
good earnest design the End, when he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
the best and most proper means for the
attainment of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95503:8"/>
IV. The due care of our Souls consists also
in avoiding those things which are pernicious
to our Salvation, and whereby men do often
hazard their Souls. Such in general is the
practice of any known Sin. By this we do,
as it were, run upon the swords point, and
do endanger our Salvation as much as a deep
wound in our Body would do our Life: And
though such a wound may perhaps be cur'd
afterwards by Repentance, yet no man that
commits any wilfull Sin knows the dismal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of it, and whither by degrees it may
carry him at last: For upon such a provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
God may leave the Sinner to himself,
and withdraw his grace from him, and give
him up to a hard and impenitent heart to
proceed from evil to worse, and from one
wickedness to another, till he be finally ruin'd.
So dangerous a thing is it knowingly to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God, and to commit any deliberate act
of Sin.</p>
            <p>More particularly, an inordinate love of
the World is very pernicious to the Souls of
men; because it quencheth the heavenly life,
and fills our minds with earthly cares and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
it tempts men to forsake God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
when their worldly interests come in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95503:8"/>
competition with them; and betrays them to
fraud, and falsehood, and all kind of injustice,
and <hi>many other hurtfull lusts which drown the
Soul in perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides these dangers which are more
visible and apparent, there is another which
is less discernable because it hath the face of
Piety; and that is <hi>Faction</hi> in Religion: By
which I mean an unpeaceable and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
zeal about things wherein Religion either
doth not at all, or but very little consist.
For besides that this temper is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with several of the most eminent <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Graces and Vertues, as <hi>humility, love,
peace, meekness,</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> towards those
that differ from us; it hath likewise <hi>two</hi> very
great mischiefs commonly attending upon it,
and both of them pernicious to Religion and
the Souls of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that it takes such men off from mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the more necessary and essential parts of
Religion. They are so zealous about small
things, <hi>the tithing of mint and anise and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
that they <hi>neglect the weightier things of the
Law, Faith</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>the
Love</hi> of God: They spend so much of their
time and heat about things doubtfull, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95503:9"/>
they have no leisure to mind the things that
are necessary: And are so concern'd about
little <hi>Speculative Opinions</hi> in Religion, which
they always call <hi>fundamental Articles</hi> of Faith,
that the Practice of Religion is almost whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected by them: And they are so taken
up in spying out and censuring Errour and
Heresy in others, that they never think of
curing those Lusts and Vices and Passions
which do so visibly reign in themselves. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
people! that do not consider that the
greatest Heresy in the World is a wicked life,
because it is so directly and fundamentally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the whole design of the Christian
Faith and Religion: And that do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that God will sooner forgive a man a
hundred defects of his Understanding than
one fault of his Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> another great mischief which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
this temper is, that men are very apt to
interpret this zeal of theirs against others to
be great Piety in themselves, and as much as
is necessary to bring them to Heaven; and
to think that they are very Religious, because
they keep a great stir about maintaining the
Out-works of Religion, when it is ready to
be starv'd within; and that there needs no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95503:9"/>
more to denominate them good Christians,
but to be of such a Party and to be listed of
such a Church, which they always take for
granted to be the onely true one; and then
zealously to hate and uncharitably to censure
all the rest of Mankind.</p>
            <p>How many are there in the World, that
think they have made very sure of Heaven,
not by the old plain way of leaving their sins
and reforming their lives, but by a more close
and cunning way of carrying their Vices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them into another Church, and
calling themselves <hi>good Catboliques,</hi> and all
others <hi>Heretiques?</hi> And that having done
this, they are in a safe condition; as if a mere
Name would admit a man into Heaven, or
as if there were any Church in the World,
that had this phantastical Privilege belonging
to it, that a wicked man might be saved for
no other reason but because he is of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as thou valuest thy Soul, take
heed of engaging in any Faction in Religion;
because it is an hundred to one but thy zeal
will be so employed about lesser things, that
the main and substantial parts of Religion
will be neglected: Besides, that a man deeply
engag'd in heats and controversies of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95503:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall very hardly escape being possess'd
with that Spirit of uncharitableness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
of peevishness and fierceness, which
reigns in all Factions, but more especially in
those of Rellgion.</p>
            <p>V. The due care of our Souls consists in
the even and constant practice of the several
Graces and Vertues of a good life; or, as the
<hi>Apostle</hi> expresseth it, in <hi>exercising our selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to have a conscience void of offence towards
God and men.</hi> For herein is Religion best
seen, in the equal and uniform practice of
every part of our Duty: Not onely in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God devoutly, but in demeaning our
selves peaceably and justly, kindly and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
towards all men: Not onely in restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves from the outward act of sin,
but in mortifying the inward inclination to
it, in subduing our Lusts, and governing our
Passions, and bridling our Tongues. As he
that would have a prudent care of his health
and life, must not onely guard himself against
the chief and common diseases which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to men, and take care to prevent them;
but must likewise be carefull to preserve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from those which are esteemed less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
but yet sometimes do prove mortal:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95503:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He must not onely endeavour to secure his
Head and Heart from being wounded, but
must have a tender care of every part; there
being hardly any disease or wound so slight
but that some have dyed of it: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the care of our Souls consists in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
regard to our Duty, and that we be
defective in no part of it: Though we ought
to have a more especial regard to those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are more considerable and wherein
Religion doth mainly consist; as <hi>Piety</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi> in regard
of our selves, <hi>Charity</hi> towards the poor, <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Justice, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Kindness</hi> towards
all men: But then no other <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi>
though of an inferiour rank, ought to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by us.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavour'd, as plainly
and briefly as I could, to declare to you in
what Instances the due care of Religion and
our Souls doth chiefly consist.</p>
            <p>And I would not have any man think that
all this is an easy business and requires but
little time to do it in, and that a small degree
of diligence and industry will serve for this
purpose: To master and root out the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Habits of Sin, to bring our Passions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95503:11"/>
the command and government of our
Reason, and to attain to a good degree of
every Christian Grace and Vertue: That
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity; Humility</hi> and
<hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> may all <hi>have their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
work;</hi> and that, as <hi>St. James</hi> says, we <hi>may
be perfect and entire, wanting nothing;</hi> nothing
that belongs to the perfection of a good man,
and of a good Christian. And this, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we come to make the trial, we shall find
to be a great and a long work.</p>
            <p>Some indeed would make Religion to be
a very short and easy business, and to consist
onely in believing what Christ hath done for
us, and relying confidently upon it: Which
is so far from being the true Notion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>Faith,</hi> that, if I be not much mistaken,
it is the very Definition of <hi>Presumption.</hi> For
the <hi>Bible</hi> plainly teacheth us, that unless our
Faith <hi>work by Charity,</hi> and <hi>purify our hearts</hi> and
reform our lives; unless like <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith
it be <hi>perfected by works,</hi> it is but a <hi>dead Faith,</hi>
and will in no wise avail to our Justification
and Salvation. And our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> the great
<hi>Authour and finisher of our Faith,</hi> hath no
where, that I know of, said one word to this
purpose, That Faith separated from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95503:11"/>
and a good life will save any man: But
He hath said very much to the contrary, and
that very plainly. For He promiseth Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to none, but those who live in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of those Christian Graces and Vertues
which are particularly mention'd by Him in
the beginning of his excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> upon
the Mount;<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and
<hi>Meekness,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Mercifulness,</hi>
and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Peaceableness,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi>
under persecution and sufferings for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness

<hi>Sermon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Not every one,</hi> saith He, <hi>that saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 24.</note> And again, <hi>Whosoever
heareth these sayings of mine, and doth them, I
will liken him unto a wise man which built his
house upon a Rock.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 26, 27.</note> And afterwards, He tells
us, that whosoever builds his hopes of eternal
happiness upon any other foundation, than
the Faith of the Gospel and the Practice of
its Precepts, doth <hi>build his house upon the Sand;</hi>
which when it comes to be tryed by the <hi>Rain</hi>
and the <hi>Winds,</hi> will <hi>fall; and the fall of it will
be great.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 17.</note> And elsewhere; <hi>If ye know these
things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> And He
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95503:12"/>
does very severely check the vain confidence
and presumption of those, who will needs
rely upon Him for Salvation without keeping
his commandments;<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Why call ye me,</hi> says He,
<hi>Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Does any man think that he can be saved
without loving God and Christ?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 3.</note> And this,
<hi>saith</hi> St. John, is the love of God, that we keep
his commandments:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and again,</hi> He that saith I
know him, <hi>and by the same reason,</hi> he that
saith I love him, and keepeth not his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.
If ye love me,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>saith our</hi> B. Lord, keep my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
<hi>And again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 21.</note> He that hath my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
and keepeth them, he it is that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Does any man think, that any but the
children of God shall be heirs of eternal Life?
Hear then what</hi> St. John <hi>saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 7.</note> Little children,
let no man deceive you, he that doth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is righteous, even as He is righteous: <hi>And
again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 10.</note> In this the children of God are manifest,
and the children of the Devil, he that doth not
righteousness is not of God.</p>
            <p>In a word, this is the perpetual tenour of
the <hi>Bible,</hi> from the beginning of it to the end.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95503:12"/>
               <hi>If thou dost well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 7.</note> saith God to <hi>Cain, shalt thou
not be accepted?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 3. 10, 11.</note> And again, <hi>Say ye to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
it shall be well with him, for they shall eat
the fruit of their doings: Wo unto the wicked, it
shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands
shall be given him.</hi> And in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> when
the <hi>young man</hi> came to our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by Him <hi>what good thing he should do
that he might</hi> inherit eternal life, our <hi>Lord</hi>
gives him this short and plain advice,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>If thou
wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</hi> And
in the very last <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> we find
this solemn declaration, <hi>Blessed are they that
do his commandments, that they may have right
to the Tree of Life, and enter in through the Gates
into the City,</hi> that is, into Heaven, which the
<hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls the <hi>City which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</hi>
So vain and groundless is the imagination of
those, who trust to be saved by an idle and
ineffectual Faith, without holiness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. I proceed now in the <hi>Second</hi> place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us all, if it may be, of the necessity of
minding Religion and our Souls. When we
call any thing necessary, we mean that it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95503:13"/>
so in order to some End, which cannot be
attained without it. We call those things the
necessaries of Life, without which men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
subsist and live in a tolerable condition in
this World: And that is necessary to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
happiness, without which it cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.
Now happiness being our chief End,
whatever is necessary to <hi>that</hi> is more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than any thing else; and in comparison
of <hi>that,</hi> all other things not onely may, but
ought to be neglected by us.</p>
            <p>Now to convince men of the necessity
of Religion, I shall briefly shew, That it is
a certain way to happiness: That it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that there is no other way but this:
And that if we neglect Religion, we shall
certainly be extremely and for ever mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That Religion is a certain way to
happiness. And for this we have God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Declaration and Promise, the best assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that can be. He <hi>that cannot lye</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<hi>eternal life, to them who by patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in well-doing</hi> seek for glory and honour
and immortality. All the happiness that
we can desire, and of which the nature of
man is capable, is promised to us upon the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95503:13"/>
terms of Religion, upon our <hi>denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and worldly lusts, and living soberly, and
righteously, and godlily in this present world:</hi>
A mighty reward for a little service; an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of happiness, of joys unspeakable and
full of glory, for the diligence and industry
of a few days: A happiness large as our
wishes, and lasting as our Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis certain also that there is no
other way to happiness but this. He, who
alone can make us happy, hath promised it
to us upon these and no other terms. He
hath said, That <hi>if we live after the flesh, we
shall die; but if by the spirit we mortifie the
deeds of the flesh, we shall live:</hi> That <hi>without
holiness no man shall see the Lord:</hi> And, that
he that lives in the habitual Practice of any
Vice, of <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Malice,</hi>
or <hi>Revenge, shall not enter into the kingdom of
God:</hi> And we have reason to believe Him
concerning the terms of this happiness, and
the means of attaining it, by whose favour
and bounty alone we hope to be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of it.</p>
            <p>And if God had not said it in his Word,
yet the nature and reason of the thing doth
plainly declare it. For Religion is not only
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95503:14"/>
a condition of our happiness, but a necessary
qualification and disposition for it. We must
be like to God in the temper of our minds,
before we can find any felicity in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him. Men must be purged from
their Lusts, and from those ill-natur'd and
devilish Passions of <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and
<hi>Revenge,</hi> before they can be fit company for
their heavenly Father, and meet to dwell
with <hi>him who is love, and dwells in love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we neglect Religion, we shall
certainly be extreamly and for ever miserable.
The <hi>Word of Truth</hi> hath said it, that <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and wrath, tribulation and anguish shall be
upon every soul of man that doth evil.</hi> Nay,
if God should hold his hand, and should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
no positive torment upon sinners, yet
they could not spare themselves, but would
be their own Executioners and Tormentors.
The guilt of that wicked Life which they had
led in this World, and the Stings of their
own Consciences must necessarily make them
miserable, when-ever their own Thoughts
are let loose upon them; as they will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be in the other World, when they shall
have nothing either of pleasure or business to
divert them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95503:14"/>
So that if we be concern'd, either to be
happy hereafter, or to avoid those Miseries
which are great and dreadful beyond all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
it will be necessary for us to mind
Religion; without which we can neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Happiness, nor escape those Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>All that now remains, is to perswade you
and my self seriously to mind this <hi>one thing</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
And to this end, I shall apply my
Discourse to two sorts of Persons; those who
are remiss in a matter of so great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and those who are grosly careless, and
mind it not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To those who are remiss in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of such vast concernment: Who mind the
business of Religion in some degree, but not
so heartily and vigorously as a matter of such
infinite consequence doth require and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
            <p>And here I fear the very best are greatly
defective; and so much the more to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
by how much they are more convinc'd
than others, of the necessity of a Religious
and Holy Life, and that without this no man
shall ever be admitted into the Mansions of
the Blessed: They believe likewise, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95503:15"/>
to the degrees of every mans holiness
and vertue in this Life, will be the degrees of
his happiness in the other; that <hi>he that sows
sparingly shall reap sparingly, and he that sows
plentifully shall reap plentifully;</hi> and that the
measure of every man's reward shall be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his improvement of the Talents that
were committed to him.</p>
            <p>But how little do men live under the power
of these convictions? And notwithstanding
we are allur'd by the most glorious promises
and hopes, and aw'd by the greatest fears,
and urg'd by the most forcible argument in
the world, the evident necessity of the thing;
Yet how faintly do we run the Race that is
set before us? How frequently and how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
are we stop'd or diverted in our Christian
course by very little temptations? How cold,
and how careless, and how inconstant are we
in the Exercises of Piety, and how defective
in every part of our Duty? Did we act rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
and as Men use to do in matters of
much less moment, we could not be so indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
about a thing so necessary, so slight and
careless in a matter of Life and Death, and
upon which all Eternity does depend.</p>
            <p>Let us then shake off this sloth and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95503:15"/>
and resolve to make that the great business
of Time, which is our great concernment to
all Eternity: And when we are immers'd
in the cares and business of this Life, and <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
about many things,</hi> let this thought often
come into our minds, That there is <hi>one thing
needful,</hi> and which therefore deserves above
all other things to be regarded by us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are another sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who are groslly careless of this <hi>one thing
necessary,</hi> and do not seem to mind it at all:
Who go on securely in an evil course, as if
either they had no Souls, or no concernment
for them. I may say to these as the Master
of the Ship did to <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he was fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
in the Storm, <hi>What meanest thou, O slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
Arise and call upon thy God.</hi> When
our Souls are every moment in danger of sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is high time for us to awake out of
sleep, to ply every Oar, and to use all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
care and industry to save a thing so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
from a danger so threatning and so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
            <p>We are apt enough to be sensible of the
force of this Argument of necessity in other
cases, and very carefully to provide against
the pressing necessities of this life, and how
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95503:16"/>
to avoid those great temporal evils of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and disgrace, of pain and suffering: But
the great necessity of all, and that which is
mainly incumbent upon us, is to provide for
Eternity, to secure the everlasting happiness,
and to prevent the endless and insupportable
miseries of another World. <hi>This, this,</hi> is
the <hi>one thing necessary;</hi> and to <hi>this</hi> we ought
to bend and apply all our care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>If we would fairly compare the necessity
of things, and wisely weigh the concernments
of this Life and the other in a just and equal
ballance, we should be ashamed to misplace
our diligence and industry as we do; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
our best thoughts and time about these
vain and perishing things, and to take no
care about that <hi>better part which cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from us.</hi> Fond and vain men that we are!
who are so solicitous how we shall pass a few
days in this world, but matter not what shall
become of us for ever.</p>
            <p>But as careless as we are now about these
things, time will come when we shall sadly
lay them to heart, and when they will touch
us to the quick: When we come to lie upon
a Death-bed, if God shall be pleas'd to grant
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95503:16"/>
us then so much time and use of our Reason
as to be able to recollect our selves, we shall
then be convinc'd how great a necessity there
was of minding our Souls, and of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
folly of neglecting them, and of our
not being sensible of the value of them, till
we are ready to dispair of saving them.</p>
            <p>But, blessed be God, this is not yet our case,
though we know not how soon it may be.
Let us then be wise, and consider these things
in time, least Death and Despair should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and oppress us at once.</p>
            <p>You that are young, be pleas'd to consider
that this is the best opportunity of your Lives,
for the minding and doing of this work. You
are now most capable of the best impressions,
before the habits of Vice have taken deep
root, and your hearts <hi>be harden'd through the
deceitfulness of sin:</hi> This <hi>is the acceptable time,
this is the day of salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is likewise a very weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
to be urg'd upon those that are old,
if there be any that are willing to own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so; that this is the last opportunity of
their lives, and therefore they should lay hold
of it, and improve it with all their might:
For it will soon be past, and when it is, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
call it back.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95503:17"/>
It is but a very little while before we shall
all certainly be of this mind, that the best
thing we could have done in this World, was
to prepare for the other. Could I represent
to you that invisible World which I am speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, you would all readily assent to this
counsel, and would be glad to follow it and
put it speedily in practice. Do but then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
your eyes, and look a little before you
to the things which are not far off from any
of us, and to many of us may perhaps be
much nearer than we are aware: Let us but
judge of things now, as we shall all shortly
judge of them: And let us live now, as after
a few days we shall every one of us wish with
all our Souls that we had liv'd; and be as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as if we were ready to step into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, and to enter upon that change
which Death will quickly make in every one
of us. Strange stupidity of Men! That a
change so near, so great, so certain, should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
us so coldly, and be so little consider'd and
provided for by us: That the things of Time
should move us so much, and the things of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
so little. What will we do when this
change comes; if we have made no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95503:17"/>
If we be Christians, and do verily believe
the things which I am speaking of, and that
after a few days more are pass'd Death will
come, and draw aside that thick Veil of sense
and security which now hides these things
from us; and shew us that fearful and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
sight which we are now so loth to think
upon: I say, if we believe this, it is time for
us to be wise and serious.</p>
            <p>And happy that man, who in the days of
his health hath retir'd himself from the noise
and tumult of this world, and made that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
preparation for Death and a better Life,
as may give him that constancy and firmness
of Spirit, as to be able to bear the thoughts
and approaches of his great Change without
amazement; and to have a mind almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
poiz'd between that strong inclination
of Nature which makes us desirous to live,
and that wiser dictate of Reason and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which should make us willing and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to die whenever God thinks fit.</p>
            <p>Many of us do not now so clearly discern
these things, because our eyes are dazzel'd
with the false light and splendour of earthly
felicity: But <hi>this</hi> assuredly is more worth than
all <hi>the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95503:18"/>
them,</hi> to be able to possess our Souls at such a
time, and to be at perfect Peace with our
own minds, having <hi>our hearts fixed trusting in
God:</hi> To have our Accounts made up, and
Estate of our immortal Souls as well setled
and secur'd, as by the assistance of God's
Grace humane care and endeavour, though
mix'd with much humane frailty, is able to
do.</p>
            <p>And if we be convinc'd of these things, we
are utterly inexcusable if we do not make
this our first and great care, and prefer it to
all other interests whatsoever. And to this
end, we should resolutely disentangle our
selves from worldly cares and incumbrances;
at least so far, that we may have competent
liberty and leisure to attend this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
and to put our Souls into a fit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and preparation for another World:
That when Sickness and Death shall come,
we may not act our last part indecently and
confusedly, and have a great deal of work to
do when we shall want both time and all other
advantages to do it in: Whereby our Souls,
when they will stand most in need of comfort
and support, will unavoidably be left in a
trembling and disconsolate condition, and in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95503:18"/>
an anxious doubtfulness of mind what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them for ever.</p>
            <p>To conclude, This care of Religion and
our Souls is a thing so necessary, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of it we are to neglect the very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of Life. So our <hi>Lord</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Take
no thought saying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 6. 31, 33.</note> 
               <hi>what shall we eat? or what
shall we drink? or wherewithal shall we be
cloathed? But seek ye first the Kingdom of
God and his righteousness.</hi> The Calls of God
and Religion are so very pressing and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
that they admit of no delay or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
whatsoever: This our <hi>Saviour</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
to us by denying the <hi>Disciple,</hi> whom
he had call'd to follow <hi>him,</hi> leave to go
and bury his Father, <hi>Let the dead,</hi> says
he, <hi>bury their dead, but do thou follow
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is <hi>one thing needful,</hi> and that is
the business of Religion and the care of
our immortal Souls, which whatever else
we neglect should be carefully minded and
regarded by every one of us. <hi>O that there
were such a heart in us. O that we were wise,
that we understood this, that we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our latter end:</hi> Which God grant we
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95503:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may all do, <hi>in this our day;</hi> for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
sake in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to whom with the
<hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> be all Honour
and Glory, now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
