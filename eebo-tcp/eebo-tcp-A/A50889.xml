            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Alterations that happen ſometimes in a
<hi>State</hi> betwixt the <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>People</hi> that is Free
and Priviledged; there are ordinarily two
Points which make them to aim at two ſeveral
ends: The <hi>One</hi> is, when as the Prince ſeeks to
have a full ſubjection and Obedience of the People: And
the <hi>Other,</hi> that the People contrariwiſe require that the
Prince ſhould maintain them in their freedoms and liberties
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101204:3"/>
which he hath promiſed and Sworn ſolemnely unto them
before his Reception unto the Government; thereupon
Quarrels grow, the Prince will hold a hard hand, and will
by force endeavour to be Obeyed according to Will and
Pleaſure; and the People riſing againſt the Prince often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
(upon ſucceſs) do reject his Authority, and ſeek
to embrace and maintain their full liberties.</p>
            <p>In theſe firſt Motions there happens ſometimes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
at the inſtance of Neighbours or others in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who may have intereſt therein to quench this fire of
Diviſion betwixt the Prince and his Subjects; and then if
any one of the parties groweth obſtinate and will not yield,
although he ſeem to be moſt in fault, it followeth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
that they muſt come to more violent Remedies, that
is to ſay, to Arms: The power of the Prince is great when
he is ſupported by other Princes which joyn with him for
the conſequence of the Example, elſe its but ſmall:. But
that of the People, which is the Body, whereof the Prince
is the Head, ſtirred up by Conſcience, eſpecially if the
Queſtion of Religion be touched; the Members ordained
for their Function doing joyntly their Duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
thereupon they Wound, they Kill, they Burn, they
Ruine, and grow deſparate of each ſide; but what is the
Event, God who is an Enemy to all Tyranny and Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
judged of their Quarrels, weigheth them in his
Ballance of Juſtice, helping the rightful Cauſe, and either
cauſeth the Prince for his Rigour, Oppreſſion, and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to be puniſhed and chaſed away, and deprived of his
Eſtate and Principality; or the People for their Attempt to
be puniſhed and brought to Reaſon, which cauſeth the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
to ceaſe, and procureth a Peace; whereof there
are many Examples, both Ancient and Modern, beſides
this enſuing Narrative of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tarquinus Superbus</hi> being the <hi>7th</hi> and laſt King of <hi>Rome,</hi>
after he had Reigned twenty five years was baniſhed from
thence, together with the whole Kingly Government,
which had then laſted 244 years before the People could
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101204:3"/>
ſhake off that Oppreſſive yoak of their Kings, which they
effected in the manner, and for the Cauſes following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sextus Tarquinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the firſt Book of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> page 41, 42.</note> Son to King <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Tyrant, being
full of Luſt and Cruelty, came to <hi>Lucretia's</hi> Houſe at <hi>Cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
a place not far diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had been
before kindly entertained by her Husband <hi>Colatinus,</hi> who
at that time was abſent; and being after Supper brought
into the Gueſt-Chamber, and when he thought all ſure,
and that every body was faſt aſleep, he ſteppeth with naked
Sword in hand to <hi>Lucretia</hi> as ſhe lay in a profound ſleep;
who ſtarting out of her ſleep, heard <hi>Tarquinus</hi> ſpeak in this
manner; <hi>I am</hi> Sextus Tarquinus, <hi>I have my drawn Sword
in hand, if thou once ſpeak thou ſhalt ſurely die; and if thou
wilt not yield to me, I will kill thee; and for thy perpetual ſhame
and diſhonour, will cut the throat of thy Servant, and lay him
naked by thee, that ſo it may be rumoured abroad that thou haſt
been kill'd in Adultery:</hi> Whereupon by violence and force
he had her Company; The next morning <hi>Lucretia</hi> did ſend
for her Father and Husband, who brought along with
them <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> to whom (when they came)
ſhe told that <hi>Sextus Tarquinus</hi> was the man, who that night
paſt entertained as a Friend, but indeed a very Foe in the
higheſt degree, had by force and violence taken from hence
his pleaſure; a deadly pleaſure I may ſay to me, and to
himſelf no leſs, if you be men of Courage.</p>
            <p>All of them gave their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſured word and comforted
her, whereupon ſhe ſaid, <hi>Well, what is his due to have, ſee you to
that; as for me, I quit and aſſoil my ſelf from ſin, yet I will not
be freed from puniſhment,</hi> and after other words uttered, with
a knife hid under her cloaths, ſtab'd her ſelf; out cryed her
Husband and Father thereat, and while they two were in
their plaints and moans, <hi>Brutus</hi> drew forth the knife out of
the wound of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> holding it out all embrewed and
dropping with bloud; ſaid, <hi>Now I ſwear by this blood, by this
moſt chaſte and pure blood, before the villanny wrought by the Kings
Son, and here before the Gods I proteſt whom I call to witneſſe, that

the Government of Kings, and utterly to root
out the Race; The dead Corps of <hi>Lucretia</hi> was brought in
the Market-place, and there ſhewed to the people, who
with wondering at ſuch a ſight, and ſo foul and unworthy
a fact, they raiſed much People together, every man for
his part was ready to complain of the wickedneſſe and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
done by the Kings Blood; <hi>Brutus</hi> who rebuked all
vain weeping and fooliſh moaning, moved and perſwaded
all that were preſent, <hi>that like men of valour, like true-hearted</hi>
Romans, <hi>they would take Arms againſt thoſe that demeaned

            </p>
            <p>Thereupon all the People Armed themſelves, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

to the people then aſſembled the villany committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Lucretia;</hi> And moreover he laid abroad the pride of the
King himſelf, the miſeries, the infinite toil and pain of
the Commons buried as it were under ground, with clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and caſting of Ditches, voiding and farming of the
Sinks; ſaying that the men of <hi>Rome</hi> who were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
of all Nations about them, <hi>were now of Warriors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Quarriors, hewers of Stone, and day-labourers;</hi> thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſing
theſe and other matters, much more grievous and
horrible, he ſo mightily inflamed the multitude, that he
cauſed the King to be depoſed and degraded of his Royal
State and dignity, yea and to decree and enact, that King
<hi>Tarquinus</hi> and his Wife and Children ſhould be baniſhed for
ever, which accordingly was effected; and after all the
Armies and people had forſaken him, <hi>Brutus</hi> being then
appointed Conſul, and for fear leaſt the Magiſtrates and
people might at any time after be won by entreaty, or
moved by gifts on the Kings part, he cauſed them to ſwear,
<hi>that they would never ſuffer any to be King at Rome,</hi> after which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101204:4"/>
the Senate was fil'd with ſuch as took the ſame Oath,<note place="margin">

to the full number of three hundred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo jealous were the
people afterwards of their Liberties, that one of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
name being <hi>Tarquinus,</hi> without they could have any
other thing to ſay againſt him but his Name, who they ſaid
<hi>was dangerous to a Free-State,</hi> thereupon was perſwaded to

the Senate, propoſed to the people, <hi>That all the Race and

was accordingly effected.</p>
            <p>No man doubted then, but that the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were about

and at preſent is endeavoured in <hi>England;</hi> The ſtory is
briefly thus;</p>
            <p>There were certain Youths of the flower of <hi>Rome,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
of no low Degree nor Parentage, who in the Kings
dayes had lived like young Princes, more looſely and at
pleaſure as Companions and play-fellows with the young
<hi>Tarquins</hi> the Kings ſons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> The ſame Book, page 45, 46, 47.</note> who ſeeking to enjoy the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
life ſtill in this Equality of ſtate, wherein all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

and while the buſineſſe was in debate in the Senate,
theſe Ambaſſadors privately ſounded the minds of theſe
young Gentle-men, whom they found ready to conſpire
with them for the return of the King. The Ambaſſadors
having obtained the reſtauration of the Kings goods, and
ready to depart, had private meetings with thoſe young
Gentle-men, who for aſſurance of their fidelity to the
King, ſigned a Letter which they delivered to the ſaid Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
all which was detected by a bond-ſlave, who
had overheard them when they delivered the Letter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
giving notice thereof to the Conſul, who apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the ſaid Ambaſſadors, and found the ſaid letter, and
thereupon all the Conſpirators were apprehended; And
to ſee how much <hi>Pagans</hi> made eſteem of their Oaths and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
<hi>Brutus</hi> then Conſul, having two of his Sons,
to wit, <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who were in the Conſpiracy,
himſelf ſaw them executed, and being bound at a Stake,
the people pittied them not ſo much for being puniſhed, as
for deſerving by their fact to be puniſhed, that they could
find in their hearts, and once let enter into their thoughts,
to betray into the hands of <hi>Tarquinus</hi> (a proud Prince, and
then a cruel enemy and baniſhed Rebel) their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
lately, and in that very year ſet free from Captivity,
and their Natural Father who ſet it free. Now for the
Kings goods which were ordered to be reſtored, were flatly
afterwards denied by the Senate, who would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate
and bring them to the Publick Treaſury, but were
given away amongſt the Commons, to the end they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once touched or ſeized on the Kings goods, as a booty,
might for ever after be paſt all hope of any peace or favour
with them.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards <hi>Tarquin</hi> obliged King <hi>Perceua</hi> with a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101204:5"/>
cruel Army to march againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; to endeavour the reſtoring
of him to the Kingdom, and to ſhew how much it conduceth
to the ſafety of a Commonwealth that the People thereof ſhould
engage againſt the baniſhed Kings, and abſolutely to abjure and
renounce them and their line for ever, and how far ſuch
an Oath doth engage a People to keep them out, take this
ſhort ſtory of King <hi>Porcena,</hi> being with his Army at the very

one <hi>Cajus Mucius</hi> afterwards ſurnamed <hi>Scaevola,</hi> together
with others of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the number of 300. engaged
one with another to venture their lives in going to the Camp of
<hi>Porcena,</hi> and to kill him, rather then ſuffer their Country to
be again enſlaved.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide,</hi> The ſecond Book of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> page 49, to 54.</note> It fell to the lot of this <hi>Scaevola</hi> to go firſt,
and coming into the Camp with a ſcain hid under his garment,
he preſſeth in the thickeſt throng to ſtand near the Kings Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal;

fearing to enquire whether of them two were <hi>Porcena,</hi> leaſt
he ſhould diſcover himſelf, in lieu of <hi>Porcena</hi> he killed the
Chancellor, and afterwards with his bloody weapon making
his way through the fearful multitude, was laid hold on and
brought before King <hi>Porcena</hi> ſitting then upon his Throne, to
whom he ſaid, <hi>I am a Citizen of</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi> Cajus Mucius <hi>is my

as ready and willing am I to die my ſelf as I was to kill another, for
both to do and ſuffer valiantly is the part of a Noble</hi> Roman, <hi>and
its not I alone that carry this reſolution, against thee O King, there is
a long train behind of them that ſeek to win the ſame praiſe and
honour, make thee ready therefore and arm thy ſelf if thou think good
against this danger, and reckon every hour to be in hazard of thy
life, and to have alwayes at the very Court gates thy Enemies
ſword; This kind of War we youths of</hi> Rome <hi>denounce openly to
thee, no battel, no fight elſe ſhalt thou need to fear, with thee
alone will we all one by one have to do, and with no other.</hi> Hereat
King <hi>Porcena</hi> incenſed with wrath, and for the danger he stood
in affrighted withall, commanded in menacing wiſe, that
he ſhould be fryed at a ſtake, unleſs he would preſently unfold
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101204:6"/>
in plain terms what ſecret and dangerous practices he meant,
and threatned under covert circuit of words and intricate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
Lo, ſaid he again, <hi>how little they ſet by this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe
that aſpires to great glory and aim at honour,</hi> and with that
thruſt his right hand into the hearth of fire that was made for
the ſacrifice, and when he endured the roaſting thereof, as if he
had been ſenceleſs and felt no pain, the King well nigh aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at this wonderful and miraculous ſight, ſtarted up from his
Royal Seat and Chair of State, commanding the young man
to be had from the Altar; Go thy wayes (ſaid he) in peace, thou

leave to depart without any hurt or abuſe offered unto thee.
Then <hi>Scaevola</hi> as it were to requite his courteſie and deſert, ſaid,
<hi>Foraſmuch as thou ſettest ſo great eſteem in valour, and honoureſt
vertue ſo highly, to the end it may be ſeen, that thou ſhalt get at my
hands by courteſie that which by cruel threats thou couldct not, theſe
are therefore to let thee underſtand, that there are 300. of us Noble
youths, even the very flower and Knighthood of</hi> Rome, <hi>that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
and ſwore thy death, and in this manner to aſſail thee; my lot
it was to be the firſt, the reſt as is ſhall fall out will be here very
ſhortly and wait every man his turn and time until they hit right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee; Scaevola</hi> was no ſooner gone back to <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followed after him Ambaſſadours from <hi>Porceua,</hi> offering the
<hi>Romans</hi> conditions of Peace, which was agreed, and <hi>Porceuae</hi>
withdrew his Army from <hi>Rome.</hi> But ſometimes after ſent other
Ambaſſadours again to <hi>Rome</hi> to treat about reſtoring the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi>
to the Realm, to whom the <hi>Romans</hi> anſwered, that the
Senate would ſend Ambaſſadours to King <hi>Porceus</hi> himſelf, who
accordingly were diſpatched, and delivered the ſpeech follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the chief of their Nobles were ſent rather then any

great mutual benefits and favours paſſed between them, ſome
diſcontentment ariſe on either ſide while he might be thought
to requeſt that which is repugnant and prejudiciall to the
liberty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> again (unleſs they would
be executors of their own wrongs, and ſeek their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to make denyal unto him, whom by their good wills
they would not ſeem to deny any thing of the world. But as
to the ſubſtance of the matter this was the point, namely that
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were not under the Government of Kings,
but were a free State, and fully ſetled in this purpoſe, to ſet
open their gates ſooner unto Enemies then to Kings, and were
generally of this mind and reſolution, that when the Freedom
of that City had an end, then ſhould the City come to an end
alſo, to conclude therefore they were to entreat him that if
he tendred the Weal and ſafetie of <hi>Rome,</hi> he would permit
them to be free ſtill at their own Liberty; King <hi>Porceus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with very modeſtie and much abaſed himſelf, anſwered
thus again, Since you are ſo fully minded and ſtifly bent
(ſaid he) neither will I importune you, nor dull your ears with
harping ſtill upon this unpleaſing ſtring, and do no good, nor
bear the <hi>Tarquins</hi> any longer in hand, and deceive them of that
hope of ayde, which nothing at all is in my power to perform,
let them henceforth ſeek any other place of Exile either for
peace or War as they ſhall think moſt expedient, that there may
be nothing to let and hinder the free courſe of amity and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
between me and you. Thus <hi>Tarquinus</hi> ſeeing all hopes of
return cut off, removed to <hi>Tuſcalum,</hi> and afterwards died at
<hi>Cumes.</hi>

               <p>TO all thoſe that theſe Preſents ſhall ſee, read or hear, Greeting;
As it is well known unto all men,<note place="margin">

Country is ordained by God to be Soveraign &amp; Head over his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and to preſerve and defend them from all injuries, force and
violence, even as a Shepherd for the defence of his ſheep, and that
the Subjects are not created by God for the Prince to obey him in all
he ſhall Command, be it with God or against him, reaſonable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
nor to ſerve him as Slaves and Bond men; but rather
the Prince is ordained for his Subjects (without which he cannot be
a Prince) to Govern them according to Law, Equity and Reaſon,
to take care for them and to love them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide,</hi> The 12 Book, page 659. to page 666.</note> even as a Father doth his
Children, or a Shepherd his Sheep, who putteth both his body and
life in danger, to defend and preſerve them; If the Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faileth herein, and instead of preſerving his Subjects, doth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and oppreſs them, depriveth them of their priviledges and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Customs, commandeth them and would be ſerved of them as of

Prince and Lord, but to eſteem of him as of a Tyrant; Neither
are the Subjects (according unto Law and Reaſon) bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him as their Prince, ſo as without any offence being done
with Deliberation and Authority of the States of the Countrey,
they may freely abandon him, eſpecially, when as the Subjects
by humble Suite, Entreaty and Admonitions could never
mollifie their Princes heart, nor divert him from his Enterpriſe
and Tyrannous deſigns, ſo as they have no other means left
them to preſerve their antient Liberties, their Wives,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101204:7"/>
Children and Poſterity, for the which (according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
they are bound to expoſe both Life and Goods, as for the like
occaſion we have ſeen it to fall out often in divers Countreys, whereof
the examples are yet freſh in memory, which ought eſpecially to be
of force in theſe Countreys, who have alwayes been and ought to be
Governed according to the Oath taken by their Princes, when they
receive them, conformable to their Priviledge and antient Custome,
having no power to infringe them; beſides, that most part of the
ſaid Provinces have alwayes received and admitted their Princes
and Lords upon certain Conditions and ſworn Contracts, which if
the Prince ſhall violate, he is by Right fallen from the Rule and
Superiority of the Countrey, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And after they have made a Recital of his
Cruelties, Oppreſſions and Tyrannies, they further

               <p>Now impartial Reader, that you have ſeen a ſhort and true
Narrative extracted out of antient and modern Hiſtory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may receive ſatisfaction of the cauſes wherefore the
<hi>Romans</hi> and our Neighbours of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> Rejected and
Renounced their Kings and kingly Office, and how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
againſt their ever returning to Rule over them; upon
the whole matter it may be queried, whether the Parliament and
good People of <hi>England,</hi> after God had ſo ſignally and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly
owned their Cauſe againſt the late King and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
have not had an equivalent or far greater Cauſe to Free theſe
three Nations of the yoak of <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>Monarchy,</hi> then the
<hi>Romans</hi> or the States of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> had, which any one
may eaſily be convinced of, if he will but take the pains and
time to read the Hiſtory of the Reign of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. but eſpecially from the coming of that
Baſtard brood to the late Tyrant; What murthers, rapines, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
wars, devaſtations, cruelties, raviſhments and what
not have been acted in the three Nations, during that time? I
ſhall onely hint to ſome few, as firſt of King <hi>John,</hi> of whom
the Hiſtory relates, that when he had endeavoured by force of
Armes and by other barbarous cruelties to impoſe his yoak of
bondage and ſlavery over his People, whom he forced to take
up Armes for his own defence, and that after they had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſeveral victories againſt him, whereby he was reduced to
great extreams, yet would not grant them Peace, till he had
made Tryal of all manner of cruel wayes to ſubdue them by
force, one whereof was, that rather then grant to the People their
Liberties and Freedoms, he ſent to the King of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and
made him an offer that if he would ſend an Army in <hi>England,</hi>
he would deliver up his right and title to him.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer our time, what cruel Murtherer and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
was <hi>Richard</hi> the third and <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his own Queens
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101204:9"/>
and many of his Nobles could not eſcape his fury, and that
for no other crime but to ſatisfie his cruelty, luſt and pleaſure;
ſo notorious was he, that to this day the Proverb remaineth
reſent of him, <hi>That he neither ſpared man in his fury, nor woman
in his luſt.</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> another fury, how many pretious
Souls ſhe cauſed to be brought to the ſtake and burned. King
<hi>James,</hi> ſo little he eſteemed the lives of the People (although
no man of War) yet (if by accident) any one hindred his
ſport in Hunting, or not opened a Gate as ſoon as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he would curſe and ſwear, and give expreſs command
that ſuch a one ſhould be hanged; And for his Son, what
wars, deſolations and miſeries hath he been authour of in the 3
Nations, how many thouſands killed and ruined, how many
millions of Treaſure exhauſted, what Plots contrived by him
and his Queen to ſubvert Law and Religion in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
his inviting of the <hi>German</hi> Horſe in time of Peace, and
in time of War pawn the Jewels of the Crown, to bring over
whole Regiments of Papiſts, to kill, deſtroy, plunder, raviſh
and barbarouſly uſe the Proteſtant People of this Nation;
And moreover of my certain knowledge their ſending Sir
<hi>Kelom Digbys</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> for Aſſiſtance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The realty of theſe unparallel'd actings being ſeriouſly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
and all by-ends and ſelf-intereſt laid aſide, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that of the Publick eyed upon, then it muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that beſides thoſe enormities, that many <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretias</hi>
have been raviſhed by thoſe Kings and their Intereſt,
and that their wars, devaſtations and cruelties have far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
either thoſe of the <hi>Tarquin's,</hi> or Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>
or in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> the raviſhing of one <hi>Lucretia</hi>
(by the Kings ſon) was the principal occaſion of the Peoples
baniſhing and abjuring the whole brood of their Kings;
and in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> the oppreſſion and cruelty of the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> occaſioned the States of that Countrey to do the like;
Weigh but the one and the other together in the Ballance of
Juſtice and Reaſon, againſt the cruelties and licentious wills
of our Kings, and you will be ſure to find them light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable;
as to what hath been exerciſed here ſince the
<hi>Normans</hi> ſubdued <hi>England</hi> under their heavy and oppreſſive
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101204:9"/>
yoak; that in reaſon it muſt be acknowledged and granted
that for the ſafety of the People, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
have (after their ſo many ſignal Victories, and their ownings
of God for the ſame) far more and juſtifiable reaſons, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and cauſe to be renounced, the whole Line of the Kings
and kingſhip, or other ſingle Perſons pretending any right or
title of Chief Magiſtrates over theſe Nations, then either
the <hi>Romans</hi> or State of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> had in renouncing and
abjuring their King and kingſhip; againſt which Oath it may
be Objected,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Oath of Abjuration taken by the <hi>Romans</hi> and
<hi>Netherlands</hi> could not be advantagious to them as for the keeping
out their Kings from returning, and that (ſay ſome) becauſe any
wicked man to bring his deſigns to paſs, will make no Difficulty nor
Conſcience to ſwallow any manner of Oaths.</p>
               <p>To which it may be Anſwered, that this ſhort Narrative
extracted out of the Hiſtory, is ſufficient to remove that Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
for firſt, It is not to be doubled, had it not been for the
Oath taken by the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the return of their Kings,
undoubtedly they had never been kept out.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly for the States of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> It was not
onely uſeful to weed out of their Armies and Garriſons all the
friends of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and likewiſe out of the Courts
of Juſtice and other places of eminent truſt; and certainly,
if the hearing of it read and propoſed could have ſo much
power as to kill that Great and Wiſe Counſellor, how
much more dreadful was it to all others of the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
faction and party, who ſeveral of them upon refuſal of the
ſaid Oath were diſplaced out of their ſeveral imployments;
and beſides it is very remarkable, that after it was impoſed
upon all Military Officers, there was neither Garriſons nor
Forces betrayed to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as formerly before it
was daily obſerved there was; whereupon the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
was forced to make Peace with them.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, It is impoſſible for the rareſt Artiſts of the
world to erect any laſting Fabrick upon an old Foundation,
unleſs firſt the rubiſh and old ruine thereof be abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and caſt out, ſo likewiſe and comparatively it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101204:10"/>
of a Monarchical Government to introduce and eſtabliſh
upon a ſure baſis a Democratical Government, without firſt
caſting off and renouncing that old ruinous and rubiſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of King and kingſhip, which if it had been effected
in the year 1648 when theſe Nations were declared a Free State,
by impoſing an Oath of that nature upon thoſe Perſons then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
intruſted in Civil &amp; Military places, there is ſufficient
ground to believe that <hi>Cromwell</hi> nor his Adherents would never
have attempted to ſubvert and uſurp the Government as they
did, which hath in a manner almoſt ruined both the Cauſe and
Nation; and for want of taking ſuch an Oath, we ſee what
hopes the Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> and other ſingle Perſons have
had and have ſtill to return, which will never be removed,
until (in imitation of our Neighbours the <hi>Netherlands)</hi> thoſe
back-doors be dammed up by taking ſuch an Oath; and
moreover doth not at preſent the Royal Party dare with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
aſſert and maintain, laying Wagers to one that the Chief
in Parliament and Army will refuſe the ſame, and upon that
do openly declare their great hopes, which would be ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
if thoſe Worthies would be but ſenſible thereof, and put
no further delayes in a buſineſs of ſo great concernment to
the ſettlement of the Nation and Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond Objection which is found in the mouths of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which are no better then kinglings, but would put it off
upon a caſe of Conſcience (viz.)</hi> That in caſe God who is the
Omnipotent over all Governments of the world, ſhould in his
Providence ſeem good to bring back ſome of the Line of the late King
to be Ruler over theſe Nations, <hi>then ſay they,</hi> if we ſhould take
ſuch an Oath of Abjuration or Renunciation, we ſhould be found to
have reſiſted the Will of God.</p>
               <p>For Anſwer, God is Juſt and Righteous in all his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
and Providences, and for any Perſon that hath
ſeen and ſeveral times returned thanks unto him for his
wonderful and miraculous Providences in owning a Cauſe
ſo much contended for, by giving ſo many ſignal and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
Victories and Deliverances to this Parliament and their
Forces, againſt the late King &amp; Family in ſeveral conflicts, and
that at ſuch a time when he was very formidable, and his party
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101204:10"/>
and Armies conſiſted of moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of
the three Nations, and yet God by making uſe of a company
of men of low Eſtate and condition, and not brought up in
the Military Art, did in ſuch wonderful manner own and
proſper them in that War againſt the King and his Son, that at
length the Father was by his Divine Providence brought to the
block, and the Sons endeavours all blaſted and brought to
nought, I ſay when men have been eye witneſſes of ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Providences, in not onely blaſting and diſowning
Kingſhip in that Family, but likewiſe in the late family of the
Apoſtate <hi>Cromwells</hi> who attempted the ſame, and that by a
Parliamentary way; And beſides for ſuch as have made War
againſt Kingſhip and againſt that Family, and Voted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
office uſeleſſe, dangerous and chargeable, making it Treaſon
to promote <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> or any other to be chief Magiſtrate of
<hi>England,</hi> ſelling all the ſupport of Kingſhip and all other Eſtate
belonging to it; And ſeeing alſo the Parliament after ſeveral
interruptions (during which time ſeveral endeavours were uſed
to bring kingſhip again) to be miraculouſly reſtored, &amp; to live to
ſee God take vengeance of all thoſe who had been chief Actors
in endeavouring to inthrall us under the yoke of the <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells,</hi>
&amp;c. for ſuch I ſay again after all this not to be convinced
of the lawfulneſs of renouncing or declaiming that whole line
and others pretenders to it, is certainly to doubt of Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and Juſtice, there being as much conſcience or reaſon
to plead the ſame providence againſt abjuring, renouncing or
declaiming the <hi>Popes</hi> Supreamacie over theſe Nations, who for
during far longer time had Dominion and Juriſdiction over
them, ſo that upon the whole matter, it cannot be imagined
that if the pleaſure of God was ſuch as to ſuffer any of that
Family or other, to Rule over theſe Nations, that it can be to
any other end then as a ſcourge and Plague to the Nations and
to thoſe perſons in particular who are ſo incredulous and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
who with many other in the Nation may be compared
to thoſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who (after their wonderful deliverances
from under the yoke of King <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> did murmure while they
were in the wilderneſs, deſiring to return to their former State
and condition of ſlavery and bondage, by reaſon they could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101204:11"/>
not enjoy the Garlick and Onions of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not minding the
Land of <hi>Caanan</hi> and of plenty, towards which they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is the condition of many murmurers in theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
who cannot or rather will not ſee nor dive into the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and plenty to be had and enjoyed under a Democratical
or Free-ſtate Government, which is the thing now aimed and
laboured hard for, and which without doubt had long ſince
been obtained and enjoyed, but for the endeavours and deſires
of ſo many in the Nation to return to their <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage
and ſlavery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, An expedient is by ſome learned men, propoſed and
offered in lieu of taking</hi> the Oath of Abjuration, Renuntiation
<hi>or</hi> Declamation of the Race of the Kings, <hi>&amp;c. ſay ſuch</hi> a Law may
be made whereby it ſhall be declared to be high Treaſon for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to propoſe, help or endeavour the bringing any of that family or
others to be chief Magiſtrates of England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which it is anſwered, that ſuch a Law (without firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch an oath) cannot oblige any perſon againſt the return
of any of that line, or the introduction of any other ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that for theſe reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Such a Law doth not bind the Conſciences and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of any as an Oath doth, which is voluntary and perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliging.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe of late there hath been a ſufficient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of the ſame in <hi>Cromwell</hi> and others, aſſuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Government of theſe Nations, although it was here
declared high Treaſon by a known Law ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe ſuch a Law (although never ſo ſtrict)
may be repealed, which ſuch an Oath can never be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe if any one of that family or other ſhould
attempt by force to overthrow the Government of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſuch a law obliges no man to oppoſe them, which an
Oath doth <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erminis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, Becauſe ſuch a Law cannot diſcover who that is in
the Commonwealth ſervice, that may be an Enemy to it,
which an Oath will ſoon diſcover, and out all ſuch Kinglings
both out of the Courts of Juſtice, as likewiſe out of the Army
and Garriſons.</p>
