         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If we puniſh ſuch by penall lawes, which vſe falſe waights and
meaſures, thoſe are not to be permitted, vvhich diuulgate corrupt
dyſcourſes: for theſe are meanes to vitiat the minde, the other can

            <p>That vvhich is infectious to publiſh, muſt needes be infamous
to patronize; it is a credit to giue countenance to a good worke;
for that cauſe I haue made choyſe of ſuch a matter, as ſhall neyther
offend your W. for vanitie in the inuention, or for indignitie in
the protection.</p>
            <p>The Subiect handled is vvarre, the rumor of it is fearefull, and
therefore the diſcourſe of it may be fruitfull; vvhich hauing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,

            <p>Firſt in reſpect of promiſe; the Ciuilians ſay, <hi>Vir iuſtus eſt vota

being olde, purgeth all the humors of her bodie, by eating
ſpyces of Arabia, and ſendeth forth of her mouth a ſweete breath;
ſo I hauing expelled the vanities of youth, by the experience of
more yeares, may haue a more rype and ſeaſoned iudgment: for as
<hi>Euripides</hi> ſayth, the ſecond actions are more ſinguler; vve ſee that

but there is in your W. both a ciuill kind of curteſie to accept,
and alſo, more then a common courſe of kindneſſe to requite; now
it is true that <hi>Tully</hi> ſayth, <hi>Omnes immemorem benificii oderunt,</hi> all

            <p>THE mutabilitie of reports had almoſt diſmaide mee
in proceeding: for one while there runne nothing
but rumors of vvarre, an otherwhile there paſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
ſpeeches of peace; the ſame mouth that ſaith at one
time, the Spanyard will come, another time affirmeth, we
neede not expect his comming. There be many that wiſh
warrs becauſe they cannot thriue with peace, and others
that ſpeak of peace, becauſe they loue not to heare of war;
but (good Reader) as there is no ſmoke without fire, ſo
there ariſeth no rumor without ſome original, for rumors
are commonly fore-runners of warre. VVhen tydings of
vvarre were voyced in Iuda, the enemies tarried not long
after; and therefore the ſpeeches which are giuen out of
the Spanyard, may put vs in expectation of his comming;
he which hath made ſo great preparation for warre, may
be ſuſpected to weight oportunitie to effect his will.</p>
            <p>There were many falſe Prophets amongſt the Iewes,
which perſwaded them of peace for ſome lewd pretence,
when they knew the Aſſyrians were ready to aſſault them,
Ierem, 6, 14. I pray GOD there be not ſome falſe-harted
ſubiects amongſt vs, that giue out reports of peace for ſom
ill purpoſe, when they are perſwaded the Spanyard is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching.</p>
            <p>Howſoeuer it be, <hi>dubia timenda,</hi> things doubtful are to
be dreadfull; It is better to liue in feare then ſecurity: for
feare maketh vs to flie to God, as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> did when he
feared the Moabites to come vpon him, 2, Chro, 20, 3, but
ſecuritie maketh vs forget God, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſecure in Ieruſalem. 2, Sam, 11. The feare of war
is to be doubted euen in the fruition of peace, for as the
wiſe-man ſayth, There is a time of warre aſwell as a time
<pb facs="tcp:18256:6"/>
of peace, Eccles, 3, 8. Such euer taſt the leſſe troubles in
the tempeſt of warre, which ſayle with a martiall foreſight
in the calme of peace.</p>
            <p>But admit the Spanyarde hath diſperced ſome part of
his Nauie, or hath ſome other croſſe occaſions to hinder
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming hether this yere, yet let vs perſwade our ſelues,
that as God made the Amorites and others to be as pricks
and thornes to the Iſraelits, Ioſua, 23, 13, ſo he hath made
the Spaniard to be as a prick &amp; thorne to Engliſhmen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as we ſhall neuer bee ſo aſſured of peace, but wee
may alwaies liue in ſuſpition of warre: and therefore thys
treatiſe of warre cannot be friuolous.</p>
            <p>I remember <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth, it is one poynt of policie in
peace to prepare for vvarre; now if outwarde furniture to
defend the body, is expedient to be in preparation, though
there be no vvarre; the inwarde Armour to aſiſt the ſoule,
cannot be impertinent though there be peace.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſome other reſpects haue mooued me to ſet
forth this Treatiſe, conſidering what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
qui nemini viuit,</hi> he liueth not, that liueth to none but
himſelfe; therefore I thought it to bee a ſinne by concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which might turne to a more profit by publiſhing.</p>
            <p>Thus being loth to put any in feare of vvarre, although
it be good policie to ſuſpect it, or in hope of peace when
the Enemie is ſo buſie about warlike preparation, I leaue
the cenſuring hereof, to ſuch as know beſt vnder God, and
the ſucceſſe of both to him that ſeeth more then any man,
which is the almightie <hi>Iehouah,</hi> whom <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth to

            <p>1. <hi>Bellum internum,</hi> inward warre, is that we commonly
call the ſpirituall warre, therefore this life is very fitlie by
one of the Fathers called a warfare. <hi>Auguſt. 45. Ser. de tem.</hi>
For the Spirit hath many egregious enemies, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
combate and encounter with it.</p>
            <p>The fleſh is called <hi>Caro a corrupto,</hi> becauſe it dooth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
or as the Schooleman ſaith, it is called <hi>Caro quia cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit,</hi>
becauſe it doth ouerthrow. This is one enemie that
impugneth againſt the Spirite; From whence are warres
(ſaith the Apoſtle) euen of your luſtes that fight in your
members: <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. Heereupon <hi>Paule</hi> wel alludeth when he
ſaith, <hi>Though we walke in the flesh, we doe not warre after it.
2. Cor.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
            <p>The world, as one ſaith wel, is called <hi>Mundus ab immun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
for it ſhroudeth much filthines vnder a faire ſhew, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:18256:7"/>
               <hi>Austen</hi> ſayd not without cauſe, <hi>Si te delectat hic mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
ſemper vis eſſe immundus:</hi> if we take pleaſure in it, wee
ſhal alwaies be impure. This world is another enemy that
warreth againſt the ſpirite. As warre commonly precee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
before victory, ſo the Apoſtle approueth the worlde
after a ſort, to warre, by ſhewing the meanes howe to get
the victorie, in theſe words, <hi>This is our victory that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
the world, euen our fayth. 2. Iohn.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>The deuil, he is called <hi>Dlabolus, quia eſt aduerſus,</hi> becauſe
he is againſt vs, and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> calleth him <hi>aduerſarie,
1. Pet,</hi> 5, 8. Thys deuill is another enemie that warreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Spirit, for it is written of him, that hee beeing
wroth with the VVoman, went and made warre with the
remnant of her ſeede. <hi>Apoc, 12, 17. S. Gregory</hi> ſaith, that the
manifold warres of our fore-fathers, are ſhadowes of thoſe
warres we muſt haue with the deuill. <hi>Greg: 23, queſt. capit.

               <item>This VVarre is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in two reſpects,
<list>
                     <item>1. of the number of the enimies</item>
                     <item>2. of the nature of the enimies</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. Of the Number: for there are three to one. The
Phyloſopher ſayth, <hi>Ne Hercules contra duos,</hi> hee muſt be a
ſtrong man that is able to reſiſt two, therefore three to one
is greater odds. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſent but three thouſand men
againſt the Citty of <hi>Ai,</hi> the Cittizens were able to ſhift
with them. <hi>Ioſua,</hi> 7, 4, but when he ſent thirtie thouſande
ſtrong men againſt it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cittie was ſoone ſacked. <hi>Ioſu.</hi>
8, 3. If the bodie be not able to withſtande outward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
where there is inequalitie of enemies, howe ſhould
the Spirit, where there is ſuch aduantage of the inwarde
aduerſaries?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18256:7"/>
2 Of the Nature: for they practiſe all pollicies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
with the ſpirit: inſomuch as many times they make
a batterie and breach in the very beſt, as in <hi>Dauid, Peter,</hi> &amp;
diuers other. This ſhort period of the melli-fluous father,
doth pretely deſcribe the nature of theſe enemies, <hi>Mundus
clamat decipiam, Caro inficiam, diabolus interficiam, Chriſtus
dicit reficiam: quem ſequereris?</hi> the worlde crieth I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
The fleſh cryeth I wil infect, the deuill cryeth I will
kill, but Chriſt ſaith I wil refreſh, which of theſe wilt thou
followe? But as there be many mighty and vndermining
enimies againſt the Spirit, ſo God hath not left it deſtitute
of aſsiſtance to animate it.</p>
            <p>There is no King will ſend foorth his ſubiects without
weapons in outward warres: euen ſo the king of al kings,
hath dealt by the Spirit in this inward warfare; for he hath
not left it naked and open to the enemies, but hath gyuen
it Armour for the defence, as the Breſt-plate of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the Shielde of fayth, the Helmet of ſaluation, the
Sword of the Spirit. &amp;c. <hi>Ephe,</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>This ſpirituall Armour is of greater force to ſubdue the
inward enemies, then politique weapons are to repell the
outward aduerſaries: therfore <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, the weapons of
our warfare are not carnall but mightie through God to
caſt downe holds. 2, <hi>Cor,</hi> 10, 4.</p>
            <p>In other warres, the Souldiers neuer goe to fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Captaine to conduct them, euen ſo hath God delt by
the Spirit, it hath Chriſt to be the Captaine, and therefore
wee are called Souldiers, becauſe wee fight vnder his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Now if <hi>Saule</hi> had good ſucceſſe in his battels, becauſe
<hi>Dauid</hi> being a godly Generall directed his bands, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
ſhall ſpeed well in this conflict, becauſe Chriſt is the
Captaine, who is farre better then <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Humaine Captaynes will ſometime recoyle and ſhrinke
<pb facs="tcp:18256:8"/>
from their Souldiers in extreamities, this heauenly Captaine
will perſiſt with his Souldiers in all perills: for (as one of
the ancient writers ſayth) he will ouer-looke vs fighting,
ſuccour vs fainting, and crowne vs ouercomming.</p>

            <p>It is moſt fearefull in many reſpects, for firſt, if we faint
in this fight, it is commonly the cauſe of all other warres,
for outward warres are ſent to intimate Gods indignation
for our ſecuritie, to the end we might be excited and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in this ſpirituall fight. God would neuer ſende out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enemies to afflict the bodie, but that hee perceiues
the inward enemies doe preuaile with the Spirit.</p>
            <p>2 In other warres, though wee bee taken captiues, yet
we may be ranſommed for money, but if wee be ſubdued
by the ſpirituall enemies, there is no hope of raunſome, as
the Pſalmiſt ſayth. <hi>Hee cannot giue his raunſome to God, Pſal,</hi>
49, 7.</p>
            <p>3 In other warres, we can but looſe our goods, lyms,
or (at the vttermoſt) our lyues, though the enemies work
their wills on vs: but in this ſpirituall battell we looſe both
bodies &amp; ſoules if the enemies get the vpper hand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S. <hi>Ierom</hi> ſaith wel, <hi>Septies ſtultior eſt, ego qui nudo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore
poneret ſe in medio hoſtium armatorum:</hi> that ſuch an one
is ſeauen times more fooliſh, or in worſe plight, then hee
which doth hazarde his naked body in the midſt of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
hoſt.</p>
            <p>It is moſt famous if the Spirite preuaileth: for in other
warres, ſuch as gette the conqueſt, may perhaps purchaſe
ſome momentanie riches or renowne amongſt men: but
in this inward warre, if we be victorious, we ſhall obtaine
a Crowne, not of gold, but of glory, not earthly, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.

how the <hi>Amonites</hi> intended to battell againſt him,
the Scripture ſaith that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> feared, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. VVe
ſee by experience in our ſelues, that when it is giuen out,
the Spanyard prepareth to come againſt vs, how many of

            <p>2 If the rumour and report of warre bee ſo fearefull,
what is the very action it ſelfe. I remember a pritty inſtance
to this purpoſe, when <hi>Dauid</hi> was to incounter with his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
ſome of his men ſayd vnto him: <hi>See wee be afrayde
heere in Iuda, how much more if we come to Kelah againſt the
hoſt of the Philiſtims. 1, Sam.</hi> 23, 3. Let vs applie this to our
ſelues, if we be afrayd to heare of warres at home in our

of the enemie? <hi>Saule</hi> was a notable and worthy warrior:
for he had ſore warres all his dayes, 2, <hi>Sam.</hi> 3, 1. Yet is it

martiall exhortation was made in Deut, 20, 8, VVhoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

There be many ſuch faint-harted men, which doth argue
no humanitie but effemenacie. VVhen open proclamation
was made in the warres of <hi>Gedeon</hi> that ſuch ſhould returne
home which were timerous or fearfull, of 32. thouſande,

Spaniards come againſt vs, let vs not be fearefull, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our cauſe is ſo good, that wee ought to ſhewe our
ſelues couragious, and not covvards.</p>
            <p>3 Of Deſpayre; If God caſteth feare vpon a man, and
in his feare he diſpaire of Gods protection, this is to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a great puniſhment, becauſe it is inflicted vpon the
wicked, as appeareth in Deut, 28, 66, Thy life ſhall hange
before thee, and thou ſhalt feare both night and day. And
in Leuit, 26, 36, I will ſend a faintnes into their harts. It
was the iudgement God impoſed vpon the impious Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians,
that theyr hands ſhall be weakened, and theyr
harts melt, and they ſhal be afrayde: anguiſh and ſorrovve
ſhal take them, Eſay, 13, 8, and therefore, howſoeuer it

ſhould take a little foyle of the enemie, as the Iſraelits dyd
of the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> farre be it from vs we ſhould be ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that our harts ſhoulde melt away like water, as theyrs
did, Ioſua 7, 5, in ſeioyning fayth from feare.</p>

               <p>THE Poets fayned VVarre to bee a Riuer running

15, 9: ſo merciles are men in vvarre that it may wel be true
which <hi>Homer</hi> ſayth, There is ſome ſacietie of all things,

               <p>Some other of the Ethnick wryters, haue deemed war
to be a fire alwaies flaming, becauſe they commonly vſe to
conſume Citties and Townes when they are beſieged,
with fire, as Iericho was by <hi>Ioſua,</hi> &amp; Ieruſalem by the king
of Babel.</p>
               <p>Theſe bee rather deſcriptions of the fruites and effects

               <p>There is no Prince in Chriſtendome euer poſſeſſed
peace ſo long as our gracious Soueraigne; It is vvritten of
Iuda and Iſraell, they dwelt vvithout feare, euery man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own Vine, 1, Kin. 4, 25, the like hath been verified
by vs in England; Reade throughout all Chronicles, and
ſee howe many of her predeceſſors had the like Alcion
dayes. Search the Scriptures, and you ſhall find how that
beloued Lande of Iſraell neuer had the like fruition of
peace as Englande had, vnleſſe it were in <hi>Salomons</hi> dayes;
Diſcend into other Countries, and you ſhall ſee hovve the

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18256:12"/>
Theſe things conſidered, what ingratefull and diſloyall
perſons are theſe, vvhich hauing by continuance of peace
gathered plentie, and with theyr plenty are ſo vncheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to part with a little to defend theyr Queene and theyr
Countrey? <hi>Tully</hi> hath a prety ſaying, Hee that deſireth
peace, let him prepare for vvar. How can a man be ſure to
poſſeſſe any thing in his owne Country, vnleſſe hee proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to repell the enemie that commeth againſt it; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that is a very mellifluous ſaying of one of the Fathers,
<hi>Sumptus pro militia honorabilis eſt,</hi> the coſt for vvarfare is
very honourable, for it is a meane to defend our liues, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and lyuings, and to preſerue our wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Miſerable are thoſe men that will not ſtrayne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

               <p>2 Of their Seruice, others are grieued at VVarres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they muſt then leaue their wiues, children &amp; goods,
or rather becauſe they muſt hazard theyr liues? Far better
it is for one to venture his lyfe like a man, then to be killed
in his houſe like a beaſt; Is it not better to hazard the lyfe
of one in an houſe, then in forbearing to fight, to bring in
daunger the whole familie? The diuine Philoſopher ſaith,
<hi>Naſcimur pro Patria,</hi> we are borne for our Countrie, and
therefore we muſt regard our Prince and common-weale
more then our owne priuate liues. 2, Sam. 10, 12. VVee
haue example in <hi>Iudith,</hi> who for the good of her Country,
put her life in great hazard in the hoſt of <hi>Olofernes,</hi> let not
the courage of a woman condemne the humanitie of a
man; for that is a reproch. Ierem. 51, 30. VVho can dye a
more honorable death then for his Countrie, therfore we
ſhall reade that amongſt the <hi>Romaynes</hi> there were the <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Codrians,</hi> and the brethren called <hi>Phileni,</hi> and amongſt

<pb facs="tcp:18256:12"/>
others, who of their owne accord gaue their liues for their

or other, as you may reade in Eſter, 3, 8, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Rulers and Gouernors had a ſecret ſpite to <hi>Daniell,</hi>
becauſe he was far in fauor with the King, yet they would
not offer hym an immediat bad meaſure, but they conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them ſelues, to moue the King to make a Law,
that by colour thereof, they might haue theyr myndes of
good <hi>Daniell.</hi> Dan. 6, 8, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If any of our Magiſtrates ſhould colour theyr own pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
malyce vnder the Queenes buſines, although theyr
ſecret pretence be no more known to her Maieſtie, then
the intendment of theſe practiſes were to the Kings, yet by
theſe examples let them feare, leaſt their dooings come to
lyght, as the other dyd (albeit they deſerue not ſo fearefull
a puniſhment as befel thoſe) that they purchaſe diſpleaſure
of theyr Prince, vvho cannot abide to bolſter ſuch abuſes.</p>
               <p>By a Captayne, who knoweth not how ſuch as be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
profeſſors of Armes being in office and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are a kind of protection for the tyme to certayne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
for this cauſe when <hi>Dauid</hi> vvas a Captayne in warre,
there gathered to hym all men that were in trouble, and
all men that were in debt, and all thoſe that vvere vexed
in mind, and he vvas their Prince or Captayne, 1, Sa. 22, 2.
Beſides, it is not to be ſpoken howe many waies they may
<pb facs="tcp:18256:13"/>
pleaſure a man in vvar, if they be vvilling; yet on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
if a Captayne be offended at his Souldier and beare
hym in the ſplene, he may quyte it vnder colour of hys of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
hee may make martage of hym, hee may vvearie hym
with vvants and diſcurteſies, hee may cauſe him to end his
dayes in euery light skirmiſhe; He vvas a VVarriour that
ſayd ſo himſelfe, and no meruaile, for we haue an example
of it in the Scriptures, <hi>Ioab</hi> did of purpoſe place <hi>Vriah</hi> in
the fore-front of the battell, that he might be ſlaine by the
Philiſtims: <hi>Vriah</hi> and all the Hoſt were ignorant of the

               <p>Decayed Souldiers, ſuch as depende vpon warres, they
are welcome to them, for they perceiue the world is come
to this paſſe, that as the Phiſition is but little regarded but
in time of ſicknes, ſo Souldiers are but little ſet by but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there is neede of theyr ſeruice; Certes it is pittie that anie
approoued Souldier ſhould be put to ſhifts. Valorous <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
would neuer ſuffer it in his time; miſery may conſtraine
a man too much; but yet for any to reioyce when there is
common cauſe of ſorrow, and for his owne priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
to deſire a generall calamitie, the one argueth his
diſſolute minde to God, and the other bewrayeth him to
be a bad member to his Country. I would haue ſuch men
as theſe conſider, that the vſe of many things may be good
though the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be naught. M. <hi>Caluin</hi> to that
effect ſayth, <hi>Purus eſt multarum rerum vſus, quarum vitioſa
eſt origo. Cal. in Math. cap. 5, verſe</hi> 37. The vſe of manie
things is pure, whoſe originall is impure. From hence I
infer, that although the vſe of a Souldiers is neceſſary, yet
to profeſſe a ſouldier (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſayth) is of it ſelfe the
puddle and ſincke of all miſchiefe; For to lyue by ſpoyles
and ſpilling of blood what life more miſerable; Beſides, it
is nothing delectable to God, but rather maketh any leſſe
acceptable in ſome good action, as we reade of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:18256:14"/>
was not onely a valiant, but a vertuous warrior, but when
he went about to builde the Temple, the Lord ſayde hee
ſhould not, becauſe he had been a man of warre, and had
ſhed blood. 1, Chro, 28, 3.</p>
               <p>Vnder officers, ſuch as may reape any profit in theyr
places, as Clarks of Bands, which may get ſome benefite
by the Booke, by entering, altering, or quitting of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
theſe are glad of warrs for gayne ſake. Notable is
that example of <hi>Gehaſi</hi> for this purpoſe; <hi>Elisha</hi> was a good
man, hee dyd a notable cure in the Syrian Captaine for
meere good will without any gyfts, but his ſeruant <hi>Gehaſi</hi>
without his knowledge, would needes take a brybe. VVe
haue many godly Lieuetenants and Captaines in Europe,
who although they themſelues reſpect rewardes no more
then <hi>Elisha</hi> did, yet ſuch as be vnder them (without theyr
priuities) perhaps like <hi>Gehaſi</hi> doe looke to get ſome-vvhat
that way, to be gratified one way or other. But as <hi>Gehaſi</hi>
for his couetous act was afterward turned away by his
Maiſter, with a grieuous puniſhment, 2, Kings 5, ſo let
theſe take heede leaſt theyr dooings be diſcerned by their
Maiſters, and they be put out of office with diſpleaſure, as
<hi>Gehaſi</hi> was.</p>
               <p>VVarlike workmen, ſuch as lyue by making, mending,
or ſelling of Armour, warres are welcome to them, for as
the Lawyers thriue beſt when men are moſt litigious, ſo
are they in time of warre moſt ſet to worke, for in tyme of
peace they profit not; Therefore, as ſome bad Lawyer
doth ſecretly wiſh that men would be contentious, that he
might haue Clyents, ſo it fareth vvith theſe kinde of men,
they vviſh warres, that they may haue vvorke: they care
not vvhoſe houſe be on fire, ſo theyrs be ſafe, they grieue
not at warre, becauſe it is ſent for a puniſhment, but they
reioyce at it, becauſe it is occaſion of theyr profit.</p>

2 Deſperate perſons, ſuch as haue nothing to looſe,

all Countries are a lyke to them, hab, nab, fall backe, fall
edge, all is one to them, vvhether they be friendly foes to
the enemy, or deadly enemies to their Country; ſo they
may ſhift, they care not what ſhift they make; they laugh
when they ſee others lament, it doth them good to ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

they will rayle, and doe hope to raigne ouer rich me one

liue in pouerty; As we read of the beſieging of Ieruſalem,
how the rich were killed or made captiues, but as for the

<list>
                        <item>1 A ſpeciall Author.</item>
                        <item>2 A manuall Author.</item>

               <p>1 THE ſpeciall Author is GOD, as appeareth by
his owne ſpeech, when hee ſaith: I will ſende
<pb facs="tcp:18256:15"/>
plagues vpon them, the ſword ſhall kill them without, and
in the Chambers feare. Deut, 32, 22, 25. It is ſaid in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that the King ſent foorth his VVarriors. Math, 22, 7.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelits confeſſed all their afflictions to come of
God: for (ſay they) he hath ſpoyled vs, and hee will heale
vs, he hath wounded vs, and he will binde vs vp. Hoſ. 6, 1.
He is therfore called the Lord of Hoſts, becauſe hee ruleth
and raigneth our all hoſts.</p>
               <p>2 The manuall Author, to our apprehenſion is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimy,
becauſe wee perceiue the Spanyarde maketh great
preparation, and purpoſeth to come againſt vs; Many of
vs take him to be the Author, in that he appeareth to be
the Actor. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, they which make vvarre,
are not ſo much th Authors as the Miniſters of God, <hi>Aug.
10. queſt. ſuper Iohn:</hi> for he is both the Paſsiue, Miſsiue, &amp;
motiue Author, as appeareth by pregnant examples in the
Scriptures.</p>
               <p>He is the Motiue Author, for he mouth and ſtirreth vp
the Enemie, or els he could not come. The Philiſtims and
Arabians came againſt Iuda, to deſtroy it, yet they came
not of their owne accord, for it is written, the Lord ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp againſt <hi>Iehoram</hi> (the King of Iuda) the ſpirit of the
Philiſtims: 2, Chro, 21, 16. The Medes &amp; Perſians made
warre againſt Babilon, thys was not their owne voluntary
act, for the Lord had ſayd before, I will ſtyr vp the Medes
againſt it. Eſay, 13, 17. Therefore we may gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe
examples, that if the Spaniard with his confederates bend
their forces to vs, it is not altogether his own ſeeking, but
God which exciteth him to it; For as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſayth, It is
God that ſtirreth vp cruell Princes &amp; Tyrants, which may
be called the hoſt of God. <hi>In com. Rom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is the Miſsiue Author: for after he hath excited the
Enimy, he ſendeth him, or els he could not approch. The
<pb facs="tcp:18256:16"/>
Chaldees, Aramites, Ammonites, and Moabites beſieged
Iudah, their comming conſiſted not in their own election,
for it is written the Lord ſent againſt him (that is the King
of Iudah,) bands of the Chaldees, bands of the Aramits,
&amp;c. 2, Kings, 24, 2. <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> with his power came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Ieruſalem to deſtroy it, the choyſe was not in him
to tarry or retyre, for the Lord had ſaid before, I wil ſend
them. Ierem, 25, 9. Now, if the Spaniard hath a purpoſe
to come againſt vs, it is in God to diſpoſe: his comming li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in his owne liberty, but the Lords.</p>
               <p>He is the Paſsiue Author: for albeit he firſt ſtirreth, and
afterward ſendeth the Enimy, yet he can do nothing whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he is come, without Gods ſufferance. The Iſraelits had
grieuouſly tranſgreſſed, for which cauſe they fell into the
hands of theyr enimy: the enemy could not haue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
without Gods permiſsion; for it is written that God
deliuered them into the hands of ſpoylers that ſpoyled
them. Iudg. 2, 14.</p>
               <p>Sith it is God that ſtirreth, ſendeth and ſuffereth the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimy
to doe his good pleaſure, they are but his ſeruants, as
the Lord termed <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> his ſeruant, Ierem, 27, 6.
Or his inſtruments, as <hi>Eſay</hi> calleth them, the weapons of
his wrath, chap, 13, 5. And they are ſo fitly called, becauſe
the Lord doth make them ſerue him by conſtraint, &amp; that
which they doe of malice, hee directeth and turneth it to
his honour and glory; ſo that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence we may conclude
that God is the ſpeciall Author of VVar.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>In that God is the
Author, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
three thinges,
<list>
                        <item>1 His power by the effects.</item>
                        <item>2 His diſpleaſure by the action.</item>
                        <item>3 His loue by the end.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18256:16"/>
1 His power by the effects, though Kings and Princes
are as Gods vpon earth, yet there is a God aboue them,
who can brydle theyr wills as hee will: this ſhould teach
vs to relie vpon God: for admit the Spanyard hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to come againſt vs, yet this is our comfort, hys heart
is in the handes of God, whoſe power is ſuch, that if it be
hys good pleaſure, hee can alter the determination of the
Spanyard, before he ſetteth forth to fight, as he did by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi>
when hee was bent to vvarre againſt the <hi>Iſralites.</hi>
1, Kings 12, 24: He can intercept his comming when hee
is vpon the Seas, and drowne hym, as he did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
hys hoſt. VVhen hee is about our Coaſtes, hee can put a
hooke into hys noſtrils, as hee dyd by <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and
make hym returne that vvay he came, 2, Chro. 32, or hee
can diſpierce and ſcatter them into vnknowne Coaſtes, as
he dyd by the Spanyard his laſt viage. Such is the power of
God, as one of the auncient Fathers ſaith, that there is not
any thing done, but that he would haue to be done, either
ſuffering it to be done, or hee hym ſelfe doing it. <hi>Auguſt.
lib. voc. Enchiredion ad Laurentium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Hys diſpleaſure by the action; for it is an argument
of his anger, and therfore you ſhall reade in the Scriptures,
that God neuer ſendeth vvarre but in his vvrath, the Lord
him ſelfe ſpeaking of Ieruſalem vvhich vvas beſieged by
the enemie, ſayth: In my wrath I ſmote thee. Eſay 60, 10.
In the 2, and 3, Chapters of the Iudges, the Lord ſent and
ſet the Enemie againſt the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> many tymes: It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in thoſe places that hee neuer dyd it, but vvhen hys
vvrath or anger was kindled againſt them: Now the anger
of God is grieuous, for the Prophet ſayth of hym, that he
ſmote the people in anger vvith a continuall plague. Iſaiah
14, 6. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth that the Kings wrath is like the roring
of a Lyon, Pro. 19, then what is his vvrath, who is King
<pb facs="tcp:18256:17"/>
of Kings, thys ſhould moue vs to take thys courſe, wee ſee
when the Prince is diſpleaſed vvith hys vaſſaile, he vvill vſe
all meanes to pacifie hym, for feare hee ſhall be caſt cleane
out of fauour, ſo ſhould vve when vve perceiue the anger
of God is kinled againſt vs, ſeeke all poſsible wayes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
hym, for feare he giue vs ouer to the luſt of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes,
and therefore let euery one of vs pray vvith <hi>Daniell,</hi>
and ſay as he dyd in the lyke caſe; O Lord according to all
thy righteruſneſſe, I beſeech thee let thyne anger and thy
wrath be turned away, Dan. 9, 16.</p>
               <p>3 Hys loue by the end, that father which doth chaſtiſe
his child for hys faults doth loue him, euen ſo our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
father which doth correct his children for theyr offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
doth affect them, and as the rod is a readie meanes to
brydle and reclayme chyldren from vntowardnes, ſo is
vvarre a good ſcourge to make vs remember our miſdeeds,
and ſeek to God. The Lord (ſpeaking of the <hi>Iſralites)</hi> ſaith,
in theyr affliction they vvill ſeeke me diligently, Hoſ. 5, 15,
and the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith: it is good for me that I haue
been afflicted for this reaſon, that I may learn thy ſtatutes,
Pſa. 119, 71. VVe ſee by experience that the child vnleſſe he
be ſometime beaten, he falleth to all vnbrideled looſeneſſe,
ſo it fareth vvith vs, if we ſhould not ſometime feele Gods
afflictions, vvee ſhould runne into all filthyneſſe, euen as
the Pſalmiſt ſaith, before I was afflicted I went aſtray. Pſal.
119, 67: Therefore let vs beare Gods puniſhment with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
for as gold is purified by the fire, ſo are we refined
by afflictions, and as the Bee conuerteth into honie, that
vvhich the ſpyder doth to poyſon, ſo that vvhich the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
doth of euill, God turneth it to our good.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>In that the Enemies are Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
wee may note two thinges.
<list>
                        <item>1 A Lymitation.</item>
                        <item>2 A Reprehenſion.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18256:17"/>
1 A Lymitation, vve commonly ſee that Seruants are
worſe many tymes then theyr Mayſters; the Steward in
Mathew dealt well with his Seruant, but he dealt extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vvith others. Math. 18, 28: the Lord vſeth the Spaniard
as a ſpur to prouoke vs to amendment, but it may be ſayd
of hym, as of <hi>Ashur,</hi> but he thinketh not ſo, neyther doth
hys heart eſteeme it ſo, but he imagineth to deſtroy. Iſaiah,
10, 7. for he commeth with a reſolute purpoſe, to execute
his owne crueltie, and not to the ende to pleaſe God. Yet
this is our comfort, he is but Gods Seruant, and therefore
he can doe no more then God will permit &amp; appoint him,
no, though he were as bad as the deuill: for you ſee howe
ſatan could do no more to <hi>Iob</hi> then GOD ſuffered him to
doe. Iob, 1.</p>
               <p>2 A reprehenſion, this concerneth vs, wee are readie
to rayle and curſe the Spanyard that moleſteth vs, but in
the meane time, we do not remember he is Gods ſeruant,
which if we did, we woulde not ſo much reſpect the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
as he that ſendeth him; The Spanyard no doubt ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and curſeth vs to the pit of hell, as we terme it, what
then, let vs forbeare him by the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who
being curſed of <hi>Shimei,</hi> a wicked man, hee put it vp pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
becauſe, (ſaith he) the Lord did bid him curſe, 2, Sa.
16, 10. If a Noble mans man abuſe vs in words, wee will
beare with him the more for his Lord and Maiſters ſake:
much more ought we to beare with the ſeruants of God;
VVe muſt not imitate euill by the example of the wicked,
though they be incited &amp; ſuffered to curſe, we haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cauſe to thanke GOD if he hath giuen vs grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine.
Beſides, it is but a vvindie conqueſt is got vvith
words, therefore you ſhall reade when <hi>Dauid</hi> vvas to deale
with <hi>Goliah,</hi> this Giant did curſe and ſcorne him in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<hi>Dauid</hi> digeſted his words with ſilence, but he praied
<pb facs="tcp:18256:18"/>
and prepared himſelfe to incounter with him to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Let vs follow his courſe, what though the Spaniard
doth curſe vs and ſcorne vs as <hi>Goliah</hi> dyd <hi>Dauid,</hi> let vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
him, (for wee can ſpeede neuer the better for our
ſpeeches,) but let vs like <hi>Dauid</hi> prepare our ſelues to repell
him.</p>

               <p>1 The Secondary cauſe is that we aſcribe to outwarde
meanes, and inſtant occaſions: as for example in other
things, if we haue any loſſe of goods, we vſe to ſay it came
by caſualtie of fire, ſhypwracke vpon the Seas, &amp;c. Or if
we get a ſicknes, we tooke it by ſuch a iourney, or of ſuch
a colde &amp;c. And ſo in this ſence we commonly ſay vvhen
we haue vvarrs, it is the malice, pryde or impietie of the
Enimy that cauſeth it. VVhen in the meane time we doe
not conſider who it is that exciteth, ſendeth, offereth or
ſuffereth ſuch motions or meanes to effect, and for what
cauſe he doth it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>2 The efficient cauſe of
warre is of two ſorts,
<list>
                        <item>1 For Correction.</item>
                        <item>2 For Reformation.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>1 For Correction, as a ſcourge or puniſhment for ſin,
which the God of hoſts himſelfe affirmeth, when he ſaith,
<pb facs="tcp:18256:18"/>
If he ſinne I will chaſten him with the rod of men, 2, Sam,
7, 14. And the Pſalmiſt to that effect ſayth: If they break
my ſtatuts, then will I (ſpeaking in the perſon of GOD)
viſite theyr tranſgreſsions with the rod: Pſal, 89, 32. It is
written in the Chronicles, that the King of Egipt came vp
againſt Ieruſalem, becauſe they had tranſgreſſed againſt
the Lord: 2, Chro, 12, 2, and ſo if the Spaniard commeth
againſt vs, we muſt perſwade our ſelues that our ſinnes are
the chiefe cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>But whether God ſendeth warre to vs for our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
for our laſt deliuery from the Spaniard, as he dyd to
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> for his vnthankfulneſſe when he was deliuered
from <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2, Chron, 32, 25, or whether it be for our
oppreſsion and cruelty, as hee did to the Iſraelites for the
like ſinnes, Ierem, 6, 6, or whether it be for any groſſe ſins
amongſt vs, as he did to the Babilonians for theyr barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
beaſtlines, Eſay 13, or whether it be for our murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at this Scarcitie, or for the hardnes of our harts to the
poore in this extreame time, God knowes; ſome grieuous
ſinnes there be that prouoke the Lord, for elſe he would
not viſite vs, two yeares together vvith Scarcitie, and the
third yeare threaten vs with warre.</p>
               <p>2 For Reformation, that warre is ſent to reforme and
amend vs is manifeſt; Behold, famine, plague, anguiſh &amp;
trouble, are ſent as ſcourges for amendement: 2, Eſd, 16, 15.
The father doth chaſtiſe his ſonne, not becauſe he taketh
pleaſure in puniſhing of him, but that he may by it brydle
and amend him; Euen ſo GOD the Father correcteth vs
which be his children, not becauſe hee delighteth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
but to the end he may therby reclaym vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
iniquities. As the rod of wood is a meane to make the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
childe gracious, ſo is the rod of warre an inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to mooue vs to good: as it is ſaide of Iudah, Lorde in
<pb facs="tcp:18256:19"/>
trouble haue they viſited thee, they poured out a prayer
when thy chaſtening vvas open them; Eſay, 26, 16. And
therfore God dealeth with vs as a Phiſitian: A good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
will ceaſe from miniſtring phiſick to his patient whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he is recouered; or as a Maiſter, who will ſtay from ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his ſeruant when he is growne better by his beating.
So God, he deſiſteth his puniſhments ſo ſoone as wee are
profited by them. I will recite one example in ſteed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Lord raiſed vp <hi>Shiſshake</hi> to ſcourge <hi>Rehoboam</hi> for
his ſinne, but the text ſayth, Becauſe he humbled himſelfe
the wrath of the Lord turned from him; 2, Chro, 12, 12.</p>

               <list>

               <p>Temporall puniſhments: for the Lord ſayth to ſuch, I
will ſet my face againſt you, and yee ſhall fall before your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies,
and they that hate you ſhall raigne ouer you. Leu.
26, 17. Let vs make this caſe our own: what a heauy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were this, if the Lord (for our committing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in ſinne) ſhould frowne vpon vs when the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
commeth with his force againſt vs, &amp; ſhould ſuffer him
to preuaile as the Medes &amp; Perſians did in Babilon, would
he not deale as they did, of whom it is ſaid: their chyldren
ſhall be broken in peeces before theyr eyes, theyr houſes
ſhall be ſpoyled, and theyr wiues rauiſhed, Eſay, 13, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18256:19"/>
VVere not this a lamentable ſight to beholde, and to haue
him to raigne ouer vs that hateth vs what a miſerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
were it? vvho would not think but that this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were grieuous and ſufficient: but if we ſtil perſeuere,
the Lord wil ſtil purſue vs, for he ſaith; If yee will not for
theſe things obey me, then will I puniſh you ſeauen times
more, according to your ſinnes; Leuit, 26. As we ſee hee
delt by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he neuer left of his plagues ſo long as hee
liued impenitent; Thys may teach vs howe grieuous a
thing ſinne is with perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>Eternall puniſhments, the temporall plagues are but an
enterance to theſe. <hi>Hoc ſuſpicari &amp;c.</hi> ſayth <hi>Gregory,</hi> a man
cannot ſuſpect howe extreame thoſe paynes are. Such as
perſeuere in wickednes, let them remember what <hi>Paule</hi>
ſayth, They doe but heape vp wrath againſt the day of
iudgement, Rom, 2, 5. As <hi>D. Martir</hi> ſayth vvel vpon that
place, a hard hart is that which wil not be mollified with
Gods benefits, woon with hys mercyes, broke with hys
threatnings, nor reclaymed with his puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The Heathen men had thys naturall fore-ſight for the
reſtraint of ſinne; The Lidians would haue in theyr hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the picture of a deuill in forme of an Ethiopian, that by
the horrible ſight, they might abhor that which brought
him to it, which was ſinne. The Perſians would paynt an
Epicure diſguiſed with exceſſe, that theyr chyldren might
auoyde the like fault, by ſeeing that deformitie. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians
would ſhew theyr youths drunken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperat
men, that they might be deterred from ſinne, by the
lothſomnes of that ſight; If Chriſtian men, would ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them the horror of hell, it would make them feareful
to practiſe euill, much more to perſeuere in it. For thys
cauſe <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> willeth vs to talke often of hell, that wee
may take heede of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18256:20"/>
2 A notable Conſolation, by the Reformation, if wee
take profit by this puniſhment, in reforming our lyues and
lyuing in the feare of God. The Spaniarde may perhaps
feare-blaſt vs with his Armie, but he ſhall neuer preuaile in
his attempt; for the Lord ſaith of ſuch: the Sworde ſhall
not goe through your Land, yee ſhall chaſe your enimies,
and they ſhall fall before you vpon the ſword. Leuit, 26.
Although the Lord hath prepared the Spaniard to come

(If (ſaith hee) this Nation againſt whom I haue

therefore let vs all pray for the grace of repentance, and

               <p>Such as haue oppreſſed and bitten their bretheren with
extreame bargaines theſe hard yeeres, let them make ſome
amends; The Ethnicks required double reſtitution, Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus
made foure-fold reſtitution, Luke, 19. Salamon tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs of a ſeauen-fold reſtitution, Prou, 6, and therefore
they may do little if they make not ſome reſtitution. Such
as haue carried theyr heads as hie as Lucifer, let them now
holde downe their heads like Bulruſhes. Such as haue
ground the faces of the poore, let them doe good to them
thys time of Scarcetie, not onely for commandement ſake,
as <hi>Sirach</hi> ſayth, Ecclus, 37, but euen for pollicie ſake: for
you know what Salomon ſayth: In the multitude of the
people is the honour of a King, but for the want of people
commeth the deſtruction of the Prince, Prou, 14, 28. If
God ſhould ſend the enemie againſt vs, the moſt defenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

they want the ſtay and ſtaffe of theyr ſtrength, which

vs not ſee them famiſh; if we would haue them forcibly to
vſe theyr weapons, let vs not infeeble them for want of
victuals; If we would haue them ſtrong, let vs not ſtarue
them. How can a ſouldier bee hardie againſt the enemie,
when his hart is killed for want of ſuccour? therefore if
we loue our Prince, let vs labour to preſerue the honor of
our Prince, let vs not ſuffer the multitude of her people to

the Amalekites preuayled. Exod. 17, 11. Fourthly, becauſe

Let euery one that call vpon GOD, depart from iniquitie
ſayth Paul, 2, Tim, 2, 19. ſo that there is nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

againſt the Enimy, if it happen otherwiſe, we may impute
it to our ſin. VVhen <hi>Ioſua</hi> ſent men to beſiege <hi>Ai,</hi> ſome of

The Lorde neuer ſuffered the enimies to preuaile againſt

by the words of <hi>Hezekiah. Ioab</hi> was a valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
vnder <hi>Dauid,</hi> and he comforted hys Souldiers in this
ſort: Be ſtrong, &amp; let vs be valiant for our people, and for
the Citties of our God, and let the Lord doo that vvhich is
good in his eyes, 2, Sam. 10, 12. Albeit <hi>Ioab</hi> was otherwiſe
in hys lyfe, a bloodie man, not onely in vvarre, but in time
of peace, 1, Kings 2, 5, yet who could vſe a more com-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
kind of ſpeech, to comfort and incourage hys Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
then this? inſomuch as they all ioyned together ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie,
and put the enemie to flyght. The lyke courſe did
<hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Maccabeus,</hi> two notable vvarriors vſe with their
Souldiers, vvho being terrified with the view of mightie
Armies, and other martiall accidents, by theyr apt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
they proued valorous, where before they vvere ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
and in the end diſcomfited theyr Enemies, as you
may reade at large in 1, Macch. 3, and 2, Mach. 8.</p>
                     <p>The moſt renowned and valianteſt vvarriors amongſt
the Heathen, as <hi>Caeſar, Alexander,</hi> &amp;c, vvould neuer goe
into the field without Phyloſophers (who in theyr tymes
were deemed the onelie vviſe men) to the end they might
<pb facs="tcp:18256:25"/>
inſtruct and comfort theyr Souldiers. It is none of the
leaſt poyntes of martiall diſcipline, to practiſe all poſsible
and perſwaſiue meanes, to incourage, comfort, and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borat
the hartes of the Souldiers; for moſt men deſire to
ſerue vnder ſuch a Captayne. VVhen the Iewes heard the
comfortable vvordes of <hi>Simon,</hi> they were ſo inclined and
affected to hym, that they forth-with burſt out of theſe
words in a clamorous manner. Thou ſhalt be our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
in ſteede of <hi>Iudas,</hi> 1, Mach. 13, 8, and wee reade of
<hi>Dauid,</hi> how he did ſo win the harts of hys Souldiers, that
the people more affected and famozed hym then <hi>Saul;</hi> and
yet <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> vvere two valiant vvarriors. There is
nothing more delighteth and draweth lyking in vvarre,
then lenitie, and louing perſwaſions, vvhereas raſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
dealing, doth more hurt in the harts of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
then in the hoſt of the Enemie.</p>

                  <p>IVſt warre is that which is taken in hande at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Magiſtrate, for the demaunding of
things againe, or to repulſe iniuries, or to reuenge them.
<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> define it much after thys manner.
No man doubteth, but that the Magiſtrate is to command:
for he beareth not the ſword for nought, therefore <hi>Poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18256:25"/>
in the life of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſayth, that he in his writings

of things agayne, moued <hi>Abraham</hi> to attempt
warre, becauſe the enemies had taken away hys brother,
and other mens ſubſtance, Gen. 14, 14. To repulſe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
vvas the chiefe cauſe, that moued all godlie Kings in
the Scriptures to vndertake warre, for the deſence of their
dominions, liues, and religion. The reuenging of iniurie
was <hi>Dauids</hi> caſe, whoſe men beeing abuſed by <hi>Hanun,</hi> to

we deteine nothing of hys, that he can iuſtly demand,
or proffer hym iniurie, that he may rightlie ſeeke reuenge,
therefore hys cauſe is not iuſt. Iniurious vvarre is that
which is attempted of malyce, as <hi>Saul</hi> dyd againſt <hi>Dauid,</hi>
2, Sam, 18, 9. Or of pryde or ſuch like impious occaſions,
it is this that dooth prouoke the Spaniard in ſpyte to come

                  </list>
                  <p>In his life I will note but two things, firſt his pride, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
his crueltie. His inſolence is well knowne to the
world, inſomuch as that report of Moab may be applied to
him, which is written in Eſay 15. VVee haue heard of the
pryde of Moab, he is very proude: and therefore vnleſſe
God be merciful to him, hee may in the ſomtome of hys
pryde come to as miſerable an end as Moab. Hys crueltie
is intollerable where he doth tyrannize, for he is far worſe
then <hi>Nero. Nero</hi> for all his cruelty, when hee was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to a ſentence of death, would wiſh hee could not
write, but the Spaniard, he careth no more to ſhed blood
then the Butcher, and therefore in his enterprize hee may
be fearefull by the example of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who carrying ſo
murderous a minde, by deſtroying chyldren in the water,
that in the warre where he thought to worke his will, he
was drowned himſelfe by water; let him take heed, leaſt
the Lord doth make him ſhed teares without mercy, as he
hath ſhed blood without meaſure.</p>
                  <p>In religion, the Spaniard is like the Leopard, ful of ſpots;
<pb facs="tcp:18256:26"/>
A ſpottiſh and ſottiſh profeſsion is that which derogateth
the glory of God, for the whole action of idolatry, &amp; the
ſubſtance of ſuperſtition is common in his Country; ſuch
crouching to croſſes in the ſtreets, ſuch adoration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Churches, ſuch mumbling of Maſſes, Diriges,
Trentals, and ſuch like trumperies, which would make a
good Chriſtian lament to looke vpon, which they delight
to practiſe and depend vpon. Hee is worſe then <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
for he made much of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> becauſe hee was a good man,
but he can neither abide the perſon or profeſsion of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man. He is worſe then the Turke, for he wil not refuſe
to receiue the Bible, much leſſe perſecute ſuch as preſent
it to him; but the Spaniard is ſo great an enemie to God,
that he doth impriſon the bodyes, confiſcate the goods, &amp;
inflict other puniſhments vpon ſuch as bring but a godlie
booke into hys Country; inſomuch as there appeares to
be no ſparke of godlines in him: becauſe he reiecteth the
meanes that might effect ſome good in him.</p>
                  <p>Sithence the Spaniard is but a prophane perſon, let vs
diſcend to examples for our comfort, and we ſhal ſee from
time to time, how the wicked in theyr warres againſt the
godly, haue alwayes got repulſe &amp; ouerthrow in the end.
That wicked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> which long troubled and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
ouer the good Iſraelites, in his laſt aſſault of warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, he was ſo far from effecting his furie, that the
Lord drowned him &amp; all his hoſt vpon the red Sea. VVell
woorthy was hee to be drowned in the water, who had
cauſed many chyldren to be caſt into the Riuer, Exo, 1, 22.
That blaſphemous <hi>Senacherib,</hi> who diſturbed <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a
godly king, in the end the Lorde did puniſh him, not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly,
but immediatly, by ſending his Angell into his
Camp, who ſmote many thouſands of his men; and as for
<hi>Senacharib</hi> himſelfe, as hee had dealt vnnaturally againſt
<pb facs="tcp:18256:27"/>
God, ſo he was not long after vnnaturally put to death of
his owne chyldren.</p>
                  <p>That peruerſe generation of the Moabites &amp; Amonits,
made warre againſt that vertuous King <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> they
vvere ſo far from preuailing, that GOD made one enemy
to be executioner to another; 2, Chro, 17.</p>
                  <p>That irreligious Ethiopian which moleſted <hi>Aſa,</hi> that
tovvard plant and Prince, at the laſt hee did not onely put
the Ethiopian to flight with a fevve, but alſo got him by
purſute, and had his will of him. 2, Chro, 14.</p>
                  <p>Similitude and example, doth much moue ſaith <hi>Cicero,</hi>
for vvho cannot be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted by ſo godly examples. <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi>
ſayth, that hiſtories and examples be iudgements and
teſtimonies; for who cannot beholde the iudgements of
GOD by theſe examples? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that examples
ought to be as Sermons to vs: for as godly Sermons doe
miniſter matter for our edification, and conſolation, ſo doe
theſe examples in thys ſort.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we may learne from hence, howe the godlie are
ſubiect to many ſorrowes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth: The troubles of
the righteous are many, Pſa, 34, 19, for there are euer ſome
ambitious and rebellious kinde of people that ſtir vp ſtrife
and ſedition againſt them, therefore wee muſt not thinke
much though the Spaniard ſet himſelfe againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may ſee from hence, although God doth
ſuffer the wicked to aſſault and diſturbe the godly, yet hee
vvill not ſuffer the enemy to preuaile: therfore this is our
comfort, ſo long as wee feare God and liue in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
anſwerable to it, the Spaniard may well come, but he
ſhall neuer accompliſh his will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee may behold by theſe examples, that albeit
God doth vſe the wicked as his inſtruments or ſeruaunts,
yet he dooth not affect any euill, or fauoureth theyr mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb facs="tcp:18256:27"/>
intents. He affecteth no ill, becauſe in the ende hee
afflicteth ſuch as commit it: Prou, 24, 20. He doth not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
theyr malicious intents, becauſe hee gyueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bad
ſucceſſe in theyr attempts.</p>
                  <p>3 The End, which ought to be aymed at in VVar, is
not victory but peace: for as Chriſtians would neuer vvar
if they might poſſeſſe peace, ſo when they be conſtrayned
to warre, they deſire peace; as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth of his enemies,
I ſeeke peace, and when I ſpeake thereof, they are bent to
vvarre, Pſalme, 120, 7. Thys contradicteth Ariſtotle, who
concludeth, that as the end of phiſicke is health, ſo the end
of vvarre is victory.</p>
                  <p>But let vs diſcend to the Spaniard, to ſee what end hee
aymeth at; he commeth not hether to enrich vs with his
Indian treaſure, or to ſupply vs with his Spaniſh warres, or
to make amends for his proffered iniuries, or to offer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of peace, but the end of his comming is eſpecially,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>for theſe three cauſes,
<list>
                           <item>1 To attempt VVarre.</item>
                           <item>2 To inuade the Land.</item>
                           <item>3 To deſtroy vs.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1 To attempt warre: for it may be ſayd of hym, as of
<hi>Aſshur,</hi> vpon vvhom hath not his malyce paſt continually.
Nah. 3, 19. For he warreth and diſquieteth many Nations,
as he loueth, ſo he laboureth to ſhed blood: Yet in thys
action, he ſhowes a baſe minde, for all he is ſo ambitious a
man, vve commonly ſay he is no man that vvill fight with
a woman: for if he doth vanquiſh, he can haue no great
glory, if he be ouerthrown, he taketh great ſhame; There
is a pretie inſtance for thys purpoſe in <hi>Abimelech,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about to ſet a Tower on fire, a woman caſt a peece of
milſtone vpon his head, and broke hys brayne-pan; <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi>
called haſtelie for hys Page, and bad hym drawe his
<pb facs="tcp:18256:28"/>
ſword to ſlay hym, that men might not ſay of hym, a vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſlewe hym, Iudg, 9, 54. If the Spanyard dyd beare
the minde of a man, he would neuer moleſt a woman, a
Virgine, a Queene, whoſe lyfe and religion is a light to all
the world, vvhoſe diſpoſition and dayes requier quiet, but
as God brought <hi>Syſera</hi> that wicked perſon to death, by the
hand of <hi>Iael</hi> a woman, Iudg. 4, 22, and <hi>Olifernes</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
by the hand of <hi>Iudith</hi> a woman, and <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
to hys ende, as you haue heard by a woman, ſo his mercy,
can make her Maieſtie powerful, by ſome meanes or other,
to ſpoyle the Spanyard; hee vvhich hath deliuered her
from ſo many ſecret villanies at home, vvill protect her
from the open violence of her Enemies abroad.</p>
                  <p>2 To Inuade the land: hys meaning is not to view it,
but to inuade it, he carryeth a reſolute intent to enter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he knowes the iſſue: for in hys laſt vyage he made he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he preſumed of a conceited conqueſt, and bewrayed
hys ſiniſter pretence, before he was aſſured of his purpoſe.
The Iewes dyd not caſt lots for Chriſtes garments, tyll he
was crucified, but the Spanyard and hys company did caſt
dyce for our lyuings, before they had tryed the euent.</p>
                  <p>3 To deſtroy vs, thys was one commendation <hi>Cicero</hi>
gaue <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that when he had vanquiſhed, hee would be
mercifull and forget iniuries, <hi>Alexander</hi> that magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
minded vvarrior, when he might haue hys will of hys
Enemyes, would ſay it ſuffized hym to tryumph, though
he dyd not tyrannize. If heathen men were ſo inclyned to
mercie, much more ought Chriſtians, the very law of arms
affordeth mercy to ſuch as be ſubmiſsiue, but what fauour
is to be expected of hym, whoſe affections be not ſeaſoned
with the feare of God? The Spaniard pretendeth to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dyd to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſayd, I will deuide
the ſpoyle, my luſt ſhalbe ſatisfied vpon them, I will drawe
<pb facs="tcp:18256:28"/>
my ſword, myne hand ſhall deſtroy them. Exod. 15, 9.
God deliuer vs from hys malyce, we may not truſt to hys
mercie: for as the ground dyd fare the vvorſe for <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi>
becauſe it was fruitfull, ſo ſhall we by the Spanyard,
becauſe of our profeſsion: He made the ground barren by
ſowing of ſalte, Iudg. 9, 45, thys, hopes to hynder the
growth of the word by ſhedding of blood, the truth is, he
would take away our liues, to roote out our religion; but
as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayth: He that deſpiſeth the word, he ſhall be
deſtroyed, Pro. 13, 13. So thys is our comfort, God will
take our cauſe in hand: for as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> ſayd, ſo may we.
It is Gods battell and not our, 2, Chro. 20. Hee will not
permit ſuch to preuayle, which haue any pretence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
hys glorie.</p>

the aſiſtance of the Pope, and perhaps
the helpe of ſuch as haue greater cauſe to gratifie vs, then
be againſt vs. Alas good England, thou art incloſed in a
corner of the world, many are thy Enemies, becauſe God
is thy friend; thou haſt not many Nations to combyne
with thee, yet thys is thy comfort, if thou doſt relie vpon
God, he is able to delyuer thee from all. There were fiue
Kinges ſet againſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14, and as many agaynſt
<hi>Ioshua.</hi> Ioſh. 10, 16: yet <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> got the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.
Some aledge that the ſpaniſh Nauie is mighty, both
<pb facs="tcp:18256:29"/>
in regard of hys long tyme of preparation, as of hys laſt
euerſion, which will make him come the more forceable,
for feare of a double foyle. To thys I aunſwere, though
hys Nauie were innumerable, and he ſhould arrogate this
tytle, as he dyd laſt time, that it is an inuincible Nauie, yet
for all his great power and pride, God can deale with him
now as hee dyd then, not onelie to diſpierce and ſcatter
them in vnknowne Coaſtes, but alſo make the Spanyard
lyke <hi>Senacherib,</hi> returne with ſhame to hys owne Land, 2,
Chro. 32, 21. Admit hee comes with many millyons of
men; yet wee muſt conſider that hee intrudeth into hys
Ships all ſortes of people, ſome that came neuer at Sea, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that cannot away with the Sea; now who knowes
not that ſuch as be weather-beaten and cannot brooke the

furniture to defend them. A more morrall reaſon is thys,
be he neuer ſo mightie, it is but an arme of fleſh, they can

thouſand, Leuit. 26. VVee haue examples of it for our
comfort.</p>
                  <p>The Madianites, and Amalakites, and many of the Eaſt,
of whom it is vvritten, lay in valleis lyke Graſhoppers in
multitude, and theyr Cammels were vvithout number, as
the Sand is by the Sea-ſide, Iudges 7, 12. All theſe came
againſt the Captayne of the Iſralites, who had but three
hundred men, and yet he diſcomfited them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zerah</hi> came with ten hundred thouſand men, and three
hundred Charrets, againſt <hi>Aſa,</hi> who had but fiue hundred
<pb facs="tcp:18256:29"/>
foure-ſcore thouſand men, yet he incountred with him &amp;
ouer-came them, 2, Chro, 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon the 13, pſalme <hi>con:</hi> 2. ſayth, Hee is trulie
valiant vvho is not ſtrong in himſelfe but in the Lord. Our
chiefe valure conſiſteth in God, but the confidence of the
wicked in theyr power, Eſay, 31, 1, 2. GOD in iudgment
doth puniſh ſuch as ſtande vpon theyr owne ſtrength, but
in mercy he protecteth thoſe which haue a truſt in him in
theyr troubles.</p>
                  <p>2 Some ſiniſter ciuill practice. Thys is the common
ſaying: if we be true within our ſelues, we neede not care
or feare the enemy. Many ſuſpect the Papiſts. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
many times will ſuſpect the godly, and therefore it is
not amiſſe for Conformoliſts to ſuſpect Recuſants. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
that wicked tyrant, feared and ſuſpected the Iſralits,
for (ſayth he,) Come let vs worke wiſely with them, leaſt
they multiply, and it come to paſſe that if there be vvarre,
they ioyne themſelues alſo vnto our enemies, and fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs: Exod, 1, 10. Therefore it is good policie where
there be ſuſpicious perſons, to preuent the occaſions that
may effect theyr ill pretence, by reſtrayning theyr libertie,
deteyning theyr armor, not admitting them to any office
in Armes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If two dogs be ſtryuing for a bone, when they ſee the
Beare, they will both forſake the bone to flye vppon the
Beare: and certes (though the compariſon be ſome-what
groſſe) I take it, albeit the Papiſts iarre about matters of
Religion, yet when they ſee the Spanyard, they wil ioyne
with vs againſt him, if it were but to ſaue theyr liues. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
and <hi>Herod</hi> were at great ods about priuate matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, but when they had to deale with Chriſt, they
could then become friends, &amp; conioyne together for hys
deſtruction, Luke, 23, 12, then much more ought the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
<pb facs="tcp:18256:30"/>
for all theyr opinions, reconcile themſelues and ioyne
with vs againſt the Spaniard, who deſerueth death more
then Chriſt. The dog will fawne of his Maiſter, but barke
at ſtrangers, farre worſe were they then dogs, if they doe
not affect theyr Prince, and fight againſt her enemies.</p>
                  <p>In Ieruſalem there were ſome irreligious perſons, as bad
as <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> himſelfe, yet when hee beſieged it, hee
killed and captiuated all ſauing a fewe poore, which were
left to looke to the grounds, 2, Reg. 24, euen ſo let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
thinke, if the worſt ſhould fall (as God defend,) the
Spaniard will deale as <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> did, he wil not ſpare
a Papiſt though he be a Papiſt: (but he will rather ſuppoſe
it is done of policie to poſſeſſe life) and therefore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they ſhould arme themſelues againſt the enemie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are like to ſpeed no better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we, if he preuaile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had rather die then beare Armes againſt his
Country; VVhat more neere to any then his natiue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
For thys cauſe I reade of <hi>Zeno,</hi> who being taken by a
Tyrant, and enioyned to tortures, he bit out his tongue &amp;
ſpit it in the Tyrants face, for feare the extreamitie of the
payne ſhould make him confeſſe any thing againſt his
Country. Let theſe Heathen men excite vs to carrie true
harts to our Country, for as <hi>Paedanius</hi> ſaith, he that betraies
his Country, is worſe then he that beſiegeth it.</p>

                  <p>Yet commonly they fayle in theyr purpoſe, and receiue in
ſteede of preferment reproch, in ſteede of reward, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in ſteed of loue, hatred.</p>
                  <p>As for preferment, we reade of <hi>Laſthenes,</hi> who when
he had betrayed hys Countrie to King <hi>Phillip</hi> of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
he expected to haue had ſome preferment and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
for hys deede, but the common Souldiers in deryſion,
called hym euer after by no other name but TRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR:
inſomuch as he complayned to King <hi>Phillip</hi> for
redreſſe, the King made hym thys aunſwere, the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
are rude and playne people, and knowe not how to
call things, but by theyr own proper name, noting heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that as he had committed treaſon, ſo he iuſtly deſerued
no other name but Traytor.</p>
                  <p>As for Reward, we read of certayne Phaliſcian Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
vvho hoping of reward, went about to betray theyr
Countrie to <hi>Camillus:</hi> vvho rewarded them as they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
for hee commaunded that they ſhould be brought
home agayne, into theyr owne Countrie, with the ſtrypes
of theyr own Schollers, becauſe they would haue betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. <hi>Menelaus</hi> preſumed of ſome reward, vvhen hee
ſought to betray his Countrie to <hi>Eupator,</hi> ſo hee had, for
he commaunded he ſhould be put to death for his deſert,
2, Mach. 13.</p>
                  <p>As for Loue, vvee reade of the King of the Thraciaris,
who in hope of fauour, fell from <hi>Anthonie,</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
which afterward he boaſted on, in the preſence of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
and others; but <hi>Auguſtus</hi> turned hym to hys friend, and
<pb facs="tcp:18256:31"/>
ſayd, I loue the Treaſon but the Traytor I commend not.
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> King <hi>Pyrhus</hi> Phiſition promiſed to the Romayns,
that he would for theyr ſakes, worke treaſon agaynſt hys
King and Countrie, they were ſo far from fauouring hys
ill pretence, that they dyd detect hym to his King, that he
might take heede of hym; that example of <hi>Iudas,</hi> may be
pretelie heere-vnto applyed, the Iewes made of <hi>Iudas,</hi>
whileſt he was a working the Treaſon, but vvhen he had
done, they made no force of him; for when he told them,
he was touched and diſturbed for the treacherie, vvhat is
that to vs (ſay they) ſee thou to it, Math. 27, 4. A Traytor
may haue ſome kind intertaynement for the tyme, but he
ſhall neuer haue any matter of truſt committed to him, for
he that will betray hys natiue Countrie, ſhall liue euer ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
of falſehood in a forrayne Nation.</p>
                  <p>To GOD. Treaſon is an odious thing to God, and ſo
odious, that although it ſhould paſſe vnpuniſhed amongſt
men, yet he will purſue a traytor himſelfe with his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereof we haue many examples in the ſcriptures.
<hi>Abſalom</hi> committed treaſon againſt <hi>Dauid</hi> hys father, and
<hi>Zimri</hi> againſt <hi>Elah</hi> hys Maiſter, yet for all that, <hi>Dauid</hi> dyd
not puniſh hys Sonne, nor <hi>Elah</hi> hys Seruant, the Lord
ſhewed hys iudgments vpon them, for one vvas hanged
by hys owne haire, 2, Sam. 28, and the other burnt hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
1, King, 16, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iaſon</hi> was a notable Traytor to his Countrie, and raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
lyke a roge or vagobond afterward from Countrie to
Countrie, he did eſcape the puniſhment of men, but God
ſtill purſued hym, tyll at laſt comming to Lacedemonia,
where he had thought to haue had reliefe, he dyed moſt
miſerablie, vvanting the laſt office of humanitie, which is
buriall, 2, Mach. 5, 7, 8, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There be many, yet I will but note one other worthie
<pb facs="tcp:18256:31"/>
example. <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> betrayed and rebelled againſt <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer,</hi>
a wicked King, this action ſo much diſpleaſed
the Lord, that he rayſed vp many bands of men agaynſt
<hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> to aflict hym for his treacherie, 2, King 24, 1. If
the Lord will puniſh ſuch as worke treaſon againſt theyr
King, though he be a tyrant, vvhat will hee doo to thoſe
that betray a good Prince, which mayntaynes the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Sithence treaſon is ſo odious to God and man, as <hi>Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>
ſayth, <hi>Aliorum perditio tua ſit cautio,</hi> let other mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
be our permonition, and let euery one of vs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
true harts to our Queene and Countrie; If it be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
to haue a Tyrant to raigne, and a double puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to haue hym taken away, Hoſea 13, 11, (for better is
a Tyrant, then no gouernour, Iudg. 17, 6,) vvhat a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
is it to haue a godlie Prince, as we haue, and a double
bleſsing to enioy her dayes as we doe, but how vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
our puniſhment, if we looſe her; therefore let vs vnite
our heads, harts, and hands, and venture our own liuings
and liues for the preſeruation, &amp; defence of ſuch a Prince;
Then we may be fully reſolued, (if we haue had vnfeyned
repentance for onr ſinnes, and make defenſible preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for our ſelues, and vſe feruent prayers for our ſucceſſe)
that God will ſo bleſſe vs with the meanes, as we ſhall not
neede to feare the iniurious aſſault of that proud <hi>Senacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi>
of Spayne. Let <hi>Ahab</hi> call vpon <hi>Baal;</hi> the Turke vpon
<hi>Mahumet,</hi> in their troubles, and the Spanyard vpon Idols
in hys attempts, we wil pray and depend vpon the God of
Iſrael; And if <hi>Symachus</hi> boaſted that in his wars his wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
gods did deliuer him from the <hi>Senons, D. Mar. co. Ro.</hi>
we may be aſſured that our immortall and liuing God, can
and wil deliuer vs from the Spaniard.</p>
