            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Confession of Faith.</head>
            <p>I Beleeve that nothing is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning but God, no nature, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no spirit but one and the same God; That God as he is eternall, almighty, onely wise, onely good in his nature, so he is eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne and Spirit in persons.</p>
            <p>I beleeve that God is so holy, pure, and jealous, as it is impossible for him to be pleased in any creature, though the worke of his owne hands: So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angell, Man, nor World, could stand or can stand one moment in his eyes, without the beholding of the same in the face of a Mediatour; and therefore that before him, with whom all things are present, the Lamb of God was slaine before all worlds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which eternall councell of his it was impossible for him to have descended to any work of creation, but he should have enjoyed the blessed and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all society of three Persons in Godhead onely forever. But that out his eternall and infinite goodnesse and love, purposing to become a Creator, and communicate with his creatures, he ordained in his eternall councell, that one person of the Godhead should be united to one nature, and to one particular of his creatures, that so in the person of the Mediatour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101339:3"/>
the true ladder might be fixed, whereby God might descend to his creatures, and his creatures ascend unto him: So that God by the reconcilement of the Mediatour, turning his countenance towards his creatures, (though not in the same light and degree) made way unto the dispensation of his most holy and secret will; whereby some of his creatures might stand and keepe their state, others might fall and be restored, and others might fall and not be restored in their state, but yet remaine in their beeing, though under wrath and corruption, all with respect unto the Mediatour; which is the great mysterie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect center of all Gods wayes with his creatures, and unto which all his other works and wonders do but serve and refer.</p>
            <p>That hee chose (according to his good pleasure) man to be that creature, to whose nature the person of the eternall Son of God should be united: And amongst the generations of men, elected a small flock, in whom (by the participation of himselfe) he purposed to expresse the riches of his glory: all the ministration of Angels, damnation of Divels and Reprobates, and universall administration of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and dispensation of all times, having no other end, but, as the wayes and ambages of God, to be further glorified in his Saints, who are one with the Mediatour, who is one with God.</p>
            <p>That by the vertue of this his eternall councell touching a Mediatour, he descended at his own good pleasure, and according to the times and seasons to himselfe knowne, to become Creator, who by his eternall Word created all things, and by his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101339:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eternall Spirit doth comfort and preserve them.</p>
            <p>That he made all things in their first estate good, and removed from himself the beginning of all evill and vanity unto the liberty of the creature, but reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in himselfe the beginning of all restitution, to the libertie of his grace, using neverthelesse, and turning the falling and defection of the creature, (which was to his prescience eternally knowne) to make way to his eternall councell touching a Mediatour, and the worke hee purposed to accomplish in him.</p>
            <p>That God created Spirits, whereof some kept their standings and others fell, hee created Heaven and Earth, and all their Armies, and Generations, and gave them constant and everlasting lawes which we call nature, which is nothing but the laws of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which lawes neverthelesse have had three chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or times, and are to have a fourth or last: The first, when the matter of heaven and earth was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without formes. The second, the <hi>interim</hi> of perfection of every dayes worke. The third, by the curse, which notwithstanding was no new creation: And the last at the end of the world, the manner whereof is not yet fully revealed: So that the lawes of nature which remaine, and now governe inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly till the end of the world, began to be in force when God first rested from his workes, and ceased to create; but received a revocation in part by the curse, since which time they change not.</p>
            <p>That notwithstanding God hath rested and ceased from Creation since the first Sabbath, yet, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, de doth accomplish and fulfill his divine will in all things, great and small, singular and generall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101339:4"/>
as fully &amp; exactly by providence, as he could by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and new creation, though his working be not immediate and direct, but by compasse; not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature, which is his owne law upon the creature.</p>
            <p>That at the first the soule of man was not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by heaven or earth, but was breathed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly from God; so that the wayes and proceedings of God with Spirits, are not included in nature, in the lawes of heaven and earth, but are reserved to the law of his secret will and grace, wherein God worketh still, and resteth not from perfecting the worke of redemption, as he resteth from the worke of creation, but continueth working till the end of the world; what time that worke also shall bee accomplished, and an eternall Sabbath shall ensue. Likewise, that whensoever God doth transcend the law of nature by miracles, (which may ever seem as new creations) hee never commeth to that point or passe, but in regard of the worke of redemption which is the greater, and whereto all Gods signes and miracles doe referre.</p>
            <p>That God created man in his owne Image, in a reasonable soule, in innocencie, in free-will and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie: That he gave him a Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was in his power to keepe, but he kept it not: That man made a totall defection from God, presuming to imagine that the Commandements and prohibitions of God, were not the rules of good and evill, but that good and evill had their owne principles and beginnings; and lusted after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of those supposed beginnings, to the end to depend no more upon Gods will revealed, but upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101339:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himself and his own light as a God, then which there could not be a sin more opposite to the whole Law of God: That yet neverthelesse this great sin was not originally moved by the malice of man, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated by the suggestion and instigation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, who was the first defective creature, and fell of malice and not by temptation from another.</p>
            <p>That upon the fall of man, death and vanitie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the Justice of God, and the Image of God in man was defaced, and heaven and earth which were made for mans use, were subdued to corruption by his fall: But then that instantly and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of time, after the word of Gods Law became, through the fall of man, frustrate, as concerning obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, there succeeded the greater word of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that the righteousnesse of God might bee wrought by faith.</p>
            <p>That as well the Law of God, as the Word of his promise endure the same for ever; but that they have beene revealed in severall manners, according to the dispensation of times: For the Law was first imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that remnant of light of nature which was left after the fall, being sufficent to accuse; then it was more manifestly expressed in the written Law; and was yet more opened by the Prophets, and lastly expounded in the true perfection by the Son of God, the great Prophet and perfect interpreter of the Law.</p>
            <p>That likewise the word of the promise was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted &amp; revealed, first by immediate revelation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, after by figures, which were of two natures; the one the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the continuall Historie of the old world, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101339:5"/>
Church of the Jewes, which though it bee literally true, yet it is for the most part pregnant of an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie and shadow of the worke of the redemption to follow: The same promise or Evangel, was more clearly revealed and declared by the Prophets, and then by the Son himselfe, and lastly by the holy Ghost, which illuminateth the Church to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>That in the fulnesse of time, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and oath, of a chosen lineage descended the blessed seed of the Woman, Jesus Christ, the onely begotten Son of God, and Saviour of the world, who was conceived by the power and over-shadowing of the holy Ghost, and tooke flesh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> That the Word did not onely take flesh, of was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to flesh, but was made flesh, though without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of substance or nature; so that the eternall Son of God, and blessed Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> was one person: So as the blessed Virgin may be truly and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly called <hi>Deipara,</hi> the Mother of God; so one, as there is no unitie in universall nature, not that of the soule and body of man, so perfect: For the three heavenly unities, whereof that is the second, exceed all naturall unities; the unitie first of the three persons in the God-head: secondly, of God &amp; man in Christ: thirdly, of Christ and the Church, the holy Ghost being the worker of both these latter unities, for by the holy Ghost was Christ incarnate and quickned in the flesh, and by the holy Ghost is man regenerate and quickned in the spirit.</p>
            <p>That Jesus the Lord became in the flesh a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and sacrifice for sinne, a satisfaction to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101339:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Justice of God, a meritor of glory and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a patterne of all righteousnesse, a Preacher of the Word which himselfe was, a finisher of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, a Corner stone to remove the separation between Jew and Gentile, an Intercessor for the Church, a Lord of nature in his miracles, a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of death and the power of darknesse in his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and that he fulfilled the whole Councell of God, performed all his sacred offices and annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on earth, accomplished the whole worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and restitution of mans nature to an estate superiour to the Angels, (whereas the state of man by creation was inferiour) and reconciled and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished all things according to the eternall will of the Father.</p>
            <p>That in time, Jesus the Lord was borne in the dayes of <hi>Herod,</hi> and suffered under the government of <hi>Ponce Pilate</hi> being deputy of the Romans, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the high Priesthood of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> was betrayed by <hi>Iudas</hi> one of the twelve Apostles, and was crucified at Jerusalem, and after a true and naturall death, and his body laid in the sepulchre, the third day he raised himselfe from the bond of death, and rose and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe to many chosen witnesses by the space of divers dayes, and at the end of those dayes, in the sight of many, ascended into heaven, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth his intercession, and shall from thence at the day appointed, come in great glory to judge the world.</p>
            <p>That the sufferings and merits of Christ as they are sufficient to do away the sins of the whole world, so they are only effectuall to those which are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101339:6"/>
by the holy Ghost, who breatheth where he wil of free grace, which grace, as a seed incorruptible, quickneth the spirit of man, &amp; conceiveth him anew, a son of God, and member of Christ; so that Christ having mans flesh, and man having Christs spirit, there is an open passage and mutuall imputation, whereby sin &amp; wrath was conveyed to Christ from man, and merit and life conveyed from Christ to man, which seed of the holy Ghost figureth in us the Image of Christ slaine or crucified, in mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through a lively faith, and then reneweth in us the Image of God in holinesse and charitie; though both imperfectly and in degrees farre differing, even in Gods elect, as well in regard of the fire of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as of the illumination which is more or lesse in a large proportion, as namely in the Church before Christ, which yet neverthelesse was partaker of one and the same salvation with us.</p>
            <p>That the worke of the spirit though it be not tyed to any meanes in heaven or earth, yet it is ordinarily dispensed by the preaching of the word, administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, Covenants of the fathers upon the children, prayer, reading, the censures of the Church, societie of the godly, crosses and afflictions, Gods benefits, his Judgements upon others, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, &amp; the contemplation of his creatures, all which, though some be more principall and perpetuall, God useth as the means of vocation and conversion of his Elect, not derogating from his power to call imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by his grace, and at all hours and moments of the day (that is of mans life) according to his good pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101339:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>That the word of God, whereby his will is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, continued in revelation and tradition untill <hi>Moses,</hi> and that the Scriptures were from <hi>Moses</hi> time, to the times of the Apostles and Evangelists, in whose age, when after the comming of the holy Ghost, the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of all truth, they had delivered the tradition of Scripture, the book of the Scripture was shut &amp; closed, so as not to receive any new addition: And that the Church hath no power over the Scriptures, to teach or command any thing contrary to the written word, but is as the Arke wherein the tables of the first Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament were kept and preserved, that is to say, the Church hath onely the custody and delivery over of the Scriptures committed unto the same, together with the interpretation of them, but such onely as is conceived by themselves.</p>
            <p>That there is an universall or Catholicke Church of God dispersed over the face of the earth, which is Christs Spouse and body, being gathered of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the old world, of the Church of the Jewes, of the spirits of the faithfull dissolved, of the spirits of the faithfull militant, and of the names yet to be borne which are already written in the booke of life. That there is also a visible Church distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the outward workes of Gods Covenant, and the receiving of the holy Doctrine, with the use of the mysteries of God and the invocation and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his holy name, together with regeneration by his spirit. That there is also a holy succession in the Prophets of the new Testament, and Fathers of the Church from the time of the Apostles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, which saw our Saviour in the flesh, unto the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101339:7"/>
