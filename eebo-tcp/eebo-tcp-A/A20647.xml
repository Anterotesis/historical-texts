            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label>CHAP. III.</label>
               <item>That the Roman Religion doth by many erroneous doctrines mis-encourage and excite men to this vitious affectation of danger: first by inciting secular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy: Secondly by extolling the value of Merites, and of this worke in special, by which the treasure of the Church is so much aduanced: And lastly, by the doctrin of Purgatory, which by this act is said certainly to be escaped.</item>
               <label>CHAP. IIII.</label>
               <item>That in the Romane Church the Iesuits exceed all others, in their Constitutions and practise, in all those points, which beget or cherish this corrupt desire of false-Martyrdome.</item>
               <label>CHAP. V.</label>
               <item>That the Missions of the Pope, vnder Obedience whereof they pretend that they come into this Kingdome, can be no warrant, since there are laws established to the contrary, to giue them, or those which harbor them, the comfort of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyredome.</item>
               <label>CHAP. VI.</label>
               <item>A Comparison of the Obedience due to Princes, with the seuerall Obediences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and exhibited in the Romane Church: First, of that blinde Obedience and stupiditie, which Regular men vow to their Superiours: Secondly, of that vsurped Obedience to which they pretend by reason of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <label>CHAP. VII.</label>
               <item>That if the meere execution of the function of Priests in this Kingdome, and of giuing to the Catholiques in this land, spiritual sustentation, did assure their consciences, that to dye for that were martyrdome: yet the refusall of the Oath of Alleageance doth corrupt and vitiate the integrity of the whole act, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoile them of their former interest and Title to Martyrdome.</item>
               <label>CHAP. VIII.</label>
               <item>That there hath beene as yet no fundamental and safe ground giuen, vpon which
<pb facs="tcp:10519:5"/>
those which haue the faculties to heare Confessions, should informe their owne Consciences, or instruct their Penitents: that they are bound to aduenture the heauy and capitall penalties of this law, for refusall of this Oath. And that if any man haue receiued a scruple against this Oath, which he cannot depose and cast off, the Rules of their own Casuists, as this case stands, incline, and warrant them, to the taking therof.</item>
               <label>CHAP. IX.</label>
               <item>That the authority which is imagined to be in the Pope, as he is spiritual Prince of the monarchy of the Church, cannot lay this Obligation vpon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: First because the Doctrine it selfe is not certaine, nor presented as matter of faith: Secondly because the way by which it is conueyed to them, is suspitious and dangerous, being but by Cardinall Bellarmine, who is various in himselfe, and reproued by other Catholiques of equall dignity, and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</item>
               <label>CHAP. X.</label>
               <item>That the Canons can giue them no warrant, to aduenture these dangers, for this refusall: And that the Reuerend name of Canons, is falsly and cautelously insinuated, and stolne vpon the whole body of the Canon law, with a breefe Consideration vpon all the bookes thereof: and a particular suruay, of all those Canons, which are ordinarily cyted by those Authours, which maint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <label>CHAP. XI.</label>
               <item>That the two Breues of Paulus the fift, cannot giue this assurance to this Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; First, for the generall infirmities, to which all Rescripts of Popes are obnoxious: And then for certaine insufficiencies in these.</item>
               <label>CHAP. XII.</label>
               <item>That nothing requir'd in this Oath, violates the Popes spirituall Iurisdiction; And that the clauses of swearing that Doctrine to bee Hereticall, is no v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping vpon his spirituall right, either by preiudicating his future defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or offending any former Decree.</item>
               <label>CHAP. XIII.</label>
               <item>That all which his Maiesty requires by this Oath, is exhibited to the Kings of Fraunce, And not by vertue of any Indult, or Concordate, but by the inhaerent right of the Crowne.</item>
               <label>CHAP. XIIII.</label>
               <item>Lastly, That no pretence, eyther of Conuersion at first, Assistance in the Conquest, or Acceptation of any Surrender from any of our Kings, can giue the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more right ouer the Kingdome of England, then ouer any other free State whatsoeuer.</item>

For, as my fortune hath neuer beene so flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nor abundant, as should make this present life sweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to me, as I am a Moral man: so, as I am a Christian, I haue beene euer kept awake in a meditation of Martyrdome, by being deriued from such a stocke and race, as, I beleeue, no family, (which is not of farre larger extent, and greater branches,) hath endured and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more in their persons and fortunes, for obeying the Teachers of Romane Doctrine, then it hath done. I did not therefore enter into this, as a carnall or ouer-indulgent fauourer of this life, but out
<pb facs="tcp:10519:6"/>
of such reasons, as may arise to his knowledge, who shall be pleased to read the whole worke.</p>
            <p>In which, I haue abstained from handling the two last Chapters vpon diuers reasons; whereof one is, that these Heads hauing beene caried about, many moneths, and thereby quarrelled by some, and desired by others, I was willing to giue the Booke a hasty dispatch, that it might cost no man much time, either in expecting before it came, or in reading, when it was come.</p>
            <p>But a more principall reason was, that since the two last Chapters depend vpon one another, and haue a mutuall Relation, I was not willing to vndertake one, till I might perseuere through both. And from the last chapter it became me to abstaine, till I might vnderstand their purposes, who were formerly engaged in the same businesse. For the first Discouerie giues some title to the place, and secludes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without the Discouerers permission; And in men tender and iealous of their Honour, it is sometimes accounted as much iniurie to assist, as to assault.</p>
            <p>When therefore I considered, that the most Reuerend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Pleas (whom, they which are too narrow to comprehend him, may finde argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enow to loue, and admire, out of the measure and proportion of his malice who hath written agains<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him, (since wee ought to loue h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m so much, as such men hate him) had in this point of Iurisdiction, laid so solid foundations, raised so strong walls, &amp; perfited his house vpon so sure a Rocke, as the lawes of this Kingdome are. And when I saw, that as the diuell himselfe is busiest to attempt them, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in strength of Grace, (not forbearing our Sauiour himselfe) so an ordinary Instrument of his, (whose continuall libels, and Incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie bookes, haue occasioned more afflictions, and drawne more of that bloud, which they call Catholique, in this Kingdome, then all our Acts of Parliament haue done,) had oppugned his Lordships Booke, and iterated and inconculcated those his oppositions, I could not know whether his Lordship reserued any farther consideration of that matter to his owne leasures, or had honoured any other man, with his commandement, or allowance to pursue it. Till therefore I might know, whether any such were embarqued therein, as would either accept my Notes, and dignifie them with their stile, or submit their Notes to my method, and the poore apparell of my language, or vndertake it entirely, or quit it absolutely, as a body perfit alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by that forme which his Lordship hath giuen it, I chose to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare the handling thereof at this time.</p>
            <p>One thing more I was willing the Reader should be forewarned
<pb facs="tcp:10519:6"/>
of; which is, that when he findes in the printing of this Booke often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a change of the Character, hee must not thinke that all those words or sentences so distinguished, are cited from other Authors; for I haue done it sometimes, onely to draw his eye, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more intensly vpon that place, and so make deeper impressions thereof.</p>
            <p>And in those places which are cited from other Authors (which hee shall know by the Margine) I doe not alwayes precisely and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously binde my selfe to the words of the Authors; which was impossible to me, both because sometimes I collect their sense, and expresse their Arguments or their opinions, and the Resultance of a whole leafe, in two or three lines, and some few times, I cite some of their Catholique Authors, out of their owne fellowes, who had vsed the same fashion of collecting their sense, without precise bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues to All, or onely their words. This is the comfort which my conscience hath, and the assurance which I can giue the Reader, that I haue no where made any Author, speake more or lesse, in sense, then hee intended, to that purpose, for which I cite him. If any of their owne fellowes from whom I cite them, haue dealt otherwise, I cannot be wounded but through their sides. So that I hope either mine Innocence, or their own fellowes guiltinesse, shall defend me, from the curious malice of those men, who in this sickly decay, and declining of their cause, can spy out falsifyings in euery citation: as in a iealous, and obnoxious state, a Decipherer can pick out Plots, and Treason, in any familiar letter which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>And thus much it seemed necessary to mee, to let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der know, to whose charitable and fauourable opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I commit the booke, and my selfe to his Christianly and deuout Prayers.</p>

            <p>Those literall and punctuall Errors, which doe not much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the sense, I haue left to the discretion and fauour of the Reader, as he shall meete with them. The rest he may be pleased to mend thus.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 Now betwixt God and vs there is no such Couenant; our best plea is, The sinner must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and God will blotte out his sinnes. If a Prince should so farre prostitute his mercie, as to proclaime a veniall Pardon, by which for certaine money, any Malefactor might be pardoned, no such Malefactor as by the nature of his fault, had at that instant forfaited and confiscated all his estate, should haue benefite by that pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had nothing to giue. All these dis-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages and infirmities oppresse vs; no good worke is naturally large enough to reach heauen; no promise nor acceptation of God hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the nature of a good worke: And lastly, we can do no perfit good work; for originall sin hath poisoned the fountaines, our hearts: and those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and approaches, which we seeme to make towards good workes, are as if a condemned man would make a large will, to charitable vses. For, as that which hee giues is not his owne, so that goodnesse of good workes is not ours; and as it is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10519:70"/>
in the Princes pleasure and allowance, whether his will shall take any effect, or no; so is it in the pleasure of God, whether any workes of ours shal be accepted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Yet there is more Deuotion in our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of good works, then in that of the Romane Church, because wee teach as much necessity of them as they doe, and yet tye no reward to them. And we acknowledge, that God doth not onely make our faith, to fructifie and produce good workes as fruits thereof, but sometimes beginnes at our workes: and in a mans hart morally encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe good, dooth build vp faith: for if an Angell could transport <hi>Abacuc,</hi> for Gods seruice, by onely taking hold of his haire, God can take such holde of our workes, and carrie vs further by them.

For it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that vpon a Petition of a priuate Gentleman, for Legitimation of his Children, who doubted not of his power to doe it, the Pope would des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to a long discourse and proofe out of both testaments, and reasons of conueniencie, that he might doe it, and then in the end, tell him, hee would not, except hee meant, that this Letter should remaine as euidence to posteritie, what the Popes power in <hi>Temporall</hi> causes was.
