            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

men, he that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is accepted with him: Beware we (my dear brethren) leſt whiles we follow the chaſe of Zeal, we out-run charity, without which, piety it ſelf would be but unwelcome: As for matter of opinion in the differences of Religion, wherewith the whole known world, not of Chriſtians only, but of men, is wofully diſtracted, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of millions of ſouls, let this be our ſure rule.<note place="margin">Jude. 3.</note> Whoſoever he be that holds the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, agreeing therefore with us in all fundamentall Truths, let him be received as a brother: For there is but one Lord, one Faith, one<note place="margin">pheſ. 4. 5</note>

            <p>The Communion of Saints is not ſo ſleight that it ſhould be violated by weak miſtakings: If any man through ignorance or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, ſhall ſtrike at the foundation of faith, let us labour by all gentle means, and brotherly conviction, in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to
<pb facs="tcp:45597:8"/>
reclaim him: If after all powerfull indeavours he will needs remain, obſtinate in his evill way; let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his fellowſhip, and not think him worthy of a God-ſpeed. But if he ſhall not only wilfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ground-work of Chriſtian faith, by his own damnable opinions, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his hereticall blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies to the infection of others; let him be cut off by ſpirituall cenſures; and ſo dealt with by publick authority that the miſchief of his contagion may be ſeaſonably prevented, and himſelf be made ſenſible of his hainous crime.</p>
            <p>In all which proceedings, juſt diſtinction muſt be made betwixt the ſeduced ſoul,
<pb facs="tcp:45597:8"/>
and the peſtilent ſeducer, the one calls for compaſſion, the other, for ſeverity: So then my brethren let us pity and pray for all that have erred and are deceived; let us inſtruct the ignorant, convince the gainſaying, avoid the obſtinate, reſtrain the infectious, and puniſsh the ſelf-convicted hereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, let us, I beſeech you, take heed of beeing ſwayed with ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſts in all our deſigns: Theſe have ever been the bane of the beſt underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, as being not more plauſibly inſinnuative, then pernicious: For that partiall ſelf-love, that naturally lodges in every mans breſt, is ready to put us upon thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:45597:9"/>
projects, which, under fair pretences, may be extreamly prejudiciall to the publique weal; ſuggeſting not how lawfull or expedient they may be for the common, but how beneficiall to our ſelves; drawing us by inſenſible degrees to ſacrifice the publique welfare to our own advantage, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and croſs the better counſails of more faithfull patriots: Whereupon, many flouriſhing Churches, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, States, have been brought to miſerable ruine: Oh that we could remember, that as all things are ours, ſo we are not our own; that we have the leaſt intereſt in our ſelves, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more conſiderable as parts of a community, then
<pb facs="tcp:45597:9"/>
as ſingle perſons; that the main end of our beeing, (next to the glory of our maker) is an univerſall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſſe to others: in the attaining whereof, we ſhall far more eminently advance our own happineſs, then by the beſt of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſelf-ſeeking indeavors.</p>
            <p>But withall, it will be meet for us to conſider, that, as we are made to ſerve all, ſo only in our own ſtation: There can be no hope of a continued wel being without order: There can be no order without a due ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of degrees, and diverſity of vocations; and in vain ſhall divers vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

that which heightens the wonder of thy manifeſtation to men, is the depth of thine abaſement: Although thou wouldſt not take the nature of Angels, yet why wouldſt thou not appear in the luſtre and majeſty of thoſe thy beſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

thy mercy, that being upon earth, thou wouldeſt abandon all earthly glory; there could not be ſo great an exaltation of thy love to mankinde, as that thou wouldſt be thus low aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; Manifeſted then thou wert, but manifeſted in a deſpicable obſcurity: whether ſhall I more wonder, that being God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever, thou wouldſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man; or, that condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to be man, thou wouldſt take upon thee the ſhape of a ſervant, a ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to thoſe whoſe Lord, whoſe God thou wert.</p>

that the infinite Deity, and finite fleſh ſhould meet in one ſubject? yet ſo, as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſhould not be abſorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Godhead; nor the Godhead coarcted by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, but both inſeparably united; that the Godhead is not humanized, the humanity is not deifred, both are indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conjoyned: conjoined ſo, as without confuſion; diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſo, as without diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So wert thou, O God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh, that thou the word of thine eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wert made fleſh; and dwelledſt among us; and we<note place="margin">Job. 1. 14</note> men beheld thy glory, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth; Yet ſo wert thou made fleſh as not by converſion into fleſh, but as by aſſumption of fleſh to thine eternall Deity: aſſumption, not into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Godhead, but into the perſon of thee, who art

            <p>What then, O Saviour, was the ſtrengthening which thou receivedſt from this officious ſpirit in this pang of thine ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?

And may thy poor ſervants warfairing and wandring here upon earth, ever ſecond them in thoſe heavenly ſongs of praiſes and gratulations: for wherein ſtands all our ſafety, hope, comfort, happineſſe, but in this, that thou our Jeſus art received up into glorie? and having conquered all adverſe powers, ſitteſt on the right hand of God the Farher, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with honour and majeſty?
