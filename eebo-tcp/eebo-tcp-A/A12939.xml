         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He blessed apostle S. Paul (good Chri

               <hi>There must be heresies, to the

In which waighty and graue prediction of the
Apostle two things I see especially to be notised. The
one for our comfort, the other for our instruction.
For our comfort it is, that we be not dismaied or ouer
much offended when we see in the holy profession
of our Christen religion, heresies, sectes, and schismes
to arise: that we forsake not therefore the field of our
faith.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Wherin we warfare to god and ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne not as at an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain

ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to obtaine, and fight to winne</hi> the reward: that we let
not go the holdfast of our hope <hi>Which we hold as the
sure and stedfast anchor of our soule:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.</note> but rather with the
patience of Abraham,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
               <hi>We beleue in hope contrary to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi>
continuing and cleauing stedfastly to the rocke
of oure faith, against the which, <hi>Hel gates shall neuer
preuaile.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> For as we see by the verdit of the Apostle,
<hi>There must be heresies.</hi> It is now sithen the time that the
Apostle spake these wordes a thousand fiue hundred
and odde yeares, Yet neuer was there aage sence that
time but that in some part of Christendom heresies
<pb facs="tcp:18354:3"/>
haue ben sturring. In the very first ofspring of the

howe from age to age heresies being alwaies cutte of
and destroied haue yet spronge vp again and flouris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed
for a season as the venimous heades of Hydra. I
remitt you (to auoide prolixite) to the writinges of

forthe in tables seuerally the Popes and supreme
vicars of Christ, the Emperours, the generall and
prouinciall councels, the heresies of al times, haue in
no time nor age left vs bare the leafe of the heresies.
The figure of this calamite in Christes church we
see to haue gone before in the lawe of Moyses. For
at what time the children of Israel had by the mighty
hand of god entred in to the land of promis, chased
oute Idolaters and were setled in quiet possession, yet
god of a iust indignation conceiued against them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:18354:3"/>
               <hi>those Idolaters out before them, to the entent they might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
them as enemies amonge them, and their gods should be as
asnare vnto them.</hi> And thereby the children of Israel
were tried as now the Christians are, they by Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
we by heretikes. Though therefore his our
present time be so entangled with schismes, seuered
in sundry sectes, and embrued with hainous heresies
as neuer at any time sence the first preaching off the
ghospel: Yea and though it haue so ouerrunne the
small plat of Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dom that remaineth, as euer any
heresy did (except that of the Arrians) yet bicause we
see the holy ghost suffreth it so to be, and warneth vs
by the mouthe of the Apostle that is behoueth so to
be, we must yelde to the prouidence of almighty god.
and saie with the prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> 
               <hi>We haue sinned with
our forefathers.</hi> Yea thousand fold more then oure fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refathers,
and therefore no maruaile if the dreadfull

            </p>
            <p>An other lesson in the wordes of the Apostle for
our instruction is this, that heresies therefore are suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fred
to be, to the entent that they which are perfect
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vs might be knowen. For by heresies the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
as gold by the fire is tried, and as the riuer or sea

her,<note place="margin">The duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sten man in time of heresy.</note> the sounde and faithful remaining vnder her rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
and abiding in the receaued faith and belefe. For in
time of schismes and heresies the part of euery good
Christen man is, to do as the good souldyars in the
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe when a ciuil seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ariseth, or as the quiet passan
ger when the sea stormeth: for euen as the true and
faithfull souldyars in such a case runne all vnto their
Capitain and General, looking to be of him dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
where, howe, and when to strike, and as the wise
and sober passanger when the tempest and storme
disordreth the passage, suffreth quietly the master to
rule the sterne, medling not with that he hath no
skill of: right so when preuy rebells or open apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statas
of Christen religion sowe seditious schismes
and preache hereticall doctrine, troubling thereby
the quiet and settled consciences of true and vpright
beleuers, euery Christen man, especially such as are
of the laye and inferiour sorte, ought to cleaue vnto
their heades and rulers in Christ his church medling
not with the determination of any point called then
in controuersy: but looke to be directed as they haue

of false and wrong interpretation of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which is no lesse necessary then the reading off
scripture it selfe, secondarely detecteth certain false
translations of the Bible by Luther in to his mother

trusting in almighty God to profit hereby many

<pb facs="tcp:18354:6"/>

               </gap> in greke and <hi>presbiter</hi> in laten, they turne

may be younge, but the priest may be only an elder.
And these men marke not that this worde <hi>priest</hi> is

which two languages we (as in thousands of other

allwaies <hi>congregation,</hi> and that of a very wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
meaning thereby to disanull the authorite and
estimation of Christes churche, making it to be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
peltinge congregation of priuat heretikes: or as iff
that which we call the churche, were nought els but
the stones and morter it is made of. But as touching
the corrupted text of our common translation nowe
vsed, it is beside our purpose to make any speciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
thereof: and in our Discours we shal haue occasion
to specify some other places of more importaunce:
As for these false and hereticall foistinges of <hi>Luther</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18354:7"/>
here noted by <hi>Staphylus,</hi> though in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of our countre (thanked be God) they are not
readen, (one excepted) which when I come to the
place, I shall in the margin note you, yet it may serue
to the Lutherans of oure countre for a most euident
argument of the sprit of Antichrist speaking in Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of a wicked and detestable archeheretike.
For what is more conuenient for Antichrist, or more
proper for an archeheretike, then to corrupt gods ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
worde, and geue vs in stede of it, his owne poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and hereticall worde? Neither may the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
of oure conntre thinke that this toucheth
not them. For they are of Luthers broode no lesse
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other: Beside that their master, Caluin, is not
behind hand for his part, as in our Discourse we shal
by occasion declare vnto youe in diuers textes and
passages of holy scripture by him corrupted.</p>
            <p>The third part of the booke is an euident and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
detection of the abhominable schismes of these
protestans (what soeuer smothe countenaunces they
beare to the world) not only profitable for the laye
and vnlerned common people, but right worthy to
be read, waighed and considered of the rulers and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher
powres: to the entent that seing euidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes the horrible schismes, diuision, and
disordre, that these protestants haue caused in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
and do foster vp and brede daily, where
they may haue their full swaie and course, they may
thinke vpon some spedy remedy for the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vnite and agrement amonge them, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18354:7"/>
church of Christ from whence they haue parted.
And truly by the example of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion in Germa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
(where heresy hath had his free course in a state
of liberty these fourty yeares and more) we may see
as in a glasse the like inconueniences to be feared
amonge vs, if it should continew many yeares (which
God of his tender mercy forbid) as also it would ere
this haue showed it selfe amonge our protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts at ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me,
if worldly policy had not refrained their vnruly
liberty.<note place="margin">Disagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in doctrine among our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testans.</note> And yet amonge the pretended bishops of ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
countre it is well knowen that some allowe the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
of priesthood, as the ciuill Lutherans do at Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,
some preache openly that all men and we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are priestes, as the Illyricans do in Saxony and
all the flocke of the zelous Lutherans. Againe some
in the matter of the blessed Sacrament are very Zuin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glians,
as the Apologie and their articles at the laste
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocation declare: some yet and that not the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
starres of the realme,<note place="margin">Caunter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury. Chi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chester. Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. Roche<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster.</note> are in that point Lutherans,
as the trouble of certain of them after the ende off
the last parlement witnesseth. Notwithstanding (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the counsell of Melanchthon in his boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
against <hi>Fridericus Staphylus</hi> they pretend outwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly
agrement and vnite amonge them selues, to the
ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that like the people of <hi>Creta</hi> (whereof such pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testans

ioyned force sett vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon aduersaries the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pistes,
and ouercome them the sooner. The late sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
abhominable booke of <hi>Bernardinus Ochinus</hi>
the Apostata, Peter Martirs companyon lately prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

may geue vs to vnderstand, what ioyly newe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
and heresies the scholers of Peter Martir which
are not fewe, nor of the basest sorte in our countre,
woulde plant and preach amonge vs, were it not that
matters being not yet ripe, nor thouroughly settled,
they were like to marre all the game, if they kept
not wel their countenaunces. Where in they folowe
wel and wisely the counsell of <hi>Nicolaus Amsdorffius,</hi>
which he writeth in his booke entituled <hi>Publica co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio

In the which complaining that <hi>Brentius</hi> and
the masters of Wittenberg being at a conference and
diet helde at <hi>Wormes</hi> would not condemne <hi>Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and <hi>Osiander</hi> whose doctrine vtterly repugneth to
their Confession of Augspurg,<note place="margin">In the ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are. 1557.</note> he writeth these wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.
<hi>In this doing they haue departed from the Confession of
Augspurg although they pretend to remaine in it, they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
caused dissension and taken away all meanes of agrement,
for if they would (as we doe) condemne the errours of Zuinglius
and Osiander, then might we al agre together against the papi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes.</hi>
These be the very wordes of <hi>Nicolaus Amsdorfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
a famous Superintendent amonge the Lutherans
well and truly obserued of our protestant preachers
and Ministers. And is this the pure worde of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
so to beare two or rather twenty faces in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18354:8"/>
semeth in this newe religion an apparent vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
of doctrine, yet they vary not only amonge
them selues, as we haue before touched, but also
from their owne doinges. The order of communion
now practised in England differeth as much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do from the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> and as
the <hi>Illyricans</hi> do now from the <hi>Melanchthonistes.</hi> For
the first bothe allowed the real presence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
as Luther did, and vsed also many olde cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Christ his church as the <hi>Melanchthonistes,</hi>
and the ciuil Lutherans do yet in <hi>Wittenberg</hi> in <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
in <hi>Franconia,</hi> at <hi>Norimberg,</hi> at <hi>Vlmes</hi> (where pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by of late we sawe in the churche the holy Roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and aultars of stone yet standing) in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> at <hi>Breslaw</hi> at <hi>Briga</hi> in <hi>Silesia</hi> and
in many other places. The last and present order off

Cantons of Suitzerland <hi>Basil, Zurich, Berna, Schafusa</hi>
and <hi>Clarona,</hi> at Geneua in Sauoye, in Scotland and
emong the seditious rebelles in Fraunce. Now Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it is to be sene. By the iudgement then of Luther,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:9"/>
of Melanchthon, and of all the ciuill Lutherans, yea
and by the iudgement of all the ghospellers in Kinge
Edwardes time, and of the stinking martirs of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
our communion now practised in England is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,
and against the pure doctrine fo the ghospel.
It were ouer long to recite here all the variaunces in
doctrine amonge our protestants. I remitt you to the
daily experience which you may see better at home
then we which are abrode. And thus much of the

as we be called in to one hope and vocation? For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is but one lorde, one faith, one baptim, one God, and fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
of all, that we hence forth be no more children wauering
and caried aboute with euery winde of doctrine by the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes

for their right in temporall traihe, in worldly
commodites and present pleasures, which we haue
renounced in our baptim, which with care being
gotten with sorow is kept, and yet soone loste, and
how colde, negligent, and careles we are, aboute
the true and sincere worshipping of God, which we
haue promised and professed in our baptim, and
which only hath his sure, certain, and euerlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.
We spare no labour, no coste, no trauail for the

            <p>As touching the Author of this booke <hi>Fridericus
Staphylus,</hi> in his life time (for within these fewe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
he departed the worlde to the great grief of all
good men) he was a vertuous, lerned, and wise, Noble
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. His vertu wel appereth not only in the ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of gods worde and the truthe, for the setting forth
of the which, he toke such trade of life as bothe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
much the helth of his body, and procured also
greatiosse of his substaunce (as he writeth in the first
part of this worke) but also in the great patience and
modesty that he vsed alwaies against his aduersaries
writing pasquils, libels, and famous epigrams, against
him, calling him <hi>Iudas,</hi> runneagat, traitour and so
forth (as the modesty of this new ghospel vseth) by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he forsoke their abhominable heresies after
a thourough knowledge of them, and detected their
iuggling deceites to al the worlde as especially he doth
in this worke folowing. And this only were they able
to obiect against him, which declareth well the inno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy and vprightnes of his life, For as herein they spa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
no kinde of rethorike to exaggerat his departing
from them (which was a singular grace of God and
most in him to be commended) so if they had had bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
matter, it should not haue lacked the telling on
their part. <hi>Smidelinus,</hi> one that of all other to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
shame and ignominy toke vppon him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with <hi>Staphylus</hi> labouring to fasten vppon

he had thereby raught him a great rappe. Which how

that his most aduersary could laie no greuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

            <p>
               <hi>His lerning well appeareth in this and other his
workes as in his Absolut apology, his epistles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
against</hi> Melanchthon, Flaccus, <hi>and other: where
he showeth him selfe no lesse lerned Diuin, then elo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quent
oratour and expert of the tongues. But of his
education in lerning and prospering in the same, of
what estimation also he was amonge the protestants
them selues yow shall vnderstand by his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
being forced to declare the same by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
reproches of Smidelinus his aduersary. In his
Absolut apology write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the yeare 1562. thus he wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth.</hi>
Whereas Smidelinus obiecteth to me that I was Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Melanchthons scholer, I denie it not, for I liued in
the vniuersite of wittenberg ten yeares of my owne costes
and charges studying there vnder Luther, Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chthon and
others. At that time also being a younge man rash and vns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilfull,
I was infected somwhat with the poisonnous doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of Luther. Howbeit that was not so rooted in me, but
that it was soone driuen out again. And that I neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb facs="tcp:18354:12"/>
thoroughly to the fifte ghospell of Luther, many thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
do euidently proue. First that whereas the Masters off
Wittenberg would nedes persuade me to procede Doctour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
them,<note place="margin">Staphylus refuseth to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the othe.</note> I would neuer do it. And that only bicause I
would not take the othe of the vniuersite and make open con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession
of my belefe in that place. And this Doctour George
Maior who yet liueth can beare me witnes of. Secondarely
bicause I would neuer take vppon me the Lutheran Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
in any church: though fewe yeares past I haue ben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of certain Princes to high dignites: as to be Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent
in sondry places: as at Augspurg, at Lubeck and at
Brunsuick. Thirdly this may declare how litle I fancyed
in my hart the doctrine of Luther, that being called and cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen
of the Duke of Prussia to be a Reader in his dominions
(at Coningsberg) and a Counseller, I caused in the write of
my stipend this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition expresly to be put that I would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelled
to no religion or doctrine that in any point repugned
with the doctrine of the primitiue, Catholike, and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
church, and of this my condition I am able to show iff
nede shall require sufficient testimonies. <hi>By these wordes
ye may see off what reputation and opinion of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and vertu this man was at Wittenberg, Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spurg,
Lubeck and Brunsuick the most famous cytes
of the Lutheran profession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and other noble qualites he well decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
first in the seruice of a counseller to the Duke of
<note place="margin">Indefensio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne contra Musculum</note> Prusia from whome he was forced to depart and
that (as he writeth) to the losse of some thousands
of marks, bicause like a worthy and faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller
he frely aduertised eftsones the Duke to bewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18354:12"/>
of the cursed heresies of <hi>Osiander</hi> and his felowes.
Secondarely in the like seruice vnder the Catholike
and vertuous Duke of Bauaria, vnder whom he was
in such credit that he was made ouerseer and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncelour
of the vniuersite of Ingolstad iointly with
the Bishop of Eistat. Thirdely for his wisedom, ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and vertu he was of longe time and many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
Counseller to the late most worthy Emperoure
<hi>Ferdinandus.</hi> vnder whom he hath done noble serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
as well in the diets and conferences in Germany
as in embassages of Liflande, Pole, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres.</p>
            <p>As for the great labour, and diligence he besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
to shift him selfe oute of the captious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
controuersies of this time (wherein he was
nouseled in his youth) it may wel appeare in that (as
he writeth in the first part of this booke) <hi>He emploied
only the study of Diuinite and matters of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie about
two and twenty yeares: not medling in all that time with
any worldly or ciuill matter.</hi> And what thinck you
after so many yeares study and labour, after so great
experience and lerning, was the chiefest argument
and reason whereuppon he forsoke the Lutherans
and claue vnto the Catholikes? forsoth he declareth
it in the very same place last alleaged: and it is right
worthy to be noted. <hi>This</hi> saieth he, <hi>was the chief and
principal cause why</hi> I <hi>acto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted the diuers doctrine of Luther
and his felowes to be hereticall and for such do vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi>
               <note place="margin">VVhy Sta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phylus forsoke the Luthe rans.</note>
               <hi>it and detest it, this again is the cause why I esteme the
doctrine in all Christendom (which they call the Popedom)
<pb facs="tcp:18354:13"/>
receiued, to be the only true and holesom doctrine, bicause this
doctrine is the Catholike and vniuer sally receiued interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of holy scripture, but their doctrine is only their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat
opinion and their priuat deprauation of holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi>
This lowas the principall reason that drew this
wise, lerned and vertuous man from the sectes of his
Masters, Luther and Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and brought him ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
to the perfect vnite of the Catholike faith. for he
sawe by lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that al the doctrine of the new
ghospellers, was nought els but their owne traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
their propre inuentions, and priuat imaginations: for
ging vpon the worde of God such sence as them lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and telling then the people that the same was the
very worde of God: whereas the Catholikes folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
such sence and meaning of the writen worde
as by the lerned fathers, continual tradition, and vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersall
consent of Christendom was receaued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
And truly this only reason may be sufficient
bothe for the vnlerned and deceaued protestants to
reduce them home again to the Catholike churche
of Christ, and to kepe also within the same such as
by the grace of God, vertuous education, and good
instructions haue not yet swarued from the same.
Which I beseche almighty God it may so do.</p>
            <p>And thus much hitherto of this present Treatise
and the author thereof. Many other things there are
which I would gladly aduertise the Reader of. But
bicause we haue (I feare) ben ouerlong allready and

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18354:13"/>
I wil here breake of, and after the ende of the
Authors whole discourse, put for conclusion the rest
of my meaning, aduertising in the meane season
the reader of this one thing, that this our labour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

deliberation by trouble of time was defeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
constrained, not as I would but as I was forced,
to yelde to necessite, and therefore must omitte the

occupied, and in the principall by the waye to
be doing, I haue not suffred suche leasure as at times
happened, to passe withoute some frute of publicke
commodite. Whereof hauing longe thought, it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

me, I coulde not by the waie more profitably be
doing then if (at what time other plaie or banquet) I
laboured vppon some such thing as might enforme
the poore deceaued people, and not offend rulers and
magistrats. And to this ende truly, these darke win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dayes as leasure serued me, I haue compiled this
booke, framing my stile after a rude and simple sorte,
that the vnlearned might vnderstande me, but letting
passe no iote of the truthe, to cure and remedy the

heretikes being spredd so farre and so diuersly in
Christendom, that the vnlerned can not comprise
them and the lerned scant espie them, it shall be inou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ghe

to do their duty to God, and of the ciuill or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
magistrat to learne their duty to their prince, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18354:15"/>
in all thinges rather to lerne then to teache, rather to
obey then to commaunde.</p>
            <p>For these two estates the spirituall and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
haue of God him selfe ben ordained, duly rece<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aued
of vs, confirmed and established by lawes: and
haue serued vs as two walles by the which the power
of the Romain empire hath ben in Germany stayed
vp and continued all most these eight hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
And truly as longe as matters appertaining to
God were by the spiritualty, and the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
by the temporalty gouuerned, and the lawes off
bothe estates ordained were inuiolatly obserued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Germany might contend in wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the grekes,
in stoutnes of courage with the Romanes, in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines

            <l>By auncient lawes and men doth stande</l>
            <l>Thestate of Germany and Allemain lande.</l>
            <p>Then it could, when lawes ruled men, not men the
lawes maintaine peace abrode, and reste at home: kepe
out their enemie valiantly and gouuerne their people
in all felicite.</p>
            <p>But Satan not abiding the repos of this countre,
stirred vp <hi>Martin Luther</hi> a German borne, pricked
him with furious rage: and draue him so forwarde,
that he ouerthrew all auncient lawes, by the which
this Empire hitherto hath staied and continued: and
placed for them newe by the which it should perishe
and fall. <hi>Luther</hi> iolted and enraged by this rider Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
began with a fury to set vpon the two saide wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb facs="tcp:18354:16"/>
of the empire, and in shorte time, as well by his bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tering
the walles were sore beaten, as by the sounde
slepe of the rulers the warde and watche was forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
And that in such sorte, vntel one of the walles,
the Spiritualty, was vtterly ouerthrowen: the other,
the Temporalty, was put in greate hazarde: For so it
proueth in dede. when that (as the poete saieth)</p>

            <l>But asketh the Gods to cure the desease.</l>
            <p>But this negligence being ones committed and done
it can not nowe be vndone: Yet although of thinges
past we haue the remembraunce only, consultation
or deliberation we haue none, truly I can not forget
with what a perpetuall ignominie and shame we are
to be noted, that coulde suffer a lewd frier, and that
neither craftely cladde in his shepes cote, neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
lerned, to worcke so foule and so pernicious
a mischef against all Christendom, that hauing first
all most ouerthrowen the Spiritualty, he hath so
shaken and weakened also the Temporalty, that it se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
rather already fallen downe then liekely to
fall.</p>
            <p>But what entry made Luther? Howe began he to
ouerthrowe these two estates? His beginning was
surely vaine and foolish, and stuffed all with lies.
<hi>The principles and growndes</hi> (saieth he) <hi>of the papistes are the
traditions of men not expressed in holy write, the pope of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
doubting and vncertainte of the grace of god.</hi> But who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18354:16"/>
saieth this? Luther euery where. What witnes hath
he? Ihon Brentius in his booke <hi>of the causes of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
But howe proueth he it to be trewe? for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason forsothe but for that Luther is (as he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth)
an Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist, and Brentius is an other S. Ihon. I
thinke the thirtenth Apostle. But as for these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or groundes, there was neuer Catholike that so
much as dreamed them. so farre is it that any man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
them or defended them.</p>
            <p>The true principles of Diuinite with vs are and
haue allwayes ben these.<note place="margin">The prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples of the catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> first <hi>the worde of God</hi> to wit
the doctrine of the prophets and the Apostles, and
brefely al the holy Scripture whiche we call the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The seconde principle is <hi>the right and Catholike sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
and vnderstanding of tbe worde of God</hi> deliuered by
the Apostles to their successours and by them spred
through the whole worlde, declared also in many
Councels of the holy fathers and brought in to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
For this Catholike exposition of the holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
bicause it was deliuered vnto the Apostles by
Christ him selfe, and by them left vnto their lawfull
successours with the very text of the scripture, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called the Tradition of the holy
fathers, and oftentimes, the vnwriten verite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the writen texte. And bicause the truthe off
the text and of the right vnderstanding of the texte
must nedes be all one, truly our aduersaries do slaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
vs, fayning that in triall off co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies we woul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
beside the worde of God sett as iudge the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of men directly against the worde of God.
<pb facs="tcp:18354:17"/>
The third principle is that <hi>holy continuall succession
of the See Apostolike and other bishops in the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che.</hi>
For if we be able to proue by order of continuall
succession that all bishops as well before vs as nowe
haue allwaies expounded the holy scriptures euen as
the first Apostles did, can there be any more certain
waye for the vnderstanding of scripture then this is?
I would gladly heare what can be saied against it.
The fourthe principle is <hi>the vnite and consent of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
churche,</hi> Whereby it is made that the like truthe
be in euery part that is in the whole, and so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise. These are (moste Reuerend Prelate) the right
principles of Christian doctrine: these are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of all truthe: these as foure quarres or corner
stones holde vp the Catholike churche: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called <hi>One, Holy, Catholike, and Apostolike chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che.</hi>
For of these principles dependeth the Authorite
of the councels. Of these the holy Canons haue the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
beginning: and of these, all laufull and laudable
rites of the church take force and strength.</p>
            <p>These then being the principles of our religion,
not those which <hi>Brentius</hi> falsely chargeth vs withal,
Princes and rulers ought to looke more nerer vnto
the doings and sayings of their preachers. But nowe
<hi>Bretius</hi> to make an oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the foresaide forged
principles, <hi>our principles are</hi> (saieth he) <hi>the worde of God,
Christ, and an assured certainte of oure confidence in Christ,</hi>
But what is I praie you, this your worde of God?
This it is, that all maner of folke, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and coblers, baudes and buchers, tinkers and tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18354:17"/>
pedlers and poticaries, minstrels and mummers,
and all such like, be priestes, be bishops, be doctours,
and pastours, and haue authoritie to administrat the
Sacraments, to interpret Scripture, and what interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
eche one by the drifte of his braine draweth
out of scripture, that to be the pure ghospell off the
Lorde, and the expresse worde of God. This is not
(right Reuerend father) the worde of God, but the
worde of the diuell him selfe, inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of Luther, not
inspired by the sprit of God. For that man entending
to peruert all that appertained to God or to man,
laboured, trauailed and endeuoured by al meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sible,
that there might remaine no spirituall magistrat
whiche might by authorite <hi>discerne betwene leper
and leper,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 13.</note> maintaining the right doctrine of the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
and remouing the bastard. And this labour of
Luther being well liked of Sathan, he imagined an
other worde of God, as <hi>that among Christen men shoulde
be no ciuill magistrat: for all princes were fooles tyrans and men
of no religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his boo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke de secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</note> to thentent that, if perhaps the heresies
of Luther were condemned by the Spirituall magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
and so forth with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the secular sworde
princes therunto might haue no authorite. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<hi>he forbiddeth Christen men to kepe warre against the Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke,</hi>

               <hi>and commaundeth subiects to rebel against their princes.</hi>
Strait vppon this arose an other worde of an other
God, that all lawes of chaste and single life shoulde
be taken awaye, teaching amonge a sorte of maydes
and yonge men that <hi>Man was no more able to refraine his
fleshly lustes then not to spet when nature prouoked.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In lib. de Matrimo.</note> Againe
<pb facs="tcp:18354:18"/>

               <hi>nothing furdered deuotion made nothing to sobriete.</hi>
These smaller pointes being first all most conquered,
he reacheth to higher and diuiner matters. First bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he teacheth that <hi>sinne is not by the grace of baptime
taken away in dede,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad Leone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
               <hi>but is saide and fained only to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
hereof he savve it vvolde folovve that <hi>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oughte not

               <hi>but onely accompted and
imputed for such.</hi> Then bycause he made no difference
nor degre of grace, he admitted no encrease in vertu,
and therefore could not abide the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
Fardermore bicause if sinne be not rooted
out if there be no encrease of grace nor goodnes, but
al is only by maner of acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte and imputing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must
he also infer, <hi>that the presence of Christes body may not be in
earthe, that no sacrifice be admitted, and</hi> (vvhich folovved
thereupon) <hi>no priesthood nether.</hi> And of this point the
Zuinglians picked out one worde of their straunge
God and the Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s an other. of this spring also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
the doctrine teaching ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be iustified by only
faith: hope, charite, repentaunce and other good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
being pernicious and hurtefull to saluation. what
frute then thinke you proceded hereof? This sothely
and many other.<note place="margin">Caluin in his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</note> For if God doth compell man
to sinne, as Luther and the Caluinistes do write, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
can God require good workes or by what lawe
can be punish sinne, seing that he worketh sinne in
vs, and good workes are thought to be pernicious?
And truly if there be no rewarde for vertu there shall
be no punishment for sinne. And then there is no hel
nor place of punishment: as in the seacoste townes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18354:18"/>
of Germany it is taught: there is no diuell to execute
that punishment as Osiander teacheth.</p>

Christ ensued: as that the humain nature of
Christe is god, as the Swenckfeldians will haue it, or

teache and Mathias Flaccius,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> affirming that <hi>the worde</hi>
in the first of Iohn is not the sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Lo how fertill and abundant was this principle
of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Brentius.</hi> There were in times past and
are also nowe a dayes whiche openly denie Christ
to be the son of God: affirming him to be the son of
Ioseph and Mary. Which Mary also had (as they saye)
many other children beside Christ. Other there be
nowe which teache the ghospell of S. Iohn to be a
tale of Plato, baptim to be the inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuell.
And that there is not in God the Trinite of persons,
some other doubting whether this Trinite be man
or woman. So taught euen this winter a certayn new
ghospeller in <hi>Sternberg</hi> a towne of Morauia,<note place="margin">Detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning the Blessed Trinite.</note> and
that with the fauour of the people, but much against
the will of the Bishop of <hi>Omoluke</hi> their diocesian.
There be nowe in Hungary also, which in their bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tim
leaue out cleane the name of the Son. There be
in many places the Seruetians, which call the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinite by the name of the hellhownd Cerberus
whom the poetes fained to haue thre heads. With li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
horrible blasphemies two other ghospellers daily
preache, the one in the hilles of Gutni, the other in
<pb facs="tcp:18354:19"/>
               <hi>Zary</hi> a village of <hi>Silesia.</hi> In <hi>Pintzou</hi> a towne of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone
<hi>George Brandat</hi> and <hi>Peter Statorius</hi> teache o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
that there is not one, but thre Gods, and eche
of them of diuers and distinct natures no lesse then
thre diuers men. So that there is not one substaunce
of the godhed but thre, and thre different operations
thre diuers willes. And that the Son is lesse then the
father. As for the crede of Athanasius that it ought
rather be called the crede of Sathanasius the diuell
him self. And these felowes <hi>Brandat</hi> and <hi>Statorius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admonished of such blasphemous doctrine, and
required by what authorite or whose persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they

were moued thereunto first by the authorite of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
of wolfgangus Musculus, of Peter Martyr of Bul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linger
and such like masters, then by the euidence of
the holy truthe, which hitherto hath layen hidd and

            <p>But bicause this parted confusion of so diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

or discerned of such as gladly receaue al nouelties,<note place="margin">Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in Bohem teache the soule to die vvith the body.</note>
there is vpsterte this very winter in Bohem a newe
Secte. The which to take awaye this confusion, and
to sett forthe a brefe and compendiouse waie of the
Lutheran doctrine, teacheth openly and affirmeth,
<hi>that all other opinions and doctrine of God, of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18354:19"/>
worshipping of God, of faith, of good or euill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and to be short of any saluation of man, be but
olde wyues tales and fonde inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. This onely to

            <p>The third principle of the Lutheran ghospell is,

that certainte of faith which for the clerenes and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence

consent and maruaylous agreement ioyned together
the Lutherans, that in all their new ghospell no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension
can be founde, no variaunce in any article of
their faythe, no heresyes at all in their doctrine may
be espied. For if constant certaynte bredeth true con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corde
and agreement (as a certain philosopher witte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reporteth) then surely vncertainte and wauering
in opinions muste nedes brede strife. Hereof then we
may clerely gather howe trew this thirde principle
of Luther is: for such is the certaynte of their faithe
as the agreement of their opinions is. The whiche

howe greate and of what maner it is, they haue them

are the principles of the reformed ghospell laied by
Luther, repeted by Bre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, and admitted of the who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
swarme of sectaries. Nowe bicause in the principle
all is contained and many labels depend thereof,
what roufe thinke yow will the diuell buyld vppon
these foundations of Luther? For the effect neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>celleth

to haue ben deriued from the Apostles and so re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaued

agreeth wel that Noble and wise Emperour <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius,</hi>
the first, who in this very question of vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
chose for iudge in that controuersie the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholike
and receaued interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy scripture.
For thus we reade in the ecclesiastical historie of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
of one <hi>Sisinnius</hi> who gaue the Emperour this
councell to aswage the greate contentions that were
then in the church, through that heresie of <hi>Arrius.</hi>
This <hi>Sisinius</hi> was,<note place="margin">Socrates. li. 5. cap. 10. Sozomenus li. a. ca. 17 Nicephor. libro. 12. Cap. 15.</note> as <hi>Socrates</hi> writeth, an eloquent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
a man of much experience, very well sene in the olde
writers expounding holy scripture and a good philo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sopher.
This man therefore perceauing that by dispu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tations
and conferences with heretikes, the schisme

<hi>Nectarius</hi> then Patriarche of Constantinople in

them (if they dare) condemne and anathematise them. If they
so do, the very people will ouerrunne them. And so truthe
shall ouer come. But yf they do not repell the olde doctours, it
shall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be our part to bring forth their sayengs, and by their
testimonies confirme our doctrine.</hi> This being tolde of
<hi>Sisinius, Nectarius</hi> goeth forth with vnto the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
and declareth vnto the Emperour the aduise off
Sisinius. who liking it very well, and going wisely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
the matter, called the heretikes before him, and
dissembling his purpose demanded them only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they made any accompt of the Doctours of the
church which liued before their heresie began or no.
They not reiecting those writers but calling them
their masters and fathers, the Emperour asketh them
againe whether they woulde admit them as worthy
witnesses of the Christen faith. The chief masters
of that heresie, hearing those wordes, doubted much
what they might answer. Whereuppon they striued
amonge them selues, some thinking the Emperour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
wel, some mistrusting the issue of his demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and perceauing they made litle for their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
For they were not all of one minde touching the
writinges of the olde fathers, differing in that point
not only from other religions, but also from them sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues
who professed all one religion. Thus their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
doctrine was discouered and confounded, as the
buylders of Babel by their variaunce in language. For
<pb facs="tcp:18354:25"/>
the emperour preceauing their disagrement, and seing
they trusted only vpon contentious disputing, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
not the exposition of olde writers,<note place="margin">Olde here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tikes dispi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers as our protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts novv.</note> he toke an
otherwaie with them commaunding that eche reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
should in writing shortly comprise the effect of
their doctrine and opinion. Thus farre the history of
Socrates. That Sisinius though good not to dispute
with heretikes, it was not his first deuise. The holy
canons had commaunded the same.<note place="margin">In pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</note> Tertullian and
other holy fathers had writen the same.</p>
            <p>And the cause why they thinke it not expedient
to trie by disputation matters of our faith is,<note place="margin">vvhy it be houeth not to dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute vvith heretikes.</note> that all
heretikes do vtterly take away the true principles off
Christen religion, which are the sure groundes off
good disputation, and place in their stede false and
forged which are all vncertain: and maye serue (as we
see in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting) sometime for more, sometime for les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
sometime nothing at all. For he that taketh away
the generall and the whole, howe can he be sure of
the partes? Or if ye denie the substance, to what
purpose were it to dispute of the accident? To none
at all. Therefore he that listeth dialectically and scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
like to reason with an heretike, if he agree not first
with him for the principles, he shall fight he woteth
not against what, nor to what purpose. and sooner
shall ye take a hare with a taburin then conclude
a suttell heretike with an argument. For he hath no
certainte in his doctrine: but is ready to denie that he
graunted the last worde before, and likewise to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unte
that he laste denied flitting and flieng as vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

serueth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brentius</hi> affirmeth the only text of the writen
worde to be the first principle of Lutheran religion.
But in such sorte that it may be lawfull out of this
writen text to cut of the epistle of S. Iames,<note place="margin">Vide praefa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiones Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri in hos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>libros pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae editio.</note> cast awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
the epistle to the Hebrews, refuse the Apocalypse
of S. Ihon, and condemne the bookes of Machabes.
This principle serueth also to reiect any other part of
the whole Bible. for if any sentence euidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in sctipture be brought against him, strayte
<hi>Brentius</hi> crieth. The Hebrewe text readeth not so.
The greke copies haue otherwise. And this principle
of the only text serueth so fit for these heretikes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that for conference with them no waye can be
made, nor ende can be founde. Then the Catholike
and Apostolicall vnderstanding of holy Scripture
which is euery where one and allwaies agreable with
it selfe, which is deriued from the Apostles, which
is the present iudge in all controuersies, they vtterly
refuse, and very rudely and impudently appeale vnto
Christ, whom in earthe present iudge we can not
haue.<note place="margin">In Bohem and in the seacost tovvnes of germa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny.</note> Whom yet some of them denie to be God, some
to be man, and some other saie he is but a tale of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And yet forsothe they boaste of the certainte of
their faith, which in dede is most vncertain, as their
most manifest dissension well declareth.</p>
            <p>A very vaine and childish crake it is, to crie allwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies
that their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of Augspurg is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the doctrine of the prophetes and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
For who saieth so, but they them selues and of
<pb facs="tcp:18354:26"/>
their only fecte, which first inuented it and would
impudently compel all Christendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to receaue it? But
if you ask them howe they proue it, they will saie
vnto you, <hi>All the articles of our Confession agree
with the prophets and the Apostles, and differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thence in no point.</hi> O the madnes of our countre.
That which is called in question, they laie for their
grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, bringing for proufe that which ought to be
proued. What child in logick would so fondly reason?
For if you denie againe that the articles of this their
confession is grounded vpon the doctrine of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and the Apostles, what haue they then to saye?
peraduenture left they may seme to be put to silence
they will beginne to interpret and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fer Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
after their maner. But is not this the foule fau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
in logike called <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> that is, to aske that
whiche ought to be proued? For when we blame the
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Augspurg we blame nothing els but the
false and wronge interpretation of holy Scripture v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that Confession. But you will saye. We may as
well refuse the interpretation that the Catholikes do
bringe of their owne. Well truly and worthely. For
who will heare the Catholike doctour if he bring
forthe nothing, but saie only that the doctrine of the
Catholike churche is grounded in holy Scriptures?
This must not be tolde but be proued.</p>
            <p>What then will the Catholike bring that the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike
shall not be able to bring? He will surely bring
and declare first the interprerarion of Scripture which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18354:26"/>
he vseth to be vniuersall, to haue ben deriued from
the Apostles, to be receaued and allowed in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.
Then he will showe that euery article and
principall point of our faith hath ben confirmed by
miracles. Last of all he will teache you that all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Catholike church, which be proper of the
newe testament, are founde expressed by euident fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in the olde Testament:<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholikes and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</note> What difference then
is there betwene the right Catholike and the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
heretike? Truly herein heretikes agree with the
Catholikes, that bothe embrace, alleage, and defend
holy scripture as the very worde of God, hut herein
differ all heretikes from the Catholikes, that these
bring the Catholike and vniuersall interpretation of
holy scripture, they bring their owne priuat and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikall.
These are able to proue their doctrine by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
they are neuer able: Last of all, that these are able
to showe the matter of the newe Testament by the
figures of the olde lawe (as in the sacrifice, in the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments,
and ceremonies) they can not.</p>
            <p>These two different waies being by iust balances
indifferently pondered, and tried, it will soone appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
whiche ouerwaieth the other. And in dede if they
bereue vs of the common and receaued iudgement
of the whole churche, wherewith all thinges in the
church are iudged, why may they not in like maner
take away all the rest? For as if ye plucked out a mans
eyes and yet wolde saie that ye bereued him not of
that which might be sene, euen so it is, if heretikes
graunt vs the text of the bible and yet take from vs
<pb facs="tcp:18354:27"/>
the true vnderstanding thereof. If it forceth not
whether we vnderstand holy Scripture rightly or
no, howe shall we then discerne fashood from the
truthe? Whereby shall we trie the truthe, or what iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
shall the churche haue of the truthe? And
who woulde folowe such teachers of religion whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

For these therefore and other waighty considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

I declare that which I haue perceaued, if I aduertise
men to beware of the mischef that I haue incurred

knowe there are amonge the rulers and noble men,

            <p>Therefore writing this booke (most Reuerend)
I haue eftesoones ioyned teares with praiers bese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

he is the only porte of our saluation. Who so
straieth from him, he leseth God and life euerlasting.
And to this ende haue I directed bothe all other tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaill
of my life, and this my present labour, that the

vnlerned might hereby charitably be admonished,

bicause I haue spoken more plainely then he

otherwise then I meaned, him I beseche most hartely

with all courtesie thanke him therefore: and much
more will I be glad to submitt my selfe to the lawfull

And this lesson our aduersaries haue very perfitly

meanes they gett more grounde and deceaue more
the people, then euer they were able to do by plaine
and vpright dealing. Truly as for my part, I confesse
before God and his diuine iudgement, my sinnes to

And thus must euery man (be he neuer so holy and
perfit) iudge of him selfe, if he respect the terrible
iudgement of almightie God, wherewith no man can
stand without his mercie through Christ Iesus. But
in ciuill policie and trade of this worlde, where the

so to ordre his life that he maye without groudg of

and folow, but now, I abhorre and persecut. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
part is of the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation of the holy bible in to the
vulgar German tongue. whereof they bable that I
go about amd deuise to make an inhibition against
the reading of the german bibles. The third part is of
certain articles in controuersie, which the Lutherans
partly for shame denie, partly go about to reconcile
with the rest of their doctrine. To the ende that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby
they may persuade the worlde that I belied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hitherto, affirming such to be their articles, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them with dissension amonge themselues.</p>
            <p>With these thre pointes, by the grace of god, I shal
defend my simple conuersation and geue due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

with all modestie, the truth in all pointes, without ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iling,

And I am very sure they haue not one iote to proue

I would gladly knowe of them what is that they call

the church from the beginning vnto our time

construed and grounded on the passion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as in the true corner stone for the
saluation of our soules, as hereafter we shall in his

therefore a wonderfull slaunder that these men saye
of the Catholikes. <hi>That hitherto the ghospell and
<pb facs="tcp:18354:36"/>
the worde of God hath ben bannished from the
church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A lovvd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie of the Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike churche.</note> 
               <hi>kept in hucker mucker, and at the length
vnder the pope to haue ben vtterly extinguished:
but now is reuoked vnto light: therefore those that
embrace this newe ghospell, to be worthely called
men of the ghospell, but that we which folow our
swete parents and forefathers with the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike

            </p>
            <p>But here,<note place="margin">Note vvel.</note> he that hath eyes to see, let him open
them, and he that hath any regard of his saluation,
let him here take hede. for this is that suttell deceit
of these protestants, and the mist wherewith they
dimme the eyes of the simple people, making them
beleue that they only professe the worde of God.
And yet these newe preachers and masters knowe
very well them selues the contrary: as Luther him
selfe in his booke against the Anabaptistes and the
Zuinglians witnesseth, saying <hi>that among the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,
that is, in the churche of Rome, the holy
ghospell aud all holy scripture with al the bookes,
sentences, wordes and prickes thereof hath remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in continuall succession of time, vncorrupted
whole and perfite.</hi> whiche maketh me more to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaill,
what wicked and malitious sprit moued these
protestants, to terme them selues only ghospellers and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18354:36"/>
professours of Gods worde, calling the Catholikes
papistes, and enemies of the worde of God: seing
that bothe nowe and in all ages, we reade the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in our churches, we preache the worde of God
in our pulpits, and interpret it to the people: we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it by outward ceremonies, rites, and gestures,
such as we haue receaued of our forefathers, euen
from the primitiue church and the Apostles time.
And this Luther knewe him selfe well inough. But
why dissembled he it then? forsothe to deceaue and
entrappe the easier the simple people in to his prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
religion. For Luther and all his ministers knowe
very wel that in the ghospel and worde of God two<note place="margin">In the vvorde of God tvvo thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges are to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note>
thinges are to be considered. First that the text be
sownd and not corrupted: then that the same text be
expounded Catholikely and not heretically. For as
S. Bernard saieth, <hi>looke with what sprit the scriptures
were writen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad fratres de monte Dei.</note> 
               <hi>with the same must they be read and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed.</hi>
Seing then the text by the instinct of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost hath ben geuen vs true and perfit, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
also and interpretation thereof, coming
of the holy ghost must be true and perfit: so that one
shall be as true, and of as much force as the other. It is
not inough therefore to reade holy scripture perfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but to vnderstande it well also.<note place="margin">Aduers. Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciferianos.</note> For (as S. Hierom
sayeth) <hi>The scriptures consist not in reading but in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
All this Luther was not ignorant of. But to
depraue and corrupt the right interpretation of holy
scripture, and to bring in place his owne hereticall
and forged expositions, he maketh no mencion off
<pb facs="tcp:18354:37"/>
the text, but crieth still <hi>the worde of God,</hi> calling
the dreames of his braine, pure and holy scripture. For
if ye aske of the Lutherans when they preache that
<hi>God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straineth men to do euill,</hi>

is the pure ghospell, the sincere worde of God, and
holy scripture it selfe.</hi> But then if ye go farder, and
desire them to showe yow these very wordes and
propositions in holy scripture, there they hush. Yet
will they tell you, that <hi>the wordes in dede them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
be not in the Bible, but the meaning of them is
there.</hi> To the which if ye replie agayn, and vrge them
farder it will soone appere, that the controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
the protestants and vs, is not of holy scripture
it self, but of the true vnderstanding of the same. And
so <hi>S. Hilary</hi> hauing to do with heretikes in his time
pronounced.<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Trinitate.</note> 
               <hi>Heresie,</hi> sayth he, <hi>is in the vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding not

thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy scripture, the worde of God:
and we that are Catholikes also haue holy scripture
allwaies in our mouth.</p>
            <p>Nowe then a man may maruaill and aske, howe
cometh it to passe that the Lutherans and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
the protestants and the papistes striue and

the ghospell, bothe loue and embrace it, bothe cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aue

marke and perceaue well:<note place="margin">Note vvel</note> that this is not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

truly, rightely, and sincerely expounde that worde

<hi>The papistes vnderstand not the Bible, but we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
founde the right interpretation thereof and the
kaye of all truthe.</hi> And to set a good coulour vppon
this holy protestation they saye farder. <hi>That all bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

(as I may so speake) which these men call <hi>Papistes</hi>
haue wrought from time to time in Christ his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
as right approued histories do manifestly declare.</p>
            <p>Now as for the good and perfit life of these men,
and excellent lerning, all the worlde seeth it. An ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
sorte of heretikes called Donatistes obiected in
times past to S. Augustin the very same argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that their church only was vpright, holy, pure and
lerned. But the Catholike churche was nothing so.
And therefore the doctrine of the Donatistes was
vndoubtedly sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and perfit, but that of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
false and vntrue. But what awnswered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here

               <hi>The argument</hi> (saieth he) <hi>that proueth mens

holy protestants passed al the vniuersall Catholike
church of Christ sens the time of the Apostles, bothe
in godlines of life, and excellency of lerning. Which
I thinke in good sothe they wil not al together affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
But if it were so, it wil not yet thereuppon ensue,

we nedes leaue this great treasure of the right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <p>But nowe touching the integrite of life and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
behauiour of the Lutherans, I would be lothe
to reporte thereof my selfe. Surely I see Luther to
doute very much thereof. For in his great postill vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the ghospell of the first Sonday in Aduent, he
crieth out and complaineth. <hi>That by his ghospell
men were become farre worse then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
               <note place="margin">A notable testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther of the life of his scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</note>
               <hi>vnder the Pope. For wickednes and vice had
so farre growen in his ghospellers that they semed
allmost become deuills.</hi> And truly this is a sure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of false prophets. For <hi>Of thornes who gathered gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
or of brambles who gathered figges at any time?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 7. Luc. 6.</note> For <hi>loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
what the tre is, such is the frute.</hi> such master such scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
such doctrine such liuing.</p>
            <p>Now where as they againe obiect vnto vs the euill
and disordinat life of the prelats of the church and of
the clergy, as that they be gloutons, dronckards, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
horehunters, and so forthe, I will not here
presently defend them, that are such. It is surely
much to be lamented, that the life and behauiour off
the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t priesthood awnswereth not to their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and highe profession: but is very scandalouse to
the worlde, euen in such places as the church is by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes
corrupted and persecuted. Notwithstanding I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18354:39"/>
doubt not although in many of the clergy it be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
true that the Lutherans saye of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching euil
life, yet there are a great numbre of vertuous and ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
bishops and priestes, of deuowte and perfit reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
men, such as amonge the Lutherans were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to find. But it were better in this case and more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
for Christen charite, that eche part looked in
his owne wallet,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> and first <hi>Tooke out the beame of their
owne eyes, for so shall they see better to take out the mote off
their neighbours eie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Timo. 2.</note> And herein whatsoeuer the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man saie, <hi>God knoweth who are his,</hi> and who
are in dede vertuous or contrary. Wherefore our faith
and belefe must not be pinned to the life of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
or preachers.<note place="margin">Againe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the most vvic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked may be soden and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</note> For by this reason we are not sure of
the due administration of any Sacrament, neither can
we truste any preacher of the worde of God, seing
that we are not able to iudge whether the priest or
the preacher be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vpright life or otherwise. But
our Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to take awaie this doubt, and
to assure vnto vs the verite of his Sacraments duly
administred by the clergy thereunto chosen,<note place="margin">A perfit rule to di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scerne fal se prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> and the
preaching of his holy worde by their mouthe, he
hath left vnto vs a sure and certain rule to knowe the
false preachers and prophets from the true, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
the doctrine from the person that teacheth.
And this rule hathe thre parts.</p>
            <p>The firste is when the doctrine is good in it selfe,
but the life of the teacher is euill and fauty. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the life of the teacher is good and vertuous,
but his doctrine false and vitious. The thirde is to
<pb facs="tcp:18354:40"/>
knowe howe the doctrine may be tried by the life off
the teacher, and howe the life of the teacher may be
tried by his doctrine.</p>
            <p>As for the first part, Christ geueth vs a very good les<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son
what to do,<note place="margin">The first part.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine is good and the life
is naught, saying <hi>The scribes and pharises sitt in the Chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of Moises.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> 
               <hi>What soeuer they shal saie vnto you, kepe it and
do it: But do not according to their doings.</hi> By the which
wordes of our Lorde, we see that the lerner ought
not so much to regard the life of the teacher as the
doctrine. For it may be that his doctrine be sownde
and good, wose life is euill. For although that as well
in the former ages, as now a daies we finde many of
right good lerning, whiche haue preached and taught
the worde of God sincerly, yet some of such liue not
accordingly. Neither is there at this daie any point
wherein the people more grudgeth against the clergy
then that many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leade their life cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary
and repugnant to their owne Canons and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For many of them can tell a trim tale in the
pulpit, exhorte the people very demeurely to a sobre
and perfit life, but will not ones moue a foote to liue
well them selues. And now (alas) it is to true that our
lorde sayeth by the prophet of his church.<note place="margin">Esaiae. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I haue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
looked that my vineyarde shuld haue brought forth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
but lo it hath brought forthe brambles,</hi> and a litle after.
<hi>Wo be vnto you which rise vp early to folow dronknes, and
to drinke vntell the euening, that they be set on fire with wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
In your companies are harpes and lutes, tabrets and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
but ye regard not the worke of the lorde.</hi> Can this be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18354:40"/>
denied? it is, alas, to true. But what then? is this their
liuing accompted vertuous? is this Catholike? No
Catholike nor Christen man wil saie so. The doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of our religion vtterly forbiddeth these thinges
and the Catholike church condemneth them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al this preiudicat in any point to the doctrine
of the Catholike church. For (as our Sauiour saied)
<hi>Do all that they shall saie vnto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 23.</note> 
               <hi>but do not as they do.</hi>
and againe. <hi>First cast out the beame of thy owne eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
               <hi>and

And in an other place.<note place="margin">Ioan. 8.</note>

            </p>
            <p>The second part now is cleane contrary to this:<note place="margin">The sco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of the ruie.</note> as

cotes? They weare no weapon, to pretend patien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce:
they haue nothing of their owne, but all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to auide couetousnes. They eate their bread in
the sweate of their browes. they labour truly: they
praye much. The Maniches, what cotes had they?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
shepelike I warrant yow. They neuer eate flesh to
<pb facs="tcp:18354:41"/>
chasten their body they dranke no wine, abstained
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from frutes, &amp;c. The <hi>Encratitae</hi> likewise abstained
vtterly from wine to folow their bookes the better.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The <hi>Cathari,</hi> (so called as men of pure life) abhorred
all pleasures and pastimes of this worlde, neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with other. Can any man denie but that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
were gaye frutes, and ioly shepe skinnes? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
iff doctrine and religion were to be tried by the
apparence of vertu and holynes, who can condemne
these men for heretikes? truly no man. And why? bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their frutes are good. And therefore it semeth
thetre can not be euill. We see the simple shepe skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
we see no lookes nor tokens of the wolfe. Of
the outwarde shewe therefore of good life, doctrine
can not be tried.</p>
            <p>But then a man may here aske. What meaneth
Christ when he saieth,<note place="margin">Matthae. 7.</note> 
               <hi>by their frutes ye shall kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
them.</hi> For if false prophets must be knowen by
their frutes, how can I mislike the Anabaptistes, the
<hi>Waldenses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third part of the rule. Hovve to knovve doctrine by the frutes.</note> and such other, whose life and behauiour
can not be reprehended? yet their doctrine is and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
detestable. What shall I here do? for so the now
the third part of this rule shall instruct you, how you
may trie the doctrine by the frutes and how the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
by the doctrine. Wherein you must first diligently
marke that the doctrine is not tried by the only fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
but so that the doctrine and the frutes be all alike
and correspondent. For vndoubtedly where the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is like the frute, and the frute like the doctrine,
one must nedes trie the other. Whereupon our lorde
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18354:41"/>
hath geuen a yery good note and rule, in S. Matthew
teaching after this sort.<note place="margin">Matth. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Other make the tree good and his
frute good, or make the tree euill and his frute euill,</hi> For by
the <hi>frute the tree is knowen.</hi> And by this rule Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asoneth
against the vnbeleuing Iewes, when he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth
<hi>If ye wil not beleue me, yet beleue my workes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 10.</note> and why
so? bicause the workes and doings of Christ did agre
very well with his doctrine, and the doctrine with
his workes. So was the life and the doctrine allwaies
agreable of the prophets, the Apostles, the Martirs,
and all other holy men. Whereof it will well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that seing their life was holy, vertuous, and
perfit, their doctrine also was sounde, good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesome.
And why may we so conclude in them? bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
euen as they preached and taught so they liued:
and what they taught other to do, they did them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
and againe as they did so they taught. Therefore
of them it is well saide.<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Of their frutes ye shal knowe them</hi>
For their frutes being good in dede, the tre could not
be euill.</p>
            <p>The like reason is of euill doctrine and wicked li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe:<note place="margin">The fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doctrine.</note>
for one foloweth allwaies the other. It is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Luther.<note place="margin">In libro. de Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Tom. 6</note> 
               <hi>That a man can no more refraine
from satisfising the filthy lust of the flesh, then
from spetting.</hi> Of this tie what frutes proceded?
For so the these: that bicause to liue chast is an vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
thing, then no man, no woman must liue chast
or single. But if occasion serue not to mary, they may
lawfully seke after baudes and hoores. Which is now
<pb facs="tcp:18354:42"/>
a common thing in Germany: and hath proceded of
this doctrine of Luther. Luther teacheth that if the
husband can not do his dutie to his wife, she may
in this maner speake vnto him. <hi>You see good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
that you can not do your dutie vnto me.</hi>

               </note>
               <hi>Let me with your good leaue mary priuely with
your brother or next kinsman, so that allwaies
yet you beare the name of my husband, lest your
goods come into other mens handes: &amp;cae. To
this request of the woman</hi> (saieth Luther) <hi>the
man ought to accorde and prouide: or els she ought
to go priuely from him.</hi> Is not this (thinke you) a
blessed graffe? but what buddes trowe ye brought
it forthe? Truly these that now the brother may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his brothers wife, he yet liuing, as Herod did,<note place="margin">Marc. 6.</note> as it
is much now practised amonge the Lutherans Agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
that one woman may haue many husbandes, and
one man many wiues, as the Turkes vse: and as we
see in germany, not only in the cite of Mounster,
but in many other places also openly practised. And
do not these frutes agree well and iust with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</p>
            <p>In Luthers doctrine we reade: <hi>If the wife wil not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the 6. tome of his vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the yeare 1553</note>

tree this goodly frute is spronge, that nothing
is more common now amonge the Lutherans then
wanton baudery and aduoutery, so much that the

that it was neuer so badde vnder the pope.</p>

            <p>Yet as touching the life of spirituall teachers and
rulers, god hath prescribed to the laitie and common
people a perfit and absolute rule to discerne true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from the false, saying. <hi>The scribes and Pharises sit
in the Chaire of Moyses:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Do as they commaunde you to do,
not as they do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues,</hi> in the which saying of Christ,
euery Christen man that regardeth his soule helth,
ought diligently waie two pointes. First to know
which is the lawfull chaire of Moyses,<note place="margin">Hovve to discerne true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the false.</note> and which is
not. then how the laye and common sort of people
ought to beare them selues towardes the euill life of
the clergy. Let vs then first speake of the first point.</p>
            <p>Sithen the time that these newe doctrines of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath ben putin the peoples heads, and so many,
diuers and contrary opinions hathe ben taught, that
the simple and vnlerned, know not all most which
<pb facs="tcp:18354:44"/>
waie to turne them selues, many are brouht to that
point, that they reiect all religion at ones: and think
oure Christen faith to be but prety policies of mens
inuention or rather olde wyues tales to feare childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and with this imagination are become worldly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,
terming their felicite in present pleasure, as a
great number do nowe in Germany. Whereof truly
we haue great cause to feare (vnles these cursed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies

This <hi>Illyricus</hi> lately wrote against <hi>Menius</hi> who had

to plaie the bishop in the churche of Luther, and to

would not agree to his propre and seuerall doctrines,
he awnswereth them againe, that according to the
doctrine of our father <hi>Luther, Euery man was a
priest, as cacthepolles, millers, barbers, Phisicians,

so did the Sadduces heretikes of the olde lawe before

Christes time, as Iosephus in his Chronicles witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.

offices and giftes in the gouuernement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

diuers and sundry ministeries, especially
<pb facs="tcp:18354:50"/>
for the instructing and teaching the right vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of holy scripture, that we might thereby knowe
his will and pleasure in all thinges without doubt or

without a teacher and interpreter were able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
to what purpose hathe the holy ghoste
geuen in his churche vnto some the gifte of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
            <p>But what nede we spend herein many wordes? let
vs reade the bookes of Moyses, the psalmes and the

misteries which before the coming of Christ no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
allmost vnderstode? And what meaned our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
when he sayde vnto his disciples,<note place="margin">Lucae. 8.</note> 
               <hi>It is geuen vnto
you to knowe the misteries of the kingdome of God, but to the
other in parables, that seing they see not and hearing they
vnderstande not?</hi> What meaned our Lorde in these wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des?
Truly this, that it is a speciall gifte of God to
vnderstande well holy scripture: and that this gifte
was especially geuen vnto the Apostles and to their
disciples and successours, which should after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beare
their roume in Christes church. Againe that it was
inough for the people, that (as much as is necessary
for saluation) they might lerne of their pastours, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and curates the exposition of holy scripture, by
similitudes and parables agreable to their capacite.
which may farther be proued by diuers places of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture.</p>
            <p>But I would here gladly aske of our newe Masters
when they saye <hi>that the texte of scripture is sufficient, that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18354:50"/>
there nedeth no expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor glose,</hi> why write they so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries, such longe gloses vppon scripture, so
many bookes and that without all measure? if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
no exposition, then surely all the Lutherans boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and writings be vtterly superfluous, vaine and to
no purpose, but only crafty snares to catche the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and vnlerned withall.</p>
            <p>But to tell you plainely what the protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts meane
by this sutle shifte to cleaue to the only writen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,<note place="margin">VVhy the protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts crie vpon only Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture.</note>
surely this it is: they would not haue the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
vtterly not expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, they meane nothing so (for
that in dede nothing serueth their turne) but they
would haue their expositions, their maner of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unding
to be receaued and beleued as the very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of god. But contrary wise, when they haue to
do with vs, reiecting all interpretation of scripture
they ring their olde songe in our eare, <hi>The worde of
god is cleare, perspicuous aud plaine, it nedeth no
exposition, it requireth no interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the olde

is their impudencie and contrariete: And this much
haue we saide to showe that Scripture ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
that the bare text suffiseth not.</p>
            <p>But here riseth now agreat question and worthy
to be waighed.<note place="margin">A questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of scripture is to be so lovved.</note> Seing that holy scripture must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
and that we see abrode many and diuers
interpretations thereof, and yet in one thing there can
be but one truthe, and as scripture it selfe is vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
true, so the interpretation thereof must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb facs="tcp:18354:51"/>
and certain, whether of all these interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or what maner is to be accompted the right,
proper and vndoubted. As for example. No Christen
man denieth but that these wordes of the last supper,

then riseth these greate and horrible dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
surely not whether secte hathe the worde of

<hi>Zwinglius</hi> saith these wordes. <hi>This is my body</hi>

and serch the true meaning of these wordes in

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18354:51"/>
as these men aboue mentioned: who all by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of scripture you see howe swetely they agreed
vpon the truthe. But if there were any certainte in
conference (as sometimes it helpeth much) yet the
simple vnlerned man, by common order of witt shal
neuer finde it out. For how can the vnlerned and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
iudge of that, which he neuer lerned? no more
truly then the showemaker is able to iudge of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desmithes
worke, which he was neuer practised in.
And were not that showemaker to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted very
impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vndiscret, who seing two goldesmithes
contending of the fines of some piece of gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
would steppe in, and take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to determinat

medle with or determinat matters of Diuinite,
or take vpon them to expounde the meaning of the
holy ghoste, seing that in worldly affaires there can
no waightier matter, of more difficultie, or of greater
importaunce be taken in hande. what then shal the
vnlerned man do in this case? If he may cleaue to no
part at all, then must he be of no church, but make
him selfe a newe secte, forge him selfe a newe faith,
and so at length lese all faith, and become a very pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim:
whiche god forbid that euer any man should per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suade
the vnlerned. If he cleaue to any part, yet is he
in greate dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. For almightie god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his Apostle,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> 
               <hi>that we auoide the heretike.</hi> Here truly
the laye man ought to take good aduise.<note place="margin">Matth. 7. &amp; 16.</note> For he is bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde

of him felfe he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not see it, vnlesse he hath lerned of

it. Is there then any such toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or signe, or where may
a man seke it? verely the mercifull prouidence of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighte
God hath not failed in this point, but hath
left vnto the laie, simple, and vnlerned man a certain

corruption in interpreting scripture.</p>
            <p>There is no Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man so rude or ignorant that

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18354:52"/>
of the earthe for thy possession.</hi> which place all holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue so expounded, that God the father hathe
geuen to Christ such a church, as should be spred
through out the whole worlde, not only in Suethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
Denmarke or Germanie. So the Son of god
taking vpon him the nature of man, after he had here
in earthe purchased our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sente abrode the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apostles as Embassadours through out the whole
world to take possession of the foresaide inheritaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
charging them in this wise.<note place="margin">Matth. 28</note> 
               <hi>All power is geuen vnto

            </p>
            <p>In this highe and waightie embassage of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Iesus Christ</hi> two thinges are especially notised.
First that his Apostles should go and preache trough
out the whole worlde. Secondarely that he will tary
with them vntell the end of the worlde. In whiche
two pointes<note place="margin">Lib. de vni late ecclesi.</note> (as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> at large disputeth against
the heretikes of his time) this artikle of our Crede is
comprised. <hi>I beleue the Catholike churche.</hi> In the which
wordes we confesse that the church of Christ must
be vniuersall, and spred through out the whole worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and that from the time of the Apostles forwarde
it should continewe by the continuall assistaunce and
presence of Christ. And in this consideration the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
calleth the church,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the Piller and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of truthe.</hi>
signifieng by the worde <hi>ground</hi> the largenes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome:
<pb facs="tcp:18354:53"/>
by the worde <hi>Piller</hi> the continuall, smothe,
and not interrupted succession of the Apostles and
their scholers, vpon whom al truthe is builded. And
this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worde <hi>Catholike</hi> S. Augustin
teacheth in many places against the <hi>Donatistes,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in his booke <hi>de vnitate ecclesiae.</hi> Therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
it were to become a <hi>Donatiste</hi> and to take the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of those detestable heretikes. And this much of
this question.</p>
            <p>But to returne nowe to the true exposition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture, euery Christen man ought not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
this article of the Catholike church, but be also
one of the same, and beleue what so euer it beleueth,
expounde and interpret the scriptures, as it expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
and interpreteth them: condemne and reproue
all such thinges as it condemneth and reproueth.
And what surer token or more certain marke could
God geue to discerne false expositions of scripture
from the true, then this article of our Crede, <hi>I beleue
the holy Catholike Church?</hi> For when thre co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
thre diuers interpretations of holy scripture
are brought forthe, whereof two are fresh and newe,
neuer taught nor heard of before our time, the third
is auncient, accustomed, and receaued of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
deriued euen from the Apostles time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
hitherto, what laye or vnlerned man is in
this case so rude or ignorant, but (if he liste, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in his Crede, to beleue the <hi>Catholike church</hi>
which is allwaies and in all places) maye easely iudge
this thirde interpretation to be the right meaning
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18354:53"/>
off the holy ghoste, the other two to be false and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall?</p>
            <p>For the more declaration of this matter I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
here a storie,<note place="margin">A prety storie of false inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pretation</note> whiche I lerned being a boye, and
happened at <hi>Lubek.</hi> In <hi>Lubek</hi> there dwelled a riche
man, whose familie and kinred was of <hi>Turing.</hi> This
man being in Lubeck at point of death and hauing
no child to be his heire, bequeued his goods to certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of his kinsfolkes at <hi>Turing.</hi> They shortly after this
mans decease coming to Lubek bring with them a
Proctour, open the will, and founde there that the
widowe of the departed man beside other goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queued,
should deliuer them a thousand and two
hundred shipbordes, commonly called there <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genschoff.</hi>
But the Proctour and heyres of Turing
cauilling vppon the worde <hi>Wagenschoff</hi> required
a thousand and two hundred greate pieces of artille<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie:
saying that in their countre the worde so signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Neither would these men of <hi>Turing</hi> be brought
from their chalenge, vntell at the length the matter
must be tried by iudgement. Wherein their processe
being longe debated, and bothe partes heard, it was
founde that the interpretation of the worde <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genschoff</hi>
alleaged by those of Turing was a newe
and straunge interpretation neuer heard of before in
that countre: whereas the widowe by the consent of
all the people and the whole countre proued, that of
olde time the worde <hi>Wagenschoff</hi> signified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shipbordes which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly brought
thither out of <hi>Lifland</hi> and <hi>Pole.</hi> Whereuppon the
<pb facs="tcp:18354:54"/>
interpretation of the proctour of <hi>Turing</hi> was reiected
and laughed to scorne as newe, curious, superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and straunge. Much more ought we that are
Christians do the like in these newe and straunge
expositions of Gods worde inuented by proude and
presumptuous heretikes, detesting and auoidinge
them as present poison. For surely such newe forged
interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ones spread abrode,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> do crepe <hi>like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre</hi>
and infect daily more and more, as we see nowe
by experience in sundry places.</p>
            <p>Euery man nowe a daies calleth vpon scripture: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man demaundeth the expres worde of God. And
what I praie you can be more expresse then that the
Apostle S. Peter saieth <hi>So that ye first knowe this that no
prophecie in the scripture hath any pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <note place="margin">2. Petri. 1.</note> In
the which wordes it is to be noted that S. Peter will
haue vs <hi>first and before al other thinges knowe this,</hi> that no
prophecie in the scripture hathe any priuat interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Therefore it must nedes be very perilous to
beleue straight this or that interpretation, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we here. For it is a common saying, it is euill
toying with the eye, with maydenhood, and with
our faith.</p>
            <p>But many there are nowe a daies,<note place="margin">Avvicked persuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vvorl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler men.</note> which when
they heare contrarietes in doctrine, and diuers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
of scripture, they comforte them selues ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relesly
in this sort. What nede we passe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of preachers, and controuersies of Diuines?
Although they misse in certain pointes, and disagree
in some certain articles, yet our faith and belefe is not

oure <hi>Pater noster,</hi> beare awaye oure <hi>Crede,</hi> and the ten

nowe certain braynsicke men by the instinct of the
deuill raised vp againe, to the vtter destruction of the
Romane empire and our dere countre of Germanie.
Therefore he is readie to showe by good groundes
of holy scripture, by the right and Catholike vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Scripture, that the olde religion hitherto
receaued, is grounded vppon those two pillers, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them hath ben sustained from the Apostles time
vntel our daies through out the whole corps of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stendom,
and maintained sounde and perfit, against al

and with reason, that we should embrace and

Contrary wise may we not worthely esteme these

haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained me to be a doctour of their vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Againe I haue bestowed much time that I might
thoroughely and substantially be lerned in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike

<pb facs="tcp:18354:59"/>
much a do to shift my selfe out of their crafty, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and contentious controuersies, yet as sone as by
the helpe of God I attained thereunto, espieng the
erroneous and hereticall doctrine of the Lutherans,
and perceauing the true and sounde doctrine of the
Catholikes,<note place="margin">The duty of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</note> I laboured not only vtterly to ridde my

also to auoide all company and familiarite of hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
that I might neither see them, nor heare of them.
Which lacke of my olde acquaintaunce and maner of

<hi>Zuinglians,</hi> he was repelled also of them for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike.
Seing then he could not spede there, passing on
furder by the waye he came to the <hi>Picardi,</hi> hoping
<pb facs="tcp:18354:60"/>
that he might be receaued in to their secte. But when
he refused to abiure all other sectes and religions and
beleue onely them, he was faine to departe thence
also. After which he came to a Noble man of Silesia
requiring seruice, of whom being required howe he
liked the doctrine of <hi>Swenck feldius,</hi> whether he bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<hi>That the externall ministerie or preaching
was but superfluous, and that the internall worde
or rather the power and operacion off the worde
being preached were the Son of God him selfe,</hi> he
awnswered that this doctrine semed vnto him an ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
heresie confuted thouroughly of <hi>Illyricus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
Caluin</hi> and diuers other writers. Which awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
nothing pleasing that Noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our poore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
was forced to get him packing. Seing therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that he loste his labour and spent his time in vaine,
he stroke ouer to <hi>Morauia</hi> where the Anabaptistes
beare rule. Not that he minded to tary and abide with
them, but to trie and knowe their religion. But they
craftely preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting him, asking him first of what reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
he was, though he went about the bush with
them, thinking to coulour the matter, yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing
that he liked not their rebaptising, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
chased from thence as an heretike.</p>
            <p>At the last after longe and wery trauail and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
this poore Minister came vnto <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he
happened vpon a Catholike lerned man, vnto whom
he declared his trauaill, aduersites, and diuersites off
heresies that he chaunced vpon, beseching him for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18354:60"/>
the loue of God to helpe him and instruct him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
he might attaine to some sure and certaine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off holy scripture.<note place="margin">A necessa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry lesson for decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued prote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stants.</note> Then was
it tolde him, that he should folowe such doctrine and
embrace such interpretation of Gods worde, as was
Catholike and vniuersally receiued in all places, and
at al times, casting awaie all priuat opinions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre
interpretations of this secte or that secte. For it
was impossible that any priuat secte could admit the
Catholike exposition of scripture whiche is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to all, or that the sectes could euer agree among them
selues, eche one setting forthe his owne opinion and
condemning all the rest. As it is writen in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Ezechiel,<note place="margin">Ezech. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Wo be vnto these foolish prophetes which
folowe their owne sprit and see nothing.</hi> Therefore if he
would be a Christen man, and in all places be taken
for such, he should embrace and folowe the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
vnderstanding of scripture, such as in Catholike
doctours and writers we find. From the which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
and vniforme expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of scripture although
many in diuers countres haue failed, and departed, yet
before our time, it was in all places without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or gainesaieng receiued and beleued, and many
thousands of soules haue in that belefe ben saued.
Beside that there are also yet diuers Christen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
and kingdomes, diuers natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and people, which
acknowledg no other doctrine or interpreation of
holy scripture, then the Catholike and olde accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
which they haue receaued of the Apostles and
their first founders of religion. Wherein if any doubt
<pb facs="tcp:18354:61"/>
nowe a daies ariseth, or any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary interpretation be
brought, it is most expedient to seke of the first and
most auncient teachers of Christen religion the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
thereof. For so Scripture willeth vs to do, and all
auncient and approued doctours, as in S. Irenee a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
very nie vnto the Apostles, you may see, whose
wordes are these. <hi>These thinges then being so euident, we
ought not to seke the truthe at other mens handes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 4. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra he<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reses.</note>

that whosoeuer listeth, may drawe of her the drinke of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe.
For the Church is the gate of life, all other are theues. the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
we must auoide them, but loue all that the Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs and embrace the traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of truthe. For what if there
were but a small matter called in controuersie, ought we not
to haue recourse to the most au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Churches, in the which the
Apostles haue liued, and enquire of them the truthe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainte
of our doubt? And what if the Apostles had not left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs scripture at all? ought we not to haue folowed the order
of tradition which they deliuered vntothe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom they left to
gouuerne the Churche after them? the which order many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Barbarous people such as beleue in Christ, do folowe:
hauing their saluation without paper and ynke, by the holy
ghoste writen in their harte, and keping diligently their ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
traditions.</hi> Thus farre S. Irenee. With this good les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and information the Lutheran Minister being
somewhat amended, afterward in shorte time vtterly
detesting all sectes and heresies, becometh a right go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
Catholike. And surely so it happeneth, that who
so ones departeth from the church, if he entre but a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18354:61"/>

            <p>Our forefathers the auncient Germans were euer

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18354:62"/>
that crieth only that his doctrine is grounded vppon
the writings of the Apostles and Prophets. It is not
sufficient to alleage and hudle vp many places of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which the heretikes do, as roundely as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
proue that those your places be well and duly alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
and expounded. But by what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and reason
may this be proued?</p>
            <p>By thre maners of waies. First the teacher of any
doctrine or preacher ought to proue and euidently
declare,<note place="margin">Hovv in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture is tried true</note> that his doctrine or interpretation of holy
Sripture is Catholike, deriued from the Apostles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
through out whole Christendom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
vnto our time. Secondarely that all the ordre,
maner, and disposition of the church of Christ in the
newe lawe was figured and shadowed by other obser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaunces
and doings in the olde lawe. Thirdly that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
principall article of our Catholike religion hath
be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confirmed with some miracle, whereby the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of it hathe vnuincibly ben warranted. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>Amonge vs Catholikes it is a sure and vndoubted<note place="margin">The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ vn der one kinde per fit and vvhole.</note>
point in our religion that in the blessed Sacrament of
the aultar, vnder one kinde the whole and perfit body
of Christe is contained as well as vnder bothe. This
point we first proue by the expresse worde of God,
vttered by the Apostle saying, that <hi>Christ can not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note>
Nowe that this saying of the Apostle is well
applied to the one kinde of bread in the Sacrament,
the common practise of Christes Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:18354:63"/>
these many hundred yeares dothe abundantly
witnesse. Againe it is proued by an euident figure of
the olde lawe. For we reade in Moyses,<note place="margin">Exodi. 16.</note> that although
some gathered more, some lesse of Manna (which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
as S.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> Paule witnesseth was the figure of our
Lordes supper) yet he that gathered lesse, had as much
as he that gathered more. So <hi>Hilarius</hi> pope of Rome
decreeth,<note place="margin">De Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secr. dict. 2. cap. vbi pars.</note> saying. <hi>Where parte of the body is, there is the
whole, for the like is in the body of our Lorde that was in
Manna, that figured it. For not the visible quantite is to
be considered in this misterie, but the spirituall efficacie and
vertu of the Sacrament.</hi> Last of all this hath ben confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by so sundry and strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge miracles wrought from
God, that who so hath any sparckle of Christen faith
remaining in him, can neuer doubt, but that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ is as well vnder one kinde, as vnder bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
The stories of the Iewes may testifie clerely this
matter, which happened in diuers places, as at <hi>Passau,
Breslau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bedurum. Vratisluia Ratispona.</note> 
               <hi>Regenspurg</hi> and <hi>Tekendorph</hi> in Bauaria, in the
yeare of our Lorde 1337. and afterward at <hi>Berlin</hi> in the
Marchise of <hi>Brandeburg</hi> in the yere 1512.<note place="margin">In the ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are. 1556. <hi>Vide Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanum li. 5 fol.</hi> 432.</note> and now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
in Pole in the dyocese of the Archebishop of
<hi>Gnesna.</hi> In whiche all places it hathe ben seen, that
out of the Hoste of our Lordes body, foined in with
daggers by the Iewes, bloud hath gushed out, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other miracles haue befallen. The which all sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
almightie God of his mercie hath wrought for
the confirmation of his churche in this article, that
vnder the forme of bread is fully contained his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
body and bloud, and for the conuicting also of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18354:63"/>
the damnable heresie of the Maniches, who aboue a
thousand yeares agone, affirmed that vnder the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of bread was the body without bloud.</p>
            <p>This I haue brought in for an example, to show ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
the Catholike doctours are able to proue euery ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Catholike religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That is, by the Catholike,
vniuersal, and receaued expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy scripture, by
the figures and shadowes of the olde lawe, by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of miracles Surely who can thus proue his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
he may boldely saie that it is grounded vppon
the writings of the Apostles and prophets.</p>
            <p>Nowe if the Confessionistes speake as they think,
when they saie their doctrine is grounded vppon the
Apostles and prophets, and that they will proue it to
be so in dede, let them trie their <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi>
also by these waightes. Let them from the first
article vnto the last, showe first that their doctrine is
the right and Catholike exposition of Gods worde,
then whether they can confirme it by any one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
last of all let them showe the maner and order
of their Lutheran church to haue ben prefigured and
shadowed in the olde lawe. If they can so do, I
will warrant them, that all Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people wil gladly
subscribe to their articles and beleue accordinge to
their doctrine. But if they are not able to perfourme
this, then let them not obiect to vs their <hi>Confession</hi> or
<hi>Apologie.</hi> let them suffer vs quietly and frely perseuere
in our Catholike and auncient religion, and we will
not let them to crie, to sweare and forsweare that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
Confession is grounded vpon the writings of the
<pb facs="tcp:18354:64"/>
Apostles and prophets.</p>
            <p>And thus much hitherto haue we spoken as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that which our Lorde saide. <hi>Vppon the chaire of
Moyses sit the scribes and pharises,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> 
               <hi>do all thinges that they
shall bidde you to do.</hi> For hitherto haue we talked howe
to trie true doctrine, and howe to knowe such as sit in
dede vpon the chaire of Moyses. It remaineth nowe
to speake of the later part of Christes saying. <hi>But do
not as they do.</hi>
               <note place="margin">VVhy the protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts bark at the euil li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe of the clergy.</note> Which we must also no lesse discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
then the former. For in this our miserable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
time bicause heretikes can not ouerthrowe by
any good reason the very chaire of Moyses, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the church, they take holde of the euill life
of the clergy, and barke at the dissolute liuing of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that sit in the chaire, making the people beleue
that their doctrine is no other then their life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
is: inferring very absurdely, that the doctrine
and the life is all one and can not be diuers: which
wicked opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bred much strife and caused mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
trouble in the Christen common welth: as in the
writings of the fathers we may reade treating of the
heresies of the <hi>Donatistae, Encratitae, Cathari,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolici:</hi>
But we haue in holy scripture markes inoughe
and that euident, to discern heresies which procede of
euill doctrine,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. Tit. 3.</note> from the euill life, which procedeth of
men. For heresie being a very plage and poison of
Christen religion, S. Paule biddeth vs <hi>auoide and flie

he is subuerted that is such a one, and offendeth being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

is that euery laie man, craftes man, labourer, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

scripture at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>The sectes of the <hi>Picardi</hi> of the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> of the

toke vpon them to reade, interpret, and expounde

surely such as Luther him selfe or some other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheretike
hathe translated in to the vulgar tongue,
and corrupted partly with false additions and preuy

<hi>that he which will reade holy scripture,
ought not to bringe with him any iudgement, but
seke it in the text.</hi> Which is as much to saie, that the

faith of the church, nothing prepared with deuotion
and humilite, nothing instructed by what meanes to
<pb facs="tcp:18354:68"/>

so contrary and repugnant to the true vnderstanding

but cleauing vnto it tothe and naile forgeth him selfe
a newe religion, frameth a faith of his owne, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vp in his hart a newe idoll, in the defence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he will spend his body, his goods, his life, and his

nowe a daies.</p>
            <p>Wherein me thinketh it fareth,<note place="margin">A similitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted.</note> as if the common
craftes men of a cite, vpon a stomach of priuat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
would sodenly displace all phisicians and

to knowe as wel as they the vertu of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,

and other such ware: and hereuppon would take
vpon them to minister bothe to them selues and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other, potions, purgations, and all kinde of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
Were not these men thinke you, likely to do
much good in shorte time? especially if other would
be so madde as to beleue them? would not experience
quickely teache them to call home againe their olde
Masters, Phisicians and poticaries, and set these men
to their craftes againe? Surely so it is of the holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
translated in to the vulgar tongue and so made
common for all men. For the laye man may so reade
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18354:68"/>
them, and picke out metsons mete for his appetit: but
for lacke of skill (as experience hath tried) he will cast
him selfe downe being whole before, and so (as they
saie) shall paie for touching. For in very dede the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerned
man is not acquainted with the phrase of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
he knoweth not the language of the holy gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,

nothing, nor vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not to what ende or purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
this or that be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it fareth in scripture as in
medicines, which although they are ordained of God
for the helthe of mans body, and are the giftes of
God, yet if they be not vsed in time and place as the
desease requireth, and as the lerned physician appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
they may be mischef in stede of a remedy: and
serue to kill man being made to heale man. By this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
the vnlerned maie gather, howe dangerous
it is for him to reade the scripture in his mother ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:
especially with the ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to interpret it as he shal
thinke best him selfe.</p>
            <p>Nowe whereas I haue in dede founde faute with

the sence of the text by false and hereticall gloses
partly added in the margin, partly foisted in the text it
selfe. So by clipping awaie the termes of the text, and
patching on the suttle shiftes of his owne braine, he
hath gaily coloured his pernicious doctrine with the

Yet this perfection as litle as it is, Luther to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

ben corrected: the good vse should haue remained.</p>
            <p>In the same chapter of the Actes of the Apostles,

and is well translated <hi>vertu</hi> or godlynes, Luther hath
translated it <hi>merit,</hi> as though the Apostles had denied
merit. But there is great difference betwene vertu or
godlynes, and merit or desert. Yet Luther to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all loue of vertu and good workes, laboured all
that he could to persuade men, <hi>That good workes
haue no merit, dejert or rewarde before God, and
that they procure nothing but goddes wrath.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
all merites seming to Luther vaine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
for the maintenaunce of this his heresie,
scripture must be corrupted: seing directly it would
not serue him.</p>
            <p>In like maner behaued he him selfe in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of holy Orders, to the entent he might take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
all priesthood out of the church, and set in their
places rennagat prentices, and vnthrifty seruaunts,
such as had spent their owne and robbed their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to gouuerne the newe church by him erected.
For this his purpose scripture must be wrethed and
peruerted: lest the holy ghospeller might perhaps se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to saie somewhat without scripture. Therefore
whereas S. Pause admonisheth his disciple Timothe
whom he had then ordained bishop of Ephesus, to
vse well those giftes and graces of God, as had ben

in translation of the holy scripture, yet for the
more declaration thereof, I will adde yet one place
notably misused and willfully corrupted of Luther.
The Apostle writeth thus to the Colossians.<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Beware
lest any man deceiue you by philosophie or vaine deceites af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

not after Christ.</hi> Thus readeth the greke and the latin

for his purpose, where it is in the text, <hi>After the

should study philosophie. For al the writings of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Aristotle, Cicero,</hi> and such other were but friuolous
tales and daungerous deceites, and to be burned and
destroied (as in dede in many places so they were) but
onely the Bible ought to be read and studied. For by
these the holy ghoste would minister all knowledge
bothe to serue God, and to liue in this worlde, bothe
for euerlasting saluation and for this temporal estate.

<hi>Breslau</hi> did shet vp cleane all scholes, and for the

without any education or instruction. Which
if a man had asked them why they did so, the text of
S. Paule serued them for a cloke of their foly where
it was writen. <hi>Beware ye that no man deceiue you by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie

               <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.</note> But

out of the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> professing

he could not without philosophie and helpe of scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
<pb facs="tcp:18354:77"/>
vtter the wicked wares of his fresh and newe ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
letting passe (as I saide) the former text of the
Apostle, he toke holde of the wordes that folowed.
<hi>The elements of the worlde,</hi> turning it, <hi>the lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donaunces
of the worlde.</hi> For philosophie hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not so much his purpose, as the Magistrates and
and lawes of the countre did. Whose authorite on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he first ouerthrew, drawing men from due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto their superiours, he perceaued right wel,
that his purpose could not be brought about, being
to abolish olde and auncient religion, and to plant a
newe of his owne inuention. To coulour therefore
this his intent and fetch, he forceth me the Apostle
to speake for him, and to vtter his doctrine in the
vulgar tongue, putting in for the wordes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>after the elements of the worlde</hi> his owne wordes,
<hi>after the lawes and ordonaunces of the worlde.</hi>
As though the Apostle had commaunded, that bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the ciuill lawes and decrees be not worde for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
expressed in the prophets or the Apostles, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
for a policy and worldy gouuernement, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
that no man was bounde to obey them. And
this pageant so pretely entred of <hi>Luther</hi> proued not

rather transposing and altering of S. Paules wordes.</p>
            <p>In an other booke entituled <hi>Of the secular power</hi> he
writeth <hi>that amonge Christen men there ought to
be no superiorite, no power, nor no Magistrat.</hi>
In the very same booke, and in an Epistle againste
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18354:77"/>
the two edictes of the Emperour he writeth.<note place="margin">Luther vvriteth against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats.</note>

that. <hi>To fight against the Turkes is to resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste

Luther then hauing by this false and foisted
interpretation of S. Paule, founde the meanes to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the Canon lawe, to bring in contempt the Ciuill
lawe, to raise vp the commons against their princes,
beside many other seditions and rebellions hereby
procured, I trust men will take hede and beware off
such false, forged, and foisted interpretations. For
who seeth not that there is great difference betwene
<hi>The elements of the worlde</hi> and <hi>the ordonnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de?</hi>

And this is not only forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by scripture, but also by
Canons of the church, and by the ciuill lawes (as in

punished. yet Luther wil haue no other thing
ment by those wordes of the Apostle (whatsoeuer
the holy fathers saie) then politick and ciuill ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces,
whiche he lowdely and lewdely curseth.
And Melanchthon in despite of the fathers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
maintaineth at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> most aboue other sci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ences

tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slations of Luther, but that I feare me I should
wery the reader with ouer long and superfluous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall

truthe and will not willfully be abused, he may iudge
of these fewe examples, what trust is to be geuen to
the rest of Luthers translation, an such other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
especially if he consider that he that is ones o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the showes will not sticke yet to wade furder.</p>
            <p>But here peraduenture a man will demaunde. Sir
if it be so that the reading of the Bible in the vulgar
tongue be so perilous a matter, howe shall the vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
laye man prouide that he be not abused in this
case? For many there are amonge the laite that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
refraine from reading holy scripture, taking it for a
greate comfort, and instruction as well to bridle their
passions, as to moue them to vertu. What part then of
holy scripture might well be permitted them to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de?
For the whole corps of the Bible were it neuer so
wel translated, yet I doubt whether it were expedient
for the laye to reade it. For it might be an occasion of
idle and light thoughtes, if euery girle or yonge wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
should reade the stories of Lot,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. Gene. 38. Num. 5.</note> and his doughters
of Lia, and Rachel the wiues of Iacob, of Iudas, and
Thamar, and howe aduoutrie may be tried in we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Whiche all in the olde testament is to be reade.</p>
            <p>Amonge the Iewes it was a lawe that before the
age of taking priesthood,<note place="margin">Vide Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. praefat in Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elem.</note> which was of thirty yeares
no man should be suffred to reade the beginning of
the Genesis, the Canticles, the ende and beginning
of Echechiels prophecy. And that bicause although
<pb facs="tcp:18354:79"/>
all this were the worde of God, yet it was not
thought expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that euery one indifferently should
lightely come to these secret and high misteries, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
God would not haue reueled to all, lest being
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it happeneth) they should the lesse be este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Nor it hath not ben without the singular dispo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sition
and maruailous prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, that throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe
all the west churche, the wordes of his holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
haue amonge so many barbarous nations
ben kept so longe time in the Latin tonge vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and straunge to the common sorte of men.</p>
            <p>Yet that the laite be not vtterly excluded from the
misteries of holy Scripture,<note place="margin">VVhat partes of Scripture may be read of the laite.</note> but that they may as far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
as is expedient for them reade and knowe them,
this our counsell were not paraduenture amisse. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in holy scripture there are many stories, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges which are not necessary to be knowen
not only of the laite but also of the inferiour sorte of
the clergy, certain bishops of Rome many yeares past
haue piked out of the whole corps of the Bible, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
most necessary parcels thereof, and set it forthe
together in the forme of a <hi>Breuiary</hi> or portise, to be
read of the clergy by dutie, and of the laite such as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth.
This is so distributed in to the seuen howres
of Christes passion, that who so listeth applie him
selfe to praier and deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, can surely imagin no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
order then that is. The right Noble and excellent
lerned man <hi>George Gienger</hi> one of the preuy counsell
to the Emperours Maiestie, well perceauing the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
commodite thereof hathe translated the Roman
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18354:79"/>
               <hi>Breuiary</hi> in to the German tongue in so handsome
and pure stile that the Psalter, the lessons and the
ghospels be as pleasauntely to be reade in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
tongue as they are in the Latin. It were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
peraduenture more expedient for the common
and vnlerned laye men to haue with them some such
to praie and reade in, then rashely trust to euery tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation:
or confusely reade euery thinge they list. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
being so perilous a matter to swarue from
the right vnderstanding of holy scripture, that the
danger ensuing is no lesse then heresie.</p>
            <p>It were also very profitable that certain Homelies
and Sermons were gathered out of S. <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> S.
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> S. <hi>Bernarde,</hi> S. <hi>Bede</hi>
and such other holy fathers, whiche being distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in to the Sondayes and holy dayes of the yeare,
and well and truly translated in to the vulgar ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
might safely and with great profit be reade off
the common people. Beside where as many godly
praiers for diuers necessites are to be founde in the
doctours, they might serue also for common praier
for the people being truly translated in to the vulgar
tonge. Surely any laie man that desireth to reade scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
not of curiosite, but to strengthen his faith, to
encrease his hope, and to kindle his charite, may in
such bookes as we haue saide satisfie fully his desire

            <p>The matter amendeth neuer a whit, but
wexeth daily worse and worse: It is no other
wise likely but that we shall vtterly lese the gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
and in stede of it haue nothing but mere
lies and hainous errours: and that for no other
cause then that euery man foloweth his owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:
and desireth not after the truthe. In the diet
<pb facs="tcp:18354:81"/>
and conference had lately at wormes.<note place="margin">In the yea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re. 1557.</note> Brentius and
the Adiaphoristes would not condemne Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and Osiander, bicause they were men lerned in
the tongues and liberall sciences. But hissed vs out
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany and laughed vs to scorne bicause we
refused to agree vnto the conference and diet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
those men were condemned. Some of our felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
(<hi>the Lutherans</hi>) pretend that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the
Zwinglians, but Brentius his praeface vpon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Iames Smidelins booke testifieth the contrary.
For here they go about to reconcile godly Luther
and Zuinglius, which is impossible. For who euer
heard that two contradictories could agree? Such
childish and impossible matters they be not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to affirme, which wil be counted teachers and
Masters of Christen religion, as though we and all
other were stockes and blockes. But surely we can
not embrace with quiet conscience the heresies of
Zuinglius and Osiander. Neither can we subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
and yelde to such as haue departed and seuered
them selues from Luther.<note place="margin">The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a zelous Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Truly if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
cleaued vnto the worde of God and Luther
and had not geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them selues to alteratious, or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them whiche first altered from Luther,
there should haue ben no dissension nor variaunce
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18354:81"/>
amongest vs, and al these mischefs which we see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
hang ouer our heades had ben escaped. Farder
although the Ministers which after our departure
remained in the conference at wormes, wrote after
and published it abrode that they woulde not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
from the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of Augspurg, yet in dede
they do cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. For while they wil not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the Zwinglians and the Osiandrines, they
can by no meanes agree with our Confession off
Augspurg: but in so doing, they be all ready depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from it. So haue they caused disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sion and remo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
all meanes of agreement.<note place="margin">Our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants haue vvell marked this.</note> For if they would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
with vs the foresaide errours of Zwinglius
and Osiander, then might we agree together aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst
the papistes. But no we whereas the Confession
of Augspurg teacheth that the Bloud and passion
of Christ is our righteousnes, and that the bread in
the Lordes supper is the body of Christ, this can
not possibly agree with the madnes of Zwinglius
and Osiander. Therefore these two repugne, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie,
they remaine in the Confession off Augspurg,
and yet go aboute to defend Zwinglius and Osian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>VVe therefore first and formest do condemne
for heretikes Caspar Swenckfeldius and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes
<pb facs="tcp:18354:82"/>
which do contemne and refuse the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> preaching of Gods worde. Secondarely we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the Secte of Osiander which holdeth no les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
grosse and impudent heresies.<note place="margin">Our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants a-recondem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned by the Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> Thirdly we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the Sacramentaries, Zwinglius and his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Fourthely we condemne the Indifferents
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> bicause in their churches beside the ghospell they
will haue mens traditions to be obserued. For the
ghospell admitteth no commaundements of men
to be kept in their churches. But these indifferents
coulour and counterfaite all thinges. to please the
Emperour they embrace the papisticall Masse and
religion, which yet they loue not in dede, and with
all this will seme to remaine in Luthers doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
Is not this to denie God and his holy worde? Is
not this to begyle and mocke the Emperour? Is not
this to faine the papisticall religion and counter fai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
the Lutheran? This is if any thing be, to halte on
bothe sides, to serue God and Baal, to please God
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and men. Fiftely we condemne this proposition: go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
workes are necessary to saluation.<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Luthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rans of Lipsia be Pelagians</note> Beside these

<hi>Thus farre Amsdorfius. Here we see this Lutheran

which all (except only the</hi> Swenckfeldians) <hi>do yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

Nowe where <hi>Smidelin</hi> denieth that amonge the

he tolde vs what is it that those Superintendents,
<hi>Amsdorfius</hi> and <hi>Nicolaus Gallus,</hi> condemne in their

            <p>In the booke of the Countes of Mansfeld aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst

<hi>The reader nede not to maruaile that Osiander to

sightely to be passed ouer, by the which he bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

<hi>If that Osiander</hi> saithe he <hi>or his aduersaries
bicause of this contention inschole pointes only are

saieth directly and plainly that the <hi>Swinglia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> doctrine

his doctrine, but also that their opinion is so pestife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

and execrable, that he doubteth not to pronoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce

that he affirmeth: who so euer swarueth in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikle

though that al other Superintendents and ministres

               <note place="margin">The ghos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pellers doubt vvhat the ghospell preacheth</note>

imagin this glose, that the ghospell preacheth
repentaunce vnproperly, vndirectly and by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the fourth saith, after a sorte and in some

or slacknes of belefe. The sixt saieth that it
reiecteth the small faithe. The seuenth saith that it
preacheth repentaunce not principally. Thus they
disagree amonge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues no lesse then the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
or Babylonians, or those builders of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols

here that Melanchthons diuines varie one from

true, then must we saie, that the doctrine of pena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce

not to the grounde of Christen religion, nor are
not necessary articles of the same. For <hi>Smidelin</hi> in his

As the heresies of <hi>Seruetus,</hi> of <hi>Illyricus</hi> and of diuers

it is that the Caluinistes and the Illyrica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s can

be not of the articles of this <hi>Confession</hi> or no. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<hi>Smidelin</hi> here awnswereth, he can not escape,
but he must buckle with the Illyricans. Yea <hi>Gallus</hi>

Adiaphoristes, but proueth plainly <hi>that they haue de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted like Apostatas from the Confession off Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spurg
in the most principall and waightiest articles

to be (alas) to true, all that I haue noted of the diuers,

that I am not the first that haue discouered this their
shamefull doctrine of matrimony. Diuers haue done
the like before me: and especially the vertuous and

Tarsus, and Macedonius of Constantinople haue straied. In
the third companye (as I sayde before) is Acacius, Meletius
and Eutychius. All their doings be vaine and wicked. For

writeth) hange yet in the penne: but I wil somewhat
shake the pen to see whether any will fall out. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is most euident. Suche an archeheretike, as in
our daies Martin Luther hath ben, neuer yet was see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in the churche: and therefore God neuer so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his wrath in this our miserable time. Yet God of
his mercie hathe geuen vs clere tokens and sure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to knowe and espie out this heresie, suffring
such straunge dissensions and horrible schismes to

so the deuill hath ben the father, inuenter, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

desirous to saue one, coueteth euidently to see and

               <hi>Significatiui, Signifiers,</hi> whiche affirme that in the

of the anltar) is not the true body, but only the signe
of the body. So Swinglius writeth in many and son

laieth to his charge, and as it may appeare in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
printed at Heidelberg) affirmeth the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arrhabonarij, Pleadgers,</hi> which are of the opinion,

Christ after it ascended in to heauen, was made god

of Christ is God.</hi> Therefore if ye aske howe
the body of our Lorde is in the Supper, they awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.

But the peculiar and speciall doctrines, of that man

in to heauen was made very God.</hi> This te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
manifestly his legat at Augspurg and his boo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
offred off late to a certain frend off his there.
Againe <hi>that euery man is endued with the same ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghteousnes,
the same wisedome, the same charite,
and all the same vertus with the which God is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
endued, of like worthines and in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and by this very diuine nature is God:</hi> Beside
<hi>that the same vertu or operation which is in the

               </gap> that is, <hi>the worde,</hi> as scripture termeth it. Thus
he writeth in his booke <hi>de duplici statu Christi, de vero
euangelij vsu,</hi> and in many other writings, whiche he
presented to a certayn frende. Truly this man wrote
many thinges not amisse, but these and many other
very euill: a man not so malitious as vnlerned in true
diuinite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Osiandrini,</hi> which saie <hi>that Christe iustifieth man
by his diuine nature onely, vtterly excluding his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite,</hi>
againe <hi>that a Christen man ought to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
with that very iustice where with god him selfe
is essentially iuste.</hi> farder <hi>that Christe the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
son of god according to bothe</hi> natures (<hi>off
god and man) as he was in his mothers wombe, is
the very same image after the which the firste man
was created. therefore when man in the sacrament
of baptim putteth on Christe according to bothe
natures (of god and man) that he is made the very
same image generally,</hi> not particularly as the ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vse to speake. And this is the meaning (sayth he)
of the wordes of S. Ihon,<note place="margin">1, Ioan. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that Christe is come in to sleshe.</hi>
Martin Luther in the yeare 1539 at <hi>Smalcaldiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> where
the Leage (or rather conspiracye) was then made,
preaching vnto the estats and orders of protestants,
interpreted these wordes of S. Ihon <hi>that Christe is come
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18354:112"/>
in to fleshe,</hi> after this sorte. <hi>That Christe came not
therefore in to flesh, that he might communicat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs his owne iustice or righteousnes, but that he
might accepte vs for iuste and righteous outwardly:
so that our inwarde man should not in dede be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
or made righteous from vniuste and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
but we should onely be accounted for suche
before God after the maner of acceptation: as in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
paste the Lacedaemonians made and decreed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
a God with these wordes. Alexander wil
be a God. let him he a God, and let Alexander be
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and accepted for a god, though he be no god.</hi>
And Luther saith that this doctrine was the sure
foundation vpon the which the Leage of <hi>Smalcaldiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
for the defence of the ghospell might and ought
right worthely be builded, erected and absolued. But
anon after when it came to <hi>Osianders</hi> course to prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
he toke the very same theme of S. Ihon that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did. But leauing the interpretation of Luther,
he interpreted it after his owne minde: in suche sorte
that it directly repugned Luther: as, <hi>that the very
essentiall iustice or righteousnes off God, proceding
and flowing out of the foresaide image off God
(which he calleth Christe) is planted in man.</hi> and at
the last, though preuely, he gaue them to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
that this his doctrine was the very iewell and treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of the ghospell: farre better then that of Luther:
<pb facs="tcp:18354:113"/>
in consideration whereof bothe the Leage and the
warre of <hi>Smalcaldium</hi> should be entred, made, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
And this sermon of Osiander was allmoste
the laste that was made at that meting: as I am able to
showe by the hande of Melanchthon. Thus Luther
for the grounde of his iustification would haue (as
in his owne printed disputation it is euident) a kinde
of relation and imputing, which is the lest of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that are, and in dede nothing. But Osiander put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
for his grounde the diuine essence, God him
selfe, whiche is all thinges. <hi>See howe iumpe these
two ghospellers and Archeprotestants mete in the very
highest point of our religion.</hi> Vpon this faint and
frickle foundation of two false and contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
was that leage of <hi>Smalcaldium</hi> stroken: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
ensued that lamentable and cruell warre, to the
greate waste and destruction of Germany, with the
murder of infinit thousands of men. Then experien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce

was, when in the yeare .1545. in a certayn litle

we shall speake more anon) he warranted v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

this his doctrine of imputed righteousnes, they might
boldely and hardely assure them selues of the victory

of Ihon Caluin do professe, and spreade abrode
these detestable and blasphemous doctrines against
God and man, as folowe.</hi> That god chefely created
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18354:114"/>

from the beginning predestinated him to mische<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe,
and therefore he coulde not choose but sinne.
That the sinnes committed by men are not onely
done by gods permission, but by his will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion.
That all sinnes committed of men are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
the workes of god. That god worketh in
men theft, horedome, aduoutrie, and all suche sinne
as man doth. That the lawe of god and the will off
god be oftentimes contrary, one to an other. That
the deuill by gods commaundement and will lieth
in mens hartes. That not onely God is the cause of
euil, but also doth inspire in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hartes euil though<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
to worke euill: so that men sinne not, but God

            <p>This yeare 1561. one <hi>Lucas Sternberger</hi> in <hi>Omoluke</hi>
a towne of <hi>Morauia</hi> being cast in to preson, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
amonge the <hi>Sternbergers,</hi> and in diuers other
places, bearing him selfe for a Minister of the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and scholer of Luther and <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> preached
and persuaded the people this doctrine that foloweth
for the true and expresse worde of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First he openly taught and confessed,</hi> That al su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="tcp:18354:115"/>
as worship the name of the Blessed Trinite
do imagin falsely the Gods. That the name of the
Trinite is vaine and superfluous, bicause that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
is no where expressed in holy scripture, beinge
also but one God in heauen. <hi>Therefore he forbad
that the same songe</hi> O veneranda Trinitas, O blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite
<hi>should be songe, and commaunded in his place
to singe</hi> O blessed goodnes of God.<note place="margin">Horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of a ghospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster.</note> 
               <hi>He wisheth also that
all the deuills of hell woulde come and cary awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye
this Trinite: saieng he can not tell whether it
be a man or a woman: yet that he is sure that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Trinite was ones a woman, which had thre hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondarely he confessed and taught,</hi> that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
was not true god but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only like other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, For
if he had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god he should haue descended out of he
auen in to earthe and committed the gouuerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the worlde here to Angels. That he was borne
only of Mary and Ioseph the carpenter and that he
exercised that crafte with Ioseph vntel the thirtyth
yeare of his aage. <hi>Beside he teacheth,</hi> That Christ
rose fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death not by his owne power but by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of god almightie: and that he worked no mira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle,
but by the power and operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of almightie god,
which had endued him with more excellent giftes
and graces then al the other prophets: adopting him
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18354:115"/>
for his son at the leghth for his vertuous and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
life, when he was baptised of Ihon in the Iorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yn,
and the voyce from heauen came downe saieng
This is my welbeloued son in whom I am delited,
so that Christ is not the son of god but touching his
soule onely, bicause in the crosse he commended and
gaue vp but his soule to god.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly he mocketh at the holy ghoste, saieng,</hi>
that it is nothing els but a pigeon. <hi>affirming beside</hi>
that nothinge is writen of his diuinite in all scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
nether of the olde testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nether of the newe
and that it is not knowen what is this holy ghost.
Finally he had rather returne to the cloyster, and
be a papiste, then to beleue in the holy ghoste.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthely.</hi> he will not the blessed virgin Mary
mother of god to be a perpetuall virgin, but that
she had before two or thre sonnes, and that she no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of wemen: and therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
nether she nor any other saints ought to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
or haue their holy daies kepte. <hi>Againe</hi> that
men ought to worke the Sonday. and reste the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday,<note place="margin">Note the grounde of nevve heresies novvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies.</note>
bicause in holy scripture the Saterday is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to be kept holy. But of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>day nothing
is prescribed nor appointed. for (as Luther taught)
nothinge ought to be admitted or obserued, which
<pb facs="tcp:18354:116"/>
               <hi>god hath not in expres wordes commaunded or
forbyd in holy scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftely he reiecteth holy baptim, calling it a diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
institution: affirming also that it procureth
nought els, but hell and eternall damnation, for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was instituted of god, not baptim.</p>
            <p>Sixtely as touching the blessed Sacrament of the
aultar he can neuer satisfie himselfe with mocking,
iesting, and scorning at it. for he saith the Iewes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
longe ago eaten vp the paschall lambe. and if any
thing were lefte they burned it. Finally he confesseth
he is of that opinion in this Sacrament, as Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon
is. For at a certain time hauing some communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
with him, but fewer then he thought, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited
all other by speaking to them in these wordes.

heresies published by <hi>Lucas Sternberg,</hi> it maye
and ought well be awnswered vnto them, that
though Luther neuer tought these matters expresly,
(which yet is to be doubted of) yet he gaue abundant
and sufficient occasion for these and all other heresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and schismes,<note place="margin">Luthers doctrine (to haue naught but expres scripture) cause off all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</note> onely in that he writeth and bableth

or obserued in the church, which was not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
euident and expresse in holy scripture. And what
other grounde hath this <hi>Lucas Sternberg</hi> to abolish al
truthe of our Christen religion, and to plante his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish
doctrines, then this lesson of Luther? For euer
he crieth. <hi>VVhere is it writen, where is it in holy
scripture that there be thre persons? VVhere is it
read that Christ in the vnion of his godhead and
manhood, should be the Second person in Trinite?
or that Christ is the true and naturall son of God,
and not a creature according to his euerlasting and
diuine generation? VVhere is it expressed in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that the holy ghoste it selfe is any other then
the euerlasting father? VVhere is it noted in holy
scripture that Mary the mother of Christe was a
Virgin before and after the byrthe, and that shee
continued a Virgin allwaies? In what place of the
Bible can we reade that the Sabbaoth daie should
be abrogated, and the Sonday instituted?</hi> And what
heretike I pray you maye not saie the like of all the
<pb facs="tcp:18354:117"/>
articles of our catholike faithe? For <hi>what scripture
hath</hi> saie the Anabaptistes <hi>that infants shoulde be
baptised?</hi> And the Swinglians. <hi>VVhat Scripture,</hi>
saie they, <hi>affirmeth that the true body and not the
figure off Christ his body is in the Supper of the
Lorde?</hi> Againe the Lutherans. <hi>VVhat place of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
saie they, <hi>dothe testifie that Christ instituted
the Masse in his Supper?</hi> Therefore if Luther had
raised vp no other particular heresie, yet this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
and cursed inoughe, that he taught nothing
to be obserued, or receaued in the church, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
god had expresly, directly, and in plaine wordes
commaunded or forbed in the Bible.</p>
            <p>To this heresie of <hi>Lucas Sternberg</hi> an other secte
directly repugnant and contrary rose vp very lately
at <hi>Pinczouia in Pole.</hi> in the which place two new gho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spellers
<hi>Petrus Statorius</hi> and <hi>Georgius Brandata</hi> teach
<hi>that there is not one God, but thre gods, and they
so diuers one from an other as thre men. yet that
the son is somewhat lesse then the father and the
holy ghoste. Againe that the Crede which the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
vseth to singe, is not to be called the Crede of
Athanasius but of Sathanasius.</hi> as you woulde saie
of the deuill. Certain noble men of Pole demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>Petrus Statorius and Georgius Brandata</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
they had lerned this doctrine being newe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
heard off before in Pole, they awnswered,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18354:117"/>
               <hi>It was the pure ghospell and very worde off god,
and the very same doctrine which they had lerned
of their masters, Caluin, Bullinger, Peter Martir,
and VVolfgangus Musculus. But the cause why it
was not before heard of in Pole nor abrode in the
worlde was that it pleased god to reuele to the
worlde this highe misterie and greate treasure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we

            <p>

that they do all with like endeuour and malice, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

            <p>This table of Heresies hath alreadye diuers times
ben printed in the Latin tongue, solde abrode, and
read of many: and although all protestants haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailousely
ben offended therewith, yet it hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
none more then <hi>Smidelin</hi> and his company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the politike protestants. For these consider the
matter depelyer then the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sectes do: and
perceaue very well, that this foule dissension of the
Lutherans being knowen will bringe at the length
their fifte ghospell to naught. But howesouer <hi>Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delin</hi>
turne and winde him selfe herein, wil he nill he,
he must of force confesse, that the Lutheran prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
which call them selues ghospellers, be at hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
dissension one with an other, and do brede and
foster vp, detestable and heretical schismes, so diuers,
so repugnant, so plaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictory one to an other,
that sooner you shall make fire and water, hotte and
colde agre, then their doctrines, and opinions. Where
of vndoubtedly it must ensue, that the euill thinge
consuming allwaie it selfe, and nothing being worse
<pb facs="tcp:18354:123"/>
then these cursed and dissensious schismes, they wil
in time spende them selues, consume, and come to
naught.</p>
            <p>But howe miserably comforteth <hi>Smidelin</hi> him sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
with this slight and slender argument when he
crieth out, <hi>Beholde, the doctrine of the ghospel doth
not onely not decaie, nor go to wracke, as the papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
hope, but encreaseth dayly in many places, and
is spread through out Christendom euen in those
places where the ghospell before was neuer heard
of?</hi> First howe true and worthy a comforte this is, I
reporte me to <hi>Smidelins</hi> owne conscience. For, but if
he be a very block, or els beside him selfe and starke
madde, he must nedes confesse, that these newe and
freshe doctrines which daily arise and springe vp to
destroie the olde and awncient religion, can in no
wise be called the pure and expresse ghospel. <hi>Smidelin</hi>
and his felowe Lutherans, which cleaue yet onely to
Luthers doctrine, are not so betle blind or ignorant,
but that they knowe and see very wel, what eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
doctrine hathe spro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vp of late in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de,
in Scotlande</hi> and in <hi>Pole.</hi> If they knowe it not, I
wil tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The doctrine preached in those countres
is partely of the Suinglians, partely of the Caluini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
some Laskonicall and some Anabaptisticall, but
all together deuelish and heretical.<note place="margin">In libello contra Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylum.</note> And although the
doctrine of <hi>Smidelin</hi> be not much better then these,
yet in his printed writings he openly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth, that
he accompteth none of the foresaide doctrines for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18354:123"/>
Christian or euangelicall. And in dede if he be of the
opinion that the <hi>Brentians</hi> are (as he pretendeth) he
must accurse and condemne as <hi>Brentius</hi> dothe, the
doctrine of the <hi>Swinglians,</hi> the <hi>Caluinistes,</hi> the <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptistes</hi>
and of the <hi>Stancarians,</hi> not onely for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but for many other articles

that it liketh them so to vse vs, we must take it

of S. Paule to acknowleadge and beleue in one

in persons and vocations, whiche should be
diuers and different? O horrible confusion. If there
were not beside this point, manifest and outragious
impietes of the Lutherans, repugning bothe to right
reason and to the worde of God, whereby we might
iudge howe pestiferous, abominable, and wicked the

            <p>Whereof spronge the insurrection of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

of personnes before God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> therefore there ougth to be
no difference of persons, no magistrat in the church,
but that all Christen men are fre, and therefore all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
distinct estats, dignites, and qualites as well gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
as small ought to be all one, and all a like. And
whereof arise these greate and enormous dissensions
in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only of this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
take awaie from the Catholike faithe all vnite and
agreement, and teache that euery man may be saued
by his owne priuat faith, which he forgeth him sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:126"/>
and that he maye for his owne person frely bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
what he listeth? Thus they would force the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
to a certain dissembling deceit, such as neuer
was heard of. As that they should suffer euery man
to beleue as he list, and set vp newe factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
against the vnite and agrement of our faith: But
the difference of vocations, qualites and degrees, as is
betwene lowe and high, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall and spirituall, priuat
and publike, they should no more suffer, but make all
estates co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, all vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s aequall, al trade of life one
and vniforme. If this be not to confounde heauen
and earthe, surely I knowe not what heauen and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arthe
meaneth. Colde which procedeth of water, is
of this nature that it knitteth and fastneth together
diuers thinges in to one masse and substaunce, and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>serueth them also in the same, as golde, siluer, bras,
tinne, leade, claie also, durte and wodde. But heate
contrairely resolueth and seuereth all these substa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unces.
So likewise the property of faithe is to knitte
ioyne and fasten together in one belefe, and in one
vniforme vnderstanding of Gods worde all nations
and all kinde of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, noble and base, princes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
men and women, riche and power, younge and
olde. But the workes of charite, the perfitnes of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
the choise of our vocation is lefte fre to euery
man, according to the qualite of his person, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his power and abilite. Wherein euery man
bestoweth his talent that God hath lente him, and
beareth the yoke laide on his shoulders gladly, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all waies forthe, and pricking him selfe forwarde
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18354:126"/>
with a sure and certain hope in God,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> who shal rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
euery man according to his good dedes and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his charite working seuerally with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
faith of Christes church.</p>
            <p>Nowe then if <hi>Smidelin</hi> be, I will not saie lerned, but
at the lest of any reason or iudgement he maye well
thinke with him selfe, that there is greate and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
difference betwene the common nature (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is one in all men) and euery particular man, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hath his proper and peculiar qualites and giftes
from God as it pleaseth his goodnes, some of more
price and value the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we see in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and
waightes. And therefore the olde holy fathers haue
so taught, that the grace of God is due neither to the
nature, nor to the person: and that, bicause god oweth
nothinge to any creature. It is therefore a very cursed
doctrine of the Lutherans, and abhominable before
God to chaunge the faith of Christendome whiche
oughte to be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Lutherans do chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge faith in to hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> one, and vniforme in all, in to
hope which euery man hath differently according to
his vocation. And contrary wise to make that euery
mans particular hope, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, and truste is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
faith of the Catholike church.</p>
            <p>Greate is the misery and greater the shame off vs
Germans that haue thus ben deluded. We persuade
our selues we are wiser, and see more. then all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
beside, yea then all our swete forefathers
euer sawe. But I thinke, and not without reason, that
it were greate wisedome for vs, if we coulde but see
and perceaue howe wise, graue, and circumspecte our
<pb facs="tcp:18354:127"/>
forefathers were.</p>
            <p>As for doctor <hi>Smidelin,</hi> I would earnestly counsel
him that geuing vp his Lutheran doctourship in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Smithes shop,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Smid.</hi> soundeth in the ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>main ton<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gue Smith.</note> he begin again his diuinite, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arne
of some parishclarke, why when he ringeth to
sermon he ringeth but one bel and that the greatest:
but when he ringeth to euen song or other seruice, he
ringeth many belles at ones,<note place="margin">A prety si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>militude.</note> bothe greate and small.
For here <hi>Master Smidelin</hi> maie lerne that the ringing
of one bel to sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> representeth the vnite of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholike
faith taught at sermons, which ought to be
but one and vnifor-me in all men. But the iangling
of many diuers belles to commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praier signifieth the
diuersite of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, some praieng feruently some coldely,
some seruing god one waie, some an other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet so
that euery waie cometh to one ende.</p>
            <p>But nowe M. Smidelin practising his smothered
smithish diuinite, runneth in rudely with his ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and tonges, and will nedes persuade men, that
the variete of vocations must be reduced to the vnite
of faith, and contrary wise that by their scattered and
ragged faithe (whiche they define to be euery mans
truste and confidence in Christe) all men maye fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleue as they liste, and frame them a faythe after
their fonde fantasie. Suche is forsothe the wisedome
and policie of our time passing our forefathers sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite:
and yet this blindnes they will haue vs to
winke at, and runne hedlong with the reste. Not
withstanding we, grounded vpon the authorite off
gods worde comforte our selues herein, that the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18354:127"/>
and agreement of our Catholike faithe is the
grounde of all truthe. But the variete amonge vs off
diuers vocations in the Catholike church, serueth as
a guide and meanes to trade euery man: that he so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his course in perfit hope and godly workes off
Christen charite,<note place="margin">Ro. 13. 1. Cor. 15.</note> that at length for his deserts (auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
onely through the merites of Christ our
Redemer) he may be counted for a starre or parte in
heauen litle or greate.</p>
            <p>To awnswer therefore directly to Smidelins ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
charging vs of schismes and dissensions (by
reason of diuers religions and vocations) we do plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
confesse, that in the doctrine of the Christen
faith, according to S. Paules commaundement, <hi>we be
of one minde and of one accord.</hi> And againe euery man
for his qualite and vocation endeuoureth to beare
his owne yoke, and cary his owne burden, some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
carefully and diligently then some: some this
waie, some that waie: according to the grace and gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of god, and as eche man vseth the same. And off
this diuersite of the giftes of god,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. The cause of diuers professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike churche.</note> and of mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
or abilite it cometh to passe, that among vs so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
for example of their conuersation, and to sette
before them as though it were a glasse of perfection,
do folowe and embrace the rules and steppes of olde

other of <hi>S.</hi> Benedict, of S. Dominicke, and of S.
Frauncis, euery man as his deuotion serueth.</p>
            <p>But let vs nowe see and consider the agreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and
variete of the Lutheran churches. In this point first
<pb facs="tcp:18354:128"/>
they do all agree, that according to their Christen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berte
planted first of Luther,<note place="margin">Luther rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth this in his boo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke <hi>de saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari potesta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te</hi> in the 6.

his scholers, there be no Emperour, no kinge, no
Magistrat, no prince. Againe that where such are, yet
they ought not be obeyed, but al must be aequal. that
the countre man ought to be as highe as the Noble
man: the Noble man as the Prince: the Prince as the
Emperour: that the parishe clarke oughte to be as

vycar. And this wilde and vnruly doctrine of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath so farre proceded, that not onely many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

other churches erected for gods seruice are wasted

            <p>Which counsel of mine I trust is more sincere and
godly, and will haue better succes, then the cruel and
vnmercifull aduise of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> in a litle booke
whiche he made laste of all, shortly before his soden
deathe at Wittenberg in the yeare. 1545. dedicating it
vnto two honourable Princes the Duke of Saxony,
and the Lantgraue of Hesse, that they should not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
their presonner the Lorde Harry of Brunswic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.
The title of that litle booke is this. <hi>Ad Electorem
Saxoniae &amp; Lantgrauium Hassiae D. Martinus Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
decaptiuo D. Brunsuicensi.</hi> And to the entent that
in these countres and euery where the worlde maye
knowe, howe Martin Luther tooke vppon him in
his papacie, and howe proudely he behaued him sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
I will out of his owne booke declare you worde
for worde the whole matter. These then are the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
of Luther.</p>
            <p>For my parte I would not passe,<note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the pride and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Luther.</note> if that captiue
of Brunswicke were kinge of Fraunce and his son
Kinge of Englande. For what coulde that hurte
me? But to counsell you to let him go fre and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
that I can in no wise do. He hath lost that
hope and confidence. For seing God dothe punish
him, who dare be so bolde as to absolue him from
Gods punishement, onles he first do penaunce, and
<pb facs="tcp:18354:135"/>
make due satisfaction, so that we maie boldely tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
that God is appeased and reconciled? otherwise
it shoulde be no other thinge but to tempt God:
whiche in no wise must be counselled.</p>
            <p>Luther would forsothe that the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swicke
were kinge of Fraunce. A likely matter truly.
But why suffred they him not to remaine Duke stil?
who gaue Luther authorite to punish the Duke?
Is not this against all lawes Canon, ciuile, and lawe
of nature, that a man in his owne cause may be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the Iudge? The ciuill lawe hath hetherto so
prescribed, that iff any debate fall oute betwene man
and man for iniury taken or geuen, that the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Iudge and lawfull magistrat should determinat the
matter: what? is the authorite of this lawe wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
also with the ghospell? or was not the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
the highe and ordinary Iudge of all Dukes and
Princes here in Germany? what hath Luther to do
herein? Is it against the doctrine of the ghospell that
the Apostle commaundeth vs to obey the higher po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wres?
<hi>There is no power</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> (saieth he) <hi>but from God. and he
that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordynaunce off god.
whiche who do, purchase them selues damnation. But we
muste not obey,</hi> saie they, <hi>an euill magistrat.</hi> but
what euil magistrat meane they? forsothe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
And who saithe he is an euill ruler? Luther and
his felowes. But he should well and substantially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
proued it, before he saide it. And would god we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18354:135"/>
had mo such Emperours. The daye will come that
we would be glad to scrape such Emperours oute
of their graues with our nailes, if we might so come
by them. But graunte they were tiraunts: whiche yet
who affirmeth, lowdely belieth them. Doth not S.
Peter saie,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye subiect in all feare to your rulers not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good and gentle but also suche as are froward?</hi> It was
not then Luthers part, but the Emperours bearing
the sworde as an higher power and minister of god,
to reuenge and punish malefactours. Nor Luther
hath no cause nowe so proudely to demaunde,
<hi>VVho dare be so bolde as to restore to libertie the
presonner prince?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> For he whose parte it was to do it,
was not onely bolde and able to do it, but did it in
dede princely: and scourged worthely those whiche
had offended. But nowe let vs see what punishment
and satisfaction this pope of Germany enioyneth
the Duke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVhereas this captiue, saithe he, is depriued of
his estat and dominion, he ought not to thinke that
this is a worthy punishment for his deserts, but
that, being touched onely gently, as with the flappe
of a foxe taile, he is but prouoked and inuited to
penaunce:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luthers penaunce.</note> 
               <hi>and thus he must saie. O most mercifull
god, whereas I haue deserued a greate deale worse,
and thou yet dost but whip me with small roddes,
verely I will gladly beare this punishment all daies
of my life: and I will vtterly renounce my dominion
<pb facs="tcp:18354:136"/>
and estate: as of the which thou hast moste iustely,
na rather most mercifully depriued me, and from
the which I am rightly and worthely thrust out.
for I am not as I perceaue nowe, fit to gouuerne the
same. Thou art iuste o lorde, and thou hast dealed
iustely with me, yet not according to my desert.
for as I saide before, we muste entreate with god
from the bottom of our harte, and obediently yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to his punishment if we do not so, he as the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and sercher of mens hartes, from whom nothing
is preuy and whom no man can deceiue, will ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
espie it: and if any man go aboute to deceiue or
delude him, he maketh his cause be it neuer so god,
starke naught: which all we Christen men knowe
well inoughe, or ought at leste to knowe.</hi> Marke he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
nowe diligently good Christen Reader. Nowe
Luther will haue this poore prince beinge prisonner
not to make his confession after the Lutheran or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that is, that he confesse his fautes onely to god
in his harte, but euen after the papisticall maner (as
touching the confessing of his sinnes by mouthe)<note place="margin">Luther is become a papist for a vaunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.</note>
will that he kepe nothing preuy from him or them
that shall be his confessours, nor be not so bolde as
to denie any thinge. what then must this penitent of
Luther confesse? Forsothe all those thinges, whiche
his open and notorious enemies do falsely accuse
him of: to the entent that, if being forced by cruell
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18354:136"/>
emprisonment he happe to yelde vp his owne right,
then all the worlde might thinke that his voluntary
confession was the cause of such satisfaction: for
they will haue him confesse, that he suffreth such
emprisonment worthely, and that for his deserts he
is thrust out of his estate and dominion: and that he
will neuer require it againe, but will of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
yelde vp all his right, and the right of his heires
for euer to his aduersaries and mortall enemies here
in earthe, abiding for and expecting an other estate
in heauen. Is not this thinke you a swete and pleasa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt
satisfaction, and merely inuented of Luther, and
very ghospell like? when the Lutherans offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Catholikes then in the whole penaunce
there can be founde no satisfaction. contrition suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
But nowe in this case, we must haue all thre

            <p>
               <hi>But nowe Luther to showe that he is not only

countres not without the instinct of the holy gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
either mercifully to admonishe vs to looke bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to our matters, or that the vaine prediction off
this false prophet Luther might by so euident and
true a prophecy be conuicted. For he that can not see
maye yet sensibly feele that this whole matter had
the very same euent that the coyne foreshowed, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
contrary and repugnant to Luthers dreame. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persuaded the simple germans that this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was fulfilled in Duke Harry then presonner: and
that thereby the popes dominion was vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied.
and therefore pricked forwarde the Duke
and the Lantgraue to fight and rebell against their
liege Souuerain. For thus he addeth yet farder in the

            <p>But nowe for whom they haue painted the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

was constrained to plucke him out again, and fall in
him selfe? all the worlde knoweth and seeth it. This
then lo is the first prophecy of Martin Luther in this
foresaide booke. Nowe let vs here an other straite
folowing hereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the entent,</hi> saithe he, <hi>that our conscience
be not burdned with the sinnes of an other, and we
be counted afore God as wicked Achab. For if he
be deliuered out of preson, the papistes withoute
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18354:138"/>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Note the Luthe rans God</note> 
               <hi>our God, and will crake after

VVe haue praied for the Duke Harry of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suicke,
and God hathe tried oure patience, but he
hath heard vs at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. For although he suffred
the Duke Harry to fall in to the heretikes handes
for our temporall punishment, yet they haue not
ben able to kepe him still, but were compelled off
God to dismiss him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers of the Carholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</note> 
               <hi>Thankes be to our God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hathe not forsaken the churche and awncient
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in dede true it is that this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
most moued me. For we knowe the pope and
his parasites be incurable therefore they can do
nought els, but euen in their moste miseries, and
wicked dedes comforte, coulour and tricke vp them
selues.</hi> His other prophecy whereby he woulde be
counted a thirde Elias, he confirmeth by this reason.
That the same must nedes be the right church off
Christ, whiche was able by their good praiers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
their princes in to liberte. Therefore if the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
Harry through the earnest and continuall prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the papistes were dismissed of his enemies, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
euery man will thinke verely that the papistes are
the true and right church of Christ. And this is true
in dede. For this reason therefore Luther (as he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
was most moued, in no case to suffer the Duke
to be sette at liberty, lest perhaps the papistes shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb facs="tcp:18354:139"/>
be taken for the true churche of God, and he and
his felowes for the maligne churche. Here let euery
man that lacketh not common iudgement, consider
whether Luther be not suche a prophet as Caiphas
was:<note place="margin">Ioan. 11.</note> For he prophecieth nowe the truthe, but as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iphas
did against him selfe and for the contrary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.
The Catholikes in dede praied continually and
earnestly for the emprisonned prince, that he might
escape out of his enemies handes. Luther wroughte
by force and by crafte all that he coulde to kepe
him continually in preson, and in his enemies han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
Whiche parte then did God heare? vndoubtedly
the righter and more iuste. For God is no vniuste
iudge, but paieth euery man according to his paines.
Therefore he succoured the presonner, deliuered
him, and so dealed with hym that he might saye,
<hi>Iudge me o Lorde according to my righteousnes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 7.</note> God the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
gaue the right and true sentence: and nowe
which parte and whose praiers were heard, the euent
declared.</p>
            <p>But howe laboureth Luther to ouerthrowe the
reason of the papistes (wherewith he was so muche
moued) and by that ouerthrow to set vp his prowde
and arrogant prophecye? The first parte of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he letteth sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and graunteth that God heareth
the praiers of his churche. But he laieth at the other
parte, and denieth stoutely that the papistes are able
to obtaine any thinge of God. For so he goeth forth
in his foresaide booke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:18354:139"/>
               <hi>Their praier therefore is not to be feared,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Reg. 20. Fol. E. 4, &amp; F. 1.</note> 
               <hi>no
more then Elias feared the praiers of the prophets
of Baal. But as he laughed to scorne their praiers
and their God, so we maye lawfully laughe to scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the papistes and their God. For we knowe their
praiers are execrable as their doctrine and belefe
is. According to that of the psalme, 199. Let their
praier turne in to sinne. And whomsoeuer they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache,
he can not chose but be condemned. Nether
are their praiers other, then such as the deuill ones
mocked, at what time a certain priest being wel ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
saieng his complet in his bead, and spetting,
as he praied,</hi>
               <note place="margin">O the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilite of Luthers sprit.</note> 
               <hi>letted also a greate farte: well quôd
he, Diuell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such praier, such frankensence. The like
maye be saide of all their mumbling in churches
and monasterys. For they can not praie nor wil not
praie, nor know not what to praie, nor how to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie.</hi>
The hereticall doctrine of Luther is so printed in
some mens hartes by the instinct of some euill sprit,
that they passe vppon no praier, beleue no truthe
no miracle, not God him selfe: but one worde of Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers
mouth more persuadeth them, be it neuer so
false, then God him selfe, or his worde, or the whole
Catholike church. Therefore if any man at that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
had ben so bolde as to haue saide, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like
churche shoulde throughe her deuoute praiers
<pb facs="tcp:18354:140"/>
obtaine the victory against her enemies, and that
this Duke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prisonner should be deliuered, and the
other (the Duke of Saxony and the Lantgraue) caste
in preson, that man had ben mocked and scoffed to
deathe: presuming so to contemne the authorite off
the thirde Elias Luther. And I doubte whether yet
vntel this daie some simple me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are deceaued by that
his prophecy: though the ende of this tragedy being
so open to all the worlde, geueth euident testimony
that allmightie God hath heard the praiers of the
papistes, and reiected those of the Lutherans: deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Duke Harry, and bringing the other two
Princes in to the Emperours handes as presonners.</p>
            <p>Nowe Luther to absolue and consummat this his

only thankes are due to the entent that he which

            <p>Is it not a greate pride and rashe arrogancy of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

See of Rome and estat of the Pope should then vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

did Luther prophecye in the booke aboue mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
And did the euent proue all this? Not one iote.
But in euery point it hathe proued cleane contrary.
Then this worde of Luther was not the worde off
the Lorde, as Moyses teacheth, but it was the worde
of the deuill in the person of Luther.</p>
            <p>Againe that Luther hath ben a very murderer of
men,<note place="margin">Luther is a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and a stronge thefe in the church.</note> and a stronge thefe in Gods churche, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hereby that his doctrine and vaine prophecyes
(setting together the princes by the eares) hath ben
the onely cause of all seditions, warre and bloudshed
that within this fourty yeares haue happened in Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many.
The first booke that Luther made to spoyle
and ransacke the churche, was his booke <hi>De Captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Babylonica &amp; Christiana libertate.</hi> In the whiche
booke he so debaseth, reuileth, and bringeth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
not onely the awncient true and Catholike
religion of Christ his churche, but also the lawes

bothe Canon and Ciuill, that it maye seme he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
but a head and capitaine to make a perfit sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But whereas at that time there was yet amonge
men more feare of God and reuerence to their
magistrats, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they would be moued with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

1523. setting forthe a booke entituled, <hi>De saeculari

            <p>These are our Christen princes which defende
the faith and deuoure the Turke.<note place="margin">In tomo 6. germanico. Fol. 602.</note> In dede worthy

I swere vnto you by God, that if through your
negligence this poore sentence ones take holde on
you, you are vndone, were you as mighty and of as

your storming any thinge profit you. The matter is

nowe that are not counted for villaines and fooles:
and that bicause they showe themselues for such:
and the people beginneth nowe to wexe wise, and
the plage of princes which god calleth conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
daily in the peoples hartes: and I feare me

sworde, take hede leste some man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde you to

saie peraduenture. If amonge the Christians there

howe then shall men be kepte in order,

saithe. Philip. 2. Thinking euery one superiour one

VVhere such men are, if any would make a

But what effect had this fifte ghospell of Luther
and his prophecyeng of the fall of Princes? forsothe
in the yeare 1525.<note place="margin">Sleidan in the 5. boo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke.</note> (that is two yeares after the setting
forthe of that his seditious booke) it sturred vp that

hoping that <hi>Muntzer</hi> shoulde haue sped of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
But afterwarde perceauing the princes to make

might not espie these his preuy fetches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelishe

forthe an other booke quite contrary to the former.
Which he intituled. <hi>Whether souldiars be in state of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
In that booke he writeth thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here the lawe itselfe speaketh,</hi>

obedience, and dread is due. Rom. 13. For he that

               <hi>and as Salomon saith, he that throweth

euen such is the lawe made of god and receaued of
men. For these two can not agre, to obey and yet to
rebell: to be a subiect, and yet to abyde no ruler.</hi>
Thus much Luther in that place. Here I beseche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God to geue the light of truthe to all good

<hi>that among Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there can not be, nor ought
no to be any higher power, or power at al.</hi> And why
wrote he so then? bicause that if the Emperour or
other princes would perhaps haue persecuted the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy

might lawfully haue slaien the Catholike Prince, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher
power and magistrat. Now in his other booke,
<hi>Of the state of souldyars,</hi> the ghospell of Luther tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
plaine contrary, that the higher power must
be obeyed: not onely good, but also the badde: to
punishe the seditious and put to deathe rebells. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

and if it proue prosperousely, then geue honour

To the entent therefore that euery common laie

vp this our simple treatise, a litle piece out of a booke
that <hi>Vince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius lyrene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sis</hi> wrote aboue twelue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred

            <p>A man peraduenture maye demaunde (<hi>saith he</hi>)
seing the Canon of holy scripture is sufficient off it sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
for all pointes, what nedeth the interpretation off the
Church to be added thereunto? to the which question he
answereth. For bicause forsothe holy scripture being depe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18354:146"/>
and mystical, is not of all men after the like sorte expounded:
but the sentences thereof some man expoundeth one waie, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
an other: that allmoste as many men, so diuers expositions
may be drawen thereof. For the Nouatian expoundeth it
one waie. Sabellius an other waie. Donatus, Arrius, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomius,
Macedonius, Photinus, Apollinaris, Priscillianus,
Iouinianus, Pelagius, Celestius, and Nestorius al founders
of sundry heresies, folowe eche of them their owne proper and
peculiar waie of interpreting holy scripture. Wherefore it
behoueth that in consideration of so many crekes and by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
pathes, the line of interpreting holy prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and directed according to the rule of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
and ecclesiasticall exposition. In the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
it selfe we must seriousely prouide, that we folowe onely
that which is receaued in euery place, at al times, of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. for
this is Catholike in dede and properly (as the worde it self em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porteth)
comprehending all vniuersally. This we maie so do,<note place="margin">Vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite Consent.</note>
if we folowe vniuersalite, Antiquite, and Consent. Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salite

which the holy awncient fathers haue lefte vnto
vs. Consent likewise, if in the antiquite we cleaue vnto the
determinations of all or allmoste all priestes, prelats, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the church. What then shall the Catholike and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man do, if any part of the churche cutte it selfe of from
the communion and societe of the generall belefe? What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then that he muste preferre the whole body before the
deseased parte? What if some newe infection plage not onely
some parte but the whole church? Then must he diligently
<pb facs="tcp:18354:147"/>
cleaue vnto the Antiquite or awncient receaued faith whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
can be seduced by no guile of nouelty. VVhat if two or
thre men, or some one cyte or countre swarue from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquite,
and receaued doctrine? Then against the rashe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a fewe he must set the awncient and vniuersall
decrees of some generall Councell. What if such doubtes arise
that no such decree can be founde? Then let him labour to
seke out and confer together the saiengs of the fathers, such as
though in diuers times and in diuers places, yet remaining in
the vnite and belefe of the Catholike church, haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> approued
for teachers and doctours of the same: and what soeuer he shal
finde that not one or two onely of them, but that al with one
Consent haue clerely taught, oftentimes writen, and continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally

we had not departed from our first faith, and
<hi>after the knowleadg of truthe haue turned away from the

pittes of hereticall doctrine,<note place="margin">1. Timo. 3.</note> forsakinge <hi>the grounde
and piller of al truthe</hi> the Catholike church of Christ.
For verely who so earnestly and diligently would
considre with him selfe, whereby it hath happened
that in these late yeares so many haue departed from
the catholike faith and yelded to newe doctrines
not heard of before, he shall surely finde the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
meanes thereof, to haue ben the onely light cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
geuen to newe preachers, and rashe beleuing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
newe tale in matters of conscience and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The cause of this our rashnes I will not serche
out, though it be ready to finde, our onely sinnes
and wicked life being the very proper cause thereof,
and nothing els. But the meanes as I saied, hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
ben light harkening to euery such as listed to
talke newe doctrine: the doctrine it selfe being plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and gladly receiued of those, which burdned
with sinne and wickednes, were gredy of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that in the doctrine was preached. according as S.
Paul prophecied saying,<note place="margin">2. Timo. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The time shall be, when men will
not abide holesom doctrine, but as such whose eares doth itch,
they shall gett them such teachers, as shall withdraw them
from the truthe, and turne them to fables.</hi> For hereof it
happened, that not regarding what he was that
taught, or vpon what reasons he grounded his doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
onely the pleasauntnes of it, as a bayte, choked
the hearers and prisers thereof. For euen as in the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

            <p>Nowe as we are suffred to fall in to sinne someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
not onely of infirmite, or for triall of our stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghth,
but also for the plage of other sinnes, as S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
in the first to the Romans declareth, so in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this lewde liberty so gredely embraced in
smaller pointes of our faithe, God hathe of his secret
and vnknowen iustice suffred vs to fall beside in to
such enormous heresies, though nothing pleasaunt
otherwise, to such detestable doctrine, to so diuers
and contrary opinions, that considering now the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of this tragedy, and seing to what issue it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceded,
(though truly I feare it be farre yet from the
issue and ende) I haue thought it a good and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
meanes bothe to staie somewhat this hedlong
race, that men so blindely runne in, and to call backe
such as haue passed all bondes of right belefe already,
by the very same meanes, by the which they first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to breake the araye of Christes church, and to
runne this madde and lamentable course. And bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
we may worke the matter euen from the grounde,
I haue thought good to consider the very first so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18354:149"/>
of the schismaticall seede of oure time: which
I do finde to haue ben Luther, and his scholer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchthon,
and Iohn Caluin.</p>
            <p>The first broker of this cursed bargain, whereby
many haue lost heauen and purchased hell, was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tin
Luther.</hi> The setter forth of the bargain and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Marchant of these perilous wares, was <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon:</hi>
who semed partly to perfit that which <hi>Luther</hi>
began, partly to amend with ciuill conformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
which the other furiously and beyond all reason bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
Of these two heades are nowe two monstrous
sectes swarming in all such places, as protestants and
ghospellers preuaile. That is the zelous, roughe, and
rigorous Lutherans cleauing fast to euery iote and
parcell of Luthers doctrine, as being the very euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
of this fifte ghospell: and the ciuill, softe and
Philosophicall Lutherans, which after the trade off
<hi>Melanchthon</hi> plucke vp in <hi>Luther</hi> such thinges as
they mislike, and plante of their owne such as they
liste. The third chief Master of late heresies, and prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall
founder of wicked doctrine hathe ben Iohn
Caluin: the head and Capitayn of the Sacramentary
secte. For though <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> may
seme his auncetours of a fewe yeares, yet he beareth
nowe the name and the stroke of all that cursed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte,
both bicause he hath writen most thereof, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
hath done most harme of any other.</p>
            <p>Truly who so knewe what maner of men these
were, what abhominable doctrine they haue taught,
how variable and inconstant they haue ben in their
<pb facs="tcp:18354:150"/>
owne sayings and doings, if he be a Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man and
feareth God, he will neuer forsake the whole corps
of Christendom, and the Catholike faithe of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred yeares, to folowe the priuat, newe, and
variable doctrine of their braynes. But it semeth they
are of a number vnknowen, and hereuppon rashely
beleued. I will therefore adde vnto this worke of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylus</hi>
a short discours, touching the doctrine of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
thre Archeprotestants of our time. For euen as the
intent and purpose of that vertuous and lerned man
<hi>Fridericus Staphylus</hi> in this his Apology by vs trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
was to reduce his deere countremen of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
wandering like straie shepe, to the flocke off
Christes churche againe, partly by discouering the
falshod of their guides craking of Gods worde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the right meaning thereof, and abusing the
vnlerned with false forged translating off the same,
which in the first and second part of his Apology he
hath done, partly also by setting before mens eyes
their greate variaunces and most clere dissensions in
doctrine (an euident argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of heresy) euen so our
intent and pupose is for the edifieng of such of my

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
cleaued vnto the plausible and pernicious doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of these thre Archeheretikes <hi>Martin Luther, Phil.
Melanchtho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> to make an especiall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
of their doctrine, bicause they are in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
aboue all other secte masters most folowed. For

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18354:150"/>
of our countre, are partly Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, partly Sacram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre)
are zelous and rigorous Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: that is, such as

prophet of God, the fifte Euangelist, and the third
Elias of our time. Some are ciuill Lutherans, gentle
and courtly protestants, which admit Luther so farre
as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> list, professing a kinde of indifferency in many
matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Melanchthon their first Master
taught them. The third sorte of protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the most
common and allowed secte in Englande, are the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentaries
of Geneua. Who are so greate in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre
and authorite, that the other are allmost of no acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
or reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther is a papist, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
is the right and vndoubted prophet.</p>
            <p>To the entent therefore that beside the generall
discours of Staphylus, the particular humours of our
countre may somewhat be serued, I haue thought it
necessary to annexe here vnto a particular discours
of these thre sectes, by examining the thre first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

we entend to treate of the Sacramentary secte,
as being the greatest sore of the corrupted body off

may be saied, (which would require a large volume,
and perhap; more tedious then profitable) yet these
fewe that we shal bring, may be sufficient arguments
to discredit the authorite of any one of them: which

yeares (as they pretend to be, and are taken for such)
it can not possibly be, but that their sayings and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
must sauour of the Apostles, holy Martirs, and
awncient fathers of Christes church, by whom the

amonge them selues, and with them selues,
(as especially you shall see in Caluin) if they forsake

olde condemned heresies: if they forsake the ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>There arose in Holland about twenty yeares past
one George Dauid, first a Lutheran protestant, and
after a most detestable Apostata, affirming him selfe
to be the true Messias and Christ. He liued afterward
in Basill certain yeares vnder pretence of a Lutheran
protestant, and naming him selfe Iohn of Bruncke,
he died at Basill: and but two yeares after his deathe
was espied to be that George Dauid, whom so many

the protestants of Bohem are allready come to
this point,<note place="margin">In the Iea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe 18.</note> where this heresie first began, and hath
most continued.</p>
            <p>But here peraduenture some ciuill Lutheran will
be offended with vs for vrging these wordes of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and charging him so farre therewith: and awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with their common distinction, saying. <hi>The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges
of Luther are of thre maner of sortes: to witt. some wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
before he thouroughly espied what popery was, some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
writen in vehemency of contention, wherein sometime
he showed him selfe to much passioned. some again that he
wrote in mekenes of spirit, and such to be taken for the very
pure kernell, and vndoubted verite of his ghospell.</hi> This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
and poore shift,<note place="margin">Sleidanus lib. 3. histo.</note> though Luther vsed it befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the Emperour at Wormes, and be a common cloke
of the ciuill protestants, to couer the filthynes off
their father, Luther: yet bothe it standeth litle with
the truthe of an Euangelist, as he termeth him selfe,
or of the third Elias,<note place="margin">In epist. ad Argentora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanchthon de vita &amp; morte Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri.</note> as his scholers call him, and will
neuer be graunted of the zelous Lutherans, <hi>Illyricus,
Gallus, Amssdorffius,</hi> and such other, which will not
departe from any one iote of Luthers doctrine. No
nor Luther him selfe cannot abide it. For thus he
writeth in his presumptuous booke against our late
Souuerain,<note place="margin">Tomo 6. fo. 436. edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis. an. 1553.</note> king Henry the eight. <hi>It repenteth me,</hi> saith
Luther, <hi>that I submitted my selfe so much before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
at VVormes, that I would suffer any man to sitt
Iudge on my doctrine, or heare if any man could conuince
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18354:154"/>
me of any errour. For I should not haue declared so foolish
an humilite, being sure and certain of my doctrine. Beside
that the same submission nothing auailed me before that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.
A man must be so sure and certain of his doings, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all the worlde be sett against him, yet he departe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
iote from them.</hi> Thus farre Luther. Where you see,
he confesseth not that he speaketh amisse sometime
by infirmite, sometime of a passion, but he maketh
him selfe to stande vpon a most sure grounde, so that
he can not saie a misse.<note place="margin">Tomo 2. fol. 35. sac. 2. contra cae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lestes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetas.</note> Likewise at what time <hi>Carolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stadius</hi>
suaruing from Luther, would so haue excused
him selfe, that at the beginning he was but weake in
the spirit, &amp;c. Luther awnswereth him, <hi>that the spirit of
God vseth no such excuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then: if the doctrine of Luther, be so sure and
constant, that it may not vary, will our protestants
and new Masters at home stande stoutely to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me?
Will they condemne all Councells, all holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
all authorite of the Church, all that Christen
people haue hitherto beleued? for these are the very
wordes of Luther, quoted you before oute of his
workes. Truly this were a compendious waie, not
only fot their purpose, but for the Turkes to. Yea and
for Antichrist him selfe. For when he cometh, can he
deuise any more politick engin to vnderminde Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stendom,
can he wish for any better harbengers to
prepare mens hartes and good wills to lodge him in?
waight the matter who listeth wisely and diligently:
he shall finde none like to this.</p>
            <p>Yet Luther, they will saie, leaueth vs holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:155"/>
which Antichrist will not do. Yea truly, but how
leaueth he it? I meane to be read of the vnlerned laye
man. Forsothe he translateth it in to the mother ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.
And how? sincerely and truly? I reporte me to
the second part of this Apologie, where you haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
how vprightly he hath dealed herein. As for the
common text which our protestants after their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Luther, do vse, and commaunde to be read in
Churches, we haue in our preface noted you in part
the truthe and soundnes thereof. But to show to the
worlde their fidelite and sincerite yet farder, I will
here specify some other places of holy Scripture alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and corrupted by them. And this I will do but

and yet were fouly deceaued.</p>
            <p>In S. Paule, where the latin hath, <hi>Iustificati ex fide pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem

who hath lefte vs their lerned commentaries vppon
that place, did reade as the common latin hath, to wit
<hi>Chrisostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius</hi> and <hi>Theophilact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In their translation also of the olde Testament,
their demeanour is not vnlike. For sometime, when
the ambiguite of the hebrewe worde or phrase maye
importe any other sence, then the common translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath, in such places as ouerthrowe their heresies,
they alter the text at their pleasure: sometime they for
sake bothe the hebrew and the greke according with
the latin translation, without any ambiguite at all. As
in some fewe places for example of many, we wil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
declare vnto you.</p>
            <p>In the psalme 118. the common translation readeth
<hi>Inclinaui cor meum ad faceindas iustificationes tuas in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

This text of holy scripture they haue corrupted for
the maintenaunce of their lewde liberty by only fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,

vpon what grounde trowe ye, haue they vttered this

But our protestants haue either ignorantly
or malitiousely forsaken the propriete of the hebrew
worde, the greke interpretation of the, 72. elders, the
lerned translation of S. Hierom, and the common la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
text in all Christendom alwaie receaued, to folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
ignorant Munster, and the corrupted notes off
Geneua. This is lo the worde of God which our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
pretend only to embrace. This is the pure
text which they force the vnlerned to reade. But let
vs now consider some other places, and see how gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spellike
our ghospellers haue behaued them selues.</p>
            <p>In the, 9. chapter of the ecclesiastes, the common
latin translation readeth thus. <hi>Sunt iusti atque sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
&amp; opera eorum in manu dei. Et tamen non scit homo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum
amore an odio dignus sit.</hi> that is. <hi>there are iuste and

But man knoweth not whether he deserue to be loued or

faith. This place bicause (according to the saieng of
S. Paule,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> bidding <hi>vs in metu &amp; tremore operari salutem

all the doings of the iust and vpright man are in the
handes of god, and that no man knoweth whether
he be in fauour with God or no, teaching vs in all
humilite and lowlines to repose our selfe vpon God
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18354:158"/>
and his goodnes, not vpon our owne faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
as the recheles protestants of our vnhappy ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
do, bicause I saie this text ouerthroweth this their
heresy, they haue here, as in many other places, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentered
to alter the text of gods worde it selfe. And
though in their alteration and departing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
text, these foxes tailes be all tyed and knitt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
yet in the newe inuention and placing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they beare their heads farre a sonder. For in the
translations printed in the yeares, 1549. and, 1551. thus
they reade. <hi>The righteous, the wise, yea and their workes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
are in the hand of God. And there is no man that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
either the loue or the hate of the thinge that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

thus they, reade. <hi>The righteous and the wise, yea and their
seruaunts also are in the handes of god. there is no man that

            </p>
            <p>As neither of these two translations agree with
the hebrew, greke, and latin, so do they bothe vary

<hi>There is no man that knoweth the loue or the hate of

and his ape our later english tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slations haue declared
here their ignoraunce, and geuen good warning to
the lerned worthely to mistrust their iudgment in
other places.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps you will demaunde, howe the
common latin agreeth with the hebrew and greke.
We awnswer according to the iudgement of the best
lerned and most expert in the hebrewe tongue, that
the latin translation hathe expressed the right sence
and meaning of the hebrew text, though it hathe
not folowed precisely the very wordes. One S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom
in stede of many shall counterpaise the fonde
and peruerted interpretation of Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
his scholers. His interpretation vppon this
place is this, <hi>Hic sensus est, Etiam in hoc dedi cor meum,
&amp; scire volui quos Deus diligeret, quos Deus odisset, &amp; inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
iustorum quidem opera in manu Dei esse: et tamen vtrum
amentur à Deo an non, nunc eos scire non posse, &amp;c. This is
the meaning</hi> (saith S. Hierom), <hi>this also I laboured to kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we
whom God loued, and whom God hated: and I founde
that the righteous were in the hande of God. But yet that
nowe (in this life) they coulde not knowe whether they were
loued of God or no, &amp;c.</hi> Thus farre S. Hierom. Whom
<pb facs="tcp:18354:160"/>
for his lerning and knowleadge in the propriete off
this tongue, for his approued vertu, and great antiqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te
we may boldely preferre before these vpstert smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
of our daies.</p>
            <p>Neither is it any vnwonte thinge in the common
translation to folowe the sence of the hebrew, leauing
the wordes: as in diuers places it is not vnknowen
to the lerned. In the second psalme, where the hebre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
readeth, <hi>Osculamini filium,</hi> Kisse ye the Son, the
common latin translation hath turned it <hi>Apprehendite
disciplinam,</hi> Receaue and embrace discipline, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
not the visitation of the hande of God, &amp;c: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
to be the right and proper vnderstanding of that
place, beside other authorites the iudgement only off
<hi>Ionathas Targu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The hebrew hath <gap reason="foreign">

these tongues whether the wordes of these textes
aunswer not worde for worde to the first translation
brought by vs. True it is that in the greke text the
worde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is ambiguous, and may signifie to mingle

ambiguite, from whence the greke was deriued,
nor the latin which folowed the greke, that worde
must nedes be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such sence as the greke receiued
of the hebrew, and as the latins folowed in the greke.
Therefore the french translation of Caluin, and our
english folowing the same, is not the worde of God,
nor the text of holy scripture, but the worde of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
and his text. What may not heretikes do, if they
maye sette vs forthe their worde, for the worde off
God, their imaginations for holy scripture, their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonned

places of holy scripture they haue altered, peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

despeare their amendment, when they shall see,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:18354:161"/>
and fele their falshood discouered and broughte to
light: seing that in the later translations they betray
sometime their former iuggling: as in certain places
here noted by <hi>Staphylus</hi> of Luther it is euident. For
although (as we saied in our preface) of all the places
corrupted by Luther, and noted here by <hi>Staphylus,</hi>
there is but one readen in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon translations off

write plainely, <hi>that the congregation ought to be bounde to
no certain tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation, but that euery man may turne the text

see by this bare text of scripture left of Luther (more

of so many and diuers translations, to be a very bare

            <p>For when a doubte ariseth in holy Scripture (as

Let vs then see what that text hath. I meane
not the barbarous text of <hi>Munster,</hi> nor the lerned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of <hi>Quinquarboreus,</hi> but that text, which beinge

thus. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. That is. <hi>Take and eate
this which is my body.</hi> Here the hebrew text though it
haue some one worde more then the latin and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

Catholikes, and fighteth directly against the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</p>
            <p>But let these interpretations by helpe of tongues

cause that disableth so many witnesses, so lerned, so

that praier for the dead was bothe superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

as purgatory is, could not be iustified by Scripture.
and that the auncient fathers before the time of S.
Gregory acknowledged no suche place, nor praier
for the dead in such sence as the Catholikes now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
it and vse it. This sermon also hath ben thought
worthy to be printed and sette forthe to the vewe of

Master Grindall, why we ought not to praie for
the dead: and it containeth two partes. First that we
haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in Scripture to praie for the
soules of the dead, but the place of the Machabees: and
then that the same place is not in the Canon off the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As touching the first parte, I awnswer it, that we
are commaunded of S. Paul,</hi> Tenere traditiones quas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepimus
siue per sermonem siue per epistolam, To kepe suche
traditions as we haue receiued either by worde or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<hi>And S.</hi> Chrisostom <hi>telleth vs that it is a tradition
of the Apostles to pray for the dead. these are his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>

things, <hi>saieth</hi> Chrisostom, were not without cause decreed of
the Apostles that in the dreadful mysteries we should reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre
the dead. For they do know that it shall much auaile them.

decree of the Apostles to pray for the dead, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
being not expressed in scripture is called a traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And S. Paul biddeth vs kepe such traditions. ergo
we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in Scripture to praie for the

               <note place="margin">Iac. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Againe are we not commaunded in scripture to

extende? doth it not reache to all those
whose sinnes are remissible, who are in the state to
haue their sinnes forgeuen? What then if scripture tel
vs that after this life some sinnes are forgeuen? Ought

            <p>What will you replie M. Grindall, or what can you

            <p>Nowe Sir as touching the second parte, that you

these bookes. But <hi>S. Augustin</hi> denieth them not to be
of the Canon, as you do M. Grindall, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
of your heresy, though it had ben much
then for his vauntage, and might soone so haue stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the heretikes mouth, if he had thought it the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Catholike bishop, to flit from scripture when
vauntage serued. His obedience to the Church off
God, his lerning and vertu taught him to cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church in determining holy Scripture, and to
seke other meanes to awnswer heretikes. Therefore
notwithstanding the facte of <hi>Razias,</hi> who semeth in
that booke to be commended for killing him selfe,
he acknowledgeth the bookes for Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and teacheth vs also how such examples in
holy Scripture are to be read. These are his wordes.

as one that tendred the cyte, and a man of a very good name
&amp;c. But his deathe more straunge and wonderfull then wise
and discret is declared of the scripture howe it was done, not
commended as if it ought so to be done. But it is our parte as
the Apostle teacheth vs, to proue and trie all thinges and to
holde that good is. And this Scripture which is called the
Machabees, the Iewes in dede receiue not, as the lawe, the
prophets, and the psalmes. But it is receaued of the church not
vnprofitably, if it be read and heard with discretion.</hi> Thus
farre S. <hi>Augustin.</hi> In whose Wordes you see M. Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall

the <hi>Machabees</hi> for Scripture, and that receiued off the

in these bookes: not (as you obiect in your

greke copies that lacke that place of praieng for the
dead, if you haue sene any such M. Grindall, you may
rather thinke they are corrupted of some olde or new
Aerians, heretikes, as you haue heard, in that point,
then to doubte of the common receiued text of holy
Scripture. els what heresy is there that may not esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
by this shift, if it may be lawfull vpon variete off
copies (which may rise of sundry causes, as well the

of holy scripture, which ought without all doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>You go forthe M. Grindall and you saie.<note place="margin">Praier for the dead ought to be vsed, thoughe no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it.</note>

therefore condemne the practise of the vniuersall
Church, which is clere and euident in this point?
What example in Canonicall scripture haue you off

And did not thinke you the Anabaptiste laugh in

Especially when you concluded afterward so stou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tely

why? May not the Anabaptiste saie vnto you, iff yow
hadde him in consistory before you? Most certain it
is my L. if baptising of infants and babes were so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:171"/>

and all the fathers of the Ephesin Councell, We ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

make a rule of your selfe withoute Scripture, and will

you conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne all the Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people of England that

blushe you not at so lowde a lie? I am sory you did
so farre forget your self. You spake then in pulpit, and
now you speake in print. These two conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, truthe, and honesty. And how shall
I proue you the contrary? where shal I beginne? I sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
yow before out of <hi>S. Augustin</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
that <hi>Aerius</hi> was condemned for an heretike, euen for

S. <hi>Gregory?</hi> Your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des Cario<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Pantaleon can tell

these wordes may seme to haue escaped you (though
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18354:173"/>
if they had in pulpit escaped, yet in print they might
haue ben corrected) for euen in your wordes folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
you remembre your selfe better, and then you
runne to your distinctions, and you saie. <hi>If the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient
fathers when they praie for the dead, meane of the dead,
which are already in heauen and not els where, then must we
nedes by their praier vnderstande either thankes geuing, or
ells take such petitions for the dead for figures of eloquence
and exornation of their stile and oration, rather then neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
groundes of reason of any doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howe can you suppose M. Grindall any such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning
in the olde fathers,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fathers praiyng for the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ad, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by M. Grindall: vaine and foolish.</note> as though they were either
of so litle wisedome, as to praie for those that neded

and perfit blisse which are already in heauen? Let vs
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider your maner of reasoning. <hi>It is manifest saie you,

which you ought well and substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

But how better and trulyer saie we M. Grindall,
it is manifest that those holy fathers, seing they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied
for the dead, that they ment vndoubtedly there
was a purgatory or third place? You suppose they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed
only for such as were already in heauen, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupon
you make your distinctions. But as your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is a point of sophistry called <hi>petitio principij,</hi>
and beside all reason and truthe, so are your imagined
distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vaine and foolish. Wil you haue clere and

euident proufes that the fathers praiyng for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad
meaned nothing so, and that your suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is voi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
of all truthe? Or will you be contented hereafter
that praier for the dead be solemnised in your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

In these wordes M. Grindall we lerne the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the fathers prayng and offering sacrifices for
the dead, not to be allwaies thankes geuings or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of eloquence, as yow woulde haue them mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
but to be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only thanckes geuinges, when they
are offred for such as haue departed this worlde in a
perfit estate, and vprightnes of life. For other depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as sinners but not extreme hainous, and wicked,
they are, he saieth, <hi>Propitiationes,</hi> propitiatory sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that is, such as purchase fauour and mercy at Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds
hande. The third sorte of men though Christned,
yet being <hi>Valde mali,</hi> that is, so euill that they die wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
true repentaunce, they auaile not at al. We kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
well M. Grindall youre doctrine beinge builded
vppon onely faith, admitteth not these distinctions
of the estates of men. But the Catholike churche
which condemned your heresy of onely faith in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nomius</hi>
and <hi>Aerius</hi> aboue twelue hundred yeares past,
as you heard before, acknowledgeth them and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
them. By the which distinctions also we lerne
the meaning of the church praying and offering sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
for the dead.</p>
            <p>As for the figures of eloquence Master Grindall,
which you imagin the fathers vsed praying for the
dead, is a figure of your owne called <gap reason="foreign">

lye. But you saie, yow can showe by examples that
the fathers so meaned. Let vs heare and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what
<pb facs="tcp:18354:175"/>
they are. You saie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I will make this matter more plaine by an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or twaine, &amp; caete.</hi> And then you bringe the wordes
of S. Ambrose affirming first, <hi>Theodosium frui luce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petua,
tranquillitate diuturna, &amp; pro ijs quae in hoc gessit
corpore muner ationis diuinae fructibus gratulari: to enoiye
perpetuall light: and continuall quietnesse, and for those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
that he did in this body to reioyse in the fruition of Gods
rewarde:</hi> and yet afterward praying for him in these
wordes. <hi>Domine da requiem perfecto seruo tuo Theodosio,
requiem quam parasti sanctis tuis. Lorde geue rest to thy
perfect seruaunt Theodosius, the reast, I meane, which thou
hast prepared for thy Saints.</hi> In the first wordes, say you,
he pronounceth plainly that <hi>Theodosius</hi> was vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
saued, and in the later he praieth for him, vsing
a figure of eloquence and vehemency of affection.
Here ones again M. Grindall you turne the cat in to
the panne, and reason <hi>tout au rebours</hi> as the frenche
prouerb goeth, euen as you did before: for as then
you woulde ouerthrowe praier for the dead, bicause
you supposed there was no third place, whereas the
third place must nedes therefore be, bicause the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
praieth for the dead, so nowe the praying off <hi>S.
Ambrose</hi> for <hi>Theodosius,</hi> you call a figure off eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and vehemencie of affection, but his wordes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
Theodosius you call a certain persuasion,
and plaine pronouncing of his vndoubted saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
whereas in dede the wordes of S. Ambrose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<hi>Theodosius</hi> procede of a vehement affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and loue towardes that Emperour (for how coul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

            <p>Againe what difference is it M. Grindall to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie.
Lorde geue reast to thy seruaunt, and to saie, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
haue mercy vppon the soule of thy seruaunt? For
to the departed out of this worlde no other rest can
be geuen but to his soule: iff his be so, why are they
called papistes, which vse so to speake, and yet S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
so speaking is no papist?</p>
            <p>But what stande we so longe hereuppon? I wil as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
one question, and so passe to your allegation off
Chrisostom. <hi>Faustina</hi> a vertuous woman lamented
much the death of her Sister. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> writeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

your sister, but praie for her, and commend rather her soule,
to God with oblations, then mone and morne it with tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
I aske here. Did <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> will <hi>Faustina</hi> to leaue
her lamenting, and fall to figures of eloquence, and
so to vtter her vehement affection to her sister? do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
your wisedome iudge so Master Grindall? Or
do not rather all wise men see, howe farre from all
<hi>witt</hi> and wisedome this shift of youres is?</p>
            <p>Well; though perhaps ye spake but merely here, yet
you haue a sadde testimony out of Chrisosto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he

gather hereof M. Grindall? <hi>This oblation therefore,</hi> saie
you, <hi>is only a thankes geuing to God for the Saints of God
departed.</hi> Will you gather so M. Grindall? that is to

            <p>

It is the doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> in his booke <hi>de Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana
libertate,</hi> and diuers other places, that faith ought
to be free, and no man constrained thereunto. In our
countre also, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sworde was against them, <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi>
and his felowes cried for that liberty, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
they cease not continually to crie for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
It was the olde accustomed maner of al heretikes,<note place="margin">Epi. 20 4. et co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Peti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lianu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saepe.</note>
especially of the <hi>Donatistes</hi> as <hi>S. Augustin</hi> in sundry
places witnesseth.</p>
            <p>Likewise before these heresies were fauoured off
Princes and authorised of higher powers, the riches
and possessions of Bishops was a great eye sore to all
Lutherans and protestants. Nowe they can like well
the pompe of Prelats, being placed them selues in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
preferment. But their former griefe was an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
grudge of the olde heretikes <hi>Vadiani</hi> as <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>

them.</p>
            <p>What is nowe more common in the mouth of all
protestants, then that nothing ought to be added to
the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God? For by this short blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
they wipe awaye all constitutions and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unces
of the Churche. They lerned this argument
off <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, who vsed it against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions

They appealed to only Scripture and would be tried

            <p>Aduise your selues now (good Christen readers)

persuade our selues that the very sprit of heresy spake
in Luther and speaketh in all new ghospellers, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

haue protestants departed from the olde Catholike
religion, and embraced the new doctrine of Luther?
they saie forsothe bicause all thinges are reformed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

What meane they trow ye herein? truly I do not

of this new fangled faith, if they meane truly, must
nedes meane the renewing of such heresies, as were in

they folow doctrine practised in that time: that is of

many frames and facions, as there be amonge them

administration of the Sacraments, through their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilite,
see in what maruailous vnite their churches be
directed. At <hi>VVittenberg</hi> where the see of these ciuill
protestants is, foure Sacraments are approued and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred:
to witt. baptim, the Supper of our Lorde,
Holy Orders, and Penaunce or absolution. At <hi>Lipsia</hi>
thre only take place, holy orders being wiped awaie.

First those of <hi>Strasbourg, Costniz</hi> and <hi>Memming</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred

ecclesiasticall iurisdiction and authorite off bishops:
whereupon <hi>Melanchthon</hi> was expresly commaunded
to yeld no farder.</p>
            <p>Fourthly whereas in that confession presented to
the Emperour in the yeare 1530. in the tenth article
we reade this, <hi>They teache that the true body and bloud of
Christ is truly present in the Supper vnder the formes of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad

being printed at <hi>VVittenberg,</hi> they frame the same ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
after an other sorte, and write. <hi>That the body and
bloud of Christ are truly present and distribued to those
which receiue in the supper:</hi> By the which addition they
exclude all reseruation of the blessed Sacrament, for
the sicke, and tie Christ to the pleasure of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.
But in the yeare 1540. wading furder in the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of heresy they make that same article yet fouler.
For this they saie. <hi>That with the breade and the wine the
body and bloud of Christ is truly exhibited to those whiche
receiue in the Lordes Supper.</hi> Thus lo at the length this
monster of Luther was brought to perfection, I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
his proper heresy about the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But what?

Catholike, but the deceiued protestant may euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iudge and pronounce, that this mans doctrine can
not be of god, and his holy Spirit, which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of truthe and vnite, but is of the diuel and his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
sprit, which is the sprit of falshood and dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For truthe is allwaies vniforme and agreable with
it selfe. And as the philosopher saieth of vertu, so in
truthe there is but one waie to hitt the marke: a man
may shoote aside diuers waies. Wherefote two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
sayings maye bothe be false and vntrue: but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
can neuer stand with a contrary. Who then tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
contradiction, as he must nedes teach some fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
so possibly he may teach al false, and beside the
marke: euen as it happeneth with all heretikes, that
leaue the common highe waie of their forefathers,
and seke out by pathes of their owne inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
the faster they runne, the farder they straye, and
the harder they finde the right waie againe.</p>
            <p>Secondarely as touching the repugnaunce that is
in Caluins doctrine against the expresse worde off
God, I will also by two maner of waies declare. First
by a number of his propositions and assertions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

first the absurde doctrine, that he leaueth vs in

               </gap> denieng that we eate in dede the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
of Christ otherwise then by faith. Nowe let vs see
what absurdites folowe thereof.</p>
            <p>First no scripture hath this doctrine.<note place="margin">That vve receaue not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ his body poo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red vpon vs in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cap. 8. de fide.</hi>
               </note> And how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde
a thing it is to folowe any doctrine without
Scripture Caluin him him selfe telleth vs. In his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
thus he writeth. <hi>I ought not to seme to
any man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious, that I staie so earnestly vpon this point
that it is not lawfull for the Churche to make any new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that is to teache or deliuer for truthe any more then
the Lorde hath reueled by his worde. For wise men do see ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we
<pb facs="tcp:18354:194"/>
great a danger that is, if so much authorite were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to men. They see what a windowe is opened to the mockes
and scoffes of wicked men, if we sayie that to be taken for
truthe among Christians which men shall thinke good.</hi> Let
now then any scholer of <hi>Caluin</hi> showe in all Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
where it is writen, that Christ by the vertu of his
spirit pooreth downe vppon vs the communion off
his body. For <hi>Caluin</hi> as he writeth in his Harmony v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the ghospelles, thinketh it an absurde thinge to
saie that the flesh of Christ it selfe should be deriued
vnto vs. But he sayeth the communion of Christ his
flesh is deriued vnto vs (which he interpreteth to be,
<hi>a quikening vertu out of Christ his flesh</hi>) correcting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
promising vs his very flesh.<note place="margin">In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment. in. 1. Cor. 11.</note> Now (as I saied) of the
deriuation of any such communion of Christes fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she
no Scripture mencioneth. But it is a sophisticall
suttelty of Caluins imagination not reueled in any
place by Gods worde. This is lo then one dangerous
absurdite by the confession off Caluin him selfe:
onles perhaps he haue some priuiledge more then
the whole Churche hathe. For in the Churche he
alloweth nothing beside the expresse worde off
God.</p>
            <p>Againe let vs consider what is the communion of
Christ his body poored downe vpon vs. It is saieth
Caluin, <hi>vis quaedam viuifica ex Christi carne in nos diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment. ut. 1. Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>a certain quickening power poored downe vpon
vs out of the flesh of Christ.</hi> Christ saieth in S. Iohn, <hi>that
his flesh is meat in dede,</hi> and biddeth vs eate his flesh and
drinke his bloud,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> and in the other thre Euangelistes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18354:194"/>
he saieth <hi>Eate: this is my body:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lut. 32.</note> but <hi>Caluin</hi> saieth, we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
the bread,<note place="margin">Mar. 14.</note> and haue a certain quickening power out
of the fleshe,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> not (as in his Harmony he saieth) the
flesh it self, and that we haue a communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his body
poored downe vpon vs, which is not to eate the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as Christ badde vs. This lo is not only beside scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but expresly against holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thirdly where Christ biddeth vs eate his fleshe,
saying,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> 
               <hi>he that eateth my fleshe abydeth in me,</hi> he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
an action on oure part, touching the receiuing
of Christ: But where <hi>Caluin</hi> telleth vs, that a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Christ his body is deriued vnto vs, he putteth
no action on oure part, touching the receiuing off
Christ, but only touching the eating off the bread.
For we eate not the body of Christ by Caluins do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the same body is deriued
vpon vs, and poored downe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we suffring such
deriuation and infusion. Therefore betwene the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Sauiour and the doctrine of Caluin, there
is as much difference as betwene doing and suffring,
action and passion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly what meaned Caluin to imagin this
communion of Christ his body to be deriued vnto
vs, and not the body it selfe? He might haue muche
peuish meaning beside, which perhaps they onely
know, that are admitted to the secrets of his misteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
as the <hi>Electi</hi> of the <hi>Maniches</hi> were. But this one
thing I am sure he meaned, that bicause communion
importeth a number of communicants, and one alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not communicat (which is the cause, why the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<pb facs="tcp:18354:195"/>
sacramentaries require allwaies a number at their
table) therefore he would haue no receiuing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste
without a communion, nor any other receiuing
of Christ, then by hauing a communion of him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
vnto vs. Let vs suppose then (as it maie easely
happen) that amonge the numbre of all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat,
one onely be a true and vpright beleuer, and
all the rest euill and miscreants, as among so diuers
sectes of protestants none other are to be found, but
such as for feare or otherwise sitt downe amongest
them, being no protestants in dede, though in this
point no good catholikes neither. But let vs suppose
that at the table of the protestants, one onely were
faithfull and duly prepared thereunto.<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Caluin destro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s.</note> It will folow
that bicause according to the doctrine of Caluin the
infidel and wicked receiueth only the signe and bare
bread, the faith full person remaining alone through
the infidelite of other, shall not receiue Christ nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For being alone he can haue no communion of
Christ his fleshe deriued vnto him, euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion
importing a number, as these men saie. Now what an
absurdite is this, that the good man shall not receiue
Christ in the Sacrament, bicause euill men receiue
with him, or bicause he can haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of good
men?</p>
            <p>Fiftely if the communion of Christ his flesh be
deriued vnto vs by the Spirit of Christe, then the
Spirit of Christ serueth the fleshe as an instrument.<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note>
Which Caluin in his institutions expresly saieth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Spirit of Christ, a <hi>cundyt pipe by the which the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18354:195"/>
flesh of Christ is deriued vnto vs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Caluin.</note> Nowe beside that this is
a horrible blasphemy, to make the Spirit of Christe
which is his godhead, inferiour to the flesh of Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste
as an instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the same, it is also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to al
reason and common course of nature. For the fleshe
serueth well in thinges created, as an instrument
whereby the Spirit showeth forth his operations, as
by our eies we see, by oute handes we feele and so
forth: but the Spirit neuer serueth the fleshe, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
may be saied to be an instrument of the same.</p>
            <p>Last of all if the due eating of Christ, is to haue
the communion of flesh deriued vnto vs by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
whereby we receiue life, then the vnworthy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Christ is the communion of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. How
shall that be deriued vnto vs? by the Spirit off Christ
to? what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be a more horrible blasphemy? by some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
sprit? that were the doctrine of the <hi>Maniches.</hi> And
yet if it be true that the due receiuing of Christ is no
other thing, but to haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of him deriued
vnto vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truly the vnworthy receiuing of Christ
must nedes be a communion of damnation deriued
also vnto vs. Lo in what absurdites Caluin hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
him selfe by departing from the Catholike
faith. For keping the Catholike doctrine, none off al
these absurdites shal ensue. Wherefore it semeth I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
well saie nowe to Caluin, and all suche as folowe
this his doctrine, that which <hi>S. Augustin</hi> saied to the
Arrians.<note place="margin">Tract. 20. in Ioan.</note> 
               <hi>Ego secundum fidem Catholicam Video quomodo

But thou being al compassed in, arte to seke
whiche waie to gett oute. And euen so fareth it with
<hi>Caluin.</hi> For leauing the sure knowen doctrine of the
catholike Churche, teaching vs according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Christ his owne wordes, that we eate his
fleshe and drinke his bloud in the blessed Sacrament,
and imagining a communion of Christ his fleshe to
be deriued vnto vs by the Spirit of Christ, as by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undit
pipe, you see what hainous blasphemies and
brutish absurdites he is forced withal to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse. And
this point by vs nowe examined, is the chefest Kaye
of all the Sacramentary doctrine, which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
nought and full of absurdites, declareth that all
the store within is of no better stuffe. And that shall
you anon see, and sensibly feale, if priuat preiudice
haue not vtterly bereued you of common sence.</p>
            <p>Caluin in his commentaries vpon the first to the
Corinthians,<note place="margin">In 1. Cor. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1.</note> disputing howe we receaue Christ in
the blessed Sacrament, concludeth his whole disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in these wordes. <hi>I conclude</hi> saith he, <hi>the body of
Christe is geuen vs in the Supper really, as they commonly
speake, that is truly, to the entent it may be holesome foode for
oure soules. I speake after the common fashion, but I meane
that oure soules are fedde with the substaunce of Christ his
body, to the entent we may be made one with him, or, which
is all one, that a certain quickening vertu is poored vpon vs
oute of the fleshe of Christ by his Spirit, though it be farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from vs and be not mingled with vs.</hi> In these wordes
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18354:196"/>
Caluin vttereth two strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge doctrines. First that our
soules are fedde with the body of Christ, secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darely
that we receaue the body of Christ really and
truly, though he saie after that body to be farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from vs, meaning that it remaineth only in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen:
as in the very nexte wordes folowing he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p>As touching the first point, if oure soules are fedd
with the body of Christ by eating the sacrament, we
must lerne whether he meane the soule onely to be
fedde and not the body or the body also to eate the
fleshe of Christ as well as the soule. Caluin meaneth
the soule onely to eate the body of Christ. For in his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon the sixte of Iohn, he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth
our eating of the sacrament to be the worke of our
faith, and saith farder in expresse wordes. <hi>I confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
we eate not Christ any other wise then by beleuing,</hi> which
doctrine howe absurde it is, we shall anon speake off.
Nowe let vs see what absurdites folowe, graunting
the eating of Christ his body onely to the soule.<note place="margin">That the soule on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not fedde of Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First if the bread of life whiche Christ geueth in
the Sacrament, be eaten onely off the soule, then
<hi>Manna</hi> the figure of this sacrament was more auaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Iewes, then this blessed foode is to vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stians.<note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note>
For that the Iewes did eate <hi>Manna</hi> bodely not
onely by faith,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> and that it was a corporal foode vnto
them, the scripture doth clerely testifie. Againe that
it was also a spirituall foode, yea and the very same
which we receaue in the Sacrament, the doctrine of
Caluin defendeth though blasphemously, as you shal
<pb facs="tcp:18354:197"/>
see anon in the conferences of his doctrine with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture. Hereof will it folowe by the absurde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Caluin, that the figure shal excell the verite,
<hi>Manna</hi> shall passe the body of oure Lorde, the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge
of Iewes shall be off more perfection, then the

of the Iewes bothe bodely and ghostely, euen
as this heauenly passeouer wardeth vs bothe body

Caluin importeth, why desired Christ so inwardly
to eate this passeouer with his disciples? doth the

            <p>Thirdly I might aske Caluin and all the ranke of
sacramentaries swarming nowe so miserably in oure
dere countre to the vtter destruction off the same,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18354:197"/>
where they reade in holy scripture, that the soule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
fedeth on Christ, and receaueth the body off
Christ. The wordes of holy scripture declaring vnto
vs the promis of this heauenly foode, be directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men consisting of body and soule, not to the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
onely. Beside that life and resurrection (the promis
of this blessed Sacrament) are no lesse requisit to the
body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to the soule, as we shall hereafter more at
large declare, when we come to the olde heresies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
of Caluins doctrine. Where you shal see, that
this doctrine of the Sacrrmentaries graunting only

            <p>As touching the seconde pointe,<note place="margin">Real rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auing can not stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce.</note> to witt, that we
receaue the body of Christ truly and really, and yet so
that the same body of Christ is as farre distant from
vs, as heauen is from the earthe, I knowe not what
can be more absurdely saide. Caluin in dede will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
this to be a miraculous operation of the holy gho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste:
<hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>the vertu of the holy ghost is such,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Matth. Cap. 26.</note> 
               <hi>that it is
able not onely to gather together thinges by distaunce of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
separated one from the other, but also to vnite them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and make them one.</hi> Marke and ponder well the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Caluin: for this reason is the onely ancre off
this point of his doctrine. He semeth perhaps to some
that lightly ouerrunne his wordes, to speake reason.
Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidre his wordes. It is most true that the
holy ghost being god him self, can do al thinges that
can be done, and therefore can (as Caluin saith) knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
in one those thinges that are farre distant: as, God
<pb facs="tcp:18354:198"/>
can by his omnipotency ioyne heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earthe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
which we see are most distant. but then they
being so ioyned shall no more be distant. We graunte
that by the vertu off the holy ghoste the body off
Christ which is in heauen, may be the foode of oure
soules. But then it shall not onely be in heauen, but
here also (or els oure soules shall be there to, and then
seing oure bodyes remaine here, I see not but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
communicateth after Caluins doctrine, he
must dye, the soule being separated from the body)
and we saie not onely he can do so, but the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
churche teacheth vs, he doth so. Nowe Caluin bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he will denie the real presence of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the
Sacrament, imagineth that we eate the body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
really withoute the reall presence. But this imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is a plaine contradictition. And contradiction
is of those thinges that can not be done. A thing can
not be present and distant to. A thing can not be hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
and cold to in one very place and moment of time.
And therefore all lerned men haue euer saide, that
God worketh no contradiction. This then being a
plaine contradiction to haue Christ present, and not
present, to haue him in the Sacrament, and not in
the Sacrament, we saye the holy ghoste dothe not
worke it. Not bycause off any impossibilite off
God, but bycause the thinge it selfe is impossible.
And euen as we may wel say, God can not sinne, and
yet derogat no whit from the omnipotency of God,
so maye we saye, God can not worke a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God can not make a thinge present that is in
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18354:198"/>
dede absent and not present, and yet we diminishe
not the omnipotency of allmightye God. For that
consisteth in suche thinges as are semely for his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Maiesty and are of them selues possible. Nowe
contradiction is of it selfe vtterly impossible. Againe
the workes of God are permanent and vniforme, the
one of them destroieth not the other. But in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
one parte destroyeth the other, as a thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
to be present, taketh awaye the absence thereoff.
And likewise the absence destroieth the presence.
To saie therefore, as all lerned men saye, that God
can worke no contradiction, argueth not an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
or lacke of abylite in God: But rather the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine
of Caluin, making God the authour of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
argueth it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodore Beza</hi> and his companions at the late Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
off <hi>Poissy</hi> in Fraunce, praesenting vpp their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
touching this blessed Sacrament, thoughe
they were all scholers of Caluin, yet they dyd not
attribute this contradiction to the operation off
the holy ghoste, but vnto faith. The wordes of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
Confession presented the laste daye of September
vnto the councell are these.<note place="margin">An. 1561</note> 
               <hi>Bycause the worde off
God, vpon the which oure fayth is stayed, warranteth vs
the true and naturall body by the vertu of the holy Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
In this respect we acknowleadge that the body and bloud
of oure Lorde Iesus Christ is in the Supper. By these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
(Encestesgard In this respect) we meane that we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
this great and excellent mystery by faith, which is of such
vertu and efficacy, that it maketh thinges absent to be prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18354:199"/>
Hitherto the wordes of their confession. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
they attribute that to faithe, whiche Caluin the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
Master attributeth to the operation of the holy
ghoste. But be their faithe neuer so stronge and
vehement, yet shall they neuer obtaine thereby that
one selfe thinge shall be bothe present and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
For this being a contradiction, is a thinge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
and suche as God him selfe worketh not.
<hi>Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> saieth S. Paule, <hi>est argumentum rerum non apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.
Is a certainte off thinges which are not sene.</hi> By faith
we are assured of suche thinges as seme not to be,
but are in dede. But a thinge to be whiche is not,
oure faithe can not assure vs. So by faith we beleue
the present being off Christes body and bloud in the
Sacrament, which appeareth not present vnto vs. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
then if Caluin shooteth much amisse to attribut
his fonde imagination to the miraculous working
off God, howe muche were his scholers beside the
marke, that seing Gods power failed, woulde flie to
their faithe, and attribute suche operation to it, as
God him selfe worketh not? And this doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so absurde, Caluin hath inuented bycause he
woulde destroye <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> That is to saye.
Rather then with the Catholike churche he will
graunte that Christ maye be in many places at ones,
as in heauen, and in the blessed Sacrament to, whiche
is no contradiction but a worke though aboue the
commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> course of nature, yet wel agreable to the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy
of almighty God, and vniformely of al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fathers acknowledged, he inuenteth an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18354:199"/>
of his owne, making God the authour off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
saieng we eate Christ in the Sacrament,
aud yet being as farre distant from vs, as heauen is
from the earthe, whiche bothe is a thing that God
neuer worketh, and such, as neuer man before the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes
of <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi> taught in Christ his churche. I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
ben good readers some what long in debating this
one point, bicause I wish euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderstande me.
As for the deceaued scholers of Caluin in oure dere
countre, if they will not beleue the Catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
touching the omnipotency of Christe to be in
diuers places at ones, they are confuted by the greate
worke of <hi>Brentius</hi> a Lutheran <hi>de vbiquitate</hi> sette forth
this very yeare for the proufe of that onely pointe.
though it be otherwise hereticall.</p>
            <p>Caluin in his commentaries vpon S. Iohn saith in
expresse wordes.<note place="margin">In cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>I confesse we eate Christ by no other mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes

he meaneth no other eating of Christ in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith. For vpon the sixt of Ihon he affirmeth
<hi>eating to be the worke of faith,</hi> and in his Institutions
he calleth it <hi>the effect of faithe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> And this againe is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
stay of al the Sacramentary doctrine to make men
wene, that we ought to looke for no other eating of
Christ his flesh, and drinking his bloud, in the blessed
sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then by faith. For this their faith is so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a thing in the eye of Caluin, that he is not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:18354:200"/>
to write in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Matthew these
wordes.<note place="margin">In cap. 26.</note> 
               <hi>If we could sufficiently be mindefull of the passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
Christ, it were but superfluous, to haue the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
for they are remedies of oure infirmitie.</hi> This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
bicause it is a most perilous and most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
doctrine, and yet, as I vnderstande to my greate
grief, much rooted in the hartes of many of my dere
deceaued countremen, I wil labour with such reasons
as I may, to remoue it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hartes. For truly this
proude confidence of faith planted by <hi>Luther,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by <hi>Caluin,</hi> and encreased by the pricking forthe
of the deuill in his Ministres, excludeth all meanes to
call for grace, all due preparation to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all endeuour of vertuous liuing.</p>
            <p>First if by beleuing in Christ,<note place="margin">That vve eate not the Body of Christ onely by Faithe</note> we eate Christe, and
eate no otherwise then by faithe, then is all excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
vaine. Bothe the Catholike church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
allwaies practised, and the protestants of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untre
for the maintenaunce of their wicked doctrine
do gredely practise, that for certain hainous crimes
men are kepte from the holy table as they calle it, or
embarred the receauing of the blessed Sacrament, as
the Catholike churche termeth it. The doctrine off
the Catholike church teaching vs, as the wordes of
our Sauiour expresly importe, to eate not onely by
faith, but in dede the fleshe of our Sauiour in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sacrament, worthely excludeth from that most
holy mistery open penitents (as the primitiue church
speaketh) that is, suche as hauing committed notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
crimes, either wickedly perseuere in the same, or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18354:200"/>
though repenting thereof, haue not yet done due sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
therefore. But the doctrine of Caluin and al
the Sacramentaries, excluding the reall presence off
our Sauiour, and grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly foode to faith
only, what auaileth it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat or remoue
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their table any notorious offender, keping yet not
withstanding his faithe, and beleuing allwaies in the
passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour and resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also? if by faith
onely he receaue Christ, then may he eate as well at
home in his house, as if he were admitted in to the
congregation. For though he be excommunicat, he
loseth not yet his faithe, vnlesse perhaps, as they saie
(according to the doctrine of their graundfather <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>)
that who hath faith, hath withall necessarely
good workes (whereupon they builde their perilous
doctrine of only faith) so contrary wise they will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
that a notorious offender, a bearer of malice, a diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
person, and so forthe, leseth with al his faith,
by the lacke whereof he can not eate Christ vnlesse
he be absolued: if they saie this, first I aske what if the
person repent before the pretended bishop or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
absolue him? In this case other he beleueth,
and so eateth Christ though he stande yet excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municat,
as being not absolued, or he beleueth not,
and so his faith dependeth vpon the external absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which were to superstitious a doctrine for the
newe ghospell. Againe though we graunted them
this suttle shift, and suffred them so to pluck their
heades oute of the coler, that their excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were good, bicause their excommunicats haue
<pb facs="tcp:18354:201"/>
loste their faith, and are become infidels (though tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb facs="tcp:18354:202"/>
all the primitiue church excluding the <hi>Catechumeni</hi>
from receauing the blessed Sacrament, if, as he saie,
faith only geueth them this foode. I beseche here all
good Christen men, and such as feare God and loue
their owne soules, diligently to aduise with them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
howe they folowe the Sacramentary doctrine of
our preachers of Geneua, lest that in folowing them
they departe from the Catholike church, bothe that
nowe is, and euer hath ben, which in their Crede they
professe to beleue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly if when our Sauiour saied to his disciples,
<hi>Take, eate, this is my body,</hi> by the worde eating he badde
vs beleue, what did he bidde vs in the worde taking?
do we take by faith as we eate by faith? why then call
they men so earnestly to their table? maye I not as wel
eate and take by faith at home, as at their table? doth
not my faith serue me as well in the house, as in the
church? they are wonte to saie, we maie as well praie at
home, as in the church, and why maie we not also as
well beleue at home, as in the church? Then if bothe
taking and eating the body of Christ, be but a matter
of faith, what nede they storme and trouble such as
will not receaue at Easter or other times? maie not
good men tel them, that by their owne doctrine they
receaue at home beleuing in the passion and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ? Againe when Christ bad the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
take, and eate his body, did they looke vpon him
beleuing him, and receaued nothing outewardely?
yes they will saie they receaued the bread. what?
was the bread the body of Christe? the Lutherans in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dede
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18354:202"/>
would be glad to heare that. For so should <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi>
be a Lutheran, and agree with <hi>Westphalus</hi> which
while he liued, he would not do for his life. What wil
here the Sacramentary saye? What shift hath he yet?
He will perhaps saye, that Christ bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take bread,
and eate his body. This were in dede to make Christ
a very sophister: to witt, that bidding the Apostles ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
and eate both together, saying withall it was his
body, he should meane they should take bread, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
his body. Brefely this I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude. Yf Christ in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
wordes, <hi>Take, eate, this is my body</hi> meaned this, Take
and eate this bread, which is my body, then <hi>Caluin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with <hi>Westphalus,</hi> and is become a Lutheran, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will. If he meaned this, take bread, and eate
my body, then was it a sophisticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it is a point
of sophistry to ioyne two termes together, taking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
properly and the other improperly. As here by this
laste meaning, Christ bidding them take, ment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
they should take in dede and bidding them eate,
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnproperly, that is, they should not eate in dede,
but beleue. For as al the worlde knoweth, beleuing is
a very vnproper signification of eating: and suche as
neuer was heard of before the daies of <hi>Iohn Caluin,</hi>
being ment of sacramentall eating.</p>
            <p>But will you see, that by the doctrine of Caluin.<note place="margin">By the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine of Caluin the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did not rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste in the last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note>
the Apostles did not eate Christ at all in the last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?
I meane by faithe. For Caluin as you haue heard
by his wordes in his Catechisme, meaneth such faith
as beleueth that Christ died for our redemption, and
hath risen for our iustification. Nowe what faith the
<pb facs="tcp:18354:203"/>
Apostles had when Christ made is maunde, touchin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
his death, I will not nowe dispute. Althoughe it
may seme they doubted much thereof,<note place="margin">Luc. 22</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that Iudas should betraie him: as also S. Peter after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieng
him. But as touching the resurrection, the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
telleth vs plain, that diuers of the Apostles at
that time beleued it not. For first <hi>S. Ihon</hi> in his ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
writeth of him selfe,<note place="margin">Cap. 20.</note> that after he looked in to
the graue and sawe nothing but the winding shete le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fte,

that he should rise fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deathe. S.</hi> Thomas also an other of
the Apostles woulde not beleue that Ghrist had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
vntell he put his finger in to his woundes. And
therefore our Sauiour saide after vnto him, <hi>Quia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disti
me Thoma, credidisti. Thomas thou haste beleued bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou haste sene me.</hi> Lo then <hi>S. Peter, S. Ihon,</hi> and <hi>S.
Thomas</hi> beleued not in the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they receaued the blessed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the laste Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
therefore if Caluins doctrine be true, the Apostles
did not eate Christ at all in the laste Supper. See what
godly doctrine ensueth of this ghospel of Geneua.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps some scoler of Caluin will obiect:
what Sir? Will you then conclude that bicause in the
laste Supper the Apostles without such especiall faith
receaued the body of Christ, therefore nowe any
man may receaue it without that faith? Truly suche
maner of reasoning of it selfe were naught. But yet
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18354:203"/>
inioyning with Caluin it were not amisse. For he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the like against the doctrine of the Catholike
church. In his Institutions, disputing against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
presence of Christ in the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> and awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
to those which for possibilite of being in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
places at ones, alleage that the body of Christ is
glorious and immortall and not subiect to place and
measure, as oure corruptible bodies are, he writeth
thus. <hi>Some againe,</hi> saieth he, <hi>seke a more suttle escape, to
wit, that the body of Christ geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is glorious
and immortall, and therefore that it is not absurde he be in
diuers places, or in no certain place, or in any certain forme
vnder the Sacrament. But I aske them. VVhat body gaue
our Lorde to his disciples the daie before he suffred? Do not
the wordes sounde that he gaue his mortall body and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
which shoulde forthwith be deliuered?</hi> Thus farre Cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uin.
If then this maner of reasoning be currant and
allowablein Caluin, <hi>Christ before he suffred, gaue his mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall
body to be eaten, ergo he geueth not nowe any other in
the Sacrament,</hi> why then maye not we also reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, <hi>The Apostles before Christ suffred, beleued not
in the resurrection, and yet notwithstanding receaued the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
of Christ in the Sacrament, ergo it is not nowe requisit
and necessary for the eating of Christ his body to beleue in his
resurrection.</hi> If this maner of reasoning be naught
and vicious, then you lerne that Caluin in reasoning
against the churche speaketh not allwaies the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
but vttereth sometimes his ignoraunce. And if
this maner of reasoning be good, then Caluin mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
much of the marke in his doctrine, where he
<pb facs="tcp:18354:204"/>
teacheth that to eate Christ, is to beleue in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and resurrection. Againe we do not reason in
this sorte. <hi>The Apostles at the Maunde beleued not in the
resurrection, ergo such faith is not nowe necessary:</hi> as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
reasoneth. <hi>The body of Christ was then mortal: ergo it
is not to be considered here as a glorious body or immortall.</hi>
But this is our reason. <hi>The Apostles in the laste supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued
not in the resurrection: ergo Calvin defining the eating
of Christ in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be a beleuing in the deathe and
resurrection of Christ, excludeth the Apostles from eating of
Christes body in the last Supper.</hi> This is lo the effect of
our reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nowe if we would infer beside that bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the Apostles did not then beleue, such belefe now
is not necessary, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were naught.
and yet were it such as Caluin vseth against vs, as
you haue heard. I haue troubled you here somewhat
longe. But this you haue gained: that not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
point of his doctrine, whereof we now purposely
do entreate, is proued to be absurde and detestable, as
the which excludeth the Apostles from the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing
of Christ in the laste Supper, but also we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
farder declared you an other false point of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of reasoning against the Catholike doctrine in
this moste blessed Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The fifte absurdite against this pointe of his doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
maie be this. If the eating of Christ his body be (as
Caluin saith vpon S. Ihon) <hi>the worke of faithe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Cap. 6.</note> or (as he
writeth in his Institutions)<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the effect of faithe,</hi> that is,
if by beleuing in Christ, we eate and receaue Crist
in to vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14</note> then to what purpose did <hi>S.</hi> Paule bid men
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18354:204"/>
proue them selues first, and so to eate Christ? For he
that proueth, trieth, and examineth him selfe, first he
beleueth.<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> For without faith there is no triall of our
hartes, and <hi>he that cometh to god</hi> (saieth the Apostle)
<hi>must first beleue.</hi> then if he beleue before he proue him
selfe, he eateth by Caluins saieng, the body of Christ,
before he be proued. How standeth this with S. Paul
bidding vs first to proue and so to eate? Surely S. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the eating of Christ was not by faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which we muste nedes haue before we can proue
and trie our owne worthines or vnworthines, but by
receauing really after due probation and trial the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
true and naturall body of our Sauiour Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Last of all, if the eating of life whiche Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
in the Sacrament, is the effect of faith, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of iudgement and deathe is the effect of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delite.
That is, if by faith we duely receaue the blessed
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, through infidelite and lacke of faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
our owne damnation. By this reason the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
shall through his infidelite eate iudgment and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
though he neuer eate the Sacrament, nor the
bread which S. Paule spake of. This doctrine therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of Caluin maie haue good rime, but surely it hathe
small reason, it may sounde well in the eares of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
persons, that we eate Christ no otherwise
then by beleuing in him: but it standeth with no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ason
at all, as you haue I trust sufficiently heard: and
yet when we come to the contradictions of Caluin
you shal here more, and see Caluin confute him selfe.
I will note onely more most notable absurdite in

this their doctrine, whereby you shall perceaue to
what point they bring this holy Sacrament, and so
come to the contradictions of Caluin, as we promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caluin teacheth in his</hi> Catechisme, that we receaue
the communion of Christ his body as well in baptim, and by
hearing the ghospell, as at the Lordes supper. But that in
Baptim and by the ghospell we receaue him but in parte, in
the Supper we receaue him wholy and fully. <hi>And in his</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Sacraments <hi>he teacheth that we receaue
Christ in the Supper, euen as we had him before
continually dwelling in vs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Art. 19.</note> For, <hi>saieth he,</hi> Faithe being
required of vs before we come to the Sacrament, we haue
Christ also before: for oure faith is not without Christ: And
euen as the vse of the Sacraments profiteth no more the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuers,
then if they vsed them not at all, so the beleuers commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicat
and haue the verite figured by the Sacraments <hi>(which
is Christ)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Art. 20.</note> euen without the vse of the Sacraments. Farder
the profit which we receaue at the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ought not to be
restrained to the very time we receaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
being geuen vs, we receaued withal incontinently the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of God. It maie well happen that the receit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that in the acte profited nothing through our defaute
or slacknes, maie afterwarde bring forth better frute. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
Caluin. In these wordes Caluin concludeth
his doctrine touching this blessed Sacrament. Let vs
nowe examin it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What meaneth Caluin so to debace the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vertu of this blessed Sacrament, as to compare
it to baptim or hearing of the ghospell? forsothe to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18354:206"/>
persuade men that it were nought els, but a morcell
of bread, a mere figure, badge or token. For see I praie
you, what his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and doctrine is touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g baptim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baptim,</hi> saithe he in his institutions,<note place="margin">Cap. 17.</note> 
               <hi>is a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of the entring whereby we are receaued in to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the Church, that being grafte in Christ we
maie be accompted amonge the Children of God.</hi> Here
he meaneth baptim not to make vs entre in to
Christ as a Sacrament hauing efficacy thereunto,<note place="margin">The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Caluin touching baptim refuted</note> but
to be a signe of that entring: to the entent that being
first grafte in Christ (or being borne of Christen
parents by the vertu of Gods promise, or being borne
of infidels, by faith and repentaunce, as he teacheth
manifestly in his institutions) being (as I saie) thus
grafte in Christ before, then by baptim as by a sure
token we maie be accompted for Christians, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
such. And this to be his very meaning I will by his
owne wordes declare you oute of his Institutions.
In his chapter of baptim not farre from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
thus he writeth. <hi>Baptim promiseth vs no other clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
then by the sprinckling of the bloud of Christe, whiche is
figured by the water: who then will saie that we are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with this water, which dothe assuredly testifie that oure
true and onely cleansing is the bloud of Christe?</hi> Lo here he
teacheth baptim to figure oure cleansing procured
by the sheading of Christ his bloud, whiche he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
oure true and onely cleansing.</p>
            <p>It is most true that by the precious deathe and
passion of oure Sauiour we are purged from the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of our father Adam, and all other actuall sinnes.
<pb facs="tcp:18354:207"/>
And yet it hath pleased God to vse meanes for the
applie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of this souuerain benefit vnto vs. Those are
amonge other, his holy sacraments. And Caluin him
selfe writing vpon S. Paule to the Corinthians, saith
plainely that by the blessed Sacrament of the aultar
<hi>Sacrificij beneficium nobis applicatur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In. 1. Cor. Cap. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The benefit of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
is applied vnto vs.</hi> And writing vppon the sixte
of Ihon, he blameth them which teache the fleshe of
Christ to profit vs onely as it was crucified, and sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<hi>Quin potius comedere eam necesse est vt crucifixa pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>
that is. <hi>Na rather we must of necessite eate it, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
it maye profit vs, which was crucified.</hi> And againe in
in the same place he saieth. <hi>Nihil nobis prodesset victi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
illam semel esse immolata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nisi nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c sacro epulo vesceremur</hi>
that is. <hi>It shoulde nothing auaile vs to haue that sacrifice
ones offred, onles we did nowe also eate of this holy ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet.</hi>
Caluin him selfe therefore acknowledgeth that not
only the passion of Christ suffiseth, but that also this
Sacrament of Christ his body and bloud must feede
vs.<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> The like truly we saie of baptim. For as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
saied. <hi>Onles you eate my fleshe and drinke my bloud,
you shall haue no life in you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note> so he saide, <hi>Onles a man be bor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
againe of water, and of the holy ghoste, he shall not enter
in to the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And though Caluin call
here the bloud of Christe oure onely clensing, yet S.
Paule is not afeared to call baptim also, <hi>Lauacrum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generationis,
the cleansing of our new birthe.</hi> saieng we we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
saued thereby.<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> Againe Caluin him self writing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
S. Paule to the Romans teacheth no lesse.<note place="margin">In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment. in Cap. 6.</note> For
there he saith that <hi>by baptim we are graffed in to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18354:207"/>
of Christe, and liue by the substance thereof, euen as the
graffe by the stocke: sauing that the graffe kepeth his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
taste and sape, but we kepe nothinge offour owne,
but chaunge vtterly our nature in to the nature of
Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Caluin aboute baptim.</note> Howe then is baptim as he made it before, a
figure of our clensing, and a testimony onely? Yow
see he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth him selfe. And this I haue thought
good presently to declare (allbeit beside oure princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
purpose) leste that the other doctrine of Caluin
being apparently plausible, might corrupt the vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and well meaning Reader. But now to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
againe.</p>
            <p>In the same chapter of baptim, Caluin mocketh
at the whole Catholike churche (as <hi>Pelagius</hi> the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike
did a thousand yeares paste) teaching that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
sinne is taken awaye by baptim.<note place="margin">Cap. de Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Domini.</note> Brefely in the
next chapter folowing of his Institutions at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
thereof, he maketh so light of baptim in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Christen parents, that if contempt and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
be not on our partes, oure children, saieth he,
without daunger may lacke baptim.</p>
            <p>Thus lo you see howe Caluin maketh baptim but
a figure,<note place="margin">Caluin maketh the blessed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts only bare signes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, and badges.</note> and token or testimony of clensing: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so much maketh he the blessed Sacrament off
the aultar, comparing it vnto baptim, to witt, a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
a signe, a testimony which a man may as well lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
as haue, and withoute the which a man maye as
well receaue Christ as with it: imagining that these
two most waighty and holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts (for of al the
rest he maketh no accompte at all) are naught els but
<pb facs="tcp:18354:208"/>
as certain markes and tokens, whereby Christ may
knowe his flocke lest perhaps in seking for them he
should misse. See to what point oure Christen religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is brought by these newe ghospellers of late
yeares. Forsothe to mere signes, tokens and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</p>
            <p>As though we were yet vnder the shadowes off
Moyses lawe,<note place="margin">Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> as though that which happened to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in figures were not brought nowe to a sure verite, as
though the coming of Christ procured not better,
and more present remedies for mans saluation, then
such as were betokened in the tabernacle, finally as
though the church of Christ, redemed with his most
precious bloud were fedde with figures, and traded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with signes and tokens, as the synagoges of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes

for lacke of signes, as he dothe for wante off
baptim,<note place="margin">Ioan. 2</note> saieng vnto <hi>Nicodemus, Onles a man be borne

the kingdom of heauen?</hi> Would he denie vs the life of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
for lacke of tokens,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> as he doth for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing

vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs for the vnworthy receauing of a piece
of bread,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> as he doth for the vnworthy receauing
of Christ his body? Was S. Peter deceaued, when he

nowe) that by Baptim originall sinne was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie?</p>
            <p>We recited you before, in this laste conclusion of
Caluins whole doctrine touching this blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
oute of his resolutions vpon the sacraments,
that we receiue Christ no lesse withoute the vse off

his reasons why. Truly he vttereth this doctrine off
his, not in one or two, but allmost in all places of his
workes, where he treateth of this matter. In his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
vpon the sixte of <hi>Ihon,</hi> where Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth

Supper, but of that continuall communion which we surely
haue withoute the frequentation of the Supper.</hi> And this
continuall communion withoute the frequentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
vse, or accesse of the Supper, he meaneth to be the
very same which we haue in the Supper, as his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

is here spoken which is not figured and truly exhibited to the

more Catholike doctrine then this is? truly it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
no. But you shall see within fewe lines he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
all that he made before. For when he cometh to
declare after what maner we receaue the body and
bloud of Christ (for by euidence of scripture he was
forced to confesse that we receaue it) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lo he stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
him selfe, and calleth his wittes aboute him,
how he may defeat the real prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christes body

(saith he) <hi>Christ geueth vs by his Spirit. By<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit
of Christ we are coupled and ioyned to Christ. and the Spirit
of Christ is as a certaine cundite pipe, by the whiche whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
Christ is, and hathe, is deriued vnto vs. for if we see the
Son shining on the earthe with his beames, for the engendring

vnto the earthe, why should the Spirit of Christ be
inferiour or of lesse force then the shining downe the son
for conuaying vnto vs the communion of Christ his fleshe
and bloud? Wherefore scripture speaking of our partaking
with Christe referreth the whole power thereof vnto the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
One place shal suffise for all. For S. Paule writing to the
Romanes in the eight chapter teacheth that Christ dwelleth
no otherwise in vs then by his Spirit. Whereby yet he taketh
not a waie the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fleshe and bloud that we nowe
speake of, but teacheth vs that by the onely spirit we posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
whole Christ and haue him dwelling in vs.</hi>

taught that in this Sacrament we were partakners of Christ

bloud of Christe by the Spirit of Christ onely, but
spiritually only? The fleshe and bloud of Christ are
no spirituall thinges: <hi>Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Marcion</hi> were
condemned for suche doctrine. Howe then receaue
we thinges of a corporall substaunce, not mere spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
onely by the Spirit? This is a mere imagination
of Caluin, as we haue before declared you. No scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
termeth the Spirit of Christ a cundite pipe. No
scripture telleth vs, that the Spirit of Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uaieth
vs his fleshe and bloude. It is beside scripture and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all reason: and therefore not to be admitted by
the only warrant of Caluins mouthe. We must not
<pb facs="tcp:18354:212"/>
leaue the doctrine of the churche (though it had no
reason to defend it) for the bare assertion of Caluin,
being against all reason. For this is against all reason
that we should really eate the body, and drinke the
bloud of Christ, being not really present, though
Caluin to sett a gaie colour on the matter, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
this straunge meanes and order to the operation
of the Spirit of Christ God him selfe. For (as we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
before proued) god him selfe worketh no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
as it is to receaue that which is not present
to be receaued. Therefore notwithstanding all the
shiftes that Caluin maketh, it is no real communion
of Christ his body and bloud that he teacheth, as he
would it should seme to be, but a mere spirituall,
which before he blamed.</p>
            <p>As touching the Son, if Caluin speake like a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
it is no body mixte, and made of the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
as the natural flesh and bloud of Christ is, but a pure
simple and celestial body: and so we graunte the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
thereof is deriued to the earth by the shining
thereof. For that substaunce is a lightsom and shining
substaunce, and differeth no whit from the light and
clerenes thereof. Now Christ toke very fleshe in all
conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s like to our flesh, except the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
sinne bringeth. This fleshe of Christ is so endued
with diuinite, that it loseth not his natural substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
Therefore the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of Christ his body, are thinges farre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Againe
if the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the son quickeneth the earth, that
substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is really present with the earthe. By this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ason
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18354:212"/>
therefore Christ also should be really present
with vs feding vs with his substaunce. Which we do
confesse, but Caluin denieth. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dothe that si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
make for him? Truly nothing.</p>

               <hi>The Son by the meanes of his shining,</hi> saieth
Caluin, <hi>geueth his substaunce to the earthe, and so Christ by
the meanes of his Spirit geueth vs the communion of his flesh

of the fleshe, not the fleshe it selfe to be deriued vnto

this ones againe a plaine contradiction to that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

the very same? is not the communion that he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth

he not call it a certain quickening vertu oute off

the doctrine of Caluin a mere spirituall thinge, seing
<pb facs="tcp:18354:213"/>
that he teacheth blasphemousely with the olde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
<hi>Nestorius</hi> that the flesh of Christ (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

euidently, that though Caluin write we receaue
truly and really the flesh and bloud off Christ, yet he
meaneth nothing so.</p>
            <p>But why did he thus dally, and delude the world,<note place="margin">The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Caluin.</note>
a man maye demaunde. Forsothe as I suppose euen
for this cause. Caluin being lerned, and knowing the
truthe wel, if he had listed to vtter it, perceaued right
wel by the expresse wordes of scripture in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that Christ of his passing mercy and goodnes
woulde be ioyned to man not onely Spiritually, and
by grace, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> really and truly by the participation
of his body and bloud. Caluin knewe all this, and
acknowledged it: (as you haue heard in his wordes
before) for expresse scripture moued him thereunto.
Notwithstanding being vndoubtedly malitious, and
selfe willed, and in dede a very heretike, desirous to
pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te a newe doctrine, to bringe the churche in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
pricked with malice against the clergy, which in his
workes he vttereth many times) though he graunted
that man receaued whole Christ bothe in body and
Spirit, as he writeth in the 18. chapter of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet he would not graunt the reall presence off
Christ his body, which the church teacheth and all
holy fathers haue acknowledged, as a most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
consequent to the reall receauing: but as you see
imagineth a communion of Christ his fleshe to be
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18354:213"/>
deriued vnto vs by the Spirit off Christ as by a pipe.
Bicause therefore truthe and falshood can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
agree, he falleth often in to open contradictions:
sayeng one thinge as truthe and conscience taught
him, and then saieng an other thinge, as pride, malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and enuy moued him, the walking mates of heresy.
Hereof rise the sundry and manifold contradictions
in his writings, not onely aboute this most holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
but in the doctrine off baptim, and of fre will
especially, as we shall in parte note hereafter vnto
you.<note place="margin">2, Reg. 15.</note> And truly it hath so pleased God to confounde

that he whiche raised vp Christ from deathe shall quicken

he receaueth not Christ. But nowe you reason
as though the euill man, if he receaued Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste

            </p>
            <p>Lo you haue good readers a number of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
gathered oute of this small treatise of Caluin:
wherein yet according to the title thereof, he minded
to geue the worlde a full and perfit resolution of the
Sacraments. But whiles he laboureth to vtter his
heresy vnder coulour of some Christianite, and to
persuade his falshood vnder the cloke of some truth,
he is miserably driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to tell contrary tales, to saie one
thinge and thinke an other, brefely to confounde
him selfe with his owne wordes. For what better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ason
may possibly be founde to discouer false forged
doctrine of an heretike, then to trippe him in his tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
and take him in contradiction? Nothing can mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
discredit the Author of a secte or declare more his
wicked pretence, then to espie diuersite of doctrine
and variaunce of opinions in him. nor neuer, I thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke,
appeared it better in any heretike (except allwaies
that fonde frere <hi>Martin Luther</hi>) them in <hi>Ihon Caluin.</hi>
And yet this is he, vpon whose onely warrant and
worde diuers deceaued persons, haue hazarded their
soules and loste their life. I beseche god geue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnant
grace to see, knowe, and deteste from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe,
suche a teacher as you see nowe Caluin is.</p>
            <p>Diuers other contradictions might be gathered
oute of this mans doctrine touching this blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
if we listed to scanne eche of his propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18354:221"/>
and saiengs. But bicause I haue ben ouer longe
allready, and yet in so good a purpose me thinketh I
can neuer be longe inough, I wil nowe passe to the
repugnaunce in his doctrine against holy scripture.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour sayth in the ghospell off S. Ihon.<note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note>

Caluin in his institutions and in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
vpon that place teacheth thus. <hi>Who eateth the

               <note place="margin">Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in Caluin to holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</note> Marke I beseche you
Christen readers, howe he hathe altered the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

and where Christ saithe <hi>he hathe life euer lasting,</hi>
Caluin saithe <hi>he hathe a cundyte pipe by the whiche life is
deriued,</hi> calling the blessed fleshe of oure Sauiour,
one person with the godhead, a coundyt pype or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
by the whiche life is deriued from god
the Father. For that is his meaning, (as you shall see
more plainely hereafter, when I come to his heresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es)
attributing life not to the fleshe of Christ, as
Christ him selfe dothe, but to the Father in whom
he teacheth life to remaine principally, as you shall
anon see. But nowe to an other proposition.</p>

               <hi>I am the resurrection and the life.</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
saythe in his commentaries vpon the sixte off

as god and man, saith him selfe to be the life.
For as the general councell of Ephesus charely war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

               <hi>the wordes of the ghospell are all waies to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

               </hi> Caluin saithe <hi>the life to remaine in the father.</hi>
Where blasphemousely he excludeth Christ, making
him as a riuer or meanes, by the whiche life is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vnto vs. But of this we shall haue more occasion
to speake hereafter.</p>
            <p>Oure Sauiour after he had sayde in the sixte off
Ihon, <hi>my fleshe is meate in dede, and my bloud is drinke in
dede,</hi> expounding those his wordes vnto the carnall
Iewes, thinking he had meaned his fleshe and bloud,<note place="margin">Cirillus lib. 11 Cap. 22. in Ioan. Cap. 81.</note>
after the bare nature of man, saithe thus. <hi>The wordes
which I spake vnto you are Spirit and life,</hi> geuing vs to
vnderstande (as the lerned Father <hi>Cirillus</hi> noteth)
that he spake of his fleshe, and blood, inseparably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnexed
to the godhead, and one person with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
Nowe Caluin in his institutions affirmeth <hi>that
by the Spirit of Christe, his fleshe is deriued vnto vs and made
our foode.</hi> In the whiche doctrine he separateth the
Spirit of Christe from his blessed fleshe, geuing vs
the one without the other: whereas Christ him sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
aboue affirmed that he meaned his fleshe coupled
and vnited to the Spirit, sayeng, <hi>the wordes whiche I
spake vnto you</hi> (to witt, of my flesh and blood) <hi>are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and life,</hi> that is, not bare flesh but endued with my
Spirit, the godhead it selfe: nor to be deriued vnto
vs by the Spirit, as separated from the fleshe, or as a
cundit pype to conducte the fleshe vnto vs (whiche
Caluin in his institutions saythe, as you haue heard
before) but to be geuen vnto vs with the Spirit, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18354:222"/>
deite of oure Sauiour iointly and inseparably, as they
are in him one person, and one Christ. Thus you
see howe he correcteth and altereth the wordes off
oure Sauiour at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Againe whereas Christe saythe in S. Ihon,<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

correcting the sayeng of oure Sauiour, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
vpon S. <hi>Ihon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In cap. 6.</note> where Christe promiseth
life and resurrection by the eating of his fleshe and
drinking of his bloud, he saythe, <hi>Christ speaketh not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

which we haue beside the vse of the Supper.</hi> And yet that
ye maye not thinke he meaneth of any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

the very same whiche we haue in the celebration of

thus muche. <hi>And yet I confesse, that nothinge is here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
whiche is not also figured and truly exhibited vnto vs

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of an other place of holy Scripture you shall
see yet ones again.</p>
            <p>S. Paule saieth <hi>The bread whiche we breake is the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the body of our Lorde:</hi> whereby we lerne in this
blessed Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to receaue the body of Christ. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin
teacheth vs without the blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
it. For in his resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts he hathe
these wordes.<note place="margin">Art. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Right as the infidell by the vse of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

And in the .9. article of the same worke he saythe. <hi>that
such as haue before receaued Christ, receauing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do renewe and continew that which they had before
receaued.</hi> By this his doctrine you see, he correcteth
the wordes of Christe teaching vs to receaue him by
eating his fleshe and drinking his blood. And the
wordes of S. Paule, sayeng the bread to be the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of our Lordes body: by whiche worde he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aneth
the blessed Sacrament: naming it so of that
which it was before:<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> as the serpent was called Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

            <p>S. Paul sayth. <hi>Who so euer eateth the bread and drinketh

Now the doctrine of Caluin directly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
For thus he writeth in his resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.
<hi>Farder</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Art. 20.</note> 
               <hi>the profit which we receaue at the

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18354:223"/>
be not cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the meaning of S. Paul.
For if, as S. Paul saith, receauing the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely
we receaue our own da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, why also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing

howe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it afterwarde auaile vs, as Caluin teacheth?
Thirdly if at the receite of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we receaue
nothing, what shall the bread (that Caluin imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

            <p>Our Sauiour in the sixte of Ihon saithe, <hi>Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did eate Manna in the desert, and are dead. This is
that bread whiche cometh downe from heauen, that a man

vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
teacheth, that the Iewes eating Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na, did eate the

the same effect by eating the Manna, as we do
by the communion. He laboureth muche in that

Caluin. But beholde, I beseche you, the sophistry of
this wily heretike. He woulde make vs beleue, that
Christ in S. Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plaied the Rhetoricia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s part, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
is not afeared to make our Sauiour (O blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Sacramentary) a lyar. For Christe saithe plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely,
<hi>That the Iewes eating Manna died</hi> (for not by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Manna, but by beleuing in the Messias to come,
they were fedde of Christ) <hi>But the bread which he would
geue shoulde be life euerlasting to those whiche eate off it.</hi> Iff
nowe as Caluin saithe, the eating of Manna serued
their turne, no lesse then the bread of life Christ him

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18354:224"/>
bread of life spiritually in eating Manna, as we do in
eating the blessed Sacrament, then were not that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieng
off Christe true, nor his comparison good, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the bread of life which he would geue vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Manna of the Iewes. For their Manna as
Caluin saithe, was bread of life to them: then was it
not inferiour to that whiche Christe woulde ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
but all one and the same. But nowe to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour in S. Ihon hath these wordes.<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Who
eateth my fleshe and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me and

               <note place="margin">Institut. Cap. 18.</note> Caluin correcteth these wordes in his doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne

of his flesh is deriued vnto him, by the vertu of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
First in this doctrine where Christ biddeth vs eate
his flesh, and so promiseth him selfe to dwel with vs,
and in vs, Caluin biddeth vs beleue in Christ his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath,

which shal be deriued, he sayeth, by the Spirit off

Christ him selfe abiding in vs (which bicause Christ
promiseth vs, we must vndoubtedly beleue so) but
to haue him onely spiritually abiding in vs: to witt,
coming to vs onely by spirit and abiding onely in

            <p>S. Paule writing to the Corinthians, of the due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

<hi>Let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trie him selfe and so eate of this bread.</hi> Caluin

<hi>that by beleuing we eate Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> Nowe seing that
no man trieth him selfe, but first he beleueth, and in
beleuing we eate Christ, then before we trie oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
we do eate: contrary to the expresse wordes off
the Apostle, bidding vs first to trie our selues, and so
to eate of this bread of life. And truly according to
the doctrine of Caluin (as you haue sene before) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuing
in Christes deathe and resurrection we eate
and receaue the body and bloud off Christ allwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies,
no lesse then in the vse of the Supper or commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion.
Which excludeth all triall of our selues requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>For the maintenance of this wicked Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

right vnderstanding, not onely suche places of holy
scripture as directly make against him, as you haue
hetherto partly sene, but also suche as by any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

of his wicked doctrine. For example I will pnt you in

<hi>that Christ entred not the dores being shutt, but that the dores

            <p>The pittes and pudles that Caluin hathe digged
him selfe, are olde heresies condemned aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares, and nowe renewed by him partly in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
wordes, partly by most assured and necessary
consequence of his writings.</p>
            <p>Caluin in his commentaries vpon S. Ihon hathe
these wordes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In Cap. 6. Ioan.</hi> Olde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned heresies re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nevved by Caluin in the doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne of the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament.</note> 
               <hi>It is to be noted there are thre degres of life.
The liuing Father hathe the first place, as the fountaine off
life, but yet farre distant and hidde. The Son foloweth him,
whom we haue sette before vs as a riuer by the which the life
abiding in the father is deriued vnto vs. the thirde life is that
which we drawe of him.</hi> Thus farre Caluin: This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
beside that it is a mere imagination of Caluin,
and a broken pudle of his brickle brain, it conteineth
in it sundry heresies. First if the Son of god Christ
him selfe, be a folowing, that is, a second cause of life,
as Caluin saithe, then is it not equall with the first,
and so is it a creature, not god the Creatour, which is
first and chefest, and seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to none. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth
Christ to a riuer and god the father to a fountaine.
Now the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine is before the riuer, and is cause of the
riuer: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the doctrine of Caluin, god the father is
before the Son and cause of the life in the Son. For al
this he meaneth of god the Son, not of the flesh off
Christ which he denieth to geue life or to be quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
of it selfe. This lo is the cursed and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:18354:227"/>
heresy of <hi>Arrius</hi> condemned in the first general

of <hi>Faustus Manicheus,</hi> who sayde that god the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occupied the chefest and principall light: but
the Son consisted in a seconde light. Which fonde
opinion of him <hi>Saint Augustin</hi> confuteth as a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
heresy. Muche more maye we so do in this
distinction of degres of life, that Caluin imagineth
to be in the blessed Trinite.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he affirmeth the life whiche we receaue
of Christ, the Son, to abide in the Father: as though
Christ of him selfe gaue not vs life by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his diuine fleshe. Which to saie is the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
of <hi>Valentinus</hi> whom S. <hi>Irene</hi> confuteth.</p>
            <p>Caluin in his commentarie vpon the resolution
of the Sacraments, saythe that, <hi>Vnto the substaunce of
bread remaining bread, the body of oure lorde whiche is the
verite figured by the bread is so coupled and vnited, as the
godhead was to the fleshe of Christ, it remaining true and
naturall fleshe.</hi> And this his doctrine he goeth aboute
to proue by the wordes of <hi>Gelasius</hi> in his epistle to
kinge Frauncis prefixed before his Institutions. It is
also the doctrine of Caluin that Christ is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
onely by faithe not corporally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For so (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18354:227"/>
he) he is onely in heauen. Then will it folowe
by the reason of Caluin, that the godhead was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and vnited to the fleshe of Christ onely by fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
and that the fleshe was not deified and one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with god. This was the heresy of <hi>Paulus Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satenus</hi>
condemned all most thirten hundred yeares
paste.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of Caluin in his Institutions is, as
you partly heard before, that in the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the maner of receauing Christ, is by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Spirit,<note place="margin">In institut. Cap. 18 &amp; in. 1. Cor. 11.</note>

in to oure soules his body and bloud, whiche yet depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not from the right hande of the father.</hi> This doctrine
separateth Christ, making his holy Spirit to serue as
a cundyt pipe for the conuaiaunce of his fleshe in to
oure soules. Beside the absurdite of the doctrine, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
we before declared you, it sauoureth of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
of <hi>Nestorius.</hi> For as he denied the fleshe off
Christ to be inseparably vnited to the godhead, and
therefore taught that we receaued not whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
but his fleshe onely and not his godhead (for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

that is, <hi>Christ sayde, he that eateth my fleshe, he sayde not he

with vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The doctrine of Caluin as it containeth variable
and contrary assertions, so it bredeth diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
heresies. You heard euen nowe that by making
the Spirit of Christ a pipe for the conuaiaunce off
Christ his flesh in to oure soules (whiche he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
bothe in his Institutions and in his commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
vpon S: Paule) he fell in to the heresy of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niches</hi>
no lesse wicked and auncient heretikes then
<hi>Nestorius.</hi> Now you shal see that making the flesh off
Christ a pipe for the conuaiaunce of Christ his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinite
vnto vs, he falleth in to the heresy of <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
In his commentaries vpon the sixte of S. Ihons
ghospell thus he writeth. <hi>As the euerlasting worde off
God is the fountaine of life, so his fleshe conuaieth vnto vs
like a certain pipe that life abiding in the godhead. And in
this sense the fleshe of Christe is saide to geue life, bicause it
communicateth vnto vs the life which it boroweth other
where.</hi> These are the very wordes of Caluin. Nowe
let vs considre the doctrine of S. Paule saieng.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 15.</note> 
               <hi>As in
Adam all do die, so in Christ all shall be quickened or endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with life.</hi> Vppon the grounde of this doctrine whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
can not be denied, thus I reason. If the fleshe of
Christ dothe not of it selfe geue life, as Caluin say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
but serueth vs as a pipe of the life abiding in god,
then the sinnerfull fleshe of Adam was not of it selfe
damnable and the cause of our damnation (<hi>VVe all
sinning and dieng in Adam</hi> as S. Paule saithe) but a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18354:228"/>
or instrument of deathe and damnation abiding
in some euill God, from whence the fleshe of Adam
toke deathe and damnation, as the fleshe of Christe
(acording to Caluin) boroweth life of God. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the saieng of S. Paule shall not be true, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
as properly and as truly life vnto our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
as deathe vnto Adam. Nowe to imagin a higher
cause of deathe in Adam, then Adam him selfe, and
an euill God in whom that death before remained,<note place="margin">Tom. 6. pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sim &amp; in lib. de haer.</note>
to be from thence deriued to sinners, is the very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the cursed <hi>Maniches,</hi> making two Goddes or
beginnings of all things one of the good, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the badde: as in <hi>S. Augustin</hi> it is easy to finde.</p>
            <p>But here perhaps some scholer of Caluins scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,<note place="margin">VVhy Cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uin maye vvorthely be charged vvith such heresies.</note>
and zelous professour of the ghospell of Geneua
will steppe in and saie, that Master Caluin neuer
taught, neuer allowed, nor so muche as dreamed off
the approuing of suche hainous heresies as these are.
And therefore we deale not charitably herein, but
rather vtter our malice and stomache to no purpose.
To such bicause I thinke it were harde for me to
frame an awnswer of my owne, that might please
them, I will awnswer with the wordes of M. Caluin
him selfe, which I hope shall not mislike them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Caluin in his Institutions hauing for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
longe iested at the blessed sacrifice of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and with a fewe sory reasons laboured to proue
that such as saide Masse, crucified Christ againe, at
the length moueth the like obiection as this is, aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst
him selfe, and awnswereth vnto it in these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
<pb facs="tcp:18354:229"/>
               <hi>I knowe well,</hi> saith he, <hi>they haue a ready answer,
whereby they will charge vs as slaunderers. For they will
saie we laye that vnto their charge whiche they neuer
thought, and whiche they were sure they coulde neuer do.
But we knowe well inoughe, it is not in their handes to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
Christ liue or die. Nether care we if they neuer thought
to kill him. Onely this I would showe what absurdite doth
folowe by their wicked and hainous doctrine.</hi> Thus awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
Caluin, thinking it a sufficient excuse to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the note of a slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derer and false accuser, hauing
well deserued it. We awnswer the same being no fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
accusers of Caluin, but true reporters of that we
finde in his writings, and saie, that we passe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Caluin euer thought as <hi>Arrius, Faustus Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
Valentinus, Samosatenus, Nestorius,</hi> and the who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le

how the doctrine of Caluin destroying the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
vpholdeth and reneweth the heresy of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</hi>
The opinion of <hi>Valentinus</hi> was that the body
of Christ was a celestiall body, descending from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

consisteth of two thinges to witt the earthly signes setting
before oure eyes according to oure caepacite the inuisible
thinges, and the Spirituall verite figured and exhibited by
the signes.</hi> The matter also of this <hi>spirituall verite</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth

               <hi>The bread remaineth bread terrestriall and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible:

Christ him selfe whiche consisteth of two thinges

will denie the reall presence of Christes flesh in the

            </p>
            <p>Againe <hi>Valentinus</hi> denied the resurrection of ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

What scripture telleth him, that by eating the

            <p>It is the doctrine of Caluin and all the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,

are his wordes as they lye in his institutions
in latin. Now let vs see the english. <hi>Nothing had ben
done,</hi> saieth Caluin, <hi>if Christ had dyed only by bodely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athe.</hi>
O hainous blasphemy of these cursed hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
What could be saied more blasphemously?
Hath not now the death of Christ satisfised for our
sinnes? Be these the ghospellers that sette forth and
commend so much the passion of Christ? Is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
death of Christ nothing? Must his soule suffer
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18354:234"/>
also in hell? You shall heare forth the wordes of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin.
<hi>But it was also requisit,</hi> saieth he, <hi>that Christ should
fele the rigour of gods vengeaunce, whereby he might appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
his wrath and satisfie his iust iudgment, that he should
fight and combat with the Hostes of hell and horrour off
eternall death.</hi> Lo he saieth Christ ought beside
his bodely death, which was on the Chrosse, fele
also the rigour of gods vengeaunce, satisfise also
his most iust iudgment, and abide the horrour of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death. O horrible blasphemy, mete for a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentary
ghospeller. For how then saied Christ
in his Crosse, after all the bitter torments suffred for
mankind and accomplished,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> It is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished?
Was he yet to suffer more in hell? And how
cried he in his last most blessed wordes, <hi>Father in to
thy handes I commend my Spirit?</hi> Was that to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
after of the deuils in hel? Dyd his Father ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
it no better, but let it be torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted yet again? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how was that only sacrifice on the Crosse (as S.<note place="margin">Hebr, 10.</note>
Paul saieth) a perfit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>summatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and sanctification for
euer? Must he yet besides suffer torments in hell?
So saieth Caluin, Master to all the Geneuian prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
of England, expresly against scripture, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
against God, and heretically against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
doctrine. And where writeth he this? In
his Institutions: a booke so precious in the eyes off
some pretended bishops, that it is by them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be read of such, as haue charge of soules. May
not we worthely crie with that holy father <hi>Policar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,
O Deus in quae nos tempora reseruasti?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 2. histor.</note> 
               <hi>O God to what
<pb facs="tcp:18354:235"/>
times hast thou reserued vs?</hi> Do we yet looke whether
these protestants tende, that so blasphemously write
of the blessed passion of Christ, and commaunde
such writings to be read of the vnlerned priests,
which shall teache it againe to the simple and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerned
people? And yet Caluin will proue his blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemyes
by scripture: truly euen as he proueth the
rest of his doctrine. For lo these are his wordes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
<hi>The prophet teacheth that the chastisement of our
peace was layed on him, he was smitten of the father for our
offences, and brused for our wickednes: by the which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
he signifieth that he was sent in to the place of sinners as
a surety, a pleadg, yea and as a gilty person to paie and
abide all such paines, as were to be required of them: only
this excepted that he could not be continually staied with
the sorowes of death. Therefore no maruail if he be sayed to
haue descended in to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ell seing he suffred such death as God
in his wrath punisheth the wicked withall.</hi> Thus farre
you haue the wordes of Caluin, and his hainous he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
therein contained. As for the saying off the
prophet, which (as he and his felowes do in infinit
other texts of holy scripture) he wresteth from the
true meaning, the Catholike church hath allwaies
taken it to haue ben fulfilled on the Crosse, in the
bodely death of Christ. For there he was smitten off
the Father for our offences, and brused for our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
there the chastisement of our peace and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
was layed vpon him. But Caluin, as if
he were a man priuileged from God to saie and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache
as he listeth, will haue it so ment, that Christ
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18354:235"/>
beside his bodely death on the Crosse, be sent in to
the place of sinners, which is hell (for of Christes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending

protestants do) he make no hell at all, and saie
that Christ descended no otherwise in to hell, but
that he was tormented on the Crosse)<note place="margin">Reade the preface of Staphilus pag. 18. and the le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>afe. 106.</note> there to paie
and abide all the torments of sinners, sauing that he
suffreth it not eternally. This is lo the rewarde off
heresy, and of such as forsake their faith: to fall in to
most horrible blasphemies, such as a Turk would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre:
and yet to see them not, but persuade them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
they haue the light of the gospell, and be only
true Christians, and all the worlde beside blind, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious

that hath ben this thousand yeares. I will no more

in time, of such perilous heresies, as these vngho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
ghospellers of Geneua bring to our deceiued
countre. We will now passe to the doctrine of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
touching the sacrament of baptim and consider
how pure and euangelicall his doctrine thereof is.</p>

               </note> though the doctrine
of Caluin be allmost of all protestants of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
not onely the sacramentaries, receiued and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
yet it containeth many straunge and horrible
heresies. Which so in that man happened, bicause he
serched all suttle shiftes, and pried out all the preuy
fetches he could deuise, whereby he might defeate
the doctrine of the Catholike church. For hereupon
<pb facs="tcp:18354:236"/>
he vvttereth in his doctrine diuers hainous heresies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorantly or malitiously. First therefore we wil
discouer vnto you, such of his heresies as are taken
off the olde condemned heretikes in the primitiue
Church: Then such as he forged him selfe expresly
against holy scripture, and yet defendeth them no
lesse foolishely then wickedly, as allwaies the proper
of heretikes is to do.</p>
            <p>It was the heresy of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Augustin recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that children were not borne in originall sinne.

onely whereas the <hi>Pelagians</hi> speake generally of
all children. But you shall see that by the proufe

it shall stretche to all children. For what is the

leaue their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnbaptised, bicause they are allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
admitted in to the leage of life euerlasting. Those
children coming to the age of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and hauing other
children, muste they baptise their children, or must
they not? If they muste baptise their children, then
the promis of God reacheth not vnto them. For if it
reached to them, it should ereache also to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
In which case they nede not be baptised, but
maie liue by the baptim of their grandfathers. If they
may not baptise their children, but let them liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute

It condemneth the whole churche. It is the heresy

baptim done in water bringeth no saluation,</hi> so Caluin
saieth <hi>that by the water of baptim we are not clensed.</hi>
With the other parte of the <hi>Maniches</hi> saying he agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as iuste as maye be, in the ende of the. 18. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Institutious, where he writeth thus. <hi>Non
ideo baptisantur infantes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>idelium, vt filij dei tunc fiant
<pb facs="tcp:18354:239"/>
primum &amp;c.</hi> that is. <hi>The infants of Christen men are not
therefore baptised, that they may become the children of god,
as thoughe they were before oute of the church, but rather
they are with a solemne token receaued into the church, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they appertained before to the body of Christ, by the
benefit of the promis. Therefore if we lette passe this token
withoute contempt or negligence, we are safe from all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
This he writeth blaming the Catholike churche
for suffring the midwiues and laye people in time of
necessite, to baptise children: sayeng, they nede not
so to do: but that withoute baptim the childe may
be saued: euen as the Maniches thought: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
estemed it nedeles, as Caluin dothe, to baptise
those of their secte.</p>
            <p>An other olde heresy Caluin by his doctrine off
baptim consequently defendeth, when he writeth
that after baptim, we nede no other penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, all oure
life time, but when we fall, haue a recourse to oure
baptim. His wordes in his Institutions the. 17. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
are these: <hi>Sic cogitandum est quocunque baptisemur
tempore, nos semel in omnem vitam ablui &amp; purgari. Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
quoties lapsi fuerimus, repetenda erit memoria baptismi,
&amp; hac armandus animus, vt de peccatorum remissione sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
certus securusque sit.</hi> that is. <hi>So we ought to thinke
whensoeuer we are baptised, that we are clensed and purged
for all oure life time. therefore as ofte as we fall we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
oure baptim, and arme oure minde therewith being
sure of forgeuenes of sinnes and carelesse.</hi> By this doctrine
Caluin wipeth awaie the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of penaunce: and
therefore in the wordes folowing, he teacheth that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18354:239"/>
the absolution geuen by the churche is referred to
baptim. Nowe to take awaie penaunce after baptim
and to denie the second table of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce, after the
shipwracke of oure former renewing in baptim by
deadly sinne (which in the 19. chapter of his instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he calleth a wicked doctrine) is an auncient he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
of the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> as in <hi>S. Ciprian</hi> euery where it
appereth, and in S. Ambrose, who wrote a lerned wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
against them. Lo the laudable and sounde doctrine
of Ihon Caluin, a man called of the deuil to raise vp
olde carren heresies, and to infect therewith the well
disposed hartes of good Christians.</p>
            <p>Truly if Hercules was a man muche renouned
and of great fame and reputation, for that he drewe
oute of hell (as poetes do faine) the great helhownde
Cerberus with is thre ougle heads, of what fame
and reputation trowe we, ought Caluin to be, who
hath plucked oute the deuill him selfe oute of hell
with three times three hainous and horrible heresies
(whiche aboue these thousand yeares haue ben tied
to the deape dongell of hell) and hath lette him lose
againe, to walke at his will, and preache at his pleasure
aboute the worlde? In the doctrine of the blessed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the aultar he raised vp, as you haue hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
the heresies of <hi>Arrius,</hi> of <hi>Samosatenus,</hi> of <hi>Nestori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
of <hi>Faustus Manicheus,</hi> of <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</hi>
In this sacrament of baptim, he teacheth as the
<hi>Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Maniches,</hi> and the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> all famous
and notorious heretikes taught aboue a thousand ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares
paste.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18354:240"/>
It shall not nede to discusse or examin any farder
his doctrine defending these heresies. It suffiseth for
any Christen man to knowe that they are olde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
heresies, and accompted for suche of the
church of Christ. And with this reason concluded
<hi>S. Augustin</hi> his litle treatise of heresies, hauing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
vp all suche as had ben from Christes time to
his. I wil geue you here his conclusion and doctrine,
for a good holesom triacle, against the poisons off
Caluin aboue recited. His wordes are these. <hi>Quid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
ista sentiat catholica Ecclesia superfluo quaeritur: cum
propter hoc scire sufficiat eam contra ista sentire, nec aliquid
horum in fidem quenquam debere recipere. Sed multum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuuat
cor fidele nosse quid credendum non sit, etiam si dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi
facultate id refutare non possit. Omnis itaque Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus
catholicus ista non debet credere.</hi> that is. <hi>It is but in
vaine to require what the Catholike church teacheth against
these heresies: it is inoughe to knowe that she dothe teache a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, and that no man ought to beleue any of all these.
But it auaileth muche to the faithfull and true beleuing
harte to knowe, what oughte not be beleued, though by drif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of reason it be not able to refute it. Therefore euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Catholike man ought in no wise beleue these thinges.</hi> Lo
we haue a good holesom lesson of this most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and lerned Father. I beseche god geue vs all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to folowe it, and to detest al suche doctrine and
doctours, as forceth vs to embrace suche olde cursed
heresies by their newe deuised fantasies, and to forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the Catholike churche of more then fiften hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18354:240"/>
patched together, and blasted abrode scant yet

            <p>His heresies forged of him selfe aboute baptim are
these.<note place="margin">In institut. Cap. 17. In comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. in. 1. Cor. Cap. 10.</note> First he teacheth that the baptim of S. Ihon and
the baptim of Christ was all one. Then that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
were no lesse baptised vnder Moyses in the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
and in the read sea, then Christen men are nowe
in the fonte. And that equall grace was geuen in
bothe. These are two heresies expressely against holy
scripture.</p>
            <p>As touching the firste S. Ihon in the ghospell put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a most manifest distinction betwene his baptim
and the baptim of Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> saying thus of him selfe.
<hi>I baptise you in water to repentaunce, but he that shall come
after me is of more power, then I am, he shall baptise you in
the holy ghoste and in fire.</hi> In these wordes S. Ihon decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that he baptised in water onely to repentaunce,
preparing the hartes off men and disposing them to
receaue the Messias Christ him selfe, who should
baptise them, not in water onely as Ihon did for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
but in the holy ghoste also and fire, that is,
geuing to those which by Christ were baptised the
holy, ghoste, as a full pleadge and assuraunce of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of oure sinnes, and the fire of burning and
ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t charite, whereby al vanites and pleasures of the
worlde shoulde be quenched and consumed.</p>
            <p>Againe if the baptim of <hi>S.</hi> Ihon were all one with
the baptim of Christ, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we must correct holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saieng of S. Ihon, <hi>praeibis ante faciem domini parare
rias eius, thou shalt go before the face of oure Lorde to praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18354:241"/>
               <hi>his waies,</hi> and saie with Caluin that he Christned
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as well as Christ dyd, and was the Lorde him sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
that should weane vs in to the faithe by his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the baptim of S. Ihon is called in holy
scripture no other, but <hi>baptismus penitentiae</hi> the baptim
of repentaunce. For repentaunce was the waie that
S. Ihon made to bring men to Christ. Nowe the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
of Christ is called <hi>lauacrum regenerationis &amp; reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uationis
spiritus sancti,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the fountaine of regeneration and
renewing of the holy ghoste.</hi> Be these all one? Is there
not a farre passing difference betwene them?</p>
            <p>Laste of all we reade in the actes of the Apostles
euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that suche as were baptised before of Ihon,
were after baptised againe by S. Paule.<note place="margin">Acto. 19.</note> The wordes of
the scripture are these. <hi>Paule coming to Ephesus founde
there certain disciples</hi> (that is suche as bore them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
for Christians) <hi>and he saied vnto them, haue ye recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the holy ghost and do ye beleue? but they saied vnto him.
We haue not so muche as heard if there be any holy Ghoste.
Then he saied. Wherein then are ye baptised? which awn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
vnto him, In the baptim of Ihon. Then Paule saied
Ihon baptised the people with the baptim of penaunce, telling
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should beleue in him that should come after him, that
is, in Iesus. This being heard, they were baptised in the name
of oure Lorde Iesus.</hi> Hetherto the wordes of holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
Nowe if the baptim of Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Christ were al
one, as Caluin saieth, why dyd S. Paule baptise them
againe as the scripture here declareth? Doth Caluin
allowe rebaptisation? Is he an Anabaptist? Or were
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18354:241"/>
they baptised againe bicause they were not instructed
before in the holy ghoste? This were in dede a good
reason for the furious Anabaptistes to make vs all
come to the fonte again, bicause when we were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,
we vnderstode nothing of the holy ghoste. What
shift then hath Caluin here to defeate this most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
text of holy scripture? Truly he laboureth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
to defeate in it his institutions: but with no
lesse foly then impudency. For whereas it is writen
<hi>they were baptised in the name of Iesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caluin denieth scripture. <hi>Institu. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>p,</hi> 17.</note> that is saieth Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,
<hi>they receaued visible and sensible graces of the holy ghost
they were not baptised again.</hi> Lo the scripture saieth, <hi>they
were baptised in the name of Iesus.</hi> Caluin saieth <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
visible graces of the holy ghoste.</hi> Maye not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
this meanes come and denie baptim vtterly and saie
that after the ascension of Christ none were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
For in all the newe testament after the ascension
of Christ we reade of no other baptim, but that men
were baptised in the name of Iesus. So we reade in the
first sermon of S. Peter made after the coming dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of the holy goste. <hi>Baptizetur vnusquisque vestrum in
nomine Iesu Christi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acto. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Let euery one of you be baptised in the
name of Iesus Christ.</hi> And of the <hi>Centurion</hi> and all his
house it is writen,<note place="margin">Acto. 10.</note> 
               <hi>they were baptised in the name of oure
lorde Iesus Christ.</hi> Nowe all this by Caluins doctrine
was no baptim, but onely a receauing of visible gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from the holy ghoste. For why maye it not as
well meane so in other places as here? shall scripture
meane sometime one thinge, sometimes an other as
it pleaseth Caluin?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18354:242"/>
Againe many were baptised, that receaued not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
visible graces. Or els Caluin must saie there is no
baptim nowe in the worlde nor hath no ben these
many hundred yeares. <hi>Cornelius</hi> also and his family
receaued those visible graces before they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.<note place="margin">Acto. 10.</note>
Whereby we lerne it is not al one to receaue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
visible graces, and to be baptised.</p>
            <p>But what nede we farder refute this impudent he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall
shifte of Caluin? It foloweth immediately in
the text aboue recited. <hi>Et quum imposuisset manus eis
Paulus, venit Spiritus Sanctus super eos &amp; loquebantur lin
guis &amp; prophetabant.</hi> that is. <hi>And when Paule had laied
handes ouer them the holy ghoste came down vpon them
and they spake with tongues and prophecied.</hi> Lo these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
giftes were geuen them after they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by laieng on of handes. For the scripture telleth
vs, that first S. Paule baptised them, and after layed
handes on them, which being done the visible graces
were geuen them.</p>
            <p>What thinke ye now? did Caluin trow ye reade so
farre?<note place="margin">In institut. Cap. 17.</note> yes sothely. And yet goeth he forth to defend
impudently that which he had ones wickedly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
For he saieth, <hi>all this was but one action though it be
diuersly tolde, for two seuerall actions.</hi> and he saieth so
onely. But by what authorite, by what reason saieth
he so? He telleth vs, <hi>it is the maner of the hebrew phrase to
speake first the matter shortely, and after to sette it forthe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
at large.</hi> What if it be the maner of the hebrew phra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se?
Is it so allwaies, or sometimes onely? If it be so all
waies, then shoulde he at leste haue brought here one
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18354:242"/>
example. Nowe he bringeth none at al. Beside that he
shooteth very wide of the marke.<note place="margin">Quinquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boreus in Operegra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> No tounge auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
more idle repetitions of one thinge, no tounge
affecteth more breuite and speaketh more in fewer
wordes, then the hebrew dothe: and therefore it
is called of al other most chaste, frugall, and lesse ryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
in la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage. I reporte me herein to the skilful the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.
If he meane it is the hebrewe phrase sometimes
to speake so, what of that? so is it the greke phrase,
the latin phrase, and the phrase of all tongues someti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
to do. What then? Bicause it dothe so sometime,
ergo dothe it so in this place?</p>
            <p>But where trowe ye was Caluins witt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce
when he wrote this?<note place="margin">An impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uin.</note> What meaned he
to bleare oure eyes with the authorite of an hebrew
phrase in this place, whiche nother was writen in the
hebrew tongue nor of any hebrician? For whose
wordes are those we alleaged you before? Be they
not writen in the Actes of the Apostles the .19. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
Was the Actes of the Apostles euer writen in the
hebrewe tongue? we neuer heard yet, that any parte
of the new testament was writen in the hebrewe ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
except S. Matthewes ghospell onely and the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
vnto the hebrewes. Againe who wrote the Actes
of the Apostles? Was it not S. Luke the Euangelist a
greke borne, to witt at <hi>Antiochia?</hi> To what a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
shift trowe ye was this willfull proude heretike
driuen, when to vpholde his heresy against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
wordes of scripture, after all other shiftes, he
was glad at the length to flie to the succour of an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe
<pb facs="tcp:18354:243"/>
phrase, in suche a text as neither was writen in
the hebrewe tongue, neither of any hebrewe borne?
But what will not an heretike do, rather then he will
acknowleadg the truthe? We reade that onely Christ
was able to put the <hi>Pharises</hi> to silence, and stoppe the
mouthes of the <hi>Sadduces:</hi> two hereticall sectes of the
Iewes as the Lutherans and the Caluinistes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
of the Christians. We haue peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ben ouer
longe in this one point. But it was necessary that the
suttle shiftes of that wily heretike, shoulde be discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
This perilous booke of his Institutions, is (as I
vnderstande) in oure englishe tongue, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be reade of the simple and vnlerned priestes.
Let these fewe pointes, that by occasion in this oure
discours we haue discouered, be a lesson and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
aduertisme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto them, what to iudge of the rest.
Truly it were better for them, being vnlerned, to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe
a serpent at their table, then to reade this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
poisonned booke: whereby the olde serpent is
euer at hande to seduce them, in to most hainous:
heresies, and most horible blasphemies, as we haue
before in parte touched.</p>
            <p>The seconde heresy that Caluin vttereth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
himselfe aboute this doctrine of baptim is, <hi>that
the Iewes were baptised in the cloude and in the read sea, as
we are in the fonte.</hi> He teacheth this doctrine in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
vpon the first to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the tenth
chapter, and concludeth that <hi>&amp; in spirituali substantia
&amp; in figura visibili</hi> bothe in the spirituall substaunce
and in the visible figure, their baptim in the cloude
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18354:243"/>
and in the read sea, agreeth with oure baptim in the
fonte. And therefore he teacheth the Iewes to haue
had the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of baptim no lesse then we. And this
he dothe, bicause he woulde bringe oure Christen
faith to mere figures, signes, and shadowes, in the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
the Iewes in the olde lawe were traded to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perfection vnder Christ, as S. Paule teacheth. But
let vs see howe hereticall and false this doctrine is.</p>
            <p>First it repugneth manifestly against holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.
For S. Paule after he had saied, <hi>the Iewes were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the cloude and in the read sea,</hi> he saieth euen imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after <hi>Hec in figura facta sunt nostri, these thinges
were done in the figure of vs.</hi> and againe after a fewe lines,
<hi>Haec autem omnia in figura contingebant illis. all these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
happened to them in figure.</hi> And thus do all holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de this place.<note place="margin">Homil. 23. in 1. r. 10. tract. 11. &amp; 45. in Ioan.</note> Chrisostom saieth. <hi>Veritatis

Theodoret writeth, that the cloud ouer shadowing them from

vs from flame of concupiscence and sinne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom
likewise writeth that these thinges happened
vnto them <hi>in vmbra &amp; typo, non in veritate, in shadowe
and figure, not in verite.</hi> Onely Caluin against expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
scripture, and so many lerned fathers, impudently, as
his maner is, defendeth that the cloude and the read
sea was as true a baptim to the Iewes as the holy fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
is to vs. But let vs see what absurde inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:18354:244"/>
depend of this doctrine, thoughe nor scripture, nor
authorite of holy fathers made against it.</p>
            <p>If the children of Israel were baptised bothe in the
read sea and in the cloude, with the like perfection as
we in the fonte, then they were twise baptised: and our
baptim may be double not withstanding the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. Which being so, we must chaunge the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in S. Paule, saying <hi>there is vna fides, vnum baptisma
but one faithe and but one baptim.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> Caluin here awnswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that these are two different signes, making but
one baptim, awnswering to oure baptim. But see I pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie
you what a sory shifte this is. For first by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Caluin,<note place="margin">Iustitut. Cap. 17.</note> (as you haue heard before) <hi>baptim
is nought els but a signe of the remission of sinnes, by the which
we are admitted in to the felowship and societe of Christen
men.</hi> Nowe if the Iewes had two suche different sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
had they not two baptims? or els if those two
signes made but one baptim, then in the clowde they
were not baptised, vntell they had passed the read sea,
which was afterwarde. Nowe S. Paule saieth, <hi>they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
baptised in the cloude, and in the sea.</hi> Iff the worde <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised,</hi>
as Caluin will haue it, be ment of true baptim,
suche as oures is, then were they truly baptised bothe
in the cloude and in the sea: whiche were two diuers
actions, and at two sundry times.</p>
            <p>Againe if the children of Israel were baptised in
the cloude and in the sea, with the like perfection as
we are in the fonte, howe will Caluin auoide the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of an Anabaptiste, seing they were baptised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their circumcision by the doctrine of Caluin?
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18354:244"/>
For Caluin in his Institutions, in his chapter of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
teacheth <hi>that circuncision was to the Iewes as baptim
was to vs: the onely difference being in the outwarde signe.</hi>
to witt, that by circuncision they had remission off
sinnes, life euerlasting, and were admitted in to the
leage of god. And oure baptim (as you haue heard)
Caluin defineth to be naught els, but a sure token or
warrant that we be admitted in to the societe and
number of Christen men ioyned in leage to god.
Nowe if the Iewes by Circumcision had their perfit
baptim, and yet in the cloude and in the sea were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
again as perfitly, dothe not this doctour of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua
teache vs diuersite of baptims?<note place="margin">Caluin furdereth the cause of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note> Dothe he not
muche furder the cause of the Anabaptistes? Seing it is
but a matter of signes by Caluins doctrine, haue not
they greate occasion to crie vpon rebaptisation? It
is not muche to be maruailed, if so many Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
be also Anabaptistes, as experience doth showe
in all those countres, where Sacramentaries do swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
The doctrine of Caluin dothe minister right
good occasion thereunto, as you shall see yet by one
consequence more, deducted of this his heresie.</p>
            <p>If the Iewes were baptised in their circuncision, in
the cloude, in the sea, and receaued the same baptim
as Christen men do in the fonte, howe saye we to the
baptim of S. Ihon? Why dyd S. Ihon baptise the Iewes
being baptised before with the very same baptim? For
if (as Caluin here saieth) the Iewes were baptised
in the cloude, and in the sea, no lesse then we are in
the baptim of Christ, and againe the baptim of S.
<pb facs="tcp:18354:245"/>
Ihon be, (as you hearde him saie before) the very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
baptim, that Christ his baptim is, why, I saie, dyd
S. Ihon baptise them againe? Dothe he not here te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache
plaine rebaptisation? Let vs yet go one steppe
farder.</p>
            <p>The Iewes, saieth Caluin, were baptised in the
cloude, and in the sea, in their circuncision, in the
baptim of S. Ihon, euen as we are in the water of ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
baptim. Why then dyd S. Peter at his first sermon
made to the Iewes exhorte them to baptim againe?
And those of the Iewes whiche beleued in Christe,
why were they baptised, as the text saieth they were?
For it is writen.<note place="margin">Acto. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Qui receperunt sermonem eius baptisati
sunt, they that receaued the worde of Peter, were baptised.</hi>
And why dyd Ananias baptise S. Paule? If the Iewes
were as verely and as truly baptised in the clowde, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
Moyses,<note place="margin">Acto. 9.</note> (whiche Caluin most impudently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth)
as we are in the fonte vnder Christ, and his
minister, why were they baptised againe of S. Ihon,
or of the Apostles, when they came to the faithe of
Christ? What a numbre of baptims dothe Caluin tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
vs, beside the one onely baptim of Christ, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
the Catholike church hathe lerned in holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Circuncision, the clowde, the sea, the baptim of
S. Ihon, and al these the very same and of the selfe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
effect, and force, as the baptim of Christ. Is not
Caluin trowe ye a ioyly Anabaptiste? Nay dothe he
not farre passe the Anabaptistes? They go aboute to
repete one twise. Caluin maketh vs fyue for one: off
the which euery Christned Iewe by his doctrine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18354:245"/>
foure. and euery vnchristened Iewe hathe three.</p>
            <p>I woulde nowe passe from his heresies to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.
But I muste nedes put you in minde off
one ioyly tricke of Caluin which he practised in the
planting of this heresy. In his commentaries vpon
S Paule where he teacheth this doctrine, after longe
labour and strife, seing he coulde bringe forthe no
true childe, but that it proued to a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster, and ougle
vnnatural thinge, and perceauing one foule faute in
it which he thought most of all those of his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
would abhorre, he goeth aboute to cloke it and
colour it, as wel as he maie. The greate faute that he
espied him selfe in this doctrine, is, that it had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
scripture for it. You shall heare him finde the
faute and see howe he will remedy it. These be his
wordes. <hi>Sed rursum obijcitur:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caluin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth doctrine of his ovv<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
               <hi>nullum de his verbum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare.
I d ego fateor: sed neque dubium hoc est quin Deus
spiritu suo defectum externae praedicationis suppleuerit.</hi> that
is, <hi>But they will obiecte againe. That there is no worde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
hereof. That do I confesse, but it is not to be doubted but
that God by his Spirit hath supplied the lacke of external
preaching.</hi> Lo Caluin nowe is glad to runne to the
refuge of the holy ghoste for his doctrine whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
faileth him. But when the Catholike churche,<note place="margin">Caluin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvil not al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lovve the doctrine of the church vvithout scripture</note>
directed allwaies and assisted by the holy ghoste, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acheth
vs any thinge, that is not expressed in holy
scripture, Caluin can not abide it. Hereupon in his
Institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he raileth at the adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ in the
blessed sacrament, bicause in holy scripture, saieth he,
<hi>Nulla eius mentio ostendi potest, quae tamen non fuisset</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18354:246"/>
               <hi>pretermissa si deo accepta foret,</hi> that is. <hi>No mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there of
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be showed, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding had not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omitted, if it
had liked god.</hi> And in the matter of reseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though
he grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that the primitiue church vsed it, yet bicause
it is not expressed in scripture, he wil none of it. Thus
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaseth Caluin, scripture is requisit, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it pleaseth him not, scripture may be lacked and the
spirit of god maie supplie it. In like maner though he
crie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scripture alwaies, and (as we noted you befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
oute of his Institutitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) wil not allow the church
no farder,<note place="margin">Cap. 8. de side.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she bringeth expresse scripture for her,
yet not only in this place he teacheth beside scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth it to, but also in many other places.</p>
            <p>In the matter of the blessed sacrament of the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
you haue sene in howe many and sundry poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
his doctrine repugneth to holy scripture, while
he laboureth to persuade men, that to be but bread
and wine, which oure Sauiour pronounced to be his
body and bloud. It cometh nowe to my minde, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
impudenly he shifteth awaie the authorite of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
scripture, where with he sawe him selfe pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
You shall heare his wordes. In his Institutions
the 18. chapter thus he writeth. <hi>Vtcunque verboru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti

which will not go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the real presence of Christ

him felfe to be a very <hi>Antichriste?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caluin is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</note> For what can

speake plainely, yet you must harken also what we

a more righter Antichrist, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this heretike Calui.</p>
            <p>You haue sene good readers, what heresies and
howe diuers Caluin hathe partely renewed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forged of his owne, in his doctrine aboute these
two Sacraments, which onely he acknowleadgeth,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:247"/>
and taketh for Sacraments. If we woulde vse the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
diligence in other points of his doctrine, we coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
be longe, and should be, I feare, tedious. And truly
it were to be wished, that neither the heresies of this
man, neither any heresie at all were knowen to the
common and vnlerned people. But bicause this sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
heretike hathe so wined him selfe in to mens har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
that he hathe trained them not onely from the
Catholike churche of Christ, but also from the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and Melanchthonistes, which before bore all
the swaie of this new gospell, I thought good to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his heresies, and other abominable doctrine
aboute these two Sacraments, as two of the waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest
articles nowe in controuersy, and most
of all other touching oure saluation: to the entent
that not onely the Catholikes, and suche as god of
his goodnes hathe hetherto staied in the faithe of
the churche, may (as they do) vtterly abhorre his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
neither yelde by the wickednes of the time, to
any one point thereof, but also oure dere deceiued
countremen, that so gladly reade his workes, and so
gredely deuoure his diue lish doctrine, maye lerne of
these fewe, what to iudge of the rest, and by the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
taste of these mislike the remnant of his vnpleasant
and most poisonned doctrine. For if in these two
blessed Sacraments, the one being the gate and entry
of saluation, the other being a most heauenly foode
to preserue vs therein, he sticketh not to vtter so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
heresies, and setteth him selfe so wickedly aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst
the church of god, what conscience trowe ye is
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18354:247"/>
he like to take in other pointes of oure Christen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
lesse necessary, and of lesse importance? well:
Though he were in al the rest sounde and withoute
blot, yet these his heresies of vs recited, of him vttered
and taught, maye be sufficient to discredit him in the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of any Christien harte. For I thinke, and
trust verely, there is no Christen man in all the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of England, be he neuer so farre waded in heresy,
but that he dothe reuerence the primitiue church of
Christ, of the first fyue or six hundred yeares, and
will be ready to condemne all suche heresies, as were
in that time and age co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned. Nowe the <hi>Maniches,</hi>
the <hi>Aria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> the <hi>Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinians,</hi> the <hi>Marcionistes,</hi> the <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>

in the compas of those fiue hundred yeares conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
If we woulde come downe lower, we coulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
a number more of heretikes, condemned also in
Christ his church, with whose heresies the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of Caluin dothe agree. But in consideration of
the impudent bragges made nowe in euery pulpit,
that all is reduced to the state of the primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
I haue chosen oute suche heresies in Caluins
doctrine, as were in that time condemned: geuing
you to vnderstand that all is not the gospell which
is there spoken: vnlesse perhaps by reducing all to the
state of the primitiue church, they meane renewing
of olde heresies condemned in the primitiue church.
And truly so must they meane if they saie truly. But
let vs returne to Caluin.</p>

In the doctrine of free will,<note place="margin">Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Caluin aboute the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of free vv. l.</note> I will make no espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
recitall of his heresies: But note you his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
of the which euer one part is an heresy.
In his Institutions the .14. chapter, he writeth, <hi>that
God did not only foresee the fall of the first man Adam, and
in it the fall of all his posterite, but also it was his will, it
should be so.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 57. pag. 132 &amp; 136.</note> Againe in his booke of predestination
against <hi>Pighius</hi> he hath the same doctrine, saying <hi>that
God would not haue suffred Adam to fall, but that he
would haue it so to be.</hi> Also <hi>that God so determined it
and ordained it.</hi> Now in his booke of free will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Pighius</hi> also, he saith in two places these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
<hi>I confesse with Origen that those which take away free
will from Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before he sinned, be heretikes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 67. 68.</note> How agree
these sayings of him? If it were not only the will of
God that Adam should fall, but also that he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
and ordained it so to be, then he fell of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.
For the determined will of God can not be
frustrated. Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therefore could not, if he had would
continewed in his innocency. And yet had he free
will? If hotte and colde be all one, then is this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
vniforme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe in his booke of predestination he saith.</hi>
All wsuchickednes as man committeth by malice of his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,<note place="margin">pag. 243.</note>
procedethae so of God, and that not without good reason,
although we knowe it not. <hi>And to make his opinion
herein most clere, in the same booke he saieth.</hi> It is
a fonde solution of S. Paules saying, Esadu odio habui, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Esau, to saie that the reprobats do worke their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
by their owne malice. <hi>And yet see what he
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18354:248"/>
saith in his institutions the .2. chapter.</hi> Man, <hi>saith he,</hi>
can not impute the hardnes of his hart to any other cause,
then to him selfe. <hi>This lo is most true. But why then
saied he before,</hi> the wickednes of man procedeth of God?
<hi>Why reprouueth he that solution, which he now
maketh him selfe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farder Caluin in his booke of predestination,
going aboute to mitigat his former doctrine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
he taught <hi>that the reprobats could not chose, but do euill,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 156.</note>
saieth afterwarde, <hi>he meaneth not of euery particular
worke.</hi> for a litle before he confesseth Saul had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
certain thinges well. But directly contrary to
this shift is an other expresse doctrine of his in the
very same booke,<note place="margin">Pag. 154.</note> where he saieth. <hi>Men can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
haue any affection to do well, vnlesse they be of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

            </p>
            <p>Caluin yet for the better auauncement of his
wicked doctrine against free will, pretendeth to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>S. Augustin</hi> in all pointes. And therefore in his
booke of predestination, he saieth, <hi>he varieth not from
S. Augustin so much as one sillable in this question of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note>
Notwithstanding in his Institutions he
saieth,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> that <hi>S. Augustin was sometime scrupulous, and
would not tell the truthe of predestination roundely.</hi> as
when in his booke <hi>De praedestinatione &amp; gratia</hi> he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth,
<hi>that the induration and blinding of the reprobats is
not to be referred to the worke and operation of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>but
<pb facs="tcp:18354:249"/>
only to his foreknowleadg.</hi> Here in this most gracious
doctrine of that good Father, Caluin chargeth him
with scrupulosite. And yet he will beare vs in hand
forsothe, that he agreeth euen in euery sillable with
<hi>S. Augustin.</hi> Where in the one he declareth him selfe
a praesumptuous heretike: in the other a false contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictour
of his owne sayings.</p>
            <p>Finally Caluin as in wordes and doctrine, so in
doings and behauiour contrarieth his owne self.<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> In
his Institutions he wrireth: <hi>It was neuer permitted to
preachers of Gods worde to adde any one sillable to holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptare,
or diminish from thence, but to preache the only bare
worde, as it lieth.</hi> Now as in all his doctrine he talketh
more then halfe beside holy scripture, so in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of predestination he is not afeard to adde to the
very text of S. Paule, wordes of his owne, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intenaunce
of his wicked doctrine. For in his Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
labouring to refer the induration of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats

Caluin added to the text of Gods worde for a vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to witt, to make vs beleue, that <hi>from the beginning</hi>
euen before the fall of Adam, God was the cause off
induration aud harde hart of reprobats. For he is not
you see, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to attribut it only to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
and malice, but seketh a superiour cause in God,
and that by the wordes of S. Paule <hi>from the beginning,</hi>
which he nor none of all his scholers are euer able to
showe vs in any text of S. Paule, that is. This is lo the
plaine dealing of these ghospellers and refourmers of
Christes Church: These be the chalengers of Gods
worde. This is the pure text they vaunte and boaste
of. They pretend to couet after the pure text and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
letter. But as the poet saied, <hi>ex vno disce omnes.</hi> By
Caluin lerne what the rest are. And <hi>Time Danaos &amp;
dona ferentes.</hi> trust not an heretike though he bringe
you scripture it selfe.</p>
            <p>What false tricke is there,<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of Caluin, touvard holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.</note> that Caluin hath not
plaied? He hath corrupted the text with false transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:250"/>
as we showed you in the 9. chapter, of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
prouerbes. He belieth holy Scripture, as yow
heard in the S. chapter of S. Paull to the Romans. He
denieth expresse scripture, as we declared you in the
19. chapter of the Actes of the Apostles. He requireth
to be heard against expresse scripture, as we recited
you oute of his Institutions. And nowe you see he
addeth to holy Scripture. If this archeprotestant and
greate ghospelling doctour, behaueth him selfe so in
his printed workes, which remaine to be vewed of all
lerned men, what will the nouices of his religion,
and young prinking preachers sticke to do in pulpits,
where they knowe their audience to be not allwaies
lerned: and of the lerned, some of a presumed preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to take all for good, other to winke at all <hi>&amp; vti
foro?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Albeit the doctrine of Caluin (as you haue partly
sene) be stuffed with abhominable heresies and most
absurde contradictions, yet in all his doctrine he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
peremptorely. He matcheth him selfe with the
Apostles. He condemneth and reprouueth at his ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asure
all holy fathers. Whereby his pride and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuousnes
sure mates of heresy vttereth it selfe. I will
for example note you a fewe of his sayinges, where
you shall see howe proudely he demeaneth him selfe
and howe courteousely he ordereth the holy, aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and lerned fathers.</p>
            <p>First as touching his contradictions about free
will, witting and feeling him selfe very well, that he
might wottly be charged therewith, in one place of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18354:250"/>
his booke of predestination he vtereth his feare, and
with a worde of his mouthe thinketh to make all
the matter smothe.<note place="margin">pag. 61.</note> These are his wordes. <hi>I saie again
I am not ignorant what apparent absurdite and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
this doctrine hath with prophane men, and dispisors of
God. But whatsoeuer they bable or barke, our conscience
ought to serue vs for a thousand witnesses.</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
warrant of the vniformite of his doctrine? For
what saieth he? Forsothe whatsoeuer contradictions
we see and beholde with our eyes, yet we must trust
Caluins co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, that he is so honest a man, that he
would neuer saie or vtter any such thing. Now reade
againe those fewe of his contradictions that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
recited, who list, and let him iudge in his owne
conscience, what the conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Caluin is, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
farre it is to be trusted.</p>
            <p>Againe as touching the singularite off his doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
which he knoweth and confesseth to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the olde fathers, what reason, thinke ye, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
he for the defence off it? In his treatise of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
the 17. chapter of his Institutions, he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
the wordes of Christ to <hi>Nicodemus, Vnlesse a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

to the knigdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heauen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioan. 2.</note> to be but an allegoricall speache
against the whole practise off Christes church, and
consent of all holy fathers, and lerned writers expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unding
the wordes off Christ literally as the text
hath, for necessite of baptim. This Caluin knewe
and confessed. But how then thinke you doeth he

Ye shall heare. After longe talke thus he
concludeth. <hi>Scio alios aliter interpretari, sed hunc esse
germanum sensum non dubito.</hi> that is. <hi>I knowe that other
men haue otherwise expounded this, but I doubt not but this
is the right sence.</hi> Lo Caluin doubteth not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must beleue him more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
What is arrogancy, if this be not?</p>
            <p>Likewise in his doctrine and booke of predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Pag. 164. &amp; 165.</note>
such as finde fault with his doctrine, he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth
they blaspheme God: and crieth vnto them, as
S. Paul did to such as Caluin is.<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
               <hi>VVhat arte thou man
which disputest with God?</hi> Now what the doctrine off
Caluin is, you haue sene partly by this our simple
discourse, and more especially it appeareth in the
third parte of this Apologie. Yet he matcheth him
selfe with God,<note place="margin">In the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe 112.</note> and vaunteth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptrollers of his
hereticall doctrine with the check of S. Paul, as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
serchers of Gods depe secrets. And therefore no
maruail iff he sett light by the holy Fathers off
Christes church and reuerence them no deale at
all.</p>
            <p>In his treatise of baptim,<note place="margin">Institut. Cap. 27</note> labouring to promote
his heresy, touching the baptim off S. Ihon, that it
should be equall with the baptim of Christ, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that the Fathers of the church laie in his waie
and withstode him,<note place="margin">Caluin disprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the lerned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> to make the restafeared, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the venter vpon S. Augustin, and saieth. <hi>Nec

peccata Ioannis baptismo, Christi baptismo reipsa dimitti,</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:18354:251"/>
that is. <hi>Neither is that sutteltly off Augustin to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that by the baptim of Ihon sinnes were forgeuen but in
hope, by the baptim off Christ they are forgeuen in dede.</hi> In
other places he calleth S. Augustin,<note place="margin">Cap. 18. de cena domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> 
               <hi>in dogmatibus ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae

               </hi> a most trusty repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of antiquite in doctrines of the church. But when
it pleaseth M. Caluin, S. Augustins doctrine is but a sut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>telty.
Likewise reprouuing the doctrine of penaunce,
where it is compared to the borde after a shipwrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
which is a vsuall similitude off all lerned writers,<note place="margin">Cap. 19. de peniten.</note>
he writeth thus. <hi>They saie it is the similitude of Hierom,
whose so euer it be, no doubt but it is a wicked similitude.</hi>
Againe in his treatise of predestination, where as S.
Gregory (as all other Catholike writers) teacheth
that no man can be assured off his election,<note place="margin">Cap. 14. de predest. &amp; prouiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note> he vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
proudly that lerned Father with these wordes.
<hi>Pessimé &amp; perniciose Gregorius &amp;c.</hi> that is? <hi>worst of al and
wickedly taught Gregory &amp;c.</hi> In his commentaries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the sixt of Iohn disprouing the interpretation of
Chrisostom, whom <hi>Theophilact, Euthymius</hi> and diuers
haue coueted alwaies to folowe, <hi>Fallitur</hi> saieth he, <hi>meo
iudicio Chrisostomus,</hi> Chrisostom in my iudgement is
deceiued. What thinke you would Caluin feare to
vtter, that setteth so light by these lerned fathers,
whom the church so many hundred yeares hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
and folowed? May not we saie to Caluin
and al such presumptuous preachers of new doctrine,
we knowe S. Augustin, we reuerence S. Hierom, we
credit Gregory and Chrisostom: but you M. Caluin
what are you, as it was saied to the vnbeleuing Iewes
<pb facs="tcp:18354:252"/>
attempting to worke miracles vnder the name of
Iesus and Paul,<note place="margin">Acto. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Iesum noui, Paulu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scio, vos aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qui estis?</hi>
that is, <hi>Iesus I knowe and Paule also, but who are you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Caluin yet staieth not here, he is not contented to
reiect certai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Fathers the most lerned and most
approued, in certain pointes. He goeth farder. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth
the whole primitiue church in the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
of the worshipping of God. For disputing against
the blessed sacrifice of the Masse, he chargeth it with
Iuish superstition: and thus he pronounceth off the
whole order of the speciall and most principall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of the primitiue church.<note place="margin">Cap. 18. de cena domi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ni.</note> 
               <hi>They folowed rather the
Iuish maner of sacrificing, then as Christ had ordained, or
the order of the ghospel required.</hi> Thus saieth Caluin, not
speaking of these late yeares, but euen of the primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
church,<note place="margin">Caluin condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the primitiue church,</note> of the first six hundred yeares, vnto the
which time our Caluinistes at home dissenting in
this point from their Master (at lest as they pretend)
do referr all their doings and make the people beleue
that the primitiue Church vsed that order of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
as they do now, telling them withall that
the blessed sacrifice of the Masse and the maner the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
hath ben vsed onely sence these later hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares. Notwithstanding Caluin their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
acknowledgeth that maner off sacrifising in
the primitiue Church, longe before that time,
which bicause off the ceremonies thereof he calleth
<hi>Iuish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wote not herein what more to maruail at and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
other the vntolerable pride of this presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18354:252"/>
heretike condemning the very primitiue church
and therefore leauing vs no church sense the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hence of our Sauiour, or the wicked guile of our
newe preachers, which doing no lesse then Caluin
doth, sett yet a better coulour thereon, to entrappe
thereby the readier the vnlerned and well meaning
people in to their schismatical communion. For they
condemne not openly the primitiue church of <hi>Iuish
sacrifising,</hi> as Caluin doth, but denie stoutely that any
such sacrifice or cerimonies was then vsed,<note place="margin">Iuell.</note> and offer
to yelde if we can proue it. Let them now lerne off
their Masters owne confession, that such there was,
and let them lerne off their Crede, where they saie
they beleue the Catholike church, not to condemne
the primitiue church therein, which if they denie to
be the Catholike and true church of Christ, they
may as wel denie Christ him selfe head thereof, and
frustrat the whole, mistery of his blessed Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as you heard before Dauid George did, and many
Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Caluinistes do now in diuers partes of
Germany to the great grief of al good Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hartes</p>
            <p>But to returne to Caluin, what may not he
or any other heretike do, condemning and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
light by the fathers of the primitiue Church?
For by them we haue not onely the true and
right interpretation of holy scripture, but the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
also it selfe: which without their testimouy we
could not be assured of. Wherefore <hi>S. Augustin</hi> after
he had left the Manichees, and cleaued to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like
church of Christ, writing against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and commending
<pb facs="tcp:18354:253"/>
vnto them the authorite thereof, he saieth.
<hi>Euangelio non crederem nisi me Ecclesiae commoueret au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas.</hi>
I would not beleue the ghospell, vnlesse the
authorite of the church moued me thereto. Now
<hi>Caluin</hi> is nothing moued therewith, but leaneth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
to his owne iudgement then to al the lerned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and holy Fathers of Christes church beside.
Whereof he was worthely ones checked of <hi>Bucer,</hi>
telling him <hi>quod iudicaret prout amaret, amaret autem
prout libet. that he iudged as he loued, and loued what him
pleased.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Epist. a familiari.</note> And truly the only cause whereby Caluin in
his Institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in his comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and in other his workes abuseth the reader and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
the vnlerned is, that he feareth not expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
scriptures boldely to preferr his owne iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
eloquently sett forth before the iudgement of <hi>S.
Augustin, Hierom, Chrisostom, Ciprian, Gregory, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
and all the other holy lerned men that euer
wrote. Now what arrogancy is this? If euery lerned
man may sette forthe his iudgement to the worlde
as the true meaning of Gods worde, and condemne
the allowed doctours of so great antiquite, lerning,
and vertu, as the holy Fathers are, who seeth not that
euery countre in Christendom, euery vniuersite
of the countre, yea and euery lerned man of eche
colledg in the vniuersite may plante from time to ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
new doctrine, make new expositions off holy
scripture contrary to all other, and teache daily a new
faith? especially in this our time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lerned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such
as Caluin was, lacke not in al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tres. Howe bitterly

<hi>Illyricus, VVestphalus</hi> against <hi>Caluin, Brentius</hi> against
<hi>Peeter Martyr,</hi> and all the other against these? Eche
of them by lerning laboureth to drawe the worlde
to their owne iudgement, while they all condemne
all other mens iudgements. You will saie. We must
cleaue to scripture, and leaue al partes aside. Truly al
do so. And that is not the controuersy betwene these
men, nor betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the Catholikes, which of
them cleaue to scripture (For al do so as fast as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
but whether of them all do rightly expounde,

            <p>The <hi>Zuinglians</hi> and <hi>Caluinistes</hi> agree with the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

these two sectes in diuers other articles vary out off

            <p>The <hi>Lutherans of Saxony,</hi> to witt, the <hi>zelous Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraus</hi>
agree with the <hi>Caluinistes</hi> denying free will:

Yet againe these <hi>zelous Lutherans</hi> in the article of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall

the <hi>Caluinistes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Callus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra acta Adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristarum.</note> But in the articles of Iustification,

For they teache good workes to be pernicious to

            <p>The <hi>Osiandrins</hi> agree with the <hi>zelous Lutherans</hi> of

But these againe dissent from all those three sectes
in the article of Iustification, and diuers other speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
pointes of doctrine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Suenckfeldians</hi> agree with the <hi>Osiandrins</hi> in

Thus you see brefely sett before you the vnite,
consent, and agreement of this late ghospel. You see
what man <hi>Luther</hi> was, what <hi>Melanchthon,</hi> what <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi>
the three cursed springs of three most wicked

You may iudge by the heads, what the ofspring
is: by their frutes, what their sprits be: by these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars

            <p>These are the <hi>blinde guides,</hi> and <hi>lying Masters,</hi>

<hi>Caluin.</hi> The heresies of <hi>Marcion, Valentinus, Arrius
<pb facs="tcp:18354:255"/>
Nestorius,</hi> and other had coulour of lerning. The
<hi>Montanistes,</hi> the <hi>Tatiani,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians</hi>
had pretence of holynes and vertu. These
two conditions were vehement persuasions to drawe
the worlde vnto them. But the heresies of our ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
be grosse, blasphemous, and dissolut. The denial
of the blessed Sacraments and right vse thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
of ignoraunce in true diuinite: The deniall off
free will, and wicked assertion of fatall destine vnder
the name of Gods forekuowleadge is a horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.
The breach of ecclesiasticall authorite, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of only faith, contempt of all good order, and
constitutions, is a mere licentious liberte and wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
dissolutnesse. How then happenteh it that men are
so abused? that the lerned are drawen, the vnlerned
deceiued? Wil you haue the truthe tolde? <hi>Peccata no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra
diuiserunt inter nos &amp; Deum.</hi> Our sinnes haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
betwene God and vs. The gate of his grace is
shutt from vs. And why? We loue the worlde, we
let slippe our faith: we be nailed to our te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral trash:
we make it our God. We will rather become hethen
then suffer for our conscience. Otherwise if we fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
God, we would mistrust this dissolut religion: if
we were not blinded with selfewill and hardnesse
of hart (the plage of former sinnes) we should espie
the absurdite and fondnesse off this vpstert ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p>Howe were it to be wished that at the entry of
these newe preachers and planters of straunge doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
we had had a <hi>Pacuuius</hi> amonge vs? I will recite
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18354:255"/>
you the story of him. It is writen first of <hi>Liuy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 47.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted
of <hi>Macchiauell</hi> in his discourses. After the greate
bartaill lost by the Romains at <hi>Canne,</hi> al Italy allmost
forsaking their allegeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the cyte of Rome, and
tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling at the power of <hi>Hanniball,</hi> the cyte of <hi>Capua</hi>
misliking the gouuernement of their Senatours and
Counsellers (as it fareth in time of calamite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
that the faulte is layed to the Rulers) concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a great hatred against them, and deliberated to
murher them euery one, and to place other in their
rowmes, which they thought should better direct
their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthe, and more to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation.
This <hi>Pacuuius</hi> being then the chefest Ruler of the
cyte, perceauing well the peoples furious intention,
and the daunger the whole Senat stode in, deuised
with him selfe a witty policie, both to appease the pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ople,
and to saue the Senat. He calleth the Senat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Declareth them the intent of the people: ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them his meaning, and saieth. My aduise is you
suffer your selfe to be shut vp in the palace, in my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody.
I will assemble the people, and showe them
what case you stande in. For the rest if you dare trust
me, I will take such order that no harme shall befall
you. They trusted him. He calleth the people, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth
vnto them. People: the time is now come that
you may order the Senatours, as you desire without
any farder tumult. But yet bicause I know well, you
wil not leaue the cyte withoult a Senat, and counsel,
you must nedes, if you will destroye the old, make a
new. And therefore lo here the names of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours.
<pb facs="tcp:18354:256"/>
As I name you one to deliuer vp in to your
handes, so you must name me an other to succede
him. This being saied, he opened the scrolle, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
an auncient and graue Senatour. The people
hearing his name cried straight, he was a proude and
cruell man, and not worthy to beare rule. Well then,
quod <hi>Pacuuius,</hi> Who shall succede him? Here the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople
was at a staie: and looking one vpon an other
knewe not a longe time whom to name. At the
length one being named, some began to smile, some
to laugh, other to disdaine. All perceiued well (as
Macchiauell wittely noteth) that the fault appearing
in the Senat vniuersally, when it came to particular
examination, was no faute in dede, but a missecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
and wronge iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the people. By this
meanes the people knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues: the Senatours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in authorite. Particular fautes were redressed,
the whole order and estat remained. Sucha <hi>Pacuuius</hi> I
say, was at the entry of these heresies to be wished: and
prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly may also be heard. For although that which
is past, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be reuoked, yet it may be amended. Let
vs then with <hi>Pacuuius</hi> demaunde of such, as lothe
their auncient and receiued belefe, what newe faith
will they embrace? For without some faith, I thinke
none yet that beare the name of Christians, will li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
Will they be right and zelous Lutherans, taking
Luther for the very man of God, and vndoubted
prophet to reuele his holy worde in these our later
dayes? Will they reiect all Fathers, all Councells, all
that Christendom hath hetherto beleued, as you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18354:256"/>
heard before Luther doth? Then beside all that
we haue saied of his doctrine and behauiour, sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
I trust to proue him a right heretike, if an heretike
may be knowen by his frutes, let them satisfie the
ciuill and disordrely or repining Lutherans: let them
accrode with the Sacramentaries, the Anabaptistes,
the Osiandrins, the Swenkcfeldians and all the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Luthers branches: as you may see and vew in
the petigrew of his ofspring drawen out by <hi>Staphylus.</hi>
If they set light by that fonde frier, as the more part
of protestants do, to the great grief and bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of all zelous Lutherans, what secte wil they
be of? Will they ciuilly beleue at pleasure, as Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon
did, and be euerlerning (as S. Paule of heretikes
pronounceth) but neuer attaining to the truthe?
Who laugheth not at so fonde a chaunge, if in so
waighty a cause any Christen hart can laugh, and
not rather lament such willfull blindnesse or blind
willfulnesse, as in these ciuil Lutherans appeareth?
Will they forsake Luther vtterly, and become Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries?
Yet then we may demaunde of what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte
of Sacramentaries they will be: For Caluin and
Bullinger, Geneua and Zurich agre not. But if they
will be Caluinistes as most parte of Sacramentaries
are, who yet will not disdayne there at, knowing
the pride of Caluin setting light by the holy Fathers,
his corrupting of holy Scripture, wicked renewing
of olde condemned heresies, fonde auouching off
most clere contradictions, rashe teaching of moste
absurd doctrine in that article where he we was thought
<pb facs="tcp:18354:257"/>
moste to haue excelled? All which (and much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re)
we haue in this simple discourse discouered vnto
you, gentle Readers, to the entent that you may see
what an euill chaunge you make, to leaue the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
fathers, the Catholike and vniuersall belefe, the
faith you were baptised in, and in the which all our
forefathers these thousand fiue hundred yeares and
vpwarde haue serued allmighty God, and liued as
Christen men, and true membres of Christes church,
to leaue, I saie all this, and to become protestants or
new ghospellers, that is, men of a new faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which you must lerne of some one of these
three, Luther, Melanchthon or Caluin, or of such
as haue lerned it of them. By this consideration I
trust, you shall pereiue that though the vniuersall
name of refourmed ghospellers and chalengers off
gods worde haue pleased you, though the generall
name of papistry haue displeased and misliked you,
yet the particular being now discouered, as well off
the persons, as of the doctrine, you will either incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
returne from whence you departed, or at
lest deliberat thereof, and of these fewe lerne to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fridericus Staphylus,</hi> whose Apologie we haue he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
translated you, being a Lutheran many yeares, and
so farre in credit, with the protestants, that he might
haue ben a doctour of diuinite amonge them, also a
Superintendent at Augspurg, at Brunsuick, Lubeck
and Hamburg, by this very consideration became a
Catholike. For hauing many years ben a Lutheran
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18354:257"/>
and a familiar frend of Melanchthon,<note place="margin">Vide Ioan nem Lyre sium Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uensem in vita Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phili.</note> aduised with
him selfe to write also in defence of the Lutheran
doctrine. He had not yet at that time read the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
fathers: but had heard them much alleaged of
Luther and Melanchthon, and trusting to their
allegations, thought vndoubtedly that the doctrine
of Luther was agreable with the lerned fathers and
the primitiue church. Hereupon he diuised, after the
imitation of the Master of the sentence and other
schole men, to set forthe in one volume the whole
effect and summe of Luthers doctrine. This booke
he intituled. <hi>Corpus doctrinae Lutheranae: the body or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of Luthers doctrine.</hi> For this purpose he began to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eke the doctours, and serche the original of Luthers
and Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chthons allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But here lo in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
serche and examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>he found the doctours
and auncient writers to condemne directly the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of Luther. At this he was maruailousely aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
brake of his enterprise, began with priuat study
to peruse him selfe the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and approued writers
in Christes church, as well the grekes as the latins,
and to conferre with them these new writers of our
time.<note place="margin">See in the leafe 56. In the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afe, 28.</note> About this study he bestowed (as he writeth in
this very Apologie) two and twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty yeares, not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with any other ciuil or worldly matters in al that
time. By this meanes though slowly and slackely
(as in the preface of this Apologie he complaineth
him selfe) he shifted at length him selfe out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptious
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies of this time, and became not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a right good Catholike, priuately and in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science,
<pb facs="tcp:18354:258"/>
but ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly also to al the worlde he declared it, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered

the false grounde of all their pretended doctrine (<hi>that
is, the bare title of gods worde without the right vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

dissensions amonge them selues. Whereby in diuers
partes of Germany especially in the territory of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaria,</hi>
many haue returned from the dissolut heresy
of Luther, to the holesom discipline of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

in this Apologie, writen of him in his mother
tongue. This I haue made now common to my dere
