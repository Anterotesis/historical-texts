            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the holy<note place="margin">2.

The same we likewise find verified in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> predecessor Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of glorious memorie. At her first coming to the Crowne, she brake downe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and molten Images, she tooke downe high altars, and remoued away all monuments of superstition out of the Church: she feared not the malignitie of men, but claue to the Lord, resoluing to keepe his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and to see God worshipped according to the prescript rule of his sacred word. She was all her life long a harbor to the distressed children of God, a refuge to the oppressed, a protector of the persecuted for the testimonie of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> &amp; a nursing mother of Gods Church. Therefore God maruellously <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> her, both against the force of foneine enemies, and also against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of domesticall traitors, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her to prosper in all her affaires. She liued &amp; raigned long and happily, and dying left behind her a sweet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of many blessings by her meanes bestowed vpon her people.</p>
            <p>Contrariwise, such as either know not, or did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence they receiued their kingly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but either neglected the worship of God, or else for Gods worship established superstition and idolatrie in the Church, haue seldome long raigned, or prospered in their kingdomes. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> forgetting what great fauor God had done him; aduancing him from low estate to the kingdome, and renting it from the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to giue it vnto him, receiued a threatning message from the Lord by the hand of the Prophet <hi>Ahijah,</hi> 1. <hi>King.</hi> 14. The same also was shortly after accomplished. For <hi>God brought euill vpon the house of Ieroboam,</hi> and cut off his posteritie, because he did euill in the sight of the Lord, and erected idolatrie at <hi>Bethel.</hi> Likewise Queene <hi>Mary,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25623:3"/>
who brought this land not onely vnder the commaund of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> but also vnder the heauie yoke of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> burdensome both to mens ciuill estates, and also to their consciences, &amp; erected superstition and idolatrie, which before had bene banished, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Saints of God that would not bow their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> had a short, troublesome and vnhappie raigne, and left behind her nothing but hatred for her crueltie, and infamy for her vnnaturall dealing with her subiects, and misgouernement.</p>
            <p>In both we find that accomplished which the Lord speaketh by the Prophet, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>Them</hi> (saith he) <hi>that honor me, I will honor; and they that despise me, shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.</hi> For neither <hi>will the Lord faile his inheritance, nor</hi>

The which although both particularly in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers gouernement of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and also generally by the examples of all, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fauoured or disfauoured true religion, it appeareth most euidently: yet because <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> an Apostate somtime from religion, and now an vtter enemie to the state, and a renegate Englishman for hatred to the truth, and loue to Poperie, in a large discourse doth endeuour to disgrace the proceedings of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of religion especially, and to commend the State of the realme vnder Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and of all Papists vnder the Romish gouernement, I haue thought good particularly to demonstrat. I haue also wiped away both his malicious imputations, &amp; encountred him in his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling inuectiues, defending the honor of our dread so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, whose memorie shall neuer die in the minds
<pb facs="tcp:25623:4"/>
of her louing subiects, and answering for true religion calumniated by the slanderous tongues of the supposts and slaues of <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This discourse, although not of that perfection that it may seeme worthy to be presented to so great a King, yet for that it containeth a defence of your Maiesties predecessor, which you honour, and of that religion which you professe; I am bold to consecrate to your Maiestie, as the first fruites of my loyall affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. Therin also your Maiestie may see, not only a precedent to follow, but also a reward proposed to those, that studiously and couragiously seeke to aduance pietie and true religion.</p>
            <p>The aduersarie by all meanes seeketh to suppresse truth, and to aduance idolatrie and popish errors, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construing things well done, imputing crimes to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, excusing offenders, denying things manifest, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and deuising matters neuer done, nor imagined. But while he hath sought to bring disgrace, not onely vpon true religion, but also vpon the restorers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders thereof, he hath giuen vs iust occasion to shew that the doctrine, religion and practise of Papists, is not only repugnant to truth, but also enemie to Princes and States, grieuous to Christians, and profitable to none, but to the slaues and adherents of Antichrist. Further, I haue made it apparant, that the state of popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is no way to be maintained, but by trecherie and massacres, by lying, railing and forgerie, being hatefull both to God and man, and the cause of many miseries and calamities.</p>
            <p>Vouchsafe therefore, most worthy and noble King, to reade this discourse ensuing. It shal declare vnto your Maiestie plainely, by what meanes you may establish
<pb facs="tcp:25623:4"/>
your estate. Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in her latter dayes was made beleeue, that remisse dealing in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would assure her life, often sought for by Papists; and her State, that they by all meanes haue sought to ouerthrow. But this her remisnesse gaue her enemies oportunitie to practise against her life, and to make a strong partie against Religion and the State, as your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> very well knoweth. For the same is lately bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, to the hazard of your royall person, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering of the State: and God knoweth whether those that haue intended mischiefe against your royall Maiestie, that neuer offended them, did not worke mischiefe against her, whom they tooke to be the obstacle of all their plots and desseines.</p>
            <p>Your Maiestie, I doubt not, will wisely consider of these plotters, and their abettors, and all their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. <hi>A King</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>that sitteth in the throne</hi>

And that they excuse not themselues by Religion, I haue disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the deformities of their Religion, as well as their wicked treasons. All which I present to your Maiesties graue consideration, beseeching him that is King of Kings to endue you with wisedome and all royall and heroicall vertues fit for the managing of so great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that you may both triumph ouer all your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

            <p>HOw often the Spaniard and Pope, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents haue attempted by secret practises to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> I doubt not (my deare countrimen and friends) but you haue heard.

And to forbeare to speake of such secret practises, they haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by open warres also to preuaile against the State. In the yeare 1588. they prouided against <hi>England,</hi> not onely great land-forces, but also a great fleete, in their owne conceit inuincible, yet by Gods grace easily vanquished and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Likewise <hi>anno</hi> 1597 and 1598. they made two attempts, or rather offers, of some enterprise against the State. In the first one <hi>D. Stillington</hi> and other Masse-priests English and Spanish miscaried, the Spanish fleete being wracked on the rockes of their owne country, so that they could not come to sing Masse in <hi>England.</hi> The other was disappointed by stormes and contrary winds, so that no effect came of it.</p>
            <p>The noise of these preparations and menaces comming into <hi>England,</hi> and being bruited abroade, partly by letters, and partly by a proud proclamation set forth in print by the <hi>Adelantado</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherein he plainly discouereth, that

he meant no lesse then to cut all our throates if he could: it is no maruell if the State, and diuers men well affected to their countrey, did prepare themselues to make resistance. Among the rest Sir <hi>Francis Hastings,</hi> a man of auncient nobilitie, and one that hath adorned the honour of his parentage with excellent vertues, and namely with true pietie, loue of his countrey, fortitude and magnanimitie, scorning to heare, that so base a rabble of <hi>Marranes</hi> and <hi>Bisognos</hi> as were assembled first at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and then at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> should either talke or thinke of the conquest of <hi>England,</hi> which the <hi>Adelantado</hi> in his bragging <hi>Rodomonts</hi> stile did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he armeth himselfe, and prepareth his friends and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen to make resistance. Perceiuing also the securitie of some, and slacknesse of others, especially such as were tainted with the pestilent infection of Italian atheisme, or Spanish Marranisme, but commonly titled Cacolike or popish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; he publisheth a little treatise, called <hi>A watch-word,</hi> giuing warning to the secure, and stirring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>This booke crossing the desseines of <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> and his consorts, who by all meanes sought to set <hi>England</hi> in combustion, that they might triumph in the ashes, and sing Masse in the funerals of their natiue countrey; we may perceiue by the sequele, that it touched his cause and faction very nearely, and therefore was taken by him very tenderly. For presently he taketh pen in hand, and writeth a most scornefull and bitter treatise against her Maiesties procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, against Religion and all that professe it, railing against Sir <hi>Francis</hi> and the professors of the truth, and commending in the best sort he could, both the professed enemies, and the secret vnderminers of the State. Wherein, if we would but note the mans singular impudencie, or rather his audacious

foolerie, it were argument sufficient to confound all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. For at what time the <hi>Spaniard</hi> lay with forces at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> and by a Proclamation set forth in print, threatned sire and sword against the Realme; <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> like a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous traitor, in his <hi>Ward-word</hi> talketh of nothing but peace, and would make vs beleeue, that both the Pope and Spaniards are our good friends. Where Iesuites, and Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests, and malcontent Papists were brewing of sedition, and preparing themselues to ioyne with forreine forces: this good fellow would make vs beleeue, that traitors are good friends, and that there was no hurt by them meant to the Queene or State. Finally, this babling <hi>Warder</hi> doth addresse all his discourse to the Lords of the Councell, and chiefe dealers in matters of State; albeit the same tended wholly to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the State.</p>
            <p>And yet when I consider the practises of the enemies of the State, I must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse that he had great reason to enter into this shamelesse course. For albeit there was no colour of truth in his discourse, yet he supposed, if the same were shewed to her Maiestie, that it would make her stay her preparatiues. He thought also, it would proue a faire pretence to those that were loth to spend their money, to forbeare to make resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemy. Further, he saw that the same would bleare mens eyes, while both forreine enemies and secret traitors sought to cut our throates. And finally, the same being full of railing, scorning and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, he doubted not but the same would deterre others, or at least make them slow to take vpon them the defence of the common cause. For what man considering the smal encouragement that forward men did find at the hands of friends, and the rude entertainment they receiue at the hands of enemies, would not leaue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25623:7"/>All this notwithstanding, sir <hi>Francis</hi> considering the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that Christians haue to maintaine sincere religion, &amp; that bindeth true harted subiects to defend their country, hath published an Apologie, both in defence of the common cause, and of his owne reputation, against the scurrilous and railing libell, which <hi>Parsons</hi> calleth <hi>A warde-word:</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, no doubt, reward at the hands of God, rather then ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and respecting rather his own dutie, then the praise of others. But before either the booke came forth, or that I knew the Knights resolution, the impudencie of the man so boldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling traitors and forreine enemies, together with his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arrogancy despising his own nation, and his foolish speakes for the Popes cause stollen out of others, and put forth as his wont is, in his owne name, had extorted from me a reply to his <hi>Wardword.</hi> Which certes might haue bin wel spared, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the sufficiencie of the Knights apologie, if I had seene it before I had ended my reply. For what is there in the <hi>Wardword</hi> worthy of answer, seeing the same consisteth wholy of lies, and patches, and old ends stollen from others, &amp; often refuted before? And what answer can be deuised so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that counteruaileth not such a hochpotch of words?</p>
            <p>To these replies published by vs, after long silence we see that <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> hath purposed to set forth a reioynder. For we haue already receiued two parts of nine, but so fraught with calumniations and lies, malicious and scornful termes, odious and filthy reproches, that it seemeth he hath spent all his store of poison, and despaireth to perfect the rest.</p>
            <p>This booke, albeit most contemptible, containing nothing but disgracefull matter against her Maiesties proceedings, that is lately deceased, and childish disputes for some few points of poperie, yet haue I thought good to handle; not for any worth, that can be in any such packe of pedlary stuffe, set to sale by this petit merchant, but for that iust occasion is

               <p>I Need not, I trust, make any large discourse, in calling to remembrance the noble and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall acts of our late Queene, and most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne Ladie <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous and godly memory. For as <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 44.</note> said of famous men of auncient time, so we may say of her, <hi>that her name will liue from generation to generation.</hi> Her kind loue to her subiects, and gracious fauours done both to English and other nations, will neuer be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

She ruled her people by counsel, &amp; by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of learning fit for them. She was rich and mightie in power, and liued peaceably at home.</hi> Her remembrance therefore <hi>is as the composition of sweete perfume, that is made by the art of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary, and is sweete as hony in all mouthes,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Iosias.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 49.</note> In his steps she insisted, and <hi>behaued her self vprightly in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, &amp; took away al abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of iniquity.</hi> She reformed the abuses and corruptions of popish religion, which through the working of the mystery of iniquitie, had now won credit in the world, and ouerthrew the idoll of the Masse, and banished all idolatrie out of the Church. <hi>She directed her heart to the Lord, and in the time of the vngodly she established Religion.</hi>

               <p>But because as in the time of <hi>Iosias</hi> the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> so in our times their of-spring the Masse-priests cannot brooke her reformation, but looke backe to the abominations of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> I haue thought it conuenient not only to declare at large what benefites the people of <hi>England</hi> now fiue and fortie yeares almost enioyed by her gracious and happie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but also to iustifie the same against the slaunderous calumniations and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Wherein, that I may proceed with more perspicuitie, I think it fit to reason first of matters Ecclesiasticall, and afterward of ciuill and worldly affaires. In Ecclesiasticall affaires, which by her meanes grew to a better settlement, we are to consider first what grace it is to haue a certaintie in religion; and next, what fauour God shewed to vs, reducing vs to the vnitie of the true Catholicke Church. Thirdly, we will reason of true faith: fourthly, of the sincere administration of the Sacraments: fiftly, of the true worship of God: sixthly, of the Scriptures and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prayers in our mother tongue: seuenthly, of freedome we enioyed by her from persecution, from the Popes exactions, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wicked lawes and vniust censures, from al heretical and false doctrine: eightly, of deliuerance from schisme, superstition and idolatrie: and finally of good workes, and the happinesse of those, that not onely are able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That is taught by the conuenticle of</hi> Trent, <hi>sess.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>where it saith, Neque seipsum aliquis etiamsi nihil sibi conscius sit iudicare debet: that is,</hi> neither ought any to iudge himselfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be not conscious to himselfe of any thing. <hi>And in the same session chap.</hi> 9. <hi>it determineth,</hi> that no man by the certaincie of faith ought to assure himself that he shal be saued. <hi>The second point doth follow of the diuers doctrines of<note place="margin">Enchirid. c. de Ecclesia.</note> the Papists.</hi> Eckius <hi>holdeth,</hi> that the Scriptures are not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical without the authority of the Church. <hi>And although</hi> Bellarmine <hi>dare not allow this forme of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Finally, in the canon law, <hi>c. in canonicis. dist.</hi> 19. they place the decretals of Popes in equall ranke with canonicall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Of these positions it followeth, that as long as men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the Komish Church, they neither beleeue truth, nor haue any certaine faith or religion. And that is proued by these arguments.</p>
               <p>First, he that beleeueth not Gods promises concerning his own saluation, is an infidel, and hath no true faith. But this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the case of all Papists. For not one of them beléeueth that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all be saued, nor imagineth that God hath said or promised any thing concerning his owne saluation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Scriptures depend vpon the Church, and the Church is a societie of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then the Papists beléeue Scriptures with humane faith, and depend vpon men. But that they do plainely teach.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Church ought to consigne canonicall Scriptures, and the Pope ought to rule the Church; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> if the Pope either determine against canonical Scriptures, or make fabulous scriptures equall with canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Papists are to beléeue either doctrine contrarie, or diuers from Scriptures: at the least they are vncertaine what they shall beléeue. But the Pope may both erre in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Scriptures, and adding to Scriptures. To answer this the Papists are driuen to affirm, that the Pope cannot erre in these determinations. But this sheweth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of their faith, that dependeth vpon one little rotten goutie Pope, whose learning is not worth two chips, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25623:11"/>
whose pietie is lesse then his learning.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the Popes consignation be necessary to make Papists beleeue Scriptures, then is their faith most vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and rather humane then diuine. Especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that of this Popes consignation of Scriptures, there is not one word in Scriptures. But that is their doctrine.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the doctrine and practise of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being the rule of faith, the Romish faith must néeds proue vncertaine and variable. The consequence of this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is proued, for that both schoole-men differ from schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and late writers from the auncient, and also Popes from Popes, as I haue shewed in my bookes <hi>De pontif. Rom.</hi> That the rule of faith is as I haue said, it may be auerred by <hi>Stapletons</hi> words.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if faith be grounded vpon traditions, as well as vpon Scriptures, then haue the Papists no certaine faith. The consequence is plaine, for that diuers ancient traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are new ceased: and neither <hi>Caesar Baronius,</hi> nor any man is able to set downe, which are authentical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which not.</p>
               <p>Finally, if the faith of Papists rest vpon the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, or else vpon the supposed Catholicke Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches decrees; then is their faith a goutie, fraile, and rotten faith, or rather a most doubtfull opinion. For neither are they certaine who is lawfull Pope, nor that his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are vnfallible, nor is it an easie matter to know which are the Catholicke Churches determinations, the Papists themselues contending and varying continually about them.</p>
               <p>These arguments do shew, that the Papists haue either a vaine faith, or else no faith at all. And this <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> notwithstanding his obstinacie and peruersenesse must needs confesse. For simple Papists haue only these meanes whereby to direct themselues: viz. Scriptures, Fathers, or their owne Priests. Scriptures they neither heare read in a tongue knowne, nor do they much regard them. The Fathers they vnderstand not. The priests do often tel lies:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:25623:11"/>
and too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they dwell from the Pope to know of him ths truth. To omit to talke of ruder persons, and to talke of spruce <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> gladly would I know of him, how he is assured that the religion he teacheth is true. Scriptures he denieth to be the rule of faith, and will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them to be authenticall, without the Popes determination. The Pope is but one man. If then he rely wholy on the Popes determination, his faith is nothing but a foolish fancie grounded vpon one man. If vpon the Church, yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Church, but by his owne reason and sence (as I thinke) he will confesse. Rule of faith he acknowledgeth<note place="margin">Ward-word pag. 6.</note> none, <hi>but the vniuersall Church:</hi> which is not onely absurd, but maketh much against him. Absurd it is, for that the Church is ruled, and is not the rule, no more then the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter is his rule. It maketh against him, for that it is more difficult to know the Catholicke Church of all times and places, then Scriptures, or any proofe of faith else. For to know that, it is necessary to be well seene in the historie of all times, Churches and countries. And if he refer himselfe to others, and beléeue humane histories, his faith is still grounded on men.</p>
               <p>This being the case of Papists, and of their agent <hi>Robert Parsons;</hi> we may estéeme our selues happie, that are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this great vncertaintie, and taught to build our faith vpon <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and the doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay beside that<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> which is laid, that is Christ Iesus,</hi> saith the Apostle. And <hi>Eph. 2. Ye are built</hi> (saith he) <hi>vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone.</hi> We know, <hi>that faith commeth by hearing, and hearing<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> by the word of God.</hi> We beléeue that the Scriptures are a perfect rule, and therefore rightly called canonicall.

               <p>The Fathers also procéeded by the rule of Scriptures, both where they sought direction for themselues, and also
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25623:12"/>
where they brought arguments against Heretikes. <hi>Ireney lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Agréeably therefore to Scriptures and Fathers the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne acknowledged the canon of Scriptures, and thence tooke the articles of our Christian faith. And therefore I call Scriptures, and that which is necessarily deduced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And this I did to auoide the cauils of the aduersary, which inferre, because this word <hi>Trinitie,</hi> or <hi>consubstantiall,</hi> or <hi>baptisme of children</hi> is not found in Scriptures, that scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are not a solide and entire rule of faith.</p>
               <p>Against this <hi>Parsons</hi> in his <hi>Warn-word 1.

and tradition. But that was because they denyed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Scriptures. For no man can deny, but that their heresies are clearely conuinced by Scriptures. <hi>Quod sumus hoc sunt. That we are that they are,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking of Scriptures.

But if <hi>Parsons</hi> will prooue his rule of faith, he must shew a faith grounded vpon tradition, that is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of Scriptures. Nay, if he will not be contrarie to himselfe, he must shew, that not the Apostles tradition, as he saith in his <hi>Warn-word 1. Encoun. cap.</hi> 15. but <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church is the rule of faith,</hi> as he holdeth <hi>Ward-word, Encontr. pag.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>He doth also obiect against vs diuers alterations of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<note place="margin">Warn-word Encontr. c. 16.</note> in <hi>England</hi> in king <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his raigne, and in king <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes: and then asketh by what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie our rule of faith was established.

Our rule of faith therefore is certaine, albeit not alwaies in one sort approued, or receiued by men. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of Popish faith neither in it self, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Parliaments or Churches is certaine, or immoueable.</p>
               <p>Finally, he asketh a question of <hi>Sir Francis</hi> in his <hi>Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word, p.</hi> 5. how he knoweth his religion to be true. And saith, <hi>he hath only two meanes to guide himselfe in this case,</hi> and that is either <hi>Scriptures, or the preaching of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> But this question, as I haue shewed, toucheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

                  </gap> these two meanes onely, but by diuers others. For beside Scriptures he hath the help of the Sacraments of the Church, of Gods spirit working within him, of miracles recorded in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of auncient Fathers, of the practise of the Church, of the consent of nations, of the confession of the aduersaries, of the suffering of Martyrs, and testimonies of learned men, and such like arguments. In this question therefore <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> shewed himselfe to be a silly Frier, and to haue had more malice then might.</p>
               <p>In time past also we were, as shéepe going astray, and out of the vnion of the Catholike and Apostolike Church. Diuers of our auncestors worshipped the crosse and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Trinitie with diuine worship. Some like bruite beasts fell downe before Idols, crept to the crosse, and kissed wood and stone. Others worshipped Angels, the blessed Uirgin and Saints, praying vnto them in all their necessities, trusting in them, saying Masses in their honour, and offering incense and prayers to their pictures and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

               <p>In the sacrament of the Lords supper, which is a pledge of loue, there are infinite contradictions among them, as I haue shewed in my bookes <hi>de Missa,</hi> against <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> The like contentions I haue shewed in my Treatises <hi>de Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentijs, &amp; de Purgatorio;</hi> and shall haue occasion more at large to speake of them hereafter.</p>
               <p>We are therefore to thanke God, that the doctrine of faith in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is setled, and that refusing all nouelties we agrée therein with the auncient catholike Church.

We haue one vniforme order for publike prayers, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Sacraments, and Gods seruice.

               <p>From the <hi>Manicheys</hi> they borrow their communions vnder one kind, as may be proued by the Chapt. <hi>relatum,</hi> and <hi>comperimus. dist.</hi> 2. <hi>de consecrat.</hi> and by <hi>Leo</hi> his fourth Sermon <hi>de quadrages.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Helcesaites</hi> make <hi>Christ</hi> in heauen to differ from <hi>Christ</hi> on earth, as saith <hi>Theodoret haeret. fabul. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. de Helcesaeis,</hi> his words are these. <hi>Christum non vnum dicunt, sed hunc quidem infernè, illum verò supernè.</hi> So likewise the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists teach, that Christs bodie in heauen is visible and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, but not as it is in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>With the <hi>Pelagians</hi> they concurre in many points, as I haue at large declared in my late challenge. <hi>Hoc Pelagiani audent dicere</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de bono perseuerantiae c.</hi> 5.) <hi>hominem iustum in hac vita nullum habere peccatum.</hi> Now how can they cleare themselues from this, that hold, that a man is able to performe the law of God perfectly?</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth, that we are iustified before God by the workes of the law. The Papists haue taught quite contrarie. He teacheth vs not to glorie in our works. They say quite contrarie, that men may glorie in their workes. He sheweth that as many as receiue the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords bodie, are also to receiue the sacrament of his bloud. They denie the cuppe to all the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants beside the priest. Our Sauiour instituting the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his last supper, said, <hi>Accipite, manducate:</hi> that is, <hi>take and eate.</hi> These imagine that he offered his bodie and bloud really and corporally at his last supper, and that he appointed his bodie and bloud actually to be offered in the Masse, and not alwaies to be sacramentally and spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued of the communicants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:25623:17"/>The Papists teach, that wicked men, reprobates, and diuels may haue true faith. But the Apostle teacheth that true faith iustifieth, &amp; that they which haue it, <hi>liue by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Commonly they hold, that charitie is the forme of faith. Which if it were true, then could not faith subsist without charitie. But the Apostle teacheth vs, that faith, as faith, doth make the iust to liue, and auncient Christians were alwayes ignorant of these philosophicall fancies.</p>
               <p>They hold that diuers sinnes are committed, which are not forbidden by Gods law. But this sheweth, that the law of God as they suppose, is not perfect, and that the lawes of man hauing nothing in them of Gods law, bind the conscience as well as the law of God.</p>
               <p>Finally, the very foundations of popish religion are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious, the same being founded partly vpon the decretals of Popes, partly vpon the traditions of men, contained partly in their Missals, breuiaries, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> other rituall books, partly in their fabulous legends, and partly in the chest of the Popes brest: and partly vpon the old Latin translation of the Bible, which the <hi>Romanists</hi> hold to be authenticall: and partly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the interpretations of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>But since it pleased God to put into her Maiesties royall heart a resolution to reforme the church, that was so much deformed by the pharisaicall and superstitious additions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists, &amp; to restore religion according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles &amp; Prophets, not only all former heresies &amp; errors were abolished, but also the true doctrine of faith was resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The which is apparent not onely by the articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which we professe, but also by our publike confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and apologies, which we haue published at diuers times. And in part it may be proued by the secret confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our aduersaries. For albeit they would gladly cauill against our confessions; yet they take their grounds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly out of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Caluin, Melancthon</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not often medling with our confessions.

part confessed by the aduersaries themselues, and that we bring in no new faith, but that which alwayes hath bene holden and maintained in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> desiring onely that the positiue errors, heresies and superstitions of Papists may be abolished.

               <p>They haue also altered, corrupted, and mangled Christ his institution, concerning the Sacraments of Baptisme and the Lords supper. In baptime they salt and coniure the water in which the party baptized is to be dipped. They put salt into his mouth, and touch his eares and nosthrils with spittle, which is oft times very noisom.

But they by a solemne decrée of priests at <hi>Constance,</hi> take away the cup from all saue the priests that say Masse. Fiftly, Christ ordained that the sacrament of his body and bloud should be distributed and receiued in that action: these fellowes kéepe the sacrament in a boxe, and cary it about in solemne processions. Sixthly, they worship the sacrament, and call it <hi>their Lord and God,</hi> contrary to all rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. Seuenthly, Christ appointed a holy sacrament, and gaue not his body and bloud to be offered continually in the Masse, as a sacrifice auaileable for quicke and dead, as these good fellowes do beléeue. Finally, the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that as oft as we celebrate this holy action, <hi>we shew forth the Lords death vntill his comming againe.</hi> But the Papists forbid this action to be celebrated in a vulgar tong, which is commonly vnderstood of the people, as much as in them lyeth hindring them from shewing forth the Lords death: they hold also that he is already come, and present in the sacrament.</p>

                  <hi>Becket, there is no more blasphemy contained then when the holy prophets did mention the name, faith and merits of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Isac</hi> and <hi>Iacob, and other their holy fathers.</hi> But what if the holy Prophets do not mention the merites of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> but rather desire God to remember his promise made vnto them? Doth it not appeare that in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of holy Prophets, he lyeth most shamefully, and like a false prophet and teacher?

               <p>Finally he answereth, <hi>That where Thomas Becket is<note place="margin">Ibid. num. 10</note> prayed vnto, to lend his hand for our helpe, it is meant he shal do it, by his prayer and intercession.</hi> But this answer is as foolish, as the prayer is blasphemous.

This

                  <hi>Finally,</hi> they erred in the obiect of their worship, adoring creatures in stead of the Creator, or at the least aduancing creatures vnto honor not due vnto them.

But there is no personall vnion betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and the sacrament. That they call the Sacrament <hi>their Lord and their Maker;</hi> it is apparent by the common spéech vsed by the Papistes.

               <p>Secondly, the law forbiddeth vs to make any similitude, or image of things in heauen, earth, or vnder the earth, to bow downe to it, or to worship it. But they make the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God the Father, and the holy Ghost, and the crucifix, bow downe to them, and worship them: and that according to the doctrine of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> with the same worship that is due vnto God. They do also make the images of Angels and Saints, burne incense vnto them, pray before

               <p>Thirdly, they confesse their sins to Angels and Saints, saying: <hi>Confiteor Deo Omnipotenti, beatae Mariae semper virgini &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>I confesse to God Almightie, to the blessed and alwayes a virgin Mary,</hi> to <hi>S.

But if they did not beléeue that Angels and Saints can forgiue sinnes, they would not so pray vnto them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they make their vowes to saints, as appeareth by the common formes of vowes of such as enter into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de cult. sanctor. c.</hi> 9. confesseth, that vowes may be well made to saints.

               </p>
               <p>Finally, they pray to the crosse, saying: <hi>

In the end, I confesse, he was forced for shame to abolish it; yet he conceiued infinite displeasure against the Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> and fauored the Fryers as much as he could. And now, albeit he hath not simply prohibited the translation of scriptures, and reading them in vulgar tongues; yet he hath so limited the same, as in effect they are as good as prohibited. For first he will not permit, that scriptures translated into vulgar tongues shall be read publikely in the Church: as both the <hi>Trent</hi> conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and the practise of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church declareth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth doth simply forbid all transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note place="margin">Regulae Ind. b. prohib.</note> of scriptures into vulgar tongues, such onely except, as are made by his adherents and followers; which are not onely false and absurd in diuers points, but also corrupted, with diuers false and wicked annotations, as the <hi>Rhemish</hi> annotations vpon the new testament being examined do manifestly declare. Thirdly, we do not find that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists are hastie in setting forth translations of scriptures in vulgar tongues; nor can I learne that the Bible is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Fourthly, they will haue no Booke-sellers sel Bibles though translated into vulgar tongues by them selues without leaue.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25623:23"/>
dregges of Popish errors; and to lay men seldome, or neuer do they grant the same. I do not beleeue that <hi>Robert Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> albeit well acquainted in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> can name a doosen lay men of either nation, that haue licence to reade Scriptures in vulgar tongues; or that had licence in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time to reade Scriptures transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their mother tongue. If he know any suth, he may do well to name them. If he name them not, his silence wil bréed suspition, if it be not taken for a plaine confession. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> if any among the Papists be taken with other trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, then such as themselues allow, or not hauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe obtained licence according to the foresaid rule; he is presently taken for suspect of heresie, and seuerely punished if he acquite not himselfe the better So we sée, that among them it is lawfull to reade all prophane bookes, if they fall not within the compasse of their prohibition, and to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ouer the lying legends of Saints, and the fabulous booke of <hi>Conformities of Saint Francis with Christ,</hi> and that without leaue. But Scriptures translated into vulgar tongues no man may reade without leaue.</p>
               <p>Now how centrarie this course is to the word of God, to the practise of Gods Church, and to all reason, we may easily perceiue by these particulars. God would haue the words of the law not onely a continuall subiect of our talke<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> and meditations, but also to be written at the entrances and doores of our houses. Our Sauiour Christ preaching to the Jewes willed them <hi>to search the Scriptures.</hi> But how can this be done, if Scriptures be not translated into tongs which we vnderstand, and if no man may reade them without leaue?</p>
               <p>In the primitiue Church they were publikely read in the <hi>Syrian, Egyptian, Punicke</hi> &amp; other vulgar tongues. By the testimonie of <hi>Bede hist.

For how can they vse Scriptures, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them not? And how can they vnderstand them, when they are read in toungs vnknowne? And how can they come to reade them, when there are so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in obtaining licence to haue them?</p>
               <p>Séeing then at her Maiesties first entrance into her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, we were fréed from the thraldome and flauery of Antichrist, and had the Scriptures in a tongue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

restored vnto vs, and read publikely, and priuatel<hi rend="sup">y</hi> without limitation or danger; we are to accompt the same, as a singular benefit bestowed vpon the people of <hi>England.</hi> For what can be deemed more beneficiall, then for the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie to obtaine food, for naked souldiers to obtaine armes and prouisions, for poore people in want, to be enriched with such a treasure?</p>
               <p>But saith <hi>N. D. Wardw. pag. 14. If the translator do not put downe the words of Scriptures sincerely, in his vulgar translation, then the simple reader, that cannot discerne, will take mans word for Gods word.</hi> Secondly, he saith, <hi>that if a false sence should be gathered out of Scripture, then the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should sucke poison in stead of wholesome meate.</hi> But these reasons make no more against reading Scriptures in vulgar tongues, and translating them into those tongues, then against reading Scriptures in the Latin, and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into Latine. For as well may the Latine Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter erre, as he that translateth scriptures into vulgar tongues: and aswell may a man draw a peruerse sence out of the Latine, as out of the English. If then these reasons conclude not against y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Latin translation, they are too weak to conclude against vulgar translations. Againe, if it be hurtfull to follow a corrupt translation, and to gather a contrarie sence out of scriptures; we are not therefore to cast away scriptures, but rather to séeke for the most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere translations, and the most true sence and meaning of the holy Ghost reuealed in holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he alleageth these words out of the Apostle, 2. <hi>Cor. 3. The letter killeth, but the spirit quickneth:</hi> against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of scriptures in vulgar tongues. But these words do no lesse touch them that follow the letter in the Hebrew &amp; Gréek, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the vulgar tongs. And yet <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> wil not deny, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is lawfull to reade scriptures in Hebrew and Gréeke: albeit he, if it were vnlawfull, would neuer be guiltie of this fault, being most ignorant of these tongs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he asketh, <hi>how vnlearned readers will discerne things without a guide.</hi> As if lay-men, because they haue tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25623:25"/>
might not also reade the books from whence the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christian doctrine are deriued. This therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be all one, as if Geometricians, and other teachers of arts should debarre their schollers from reading <hi>Euclide</hi> and other authors that haue written of arts. Furthermore albeit somethings without teachers cannot of rude lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be vnderstood; yet all things that pertaine to faith and manners, are plainely set downe in scriptures. <hi>In ijs quae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertè in scripturis posita sunt, inueniuntur illa omnia,</hi> saith <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> he alleageth, <hi>that the vnderstanding of Scriptures is a particular gift of God.</hi> But that notwithstanding, no man is forbidden to reade scriptures in <hi>Hebrew, Greeke,</hi> or <hi>Latine:</hi> And yet if <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> vnderstand them at all, he vnderstandeth them better in the vulgar English, then in these tongues. Furthermore, albeit to vnderstand Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be a peculiar gift of God, yet no man is therefore to refraine from reading of scriptures, but rather to reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diligently, and to conferre with the learned, and to beséech God to giue him grace to vnderstand them. The which is proued by the example of the Eunuch, Act. 8. who read the scriptures, and threw them not away, albeit he could not vnderstand all without the help of a teacher.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, he vseth the examples of <hi>Ioane Burcher</hi> a pudding<note place="margin">Wardw. p. 6.</note> wife, as some suppose, and qualified like his mother the Blacke-smiths wife, and of <hi>Hacket, William Geffrey,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretickes. In his <hi>Warne-word, Encontr.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>George Paris, Iohn More,</hi> certaine <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretikes, and insinuateth <hi>that all these fell into heresies by reading of scriptures in vulgar languages.</hi> But his collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is false and shamelesse, and derogatorie to scriptures, and contrary both to them and to fathers. Our Sauior speaking of the <hi>Sadduceis, Mat.</hi> 22. saith, <hi>they erred, for that they knew not the scriptures. Erratis nescientes scripturas.</hi> The Apostle talking of reading of scriptures, saith, <hi>they are profitable to instruct men vnto saluation,</hi> and not hurtfull, or the cause of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:25623:25"/>

This therefore is a most ridiculous conceit, and likely to procéed from such an idle head. Further, the same might be alleaged against Latine translations. And yet <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> will not deny but the Church receiueth benefite by Latine translations, albeit the Gréekes, and such as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Hebrew, and not Latin, receiue no benefite by the Latine translation.</p>
               <p>If then <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> meane hereafter to barke against the reading of scriptures, that are commended vnto vs as light, medicine, food, armes, and things most necessary; he must alleage vs better reasons then these, lest he be taken for an hereticall, or rather lunaticall fellow, that spendeth his wit in the defence of fond, senselesse, and impious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>

                     </gap> necessitie of publike seruice in vulgar tongues.</hi> But if he had meant to defend the Popes cause and his owne, and to propound the state of the controuersie betwixt vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, he should haue said, that there is no profit, or vse at all of vulgar tongues in the publike seruice in the Church, and that it is rather inconuenient and hurtfull, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For if it be profitable, and no way inconuenient, why should not the publike Liturgie of the Church be in vulgar tongues?</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding let vs sée, how he proueth that, which<note place="margin">Warn-word.</note> himselfe propoundeth, albeit not the point in question.<note place="margin">Encontr. 1. cap. 8.</note> First he saith, <hi>that publike seruice is appointed to be said or sung to the praise of God, and in the name of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by publike Priests, and other ecclesiasticall officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto.</hi> But if publike seruice be appointed to be said, or song to the praise of God; then vnlesse he exclude the people from the praises of God, the people also is to concurre with the Priests in praysing of God, which they cannot do, vnlesse they vnderstand the language of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. But, I trow, he will not denie, but that the people ought to ioyne in singing Psalmes, and giuing thankes to God in the open congregation. And therefore the Psalme 95. <hi>Come let vs sing vnto the Lord,</hi> is commonly vsed in the beginning of Gods seruice, and the people in auncient Liturgies were wont oftentimes to answer the Priest. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is false, that publike seruice was appointed to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25623:28"/>
said, and sung onely by ecclesiassicall officers, and that the people did not as well pray for things necessaris, as praise God for benefites receiued. But how could they do this, not knowing what they sayd or prayed? If a man should present himselfe besore the Pope and speake ghibrish, or a language not vnderstood by the partie, would he not thinke himselfe mocked?</p>
               <p>He addeth further, <hi>that it is not needfull for the people to be alwaies present at publike seruice, but onely in spirit and consent of heart.</hi> But the fellow doth plainely contradict himselfe. For how can a man be present in spirit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of heart, when he is absent with his vnderstanding, and knoweth not what is done or said? Beside that, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth that, which he would proue. For if consent of spirit and heart be requisite in publike seruice, then is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite the people should vnderstand what is said, without which vnderstanding, he cannot consent. Lastly, if it be profitable, that the people be present in the congregation, where God is serued; that is sufficient for vs to proue our assertion. For why should not the people meete to celebrate the praises of God, being commaunded to kéepe his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths? And why should they rather be enioyned to heare Masse, which is a profanation of Gods seruice, then to come to the Church, to praise God, and to pray vnto him, and to heare his holy word? And if the people ought to do this, then is it not sufficient, that in time of seruice they should gape on the Priest, or patter their <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> or <hi>Aue Mariaes,</hi> or rattle their beades, as the ignorant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes vse to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he supposeth he can proue seruice in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue out of the ceremoniall law of <hi>Moyses.</hi> For because it is said <hi>Luk. 1. That all the multitude of the people was praying without at the houre of incense</hi> while <hi>Zacharie</hi> offered incense within: he would inferre very willingly, that it is not necessarie, the people should pray with the Priest in a tongue vnderstood. But if this might be applyed to the Masse, then would it also follow, that the Priest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25623:28"/>
might offer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Masse without a Clerke, and the people attend without in the church yard. It would also follow, that the people might not heare, nor sée Masse. For that the people might not enter within, nor sée what was done in the sanctuarie. Against vs this example fitteth not. For neither can any strong argument be drawne from the ceremonies of the law, that are now abrogated, nor can <hi>Frier Robert</hi> shew, that the Priests of the law prayed in a tongue not vnderstood, or that they vsed any publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which the people heard not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he alleageth, <hi>that the three learned languages of Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, were sanctified by Christ in the title of his crosse.</hi> But neither is he able to shew, why these three languages should be called learned, rather then others; nor doth it follow, that in publike seruice we should vse only these three languages, because they were vsed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of the crosse, vnlesse our aduersarie will graunt, that it also followeth, because <hi>Christ</hi> rode vpon an asse, that he and his consorts are onely to ride vpon asses.</p>

Basil, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, and Gregorie.</hi> But herein he sheweth himselfe a shamelesse fellow, albeit all men knew it before. For none of these speaketh one word against vulgar languages. Nay all of them shew, that the people vnderstood the language of publike Liturgies. Againe, they deny not that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that the people should vnderstand the mysteries of Christian religion, but rather shew the difficultie of it.

               <p>A sixth argument he draweth from the practise of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> supposing that in <hi>Iurie</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the publike ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice was in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was not vnderstood of the common people. But neither was publike seruice in

all <hi>Syria</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as appeareth by the songs and prayers of <hi>Ephrem</hi> in the <hi>Syrian</hi> tongue, nor is it likely, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not vnderstand <hi>Hebrew</hi> in Christs time, séeing now all the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it is said, teach their children <hi>Hebrew.</hi> In <hi>Esdras lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8. it appeareth they vnderstood <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew. Intellexerunt verba quae docuerat eos.</hi> They vnderstood the words which he taught them. That therefore which is spoken of interpretation, is meant of the meaning and not of the words, as very simply our aduersaries suppose.</p>
               <p>His seuenth argument is taken from the example of the Apostles, <hi>that</hi> (as he saith) <hi>appointed the order of seruice.</hi> But this ouerthroweth our aduersaries cause. For if the Apostles neuer appointed the Masse, or the canon, or that seruice should be said in a tongue not vnderstood, but rather ordained another forme of celebration of Sacraments, as I haue shewed in my bookes <hi>de Missa</hi> against <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and if it be a matter cleare, that all should be done decently in the Church and to edification; then is it not likely, that they would allow, or did appoint the seruice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be said in a tongue not vnderstood of the people, and very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstood of most Priests. Here also he denyeth, <hi>That it can be shewed out of any author of antiquitie whatsoeuer, that any christian Catholike countrie since the Apostles time had publike seruice in any language, but in one of these three,</hi> (viz. Hebrew, Gréeke or Latine) <hi>except by some speciall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation from the Pope, and vpon some speciall confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for some limited time.</hi> But first it maketh nothing for him, or against vs, if any nation had their seruice in <hi>Greek, Latine, or Hebrew,</hi> if the same vnderstood the language of the publike Liturgie. For we onely say, that seruice ought not to be said in a language not vnderstood. Secondly, where he denyeth the vse of all other tongues beside these thrée, he sheweth himselfe either very ignorant, or very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent. If he haue not read auncient Fathers and histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, concerning the languages of publike Liturgies, he is but an ignorant nouice in this cause. If he know the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Church, and denie it, he wanteth shame.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:25623:29"/>That other tongues haue bene vsed in publike Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies beside the thrée mentioned, it may be proued by diuers testimonies. <hi>Hierome</hi> in the funerall Sermon of <hi>Paula,</hi> saith that Psalmes were sung not onely in Hebrew, Gréeke and Latine, <hi>but also in the Syrian language.</hi> In his Epistle to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodorus</hi> he saith, <hi>that the languages and writings of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do sound foorth Christ his passion and resurrection.

But vnlesse he can shew that these tongues were not vnderstood of those people that had their publike seruice in them; all this maketh for vs, and not for him. For we do not deny the vse of these tongues to those that vnderstand them, but onely thinke it madnesse to vse them, where they are not vnderstood. In <hi>Asia</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was common to most nations. Therfore the seruice was in <hi>Greeke</hi> and not in <hi>Latine,</hi> albeit <hi>Parsons</hi> suppose <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> to be a sanctified tongue. In <hi>Africke</hi> and diuerse We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne countries, <hi>Latine</hi> was a common language in time past: and therefore they had their liturgies in <hi>Latine</hi> and not in <hi>Greeke.</hi> It appeareth by <hi>S. Augustine retract. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 20 that diuers vnderstood <hi>Latine</hi> better then the <hi>Punike</hi> tong: and <hi>Cicero pro Archia</hi> sayth, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was a common language in his time. Although therefore the publicke seruice of the Church was in <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> when those tongues were best vnderstood, yet it followeth not that the same should be still vsed, when no man of the vulgar sort vnderstandeth them: or that the Catholicke Church did generally, or euer practise this: or that <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine lib</hi> 4. <hi>cont. Donatist. cap.</hi> 24. doth intend to speake for the vse of vnknowne languages, as <hi>Fryer Robert</hi> vnlearnedly and blockishly pretendeth.</p>
               <p>Finally he alleageth, <hi>that euery man lightly vnderstandeth somewhat of the Latine.</hi> But lightly he telleth vs a loud lie, as experience may teach euery man that is not obstinate. Beside that, if it be profitable for some men to vnderstand some few words, then reason will inferre, that it were far more profitable, if the publike seruice were in a tongue that might of all the hearers be vnderstood.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a great blessing that we may heare God speaking vnto vs in scriptures in our owne mother tongue, and praise and honor him with heart and voyce in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like congregation.

Neither do any so well apprehend Gods mercie in deliuering them from the dangers of the sea, as those that haue either passed great stormes, or escaped after ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, séeing their fellowes swallowed in the sea. But those that liued in the dayes of Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> and escaped the crueltie of those times, or else by report know the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate resolution of the wooluish persecutors, both well know the fauor of God to the Church and English nation, and can not choose but shew them selues thankefull for the same.</p>

               <p>THe Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> and his greasie crew of pol-shorne Priests, although they challenge power of binding and loosing; yet as experience hath taught vs, do rather bind heauie burthens on mens shoulders, then bind their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and rather séeke to loose and emptie their purses, then to loose them from their sinnes.

But if we consider the hookes, engines, and diuers practises, which they haue vsed to abuse the world, we néed not make question, but their dealings are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.

Neither would they do any thing without money. Monkes and Friars beside buying and selling, had a most gainefull trade of begging.

                  </gap> there are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods law: viz. such things as are contrary to the Popes law.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that concupiscence is sinne:</hi> these affirme the contrary. He saith, <hi>originall sinne passed ouer al;</hi> they deny it. He saith no man is iustified by the workes of the law, they teach flat contrary.</p>
               <p>The law directly prohibiteth the making of grauen ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to the end to bow down to them and to worship them. These notwithstanding make the images of the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, bow downe to them and worship them.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>(Coloss. 2.)</hi> speaketh against the worship of Angels. They regard him not, but in humblenesse of mind inuocate and worship Angels notwiihstanding.</p>

               <p>That the Papists are by schisme rent from the Catholike
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25623:39"/>
and vniuersal Church of Christ, it may be proued by diuers particulars. First, Christs Church hath but one head, that is Christ Jesus. But the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Church hath as many heads as Popes, and heads that teach doctrine both diuers and contrary to Christ our sole head.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Christ his Church hath no other spouse but <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> But the adulterous Komish synagogue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Pope to be her spouse, and therefore must needes haue as many spouses as Popes, and be not <hi>Virgo,</hi> but <hi>Polygama;</hi> that is, <hi>one that hath many husbands or spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Catholike Church is built vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apostles and Prophets, <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> being the corner stone; and hath beside this no other foundation. But the Komish Church acknowledgeth the Pope to be her foundation. Whereupon it followeth, that she is sometime without foundation, at least during the vacancie of the popedome, and hath as many diuers foundations as Popes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> doth acknowledge the Pope to be her law-giuer, and iudge, &amp; that he hath power not onely to bind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> consciences, but also to saue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy: which doth fhew that she deuideth her selfe from Christes Catholicke Church, which for many ages after Christs time had no such conceit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the same doth rely no lesse vpon traditions not written, and vpon the Popes determinations in matters of faith, then vpon the written word of God: which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church doeth not.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, this synagogue consisteth of a Pope, and his Cardinals, together with a rabble of Monkes, Fryers, and sacrificing priests. But in the prime Catholicke Church, there was no such state, nor orders of men to be found.</p>
               <p>Finally, the members of the Komish synagogue, are not onely deuided from the Catholike Church in doctrine, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, externall gouernement and fellowship, but also one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, the <hi>Thomists</hi> differing from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Scotists,</hi> the

Monkes from begging Friars, the regular orders from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Priests, one Doctor from another, and one Pope oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from another. If then Schismatickes be no true members of the Church as their Doctors teach; then are not the <hi>Romanists</hi> of the Church. Againe, if they differ from the Catholike Church, and among themselues, then haue they long continued in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>The nature and propertie of superstition doth shew the Papists to be also most superstitious. For if it be the nature and propertie of superstition, either to giue religious honor and worship to such things, as are not capable of it, or else to worship God after humane deuises, and otherwise then he hath commanded; then do they grossely offend in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But it is most notorious, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they grosly offend in both those points. For first they inuocate Angels. On the feast of Michael the Archangell they say: <hi>Holy S. Michael defend vs in battell, that we perish not in the fearefull iudgement.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Missal.</note> They pray also to the Angell that kéepeth them, whom<note place="margin">Rom.</note> they know not: and this adoration of Angels in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>

               <p>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Finally, they giue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> worship to the crosse, and to the images of the holy Trinitie, worshipping creatures for their Creator.

               <p>Secondly, they say Masses in honor of Saints and of our Ladie, and make vowes vnto them. But our Sauiour Christ neuer taught vs to celebrate the Eucharist in honor of Saints, or to offer his bodie in honor of <hi>S. Francis, Saint Cuthbert, S.

                  </gap>. They do also make vowes to our Ladie and to Saints, and trust very much in them. They do further call vpon Angels and Saints in all places, and offer sacrifices in their honour. Finally, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of that adoration, that is due to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:25623:41"/>Secondly, they commit those faults, which the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do note and condemne in idolaters of old time. They worship creatures for the Creator, as the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. saith the Gentiles did. They make similitudes of things both in heauen and earth, bow downe to them, and worship them: although the same be prohibited in the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. They erect monuments, and titles, and stones for signes to be worshipped, contrary to the law, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. They make euery day new gods, affirming <hi>that the priest maketh his maker.</hi> Now this making of new gods is noted as a propertie of idolaters, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. They reioyce in the works of their owne hands, and worship the images which themselues haue made, as did the idolaters whereof <hi>S. Stephen</hi> maketh mention, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. They serue <hi>the hoast of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as the old idolatrous Iews spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Amos 5. &amp; Act.</hi> 7. seruing diuers saints, and as they call them, <hi>Militiam &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam coelestem:</hi> that is, <hi>the soldiory and court of heauen.</hi> As the statues of the Gentiles <hi>were siluer and gold, the worke of mens hands, and had mouthes and spoke not, eies and saw not,</hi> as sayth the Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 14. so is it with the images of Papists, that albeit of costly matter and curious worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, yet neither speake with their mouthes, nor sée with their eyes. As idolaters burnt incense to their statues, as we reade 2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 30. so do Papists burne incense to their images.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they fall into those abuses, which the Fathers of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Church thought worthy to be reprehended of old time, as sauoring of idolatry. The Gentiles thought they could represent God in a materiall image. And so do the Papists making the image of God the Father, and God the holy Ghost. The Fathers therefore reprehend them both alike. <hi>Quis tam amens erit</hi> (saith <hi>Eusebius praeparat. Euangel. c. 3.) vt Dei formam &amp; imaginem statua viro simili referri perhibeat? Who wil be so mad to think, that the forme and image of God may be expressed by an image like vnto a man? Hierome</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise writing vpon the fortith of <hi>Isay, What image</hi> (saith he) <hi>wil you make for him which is a spirit, and is in all places? Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:25623:42"/>
in his oration of the death of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> sayth, <hi>It is an errour of the Gentiles to worship the crosse. Inuenit Helena</hi> (saith he) <hi>crucem Domini: regem adorauit, non lignum vtique, quia hic Gentilis est error, sed adorauit illum qui pependit in cruce.</hi> The councell of <hi>Laodicea</hi> condemneth the worship of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as idolatrous. So like wise saith <hi>Tertullian, de praescrip. aduers. haeret.</hi> that the heresie of the Simonians in seruing of Angels, was reputed among idolatries. <hi>Simonianae magiae disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina Angelis seruie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vtique &amp; ipsa inter idololatrias deputabatur. Hierome</hi> in an Epistle of his to <hi>Riparius,</hi> saith, <hi>that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans neither adore nor worship Martyrs, nor Sun, nor Moone, nor Angels, least they should therein rather serue creatures, then the Creator. Tertullian</hi> doth also say, <hi>that euery lie of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De praeescript. aduers. Haeeret.</note> 
                  <hi>God, is after a sort a variation of the kind of idolatrie. Omne mendacium de Deo variatio quodammodo sexus est idololatriae.</hi> Both he and diuers others say, <hi>that heresie is a kind of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</hi> How then can they cleare themselues from the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish of idolatrie, that worship the crosse, serue and worship Angels, and are authors of so many sorts of heresies?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they must néedes deny the crosse, and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Trinitie, and the crucifixe to be creatures and works of their owne hands, or else in worshipping of them, they must néedes confesse and yéeld themselues to be idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But that they cannot do.</p>
               <p>Finally, the testimonie of their owne conscience doth proue them to be idolaters, in that they leaue out the second commandement, or as they make it, a péece of the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that is direct against the adoration and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of grauen images, and the making of them to that end, in most of their Catechismes, Manuals, Psalters, and ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bookes, where they rehearse the ten commandements, as their Ladies psalters, short Catechismes, and diuers of their bookes do testifie.</p>
               <p>But since it pleased God to restore religion in the church of <hi>England,</hi> the leuen of popish doctrine and heresie is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out, the breach of schisme and diuision from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is repaired, and all superstitious and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous

               <p>THe Ministers of God, as they are guides to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and teachers of the law; so ought they to go before their flockes, shewing them examples to prouoke them to do good workes, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme their liues according to the lawes of God. <hi>Shew thy selfe an example of good workes,</hi>

For <hi>we are Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> created in Christ to good workes, which God hath ordained that we should walke in them.</hi> This is our doctrine, and the practise of all that professe our religion. If any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites be found among vs, that walke not according to their profession, we renounce them, we weed them out, we punish them. If worldings and fleshly Papists, that liue in the Realme do giue occasion of offence, this ought not to be imputed to our Religion, nor the true professors thereof, that desire nothing more then that such may be weeded out, and expulsed both out of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>But if we looke backe to former times, we shall find that the Papists haue not onely erred in the practise, but also in the doctrine of good workes. For first they denie, that the law of God is a perfect rule of life. And therefore haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented other rules, whereby they hope to attaine to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfection. Secondly they hold, that by the law of God we haue not knowledge of all sinnes, teaching that it is as well mortall sinne to transgresse the Popes lawes, as to transgresse Gods lawes, as <hi>Nauarrus</hi> teacheth vs in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall by many particulars. Thirdly, they giue absolution to euery haynous sinner, confessing his sins, before he hath repented. Fourthly, they suppose that euery man is able to

For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the weightier points of the law, like their ancesters the Pharisees they stand much on fithing Mint, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and washings, &amp; such like ceremonies. Their principall works are forswearing of mariage, begging like vagabond fellowes, eating muscles, cockles, and salt fish, and such like on fasting dayes, and saints vigiles, taking ashes on Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wednesday, confessing in a priests eare at Shroftide, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of crownes, going to Masse, sprinkling of holy-water, lighting of candles at noone day, crouching to images, crée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to the crosse, kissing of the Popes toe, praying for soules in purgatorie, gaining of pardons, going on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, ringing and singing for the dead, aneling and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of men and women desperately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Popes and their faction haue caused all the warres and troubles in Christendome, as histories do recount. If a man do but look in the life of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, &amp; <hi>Iulius</hi> the 2. he may easily sée what seditious and turbulent spirits they cary. But what néed we looke so high, séeing the flames of ciuil discension in <hi>Germanie, France, Flanders, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> burning so bright by the solicitation of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, <hi>Gregorie</hi> thirtéenth and fourteenth, and this <hi>Clement</hi> that now possesseth the throne of Antichrist, do so plainely declare them to be firebrands of warre and trouble?

               <p>To conclude this large discourse, there is no state of men vnder the Popes iurisdiction, but it is growne to great dissolution and corruption of manners, and may be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of diuers sinnes and abominations by infinite witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and confessions if we would stand vpon it: but I will content my selfe with two or three. <hi>Breidenbach</hi> in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of his peregrination, speaketh generally and sayth, <hi>Recessit lex à sacerdotibus &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>the law is departed from priests, iustice from princes, counsell from elders, good dealing from the people, loue from parents, reuerence from subiects, charitie from prelates, religion from Monkes, honestie from yong men, discipline from clerkes, learning from masters, study from schollers, equitie from Iudges, concord from citizens, feare from seruants, good fellowship from husbandmen, truth from merchants, valor from Noblemen, chastitie from virgins, humility from widowes, loue from maried folks, patience from poore men. O time! ô manners!</hi> And <hi>Walter Mapes</hi> that liued in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, King of <hi>England, Virtutes cunctae</hi> (saith he) <hi>en iacent defunctae: All vertues lie now dead.

               <p>But the Church of <hi>England</hi> neither alloweth publike shewes, nor bankes of vsurie, nor dispenseth with oathes of subiects to Princes, or alloweth periurie, nor shall <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Parsons</hi> find such filthines and abhominations among the professors of our religion, as are commonly practised by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Popes, Cardinals, Masse-priests, Monkes, Friars, and Nuns, and their followers. All corruptions in doctrine concerning good workes are reformed, and diuers abuses concerning manners among the Papists taken away. The which séeing it procéeded wholly of that reformation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which Quéen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of pious memorie wrought by her regall authoritie among vs, we are most gratefully to accept that worke, and by exercises of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Against this discourse <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> talketh very scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and saith first, <hi>that the experience of the whole world will deny, that good workes are fruites of our religion.</hi> But
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25623:47"/>
if he had bene well aduised, he would haue forborne to talke of experience. For whosoeuer hath liued among those, that are of our religion, and among Papists also, must néedes say, that the liues of Romanists are abhominable, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in whosedome, Sodomie, periurie, vsurie and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and discharge vs deterring and abhorring those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and punishing them seuerely. Beside that, if he meant to winne credit, he would not talke of the whole world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to name one honest man, that will iustifie that which he talketh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he saith, <hi>our best friends renounce our workes.</hi> And then alleageth an Epistle of <hi>Erasmus</hi> mentioned by <hi>Surius,</hi> &amp; a Postil of <hi>Luther,</hi> and a testimonie out of <hi>Aurifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> But first <hi>Erasmus</hi> is none of our best friends, being in most points an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Secondly, it is a ridiculous foolerie, where we dispute of the fruites of the Gospell in <hi>England</hi> in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, to bring testimonies of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faber,</hi> that were dead before her time, and speake of some of their countrie people.

               <p>Not long after, when she saw, that to resist the enemies malice it was necessaire for her to follow the warres, she sent some forces to sea, which albeit not great nor compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently prouided, yet did they possesse the harbor of <hi>Coronna</hi> take the base towne, and defeat all the forces that were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered against them at the bridge of <hi>Burgos.</hi> The same also entred <hi>Portugal,</hi> and had possessed it, if there had bene good correspondence. <hi>Sir Francis Drake</hi> with no great forces took <hi>S.

               <p>Finally, we find Gods promise to his people by <hi>Moyses Deut.</hi> 28. verified in her. For where he sayth, <hi>That God would make all his peoples enemies to fall down before them,</hi> we sée that all the Quéenes enemies fel before her, and that the more they maligned her, the more God aduanced her. Such reputation she wan both with Christians and with Infidels, that al men had great respect vnto her, except such as maliciously oppugned her.

               <p>Before the Quéenes time the Pope claimed a great part in the gouernement of <hi>England,</hi> challenging power to make Ecclesiastical lawes, to send hither Legates, to ordaine and appoint Bishops, &amp; in diuers cases to dispose of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call liuings, and those that possessed them.

lawes for religion, to rule their subiects, to dispose of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and goods of the Church according to right.

               <p>Finally, he would insinuate, <hi>that increase of people</hi> is no blessing, séeing the <hi>Turkes</hi> by multitude of wiues haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children, and holy Cunuches are commended that haue no children. He doth also vnder hand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> at the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Ministers. But first, he denyeth that, which the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth directly teach, viz. that children are the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, and that God did promise the multiplication of his séede to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a great blessing. Secondly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit particular men that kéepe themselues chast for the kingdome of heauen, are commended: yet that concerneth the lecherous and bougerly Masse priests and Monkes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that rather for sweare mariage, then kéep themselues

chast. Neither is that a commendation to a whole State or kingdome, if some liue chastly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, albeit <hi>Turkes</hi> haue many wiues; yet God doth not so blesse them with children, but that they are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to vse the children of Christians, and to exact a tribute of them. To conclude, this bastardly fellow sheweth himselfe to be past shame, to talke against mariage, when himselfe was begotten by a filthie priest, and his consorts wallow in all beastly abhominations.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the aduersaries storme and rage as much as they list, yet will we say, and may say it most truly, that both the Church of God and the State hath receiued great blessings by Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> late happie gouernment. And if nothing else, yet the vaine opposition of enemies and traitors may perswade vs, that it is so. For not onely their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>In the first encounter of his <hi>Wardword p.</hi> 4. he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>We are deuided from the general body of catholickes in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> But this should haue bene proued if he would haue any man to giue him credit. For we alleage, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, from whom we are deuided, are no Catholikes, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the new doctrines of the late conuenticles of <hi>Lateran, Constance, Florence</hi> &amp; <hi>Trent,</hi> &amp; other Friers &amp; priests, which neither were receiued of all men, nor in all times, nor in all places, which is the true propertie of Catholicke doctrine. Next we offer to proue, that we are true Catholikes, séeing the doctrine of our faith is Apostolicall, and vniuersally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of all true Christians, and for the most part confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Papists, vntil of late time. If then this be a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall curse, <hi>to be deuided from Catholickes,</hi> then doth the same fall on <hi>Parsons</hi> his own head, and vpon his trecherous consorts, and not vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly he saith, that we of <hi>England</hi> are deuided from <hi>Lutherans, Zuinglians,</hi> and <hi>Caluinists</hi> abroad, and from <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> &amp; <hi>Brownists,</hi> and other like good fellowes at home. But this common Iergon of Papists is already answered. For neither do we acknowledge the names of <hi>Lutherans, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians,</hi> and <hi>Caluinists,</hi> nor cau he shew that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is deuided from the Churches of <hi>France, Germanie</hi> or <hi>Suizzerland,</hi> or that one Church oppugneth another.

For generally we all agree in substance of faith, &amp; in rites &amp;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:25623:54"/>
ceremonies refer euery Church to their libertie. In <hi>England</hi> publikely there is more vniformitie in doctrine, prayers &amp; ceremonies, then in the Romish Church; albeit some priuat men, whom <hi>Parsons</hi> vseth to call <hi>Puritanes,</hi> dissent in some points. As among the Papists there are diuers that allow not all, which they hold commonly. But saith he in his <hi>Warne-word, Encont.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. the <hi>French, Germaines</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> do not agrée with the <hi>English</hi> in the rule of faith, as is proued in the foure, fiue and sixe and sequent chapters. But if he had found any differences, he would not haue spared to set them down. In the chapters mentioned, he sheweth not that we differ in any article of faith, or substantiall point of religion, but rather in rites, ceremonies, and some diuers interpretations of some words of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he would make his reader beléeue, <hi>that we haue no certaintie in religion,</hi> and that as he foole-wisely imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>because we haue no certaine rule whereby to direct our consciences.</hi> And this he handleth both in his <hi>Wardword 1. Encontr.</hi> and <hi>Warnw. 1. enc. c. 15. &amp;</hi> 16. and other places, skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping like an ape vp an downe without rule, order or reason. But while he talketh of the rule of faith, he is direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himselfe. For in his Wardw. p. 6. he sayth, <hi>that the vniuersal Church was the direct rule and squire which we ought to follow,</hi> and in the <hi>Warnw. Enc.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>nu.</hi> 10. he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>that it is the summe and corpes of Christian doctrine deliuered at the beginning by the miracles and preachings of the Apostles.</hi> Where I omit to tell <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> that it is absurd to make the same thing to be a rule and a squire, the rule being direct, and the squire being square. It is also ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, though I do not tell him of it, to say <hi>that Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was deliuered by miracles:</hi> for it was deliuered by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and preaching, and confirmed by miracles. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for beare to tell him, that there is great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Catholike Church and the Catholike doctrine. How then can these two make one rule? Next he taketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to my words, where I say that the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> hath a certaine rule to follow in matters of faith, as if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:25623:54"/>
she canon of scriptures, and those conclusions which are to be drawne out of them, were no certaine rule: or else as if traditions, that are no where certainly described or set downe, were a more certaine and authenticall rule then scriptures, and necessary deductions out of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly he giueth out, <hi>that we despaire of all certaine<note place="margin">Warnw. 1. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont. cap. 17.</note> rule or meane to trie the truth:</hi> which is a most desperate and impudent kind of dealing. For directly I told him before, and now I tell him againe, that our rule is most certaine, being nothing else but the canonicall Scriptures, and the conclusions necessary drawne out of them. Nay this rule may in part be confirmed by <hi>Parsons</hi> his owne confession. For if the corps of Christian doctrine preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles be the rule of faith, as he saith <hi>VVarnw. 1. encont. c.</hi> 15. where are we to find it but in holy Scriptures? He holdeth percase that it is to be found in the Popes bosome. But if he say so in schooles, he shal not want a greater <hi>plaudit</hi> then he had, when hauing ended his comicall dealings in <hi>Bayliol</hi> colledge, he was rung and hissed out of the house. For who knoweth not, that scabs and villany are rather to be found in the Popes bosome, then any corpes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? for that is very rife with them. With the corpes of Apostolicall doctrine the <hi>Italian</hi> atheisticall Popes are litle acquainted.</p>
               <p>We tel him further, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for trial of any point of doctrine we are not to run to the Popes sea, which is as much able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue vs, as his close stoole; but to the word of God reuealed in Scriptures, and if there be any difference about a place of Scriptures, we are then to compare the same with other places, to search the resolutions of Councels, of auncient and later Fathers, of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and learned men. Prouided alwayes that nothing be receiued as a ground of faith, which is not to be deduced out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. Whether then <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> or <hi>Hierome,</hi> or <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Caluin,</hi> or any preacher among vs bring vs the word of God, it is to be receiued. But if they teach without that, we are not necessarily to credit them, nor to beléeue
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:25623:55"/>
them in grounds of faith.</p>
               <p>Out of the Scriptures we learne, that <hi>Christ hath giuen some Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists, some pastors and teachers;</hi> albeit all particular matters are not precisely set downe. So likewise we are taught that these words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> are most true, &amp; that the sacramr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is Christs body in a mysterie or sacramentally, albeit how the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called Christs body there may be some differences. Likewise out of Scripture we are taught, that the King is the most principall man in his Realme, and not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any other in externall gouernement, albeit euery one percase vnderstandeth not the seuerall points of his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority. These differences therefore notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, our rule of faith is most certaine.</p>
               <p>Fiftly he would insinuate, that as vertue, houskéeping, &amp; true dealing is much decayed, since her Maiesty came to the crowne, so pride in apparel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, drunkennes, lechery, swearing and other vices are much increased. But the man should shew that these vertues are decayed, and vices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in men that are truly of our Religion. If he say so, then let him name the men that are guiltie of these faults. If the men that are guilty be Papists, that for the most part are knowne to be carnall and cruel, and most vitious, he striketh himselfe and not vs. If they be Atheists or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, then his allegation maketh not to purpose. This I will speake to his teeth, that if our Ministery be no more honest and vertuous, then the Popes, Cardinals, Friers, and Masse-priests, and our true professors then zelous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, it were pitie they should liue on the face of the earth. Some proofes I haue brought before, and more I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage herafter. Let <hi>Parsons</hi> do the like against vs, and leaue his hypocriticall oftentation, and generall declamation, that maketh men rather to wonder at his impudency, then to beleeue that he dealeth truly or sincerely.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, he very impudently imputeth all the troubles,<note place="margin">Ward w. p. 3.</note> wars and calamities that haue happened in <hi>Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">Warn w. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

lay the blame wholy vpon vs. But if he looke into their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate causes; he shall find, that the mint of this money was the Popes consistorie, and that he and his agents are the onely firebrands of all mischiefe. In <hi>Ireland, Gregorie</hi> the thirteenth stirred vp rebellion by the traitor <hi>Saunders</hi> his legate: in <hi>England Pius Quintus</hi> by his agent <hi>Ridolphi</hi> and by <hi>Morton</hi> his messenger moued the two Earles to rise in the North, <hi>Anno</hi> 1569. The same Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated the <hi>Spanish</hi> King to make warres against the Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> and against them of the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The same Pope sent not onely his agents, to stirre the <hi>French,</hi> but ayded them both with men and mony. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the thirtéenth likewise sent ayde to <hi>Irish</hi> rebels. The wars of <hi>Germanie</hi> were enflamed by that butcherly Pope <hi>Paule the third.</hi> To make short, all massacres, trecheris, warres and troubles haue wholy procéeded from their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against the truth. If the Pope and his adherents ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue bene troubled, so was <hi>Herode</hi> and all <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with him at the birth of <hi>Christ.</hi> If they blame vs for their troubles, so did the <hi>Pagans</hi> impute all their troubles to Christians, and their religion. But the true cause was not religion, but the hatred of impious Papists against reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Finally, he saith, <hi>that if her Maiestie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not altered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then her kingdome had bene flourishing and secure, and that she would haue had issue, and her succession certaine, and continued in friendship with the Pope, and auncient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and neither had wars abroad, nor treason at home:</hi> and insinuateth, that by reason of alteration of religion al is fallen out contrarie. But if <hi>Wil Sommer</hi> had written this discourse, he could neuer haue spoken more foolishly, nor impertinently. For first I haue shewed, that the state of the kingdome for diuers respects was neuer more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing. Secondly, if any danger hanged ouer our heads, the same might easily be auoyded, if lawes had bene execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against traitors. Thirdly, it is now apparant to the world, that want of issue in her Maiestie hath not hurt vs,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:25623:56"/>
God sending vs so gracious and magnanimous a king. Fourthly his royall Maiestie succéeding in her throne hath declared, that she wanted no succession. The same act also sheweth, that <hi>Parsons</hi> and all his consorts are a packe of false Prophets. <hi>Parsons</hi> his booke of succession doth also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be a false traitor. Fiftly, it is a ridiculous thing to tell vs of vnion with the Pope, and his mediation of peace. For there ought to be no agréement betweene Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Antichrist. Here the Noddie will storme, that his holy Father should be called Antichrist. But let him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer my reasons in my fifth booke <hi>De Pont. Rom.</hi> against <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and then let him storme, while his heart break. Sixtly, we haue so litle losse by breaking with the <hi>Spanish</hi> king, that all men of knowledge pray, that either he may chaunge his former courses, or that the warres may still continue. Finally, this land hath no reason, either to feare forraine warres, or domesticall treasons, vnlesse we will vncouple the Popes hounds, that come hither to teare the kings Maiestie and State in péeces: which I hope he and his Councell of state will looke vnto.</p>
               <p>Whether then we looke into the Church, or the State; we must needes say, that Quéene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne was most happie. And that so much the rather, for that all her aduersaries wit and malice doth not affoord any one sound argument, that doth any way sound to her disgrace. <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> hath long barked in vaine against her procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

               <p>THE nature of man being subiect to change, it is no maruell (good Christian Reader) if naturally all men desire change. But that such as professe religion, and haue experience in the world, should desire to change for the worse, and seeke from libertie and peace, to returne to miserable captiuitie and slauerie, vnder the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousyoke of popish gouernment, it seemeth to me not onely strange, but also repugnant to the rules of religion and reason. <hi>Stand fast</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>in the libertie, wherewith Christ</hi>

               <p>So likewise some there are among vs, that not knowing, or not remembring the grieuances of the popish gouernment, nor wel considering their present freedome, and happie state, looke backe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes golden promises, and rather will venture their soules and bodies, then still enioy that libertie and freedome, which they haue receiued from their auncestors. Of this sort are first a sort of rinegued <hi>English</hi> fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, that runne to the Pope and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and are by them perswaded to become sacrificing Priests and traitors, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly such, as are seduced by them, all of them drinking of the golden cuppe of the whoore of Babylon, and as if they had drunke of <hi>Circes</hi> cuppe, from men being transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beasts, and brutish Papistes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to reclaime these haggard <hi>English</hi> if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to stay the stirring humours of others,, as I haue in the former Treatise recounted diuers excellent graces bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon our countrie and nation, by meanes of the pious and prosperous gouernment of our late Queene, that broke down the altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> and established <hi>Christs</hi> true religion among vs; so now in the Discourse ensuing I purpose by Gods grace to enter into a due consideration of the calamities and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wherto our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was subiect during the raign of Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> and whereto all Papists liuing vnder the Popes iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction are ordinarily subiect. Wherein that I may proceede more perspicuously, first I will speak of matters of the Church, and then of matters of ciuill pollicie: and that first as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the King, and next as they concerne his people.</p>
               <p>Now because <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> according to his best skill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to aduance popish gouernment, I haue thought it not amisse now and then, as the course of my Discourse cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, to enterlace his idle arguments, and to refute them.

Not that I suppose any man of reason will giue credit to such a lying companion, that shutting his eyes against light, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth his tongue to walke and talke against all truth, but that by his trifling obiections you may perceiue our plaine dealing, and his parasiticall and palpable glosing. I may well say of this wicked Atheists wranglings, as <hi>Origen</hi> sayd of <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> in his discourse against Christian Religion: <hi>Non est peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi>

There is no danger, least any faithfull man be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by them. God forbid that any should be so cold in the loue of God, which is through Christ Iesus, that he should be disturned from his godly purpose by Parsons</hi> his wrangling Wardwords and Warne-words, or by such friuolous deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of any of his consorts.

Against these I dispute, and for those I labour that persist in their first loue. Marke therefore, I pray you, the ignorance of Papists in matters of Religion, the falshood and absurdities of their doctrine, the burthensome and grieuous tyrannie of the Pope; and then iudge without partialitie, whether the same be not like the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and darknesse of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of which all true Christians ought to desire to be deliuered.

               <p>Loth the Pope is, that the people should know too much:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:25623:62"/>
and therefore he forbiddeth Scriptures to be either transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or read in vulgar tongues without licence. In publike Liturgies it is not the fashion of Papists, to suffer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Papists also that vnderstand not Latine pray with their lippes, but not with their vnderstanding and spirit.

               <p>Furthermore, the Priests in <hi>England</hi> were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to teach the people the worship of the crosse, of images,

And were wont to heare many good tales of the miracles of <hi>S. Audrey,</hi> and <hi>S. Cuthburge,</hi> and other she Saints. But all this tended litle to instruction in faith, or reformation in manners.</p>
               <p>Finally, in stead of true doctrine they were taught the traditions of men concerning worship of Saints, crosses, images, reliques, fasting on Saints Uigils, pilgrimages, indulgences, purgatorie and such like. <hi>Petrus de Alliac. lib. de reform. Ecclesiae,</hi> wisheth, <hi>That Apocryphall Scriptures, and new hymnes, and prayers, and other voluntarie nouelties should not be read in churches: Quòd in huinsmodi festis Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae Apocryphae, aut hymninoui, vel orationes, seu aliae voluntariae nouitates non legerentur:</hi> but he preuailed not. Nay further, they do not onely teach false doctrines and Apocryphall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, but also most wickedly rehearsing the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they haue left out the second commaundement that concerneth worship of images, albeit <hi>S. Augustine quaest. ex vet. test.</hi> 7. do set it downe for a distinct commandement from the first.</p>
               <p>Being then taught very litle truth, and much falshood, it must néeds follow, that the Papists were in time past very ignorant; and that <hi>Iohn Billet in prolog. de diuin. off.</hi> plainely confesseth. Experience also teacheth the same, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly sheweth that they scarce vnderstood any article of the Créed. A certaine <hi>Italian</hi> being asked not many yeares since by his confessor in <hi>Rome,</hi> whether he beleeued the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: answered, yea. Being further demaunded, what the Trinitie was: <hi>VVhat</hi> (said he) <hi>but our Lord God, and our Lady, and you our masters the priests and Friers?</hi> They are so brutish, that they verily beléeue that images walke and talke, and haue life.

                  <hi>Crucifixe,</hi> the caruer séeing the simplicitie of the men asked them, whether they would haue one aliue or dead.

               </p>
               <p>Most of them beléeue the lyes and fables, that Priests tell them out of their legends. And those are the best part of their knowledge. A poore countrie man of ours beleeued, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>S. Tinnoc of Portle mouth in Deuon</hi> was a good guardian of shéepe: and therefore offered euery yeare a fléece. On a time passing ouer the water at <hi>Salcomb</hi> with his offering, and being in danger, vowed, if he escaped to offer his horse, which he did, and the Saint with good glée and a becke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted him. But not being able well to returne on foote, he prayed he might buy his horse of the Saint. The priest was the broker and made the bargaine, but it was so hard, that the poore man said, he was a good kéeper of sheepe, but a cut throate Saint to deale with all in buying and selling.</p>
               <p>Commonly they neither vnderstood what they prayed, nor what was said in the Church, neither do they now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand much more, albeit the Priests in their new and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For if eternall life consist in the knowledge of God, and <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> as himselfe teacheth vs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. what hope can they haue, that are ignorant of God and godlinesse; of Christ, and Christs true religion? If they liue in darknesse, and without light, that want the light of Gods word; then is the darknesse of poperie great, where publike prayers, and Scriptures read publikely are kept vnder the couer of strange tongues, as a candle vnder a bushell. If the people of God were led away captiue, for that they wanted knowledge, as it is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. what possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie haue the Papists to frée themselues from the captiuity of the diuell and Antichrist, that are ignorant of religion, and led by the noses by impostors, and false teachers subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Antichrist? Finally, if the people perish, where there is no prophecying, as we reade <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 29. then are the Papists in a most fearefull and damnable state, among whom the word of God is not sincerely preached, and to whom wicked Masse-priests and Friars for the word of God preach humane deuises and lyes. The very heathen vnderstood, <hi>that the knowledge of God was the beginning, the cause, and rule of humane happinesse.</hi>

And the rather I follow this course, for that <hi>Schoppius</hi> telleth vs<note place="margin">De <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Wherein I would not haue any to thinke that when I name Papists, I meane to speake against all our forefathers (who indeed positiuely held not all points of popery, but rather professed Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie positiuely, albeit they did not resolutely denie popish errors) but onely such as are the chiefe founders, teachers, and maintainers of popish Religion, and which with great zeale persecute all that resist it, or refuse it.</p>

               <p>The Cardinals, which are the Popes assistants, would be loth to shame their holy Father, and creator the Pope.

               <p>

                  </gap> of his doctrinall principles, affirmeth desperately, <hi>that God speaketh in the Pope, and that the foundation of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is necessarily placed in his authoritie teaching vs.</hi> It was much to say, that he was any way the foundation of religion. But to make him <hi>a necessarie foundation,</hi> was a greater presumption, then I find in his fellows. His words are these, <hi>In hac docentis hominis authoritate, in qua Deum lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentem audimus, religionis nostrae cognoscendae fundamentum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessariò poni cernimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can any of them well deny, but that the Pope is the rocks, vpon which the Church is built, and against which the gates of hell cannot preuaile, séeing generally they proue the Popes authoritie out of <hi>Christs</hi> words to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16. For if these words be not meant of the Pope, but of <hi>Christ,</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> confessed; then are they fondly alleaged for iustification of the Popes authoritie.</p>
               <p>In summe all their practise sheweth, that the Pope to them is <hi>summa summarum,</hi> and the corner stone, and chiefe foundation of the popish Church. For alleage Scriptures, they quarrell about the interpretation, and admit no sence but that which the Pope alloweth, although his glosses and interpretations be neuer so contrarie to the text. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, alleage Councels, they enquire, if the Pope haue allowed them. Alleage Fathers speaking against the Pope, they reiect them. But alleage the Popes determination, there they stop like restie iades, and will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> further. So the Pope and his resolutions are the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nay, they are all in all with Papists.</p>
               <p>But this is not onely contrarie to the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25623:72"/>
                  <hi>Isay</hi> 8. and 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. where Christ is made the corner stone and sole foundation of the Church, but also contrarie to all Fathers, and good interpreters of Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The same is also most absurd and contrarie to reason. For first if the Pope were the foundation of the Church; then should there be as many foundations, as Popes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Church should be built vpon foundations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from Christ. Thirdly, the foundations of the Church should differ one from another, one Pope contradicting, and crossing another. Fourthly, the Popes being sometimes reprobates and damned, hell should preuaile against the foundation of the Church, which is most absurd. Fiftly, the Church during the vacation should be without foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and a woman being Pope, the Church should be built vpon a woman. Finally, the Church should be built vpon men subiect to infirmities, errors and mutations, and not vpon Christ Iesus, the vnmoueable rocke.</p>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, transumpts and copies might by like reason be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the originall instruments. Thirdly, the old
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25623:76"/>
Latine translation is proued false by diuers witnesses, by comparing of places, &amp; for that one edition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old vulgar translation doth differ from another. <hi>Non potest verum esse, quod dissonat: that cannot be true, that is repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to it selfe,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith <hi>in Praefat. in Iosuam, &amp; in Praefat. in 4. Euang.</hi> But the edition of the vulgar transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion set out by <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth doth much differ from that, which <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> set out before. <hi>Iosue 11. 19.

Clement</hi> readeth <hi>qui essent non credentes:</hi> Sixtus, <hi>qui essent credentes.</hi> And so it may appeare by diligent collation, that there are notable differences throughout the whole Bible. Lastly, if the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine text were more authenticall, then the <hi>Hebrew or Greeke:</hi> why do not our aduersaries shew, that the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, or some learned men of late time at the least, haue corrected the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greeke,</hi> according to the Latine, and not rather contrariwise?</p>
               <p>The fourth foundation of Romish religion is the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Pope in matters of faith.

               <p>TRue Religion is most true, venerable, and respectiue of Gods true seruice. If then popish Religion containe any vntrue or ridiculous, vaine, and blasphemous doctrine, then is it not true, or Apostolicall, or Christian: nor can it stand with Christian Religion, séeing no man can serue God and <hi>Baal,</hi> nor <hi>Dagon</hi> could stand before the arke of God. But notorious it is, that popish Religion containeth many blasphemous, ridiculous, and absurd points.</p>
               <p>First, concerning the flesh of our Lord and Sauior Christ Jesus they teach falsly and blasphemously, and say, <hi>that a mouse or dog, or hog may eate the body of Christ.</hi> Nay they are not ashamed to affirme, <hi>that his most holy body may be cast out vpon a dunghill, or into any vncleane place. Prima opinio</hi> (saith <hi>Alexander Hales part.</hi> 4. <hi>sum. q.</hi> 53. <hi>m.</hi> 2.) <hi>quae dicit quod corpus Christi defertur, quocunque species deferunt, vt in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem canis, vel suis, vel in alia lo ca immunda, videtur vera.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>sum. q.</hi> 45. <hi>m.</hi> 1. <hi>si canis aut porcus deglutiat hostiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secratam, non video quare corpus Christi non simul traijceretur in ventrem canis vel porci. If a dog or hog should swallow a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate host</hi> (saith he) <hi>I see no reason why the body of Christ should not withall passe into the belly of a dog or hog. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> likewise, although made a saint by the Pope, yet shameth not to hold this prophane and vnholy opinion, <hi>part.</hi>

Bread is transubstantiate into Christ, and so into the creator: and therfore a creature euery day is a creator.</hi> The like sayings are to be found in the booke called <hi>Stella clericorum,</hi> and diuers other authors. Neither do these men doubt, but that the communicants do eate their Maker. But this is most absurd, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to the <hi>Turkes</hi> and heathen, that Christians should be sayd to eate vp their God, and for this cause <hi>Auerroes</hi> said, that of all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, that of the Papists was most ridiculous. It is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd also to say, that man can make God, or the creature his Creator.</p>
               <p>They affirme also that Christ at his last supper did truly and really eate vp his owne body whole and entire. As if Christ had come into the world not onely to be eaten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of others, but also to deuoure and eate vp himselfe: a matter most absurd, and clearely repugnant to scriptures, fathers, and sense. For Scriptures and Fathers teach, that Christ took bread, and called it his body. And sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son teacheth vs, that it is vnnatural for one man to eate vp another, and impossible for the same man to eate vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. For then there should be no difference <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>While they say, that Christians do really and carnally eate Christs flesh, and drink his blood, they make them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Sauior, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. who sayth, <hi>vnlesse we eate his flesh and drink his bloud, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue life in vs.</hi> For he addeth, <hi>that the spirit quickneth, and the flesh profiteth nothing:</hi> condemning the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> that imagined that his flesh was to be torne with téeth, and his blood swallowed downe into the belly carnally as the Papists also imagine: and reprouing all carnall and literall interpretations of his words. <hi>Haec inquam, omnia carnalia mysticè &amp; spiritualiter intèlligenda sunt. All these carnall things</hi> (sayth <hi>Chrysostome hom.</hi> 46. <hi>in Ioan.) are to be vnderstood mystically and spiritually.</hi> Likewise <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> in <hi>Leuit.</hi> 7. sayth, <hi>that the literall vnderstanding of these words, Vnlesse ye eate the flesh of the son of man, &amp;c. killeth. Augustine</hi> also teacheth, that these words are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood sacramentally, and <hi>that being spiritually vnderstood they quicken.</hi> But what should I speake of the Fathers of the Church, séeing <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> talking of <hi>Polyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> do condemne the eating of mans flesh, as a thing both barbarous and monstrous?</p>
               <p>Concerning Christ his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they teach strangely,<note place="margin">Catech. Rom. in Symbol.</note> saying, that he being borne of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise passe out of the womb, <hi>then as the Sun beames do passe through the substance of the glasse:</hi> their words are, <hi>Vt solis radij concretam vitri substantiam penetrant:</hi> which do plainely ouerthrow the mystery of his natiuity. For how was he true man, if neuer man passed through his mothers womb, as the sun passeth through glasse? or how was he like to vs in all things, sinne onely except, if he were not borne like to vs?</p>
               <p>They beleeue also and teach, that Christ his body did passe through the graue stone, when he rose from death, and through the doore when he entred the house where his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were assembled, after his resurrection. <hi>The Fathers hold</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 3, <hi>de Eucharist. cap.</hi> 16.) that Christs true body came out of the sepulcher being shut: <hi>Quod per clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum sepulchrum verum corpus exiuerit.</hi> And his meaning is, that his true body passed through the stone at the graues mouth, as may wel be gathered by the drift of his discourse,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25623:79"/>
where he refuteth the opinion of those that held that the graue stone yeelded and gaue place to Christs body. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the same place speaking of Christs comming to his Disciples <hi>the doores being shut,</hi> he affirmeth <hi>that Christ pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his solide body through another solide body: Quod Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus corpus suum solidum per aliud solidum introduxerit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the sacrament they say that Christ his true body is really: and by consequent confesse, that the same is in as many diuers places at once, as is the sacrament. They hold also, that the same body is there neither felt nor seene, and that he is not extended according to the nature of an humane body, nor occupieth any place being in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But these are matters direct contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles and fathers: they also repugne against reason, and imply notorious contradictions. <hi>They brought him to Ierusalem</hi> (sayth <hi>Luke c. 2.) to present him to the Lord, as it is written in the law; euery male child that first openeth the wombe, shall be called holy to the Lord. Matris vulua</hi> (sayth <hi>Origen hom.</hi> 14. <hi>in Luc.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> tempore reserata est, quo &amp; partus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus.</hi> The mothers wombe was then opened, when her child was brought forth. Tertullian <hi>lib. de resurr. carnis:</hi> speaking likewise of Christs birth: <hi>Who</hi> (sayth he) <hi>was truly holy, but the sonne of God? Who did properly open the wombe, but he which opened it being shut?</hi> The same sayth <hi>Ambrose, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>in Luc. c.</hi> 7. Neither is this any blemish to the blessed virgins perpetuall virginitie. For that is not lost nor perished by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture of the matrix, which may diuersly happen; but by the carnall knowledge of man.</p>

               <p>Absurdly also do the Papists talke of Christ his most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifice. <hi>Christ</hi> (sayth the Apostle <hi>Heb. c. 9.) was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that he might take away the sinnes of many.</hi> And <hi>Hebr. 10.

For how is Christs sacrifice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if the same be so often reiterated? How is Christ his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice one and the same, if euery pelting priest do offer vp this sacrifice? The same is contrary to the doctrine of the Fathers, which teach that the sacrifices of Christians are spiritual, and no where say, that they offer vp Christs body and bloud really. <hi>Iustin in dial. cum Tryph.</hi> saith, <hi>that prayers and praises of God are the onely acceptable sacrifices of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> With him concurreth <hi>Tertullian lib.</hi> 3. <hi>contra Marcione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But the Masse-priests continue not for euer, nor are they without father or mother, nor are they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or ending.

regard not to know the law, yet shall Gods iustice lay hold vpon them for offending the law, which they ought to haue knowne. The Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. when he would put them in mind of their miserable estate before their conuersion, saith <hi>they liued without Christ and without God in the world.</hi> As if nothing can be deuised more damnable, then to liue with out certaine knowledge of God and of Christ Iesus. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (as the Apostle saith <hi>Ephes. 4.) walke in the vanitie of their mind, hauing their vnderstanding darkned, and being strangers from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardnesse of their heart:</hi> which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the miserable state of Christians, that liue like Gentils without the true knowledge of Christ Iesus.

How hapneth it they see not their wretched state? <hi>Absque notitia sui Creatoris, omnis homo pecus est: Without the knowledge of God, a man is no better then a beast,</hi> saith <hi>Hierome epist.</hi> 3.</p>

Therein also doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare some Papists wonderfull simplicitie, that séeing the contention of their Doctors, do not vnderstand their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; and séeeing their differences and vncertaintie of popish Religion, do notwithstanding sticke fast in the filthy dregs, and abhominable corruptions thereof.</p>

               <p>In <hi>England</hi> also the Spaniards, albeit but few, began to play their partes, offering violence to diuers mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and attempting the chastitie both of matrons and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.

In his enterprise against <hi>Algier,</hi> he lost a great part of his armie and fléete, and returned la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rather with scorne then spoile. In the end when he saw nothing succéed, he crept contemptibly into a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and died as some say crazed in his braine, and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriously.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> in his memorials to his sonne confesseth, that he spent 5594. millions of duckets in 33. yeares, and yet neuer reaped any thing for his labour, but anguish and sorrow. His noble actes by his sonne <hi>Charles,</hi> were written

in a blanke booke. His first attempt was against the Mores in the Ile of <hi>Zerbi.</hi> But therein his fléete was taken and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and his whole armie slaine or discomfited. Leauing the <hi>Turkes,</hi> he thought to trie his manhood against Christians. But in his warres he behaued himself so manfully, that thinking to subdue the Low cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by force, which yéelded vnto him for loue, in the end he lost halfe of that which he possessed before. Purposing to make a conquest of <hi>England,</hi> he was himselfe conquered and ouercome by a woman. Bragging of his inuincible fleete, he found himselfe and his fléete vanquished by small forces.

               <p>THat the yoke of Antichristian and popish gouernment is grieuous and intolerable to all Christians, we haue made it apparent by diuers particulars. But could any Christian indure it; yet Christian Kings and Princes haue least reason to do it.

                  </gap>, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard which they incurre, is of farre greater consideration, then if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same should be offered to priuate persons. And yet no man runneth into greater hazard, nor receiueth greater wrongs at the Popes hands, and by means of his doctrine and gouernment, then Christian Kings and princes. For first they are in no assurance of their state: and secondly, they runne in daunger to lose their liues, if they receiue the Popes authoritie and doctrine within their kingdomes: Of which two we will speake seuerally and in order.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> Emperours take an oath of fealtie and subiection to the Pope. <hi>Romani prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> (saith he) <hi>orthodoxae fidei professores, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of Rome professing the faith, with feruour of faith and readie deuotion honoring the holy-church of Rome, whose head is Christ our Redeemer, and the Bishop of Rome our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers Vicar, haue not thought it an indignitie to submit their heades, and to bind themselues by oath, from whom they haue receiued, not onely the approbation of their person assumed vnto the imperiall dignitie, but also vnction, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and the crowne of the Empire.</hi> But if the Emperor receiue his Empire from the Pope, then may he be deposed by the Pope. And if he take an oath of fealtie and obedience to the Pope, then is he forsworne, if he obey not his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and censures, as the Canonists teach.</p>
               <p>Likewise the same Pope affirmeth, that the Emperor<note place="margin">Clem. Rom. de iureiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando.</note> is bound by oath to roote out the enemies of the Romish church, and not to make any confederation or league with any enemie of the Pope, or any suspected vnto him. Which being graunted, it followeth, that no King or Emperour can make peace with others, then such as the Pope liketh, and that he is to make warres vpon such as he misliketh. A matter which now presently much concerneth all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. For if the Spaniards or other the Popes vassals haue respect to this law, as no question but they haue, then all capitulations betwixt them, and Christian princes of our profession are made by his dispensation, and to hold no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then it shall stand with the Popes good liking.</p>
               <p>The Author of the glosse vpon the same chapter doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so plainely declare, that the Emperour is subiect to the Pope. <hi>Modo quaero,</hi> (sayth he) <hi>nonne Iesus voluit, &amp;c. Now I aske</hi> (saith he) <hi>whether Christ Iesus would not, that these
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:25623:102"/>
Princes, to whom he hath giuen temporall iurisdiction, &amp;c. should be in some sort subiect vnto his Vicar, that is, to the Bishop of Rome: and whether he would not, that these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should giue oath to the Bishop of Rome; and whether he would not, that they should submit their heads to the same Bishop. VVhereunto Clement aunswereth in the text, that they should.</hi> And very plaine it is, that this was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Clement, séeing he determineth, that the Emperor ought to take an oath <hi>of fealtie and obedience: fidelitatis &amp; obedientiae:</hi> but if he sweare fealtie and obedience, then is he to shew himselfe obedient, and the Pope may punish him, if he sweare false. So we sée, that if the Popes law hold, then the Emperor for his Empire is tenant at the Popes will, and may hold it no longer, then he continueth in his obedience, vnlesse he will either refuse to sweare, or be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne.</p>
               <p>In the chapter <hi>Pastoralis Clement. de sent. &amp; re indicata:</hi> the Pope declareth, <hi>that he hath superioritie ouer the Empire, and that in the vacancie of the Empire himselfe ought to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Emperour.</hi> Thereupon also he contradicteth the Emperors procéeding, and declareth the Emperours sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against <hi>Robert</hi> king of <hi>Sicilie</hi> to be void, and without effect. But if the Emperour cannot procéede against rebels, but that his sentence shall be reuersed by the Pope; then is he the Popes vassall and subiect, and cannot longer hold the crowne, then it shall please the Pope. Neither may other princes looke for greater fauour at the Popes hands, then the Emperor.</p>

                  <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight in the Chapter, <hi>Vnam sanctam. extr. com. de maiorit. &amp; obedient.</hi> doth expressely determine, that the Pope hath both swords, and that he hath power both to make kings, and to depose them. <hi>Spiritualis potestas pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem terrenam instituere habet, &amp; iudicare, si bona non fuerit.</hi> That is, <hi>the spirituall power hath right to ordaine the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power, and to iudge the same, if it be not good.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>if the earthly power go astray, the same must be iudged by the spirituall power</hi> That is, by the Pope.

               <p>Now if any man except and say, that this is not the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Rome that now is, he shal shew himself to be but a nouice, that thinketh that any Papist dare depart from the doctrine of his holy fathers decretals.

No doubt therefore but one time or other the French king, that is the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> also, will require satisfaction of the Pope and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that did him this wrong. But in the meane while we may sée in this fact of Iulius the arrogance of the Popes, that take vpon them to depose kings at their pleasure, and to giue away their kingdomes.</p>
               <p>This seditious course of the Pope in sentencing kings, was also the sole pretence almost of the Leaguers rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stirres against <hi>Henry</hi> the third in <hi>France.</hi> For when the <hi>Iebusites</hi> and their faction had declared, that the king was
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:25623:107"/>
iustly deposed, then did the rebels take armes against him, and ceassed not to pursue him to the death. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> also for the same cause ayded them, and concurred with them. Likewise the execution of the Popes sentence against <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> was the cause both of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt of his subiects, and of the warres made against him by the prince of Parma and the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Such a firebrand of warres do we find the Popes sentence to be.</p>
               <p>No sooner was Henry the eight, king of <hi>England,</hi> pronounced excommunicate by <hi>Paule</hi> the third, but he sent Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> to stirre vp the <hi>French</hi> King to inuade his kingdome. Afterward when he saw, that the French could not be stirred to execute his pleasure, he caused diuerse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions to be raysed against him by the seditious clamours of Masse-priests, Monkes, and Friars, both in York-shire and Lincolne-shire, and other parts of <hi>England.

               <p>The like course held <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> that wicked Pope, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of pious memorie: for he did not onely declare her <hi>depriued of her kingdome,</hi> but by all meanes sought actually to depriue her of it: and that first by dealing with the French and Spanish, by force of arms to inuade her realmes, and afterward stirring vp and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Malcontents and Rebels, to set the realme in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion by ciuill warres. <hi>Hierome Catena</hi> in the discourse of the life of this impious <hi>Pius,</hi> sheweth: <hi>how he perswaded the Spaniard, that he could not otherwise better secure the Low-countries, then by ouerthrowing the Queene of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> He declareth further, how he induced the French to take part against her.

and others ceassed vpon all occasions to séeke her hurt and destruction.</p>
               <p>This therefore is a most cleare case, that no Christian king can be in safetie, as long as he suffereth <hi>Iebusites</hi> and Masse-priests to aduance the Popes authoritie, and to preach seditiously, that the people hath power to put Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of their royall seate. It is very dangerous also to foster any man within the Realme, that beléeueth this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious doctrine.</p>
               <p>True it is, that Papists cast many colours to hide the deformities of this doctrine: but these colours are easily washed away, as not being able to abide any weather. First, they alleage, that diuerse popish Princes haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed their kingdomes quietly without molestation. But we are able to shew more Princes of late time troubled by the Popes practises, then they are able to shew, to haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued peaceably by them. Furthermore, the reason why Popes do not trouble all, is, because it were not safe for them to fall out with too many at one time, and not because their ouer large authoritie is not preiudiciall to all.

               <p>Others alleage, that the Pope procéedeth onely against heretikes and notorious offendors. But that is a most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and palpable vntruth: for no man is more eagerly prosecuted, then religious, pious, and godly Christians, as the executions of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> do shew. And if they will not confesse it true in Christians of our time: yet can they not deny it in the times of the Emperors, <hi>Henry</hi> the third, fourth, and fifth, of <hi>Fredericke</hi> the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and of <hi>Lewis of Bauier,</hi> who made such confessions of their faith, being declared heretickes, as the Popes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues could not contradict: and yet did the Popes excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, and sought to depose them as heretikes and tyrants. Likewise did they prosecute other kings and Emperours, albeit consenting with them in matters of faith. <hi>Henrie</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> of late was cruelly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:25623:108"/>
and murdred by the popish faction: and yet was he very superstitiously addicted to popish religion. Suppose then, that the Pope would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> against none but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes and tyrants; yet it is an easie matter and very vsual for him to picke quarels, and to impute heresie and tyranny and great crimes to most innocent men.</p>
               <p>Finally they may say, that the Pope is alwayes assisted by Gods holy spirit, and cannot erre in his sentences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and deposing of Princes, especially for matters of religion. But this allegation is most brutish, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and refuted by euident experience and most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofes that teach vs, that he is rather led by the spirit of Sathan, who was a murtherer from the beginning, and is the author of rebellions and troubles, then by the spirit of God, that is the God of peace, and author of concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let all Princes that liue vnder the Popes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, consider well the former reasons and examples, and look into their owne danger and slippery estate.

               </head>
               <p>THis corollary or conclusion, is necessarily deduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of Papists, concerning the Popes power
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:25623:109"/>
in deposing of Kings and Princes. For if it be lawfull for the Pope to depose a Prince fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his royall throne, then is it lawfull for the Pope to command any assassin or cutthrote to murder him, séeing it is not likely that a magnanimous King wil yéelo to so base a companion as the Pope, nor giue vp his Crowne without force and compulsion.</p>
               <p>The same is also proued by the general practise of Popes, by the wordes of the Popes bulles, by the doctrine of their principall followers, and by diuers particular facts and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts both of Popes and their wicked instruments and agents. For first we find, that those Popes that haue gone about to depose Kings, haue also vsed all meanes to destroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to cut their throtes. The which may be verified by the procéeding of <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth against <hi>Henry</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, of <hi>Paschalis</hi> and <hi>Vrban</hi> against his sonne, of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> against <hi>Fridericke Barbarossa,</hi> of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth and <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth against <hi>Fridericke</hi> the second, of <hi>Clement</hi> the fift against <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lucembourg,</hi> whom he caused to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in the sacrament.

For why did they raise rebellion, moue warres, and suborne secret traitors to attempt against the persons of Kings, but that they meant to giue leaue to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate cutthrotes to kill them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the words of the Popes buls, and the doctrine of their wicked agents doth notoriously manifest their leud and damnable purposes touching this point. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7<note place="margin">Platina, in Greg. 7.</note> doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Someruile</hi> was so resolute in his purpose, and so iocund, that he could not kéepe his owne counsell secret, but would néedes professe to his friends, <hi>that he was determined to kill the Queene:</hi> but being detected, he wilfully made away him selfe, to saue the hangmans labor. <hi>Arden</hi> was executed for the same treason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir William Stanley</hi> and <hi>Iaques</hi> his Lieutenant, with the helpe of two Jesuites called <hi>Holt</hi> and <hi>Sherwood,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other traitorous English Masse-priests, perswaded one <hi>Patricke Collen</hi> an Jirsh man, and a desperate fencer, to go ouer secretly into <hi>England</hi> and to murder the Queen, shewing by what means he might do it, without any great danger. To encourage him the better, they gaue him thirty pound sterling, for to put himself in order and to defray his charges, and loaded him with large promises of further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and preferment: all which the man being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded did voluntarily confesse, as the acts and processe do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and was therefore condemned and adiudged to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edmund York</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> being charged with the like treason, confessed also, that partly by the perswasion of <hi>Holt</hi> the Jebusite, who abused the consecrated host, to induce them and resolue them, and partly vpon hope of an assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fortie thousand crownes shewed them by <hi>Hugh Owen,</hi> they promised to vndertake the killing of the Quèen. They said further, that <hi>D. Gifford, D. Worthington,</hi> &amp; that vnworthy knight <hi>Sir William Stanley,</hi> together with diuers other English fugitiues beyond the sea, were acquainted
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:25623:114"/>
with this their resolution and practise, and encoraged them by all meanes to go forward. Afterward, when these sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Jebusites and Masse priests, and their abbettors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that by the sword they could not take away the Quéenes life, then they set on empoysoners to do the fait.

                  <hi>Walpoole</hi> deliuered a poyson to <hi>Edmund Squire,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was agréed, that he should annoint the pummell of the Quéenes saddle. He coniured the man with all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent adiurations he could deuise. He caused him to receiue the sacrament, and to damne himselfe if he did not both meane truly, and resolutely execute that which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. In the end he promised him the state of a glorious saint in heauen, if he died in the performance of the act. The which things the partie himselfe constantly confessed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all torture, and persisted in his confession to the end. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle therefore doth it auaile <hi>Martin Aray,</hi> and <hi>Fitherbert,</hi> or rather <hi>Fitzputain, Parsons,</hi> or others to denie it, grounding themselues vpon the violence of the rackmasters, as they call them, and the reuocation of his confession at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. For neither was the man euer put to the racke, nor euer did he recant that which he had sayd before of <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole</hi> and his practise: whereof, the first is testified by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like acts, the second by infinite witnesses yet liuing. Are they not then both shamelesse and witlesse, that vpon méere fancies and hearesayes deny publicke actes, confessions of parties, depositions of witnesses, plaine presumptions, and most euident proofes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if Christian princes will either beléeue the

doctrine and grounds, or looke into the practise and procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this Satanicall race of king-killers &amp; empoysoners; I doubt not but they will prudently beware of them, and neither suffer them nor their abettors to come néere them, or to remaine within their dominions. If they haue not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto looked into matters, which so neere concerne their liues and safetie, I pray God they may yet do it in time. Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being a most mild prince, was told that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> and his faccion thought well of her, and meant her no harme. But wise men considering the maner of her death, and effects of some drugs that are wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerate the mouth, to gréeue the stomacke, to bereue men of sence, to worke a stipticity and stupidity, and the concourse, and whispering, and preparations of the popish faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of her sicknesse, do much feare that she was not well dealt withall. I pray God reueale the truth, and grant al others by her example to beware of the Popes and Jebusits most dangerous practises, which neuer cease wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mischiefe if they may haue fit oportunitie.</p>

               <p>For first the Pope shareth the Kings reuenues, claiming tenths, first fruites, subsidies, confirmation and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

and now in <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> and other popish countries, know they are intolerable, and no way inferior to the Kings reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.

The absolution of King <hi>Iohn</hi> had like to haue cost him the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, not the King but the Pope is King of priests and ecclesiasticall persons. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. in the chap. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricis de immunit. eccles. in</hi> 6. doth excommunicate both Kings and others, that impose taxes and subsidies vpon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his treatise <hi>De exemptione clericorum cap. I.</hi> setteth downe these propositions. <hi>In causis Ecclesiasticis liberi sunt clericiiure diuino à secularium principum potestate.</hi> That is, <hi>In Ecclesiastical causes clerkes are free from the commaund of secular princes, by the law of God.</hi> And by ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth all matters which concerne the church, and which by hooke or crooke the Popes haue drawne to their owne cognition. Againe he sayth, <hi>Non possunt Clerici à Iudice seculariiudicari, estiamsi leges ciuiles non seruent.</hi> That is, <hi>Clerks are not to be iudged of secular Iudges, albeit they keep not his temporall lawes.</hi> His third proposition is this: <hi>Bona clericorum, tam ecclesiastica, quàm secularia libera sunt, ac meritò esse debent, à tributis principum secularium.</hi> That is, <hi>The goods of clerkes, whether they belong to the Church, or be temporal, are free from tributes of princes, and so ought to be.</hi> He sayth <hi>also, that secular princes, in respect of clerkes, are not soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne princes, and that therefore clerkes are not bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them.</hi> Now, how is the King absolute in his kingdome, if he haue neither power ouer the persons of the clerks, nor their goods?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> in his aphorismes, <hi>In verbo, Clericus:</hi> in his book
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:25623:116"/>
first printed, and alleaged by him that wrote the <hi>Franc dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> hath these words: <hi>Clerici rebellio in regem, non est crimen laesae maiestatis, quia non est subditus regi. The rebellion of a clerk against the King, is no treason, because he is not the kings sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</hi> This is plaine dealing, and sheweth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king is no king of the Clergie, where the Popes lawes beare sway. But because these words be some what too plaine, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in a later edition of these aphorismes set out at <hi>Venice,</hi> they haue for their owne ease cut out the words, albeit in effect Bellarmine and others teach so much.</p>
               <p>Their practise also declareth that this is their meaning: for <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> stoutly resisted <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and his<note place="margin">Mat Paris. in Hen. 2.</note> parliament enacting, <hi>that clerkes offending against the kings lawes, should answer before the kings Iustices.</hi> Further, he would not agree that clerkes lay=fée should come in trial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus quartus</hi> did enterdite the state of <hi>Florence,</hi> for that they had executed the Archbishop of <hi>Pisa</hi> notoriously taken in a conspiracie against the State. <hi>Xistus, quòd sacrato viro, &amp; Archiepiscopo it a foede interfecto Cardinalem quoque cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuum fecissent, Hieronymo instigante grauissimum Florentinis (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris omnibus interdictus) bellu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intulit,</hi> saith <hi>Onuphrius:</hi> That is, <hi>Sixtus warred vpon the Florentines, and enterdited them for that they had killed the Archbishop of Pisa being a priest, and layd hands on a cardinall.</hi> And yet he declareth they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the conspiracie against <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>Laurence de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> that then ruled the State.</p>
               <p>This was also the greatest quarrell of the Pope against <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> for that he caused the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> to be killed, being culpable of most enormous trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against him. Now what can Kings do against their subiects, if they may not punish them offending in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Popes do draw many temporall matters from the cognition of the King, to themselues and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. <hi>c. quoniam. de Immunitat. Eccles. in</hi> 6. doth excommunicate all those <hi>that do hinder matters to be
<pb facs="tcp:25623:116"/>
brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> triall of temporall iudges to Ecclesiasticall courts,</hi> and namely those, <hi>that will not suffer all contracts, confirmed by oathes, to be tried before Ecclesiasticall iudges.</hi> By which meanes almost all causes were brought before them, and the Kings iurisdiction almost stopped and suspended. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> therfore, to restraine these incrochme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, made the law of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> putting them out of his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that wold not be tried by his lawes. Is it not strange then, that Christian princes should suffer such companions to vsurpe their authoritie, and not onely in causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, but also in temporall to beare them selues as iudges.</p>
               <p>Finally they deny, that Christian Princes haue power either to make Ecclesiasticall lawes, or to reforme abuses in the Church, or to gouerne the Church concerning exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall matters. All papists do so distinguish betwixt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical and politicke gouernement, that they exclude tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes from the gouernement of the Church, and make them subiect to the Pope. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 7. determineth, that <hi>temporall Princes are no gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then Christian Princes loose part of their reuenues, and part of their iurisdiction, and are quite excluded, both from the gouernement of the Church, and also disposing of the persons and goods of Ecclesiasticall persons; most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent it is, that such Princes as admit the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are either but halfe kings, or else not so much, loosing more then halfe their authoritie, by the Popes incroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>How contrarie this is to the doctrine of the Apostles and ancient fathers, we néede not here dispute. <hi>S. Peter</hi> teacheth Christians <hi>to honour the King:</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> exhorteth <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> soule to be subiect to the higher powers.</hi> Now what greater dishonour can be offered to a King, then to take away his authoritie? And how are they subiect, that pay the King nothing, and claime exemption from his gouernement? Our Sauiour willeth all to giue to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that which is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:25623:117"/>
due to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> payed tribute to <hi>Caesar.</hi> But his false successors pay no tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> but take tribute of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and challenge it as due to them selues. Nay, they haue against all right vsurped his imperiall citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and released all clerkes from temporall Princes obedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Christians honored the Emperour, as the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Scapulam</note> 
                  <hi>next man in honour to God, and onely inferiour to God. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus Imperatorem</hi> (saith he) <hi>sic, quomodo &amp; nobis licet, &amp; ipsi expedit, vt hominem a Deo secundum, &amp; quicquid est à Deo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequutum, solo Deo minorem. Chrysostome</hi> sheweth, that the Apostles wordes <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. concerne clerkes and religious men, as well as lay men.</p>
               <p>The same is also contrarie to the practise of the Church vnder the Law, and vnder the Gospell, and derogatorie to the Kings authoritie. For both vnder the Law, and when Emperors began to professe Christian religion, they made lawes for the Church, and reformed Ecclesiasticall abuses, as both Scriptures, and the lawes of the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles</hi> testifie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> this authoritie is plainly vsurped by the Pope and his followers. For vntill <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth his time, who by force and armes preuailed more, then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; we find, that the clergie and Church wa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> gouerned by Christian princes, and their lawes.</p>
               <p>Finally the same is disgracefull to Kings, and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to subiects, and most vnreasonable. Disgracefull it is to Kings to loose their royalties, and to be made subiect to forreiners. Burdensome it is to good subiects, vpon whom the whole burden is laid, and they exempted which are best able to beare. The <hi>Germaines</hi> in their grieuances, <hi>Grauam.</hi> 28. shew, <hi>that the charge of the warre against the Turke is laid wholy on lay-mens shoulders.</hi> Finally, it is no reason, that those should liue vnder the Kings protection, that neither pay him tribute, nor acknowledge his authoritie.</p>
               <p>But of the vnreasonablenesse of these incrochments we shall haue occasion to dispute elswhere. Here it is sufficient to shew, that the Popes vsurpations, exactions <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> whole
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:25623:117"/>
authoritie is preiudiciall to Kings, &amp; vntollerable to their subiectes.</p>
               <p>Be wise therefore O ye Kings of the earth, and serue <hi>Christ Iesus:</hi> but beware that in stead of <hi>Christ,</hi> ye serue not Antichrist. And you that are fréed by the preaching of the Gospell from the bondage of the Popes traditions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, take héed that you suffer not your selues to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled againe in his snares, &amp; brought againe into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.

               <p>The man was borne in an obscure village in Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire: his putatiue father was called <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> a poore Blacksmith, of the race, or at least qualitie of <hi>Vulcan:</hi> for he was matched to <hi>Parsons</hi> his mother, a woman scarce so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,<note place="margin">Her husband tooke a filthy dilease of her, of which the poore man died.

               <p>Certes if <hi>Haywood</hi> was not his father, then was he much deceiued, kéeping <hi>Parsons</hi> at schoole, and bringing him vp as his sonne.

               <p>What religion was in him, it may appeare, for that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he tooke on him a religion, which he had a litle before forsworne.

               <p>Departing out of the countrey, hee went not away empty handed. For he carried away diuers summes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which he had receiued of his schollers friends, without rendring accompt.

The seculer priests charge him with mispending the almes that is bestowed on the english Seminaries, vpon his intelligencers, &amp; spies, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage, and vpon his priuat pleasures.

               <p>And this, both himselfe, and his brother and friends did so greedily looke for, that on a time being aduised to weare a péece of scarlet before his stomacke, and giuing order, that a péece might be brought from the marchant, his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse brother thinking the time of his aduancement had bene come, caused as much scarlet to be brought to him as would make him a Cardinals robes.

                  <hi>William Browne alias Ch.

Finally the mans traitorous practises against the Queene and his countrey, in many volumes cannot sufficiently be desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phred. His first comming into <hi>England</hi> was to make a side, and to moue rebellion. And that is prooued by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties graunted <hi>anno</hi> 1580. <hi>Petatur</hi> (saith he) <hi>a S. domino nostro, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Let it be desired of our most holy Lord the Pope, that the bull declaratorie of Pius the fift against Elizabeth and her adherents, be vnderstood in this manner, that the same bull shall alwayes bind her and all heretikes,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:25623:123"/>
but not (Romish) Catholikes, as matters doe now stand, but onely then, when the bull may publikely be put in execution.</hi> By this facultie being granted, then it appeareth, that the bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> against the Quéene and her subiects, and that <hi>Parsons</hi> came to stirre vp false Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, or rather false traitors, to put it in execution, as soone as occasion should be offered. Now according to the tenor of his faculties, the fellow ceased not to rake in the coles of mens discontented humours, and to make a partie against the Queene. The papists saw he dealt so openly, that they feared, least if the fire tooke, a number of them should be burned in the flames. Such was the feare of the wisest of them, that they told him plainely, that if he retired not himselfe, they would discouer him to her Maiesties officers.</p>
               <p>Being thus forced more then halfe against his will to depart out of <hi>England,</hi> yet ceased he not to procure vs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the king now raigning can tell, and his libell against the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> that seemeth to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the kings title, doth manifestly proue. Nay in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Earle of <hi>Angus</hi> he doth plainely confesse, that at that time he was for the kings title, and sought presently to set it on foote, without longer staying for the Queenes death.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> he encouraged the <hi>D. of Guise</hi> to come with an army into <hi>England,</hi> not forgetting in the meane while to aduance the treason of <hi>Parry</hi> &amp; <hi>Sauage.</hi> There also he was acquainted, by the meanes of <hi>Ballard,</hi> with <hi>Babingtons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie. Neither is it to be doubted, but he knew of friar <hi>Sammiers</hi> comming to the kings mother, of which ensued the ruine of her, as the authour of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Catechisme testifieth. It is said also, that he caused 500. crownes to be deliuered to <hi>Ch. Paget</hi> to come ouer into <hi>England</hi> to treat with the Earle of <hi>N.</hi> whereof his destruction ensued not long after.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Flanders</hi> he sought also to draw the <hi>D. of Parma</hi> into quarrell with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> offering him the Lady
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:25623:124"/>
                  <hi>Arbella,</hi> and the crowne of <hi>England</hi> for his sonne. But he was no more able to performe his offer then the deuill, that promised to giue all the kingdomes of the earth to <hi>Christ.</hi> That packe being broken, he solicited the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> against <hi>England anno</hi> 1588. ayding <hi>Card. Allen</hi> to make that most execrable libell, which he titleth <hi>an exhortation to the Nobility and people of England and Ireland,</hi> which containeth all the disgrace that could be deuised, both against the Quéene, &amp; her subiects. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he did in deuising of that traitorous libell, one <hi>W. Br. aliâs Pag.</hi> chargeth him, that hee holpe to print it, and gaue diuers copies to his friends.</p>
               <p>Departing out of the low countries, he committed the managing of matters to one <hi>Holt,</hi> a man of his owne socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and confrairy of traytours. If then <hi>Holt</hi> was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the practises of <hi>Yorke, Williams,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> for killing the Quéene, as he is charged by <hi>W. Br. aliâs Ch. Pag.</hi> or with <hi>Heskets</hi> trecherous agency with the Earle of Darby; then no doubt, but <hi>R. Parsons</hi> was made priuie therewith also, seeing he was but as an inferiour sphere concurring with <hi>Parsons,</hi> that like <hi>primum mobile</hi> drew with him all inferior traytors, and made all matters of treason to be taken in hand.</p>
               <p>Residing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> his onely purpose was, to set this land in combustion. To worke a detestation of her Maiestie, and of the <hi>English</hi> nation in the mindes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he caused a most slanderous libell set forth before in Latin, to be translated into <hi>Spanish</hi> by one <hi>Ribadineira</hi> a man of his owne trayterous order, adding thereunto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers slaunderous and most vntrue reports of his owne, auouching his owne lies vpon the credit of Sanders being now dead. And that this is true, not onely his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science doth witnesse, but that ribald <hi>Ribadineira</hi> must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, if he be aliue, and will testifie truth. For to draw the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> into the party, he set out a most fond booke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:25623:124"/>
séeking to depriue the right heires, and endeuoring to bring vs vnder the captiuitie of strangers: to which end also he caused diuers of the English nation residing in <hi>Spaine</hi> to subscribe to that title.</p>
               <p>With the helpe of <hi>Creswell</hi> and others his adherents, he caused diuers trecherous inuectiues to be published against her Maiesty &amp; the State; and that partly vnder the names of <hi>Andreas Philopater, Didimus Veridicus,</hi> and such like counterfet names, and partly without names.</p>
               <p>By his, and other his traitorous consorts solicitation, King <hi>Philip</hi> the second sent forth a fléet to sea: of which, two attempts followed: the one about the yeare 1598. in which diuers ships by stresse of wether were wracked on the coast of <hi>Spaine,</hi>

And so earnest was the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> in setting forth this fleete against <hi>England,</hi> that at one time, returning to himselfe out of a trance, the first words he spoke, were, <hi>Whether is the Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantado gone for England?</hi> At another time, being at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Finally, it is auerred by the secular priests, that <hi>Parsons</hi> had a finger in the rebellions of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Neither is it to be doubted, but that he &amp; his agent <hi>Creswel</hi> were acquainted with the enterprise of <hi>D.

               <p>A Goose (they say) may be knowne by a feather.

For albeit he promise vs but one Warneword, yet hath he sent vs a whole fardle of idle words and fantasticall fooleries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as admonitions and warnings are sent to friends, and not to enemies; so might he haue done well to haue giuen some admonitions to the bougerly boyes of the English seminaries, that suffer themselues to be abused too shamefully by the bougeronicall Masse priests, to the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their nation; and not to vs, that regard not witlesse admonitions a straw.

               <p>Thirdly, his whole labour being spent in iangling and bangling about some pild matters of his popish paltry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; he must shew how all that nastie geare will come within the compasse of his title, vnlesse he will haue the same throwne out among the waste of his idle inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, his running vpon the letter in the titles of his <hi>Warneword, Wardword, Wastword,</hi> and in his mentioning of <hi>Watchword</hi> doth shew, that there is more rime then reason in his booke, and doth presage, that we should rather
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:25623:126"/>
haue ratling words, then sound reason. He sayth, that the <hi>VVarneword containeth the issue of three treatises.</hi> And yet he onely handleth two chapters of eight, beside other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies, seldome daring to giue the true issue, taking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Papists for Catholickes, and popery for truth: which is denied. Is it then like that he meaneth truth, that falsifieth his word so grossely in the first words of his booke?</p>
               <p>After that he talketh of a reiection <hi>of an insolent and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting minister, masked with the letters O. E.</hi> and of certaine shifts and deceits, as he pretendeth of ours. But herein his friends complaine, that his eyes were either out or not at home. For if he had looked vpon himselfe, that commeth forth masked with <hi>N. D.</hi> which letters with the helpe of <hi>O. E.</hi> come neare Noddey: he would not haue found fault with me for the same matter. Howbeit to prouoke him to shew his bastardly face, I haue bene content to leaue all the foure letters to him alone, and plainly to set downe my name, promising that I will take him to taske, in what forme soeuer he turneth himselfe into, if it be not into the shape of a clew of packthréed, which is endlesse, and of no good goust. In the meane while, if he had not bene the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Satan, he would not haue made a iest at the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the word of God, which is an office not refused by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, nor by holy fathers of the Church, nor by any, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idolatrous priests of Baal.

Now I will onely tell him, that it becommeth not him to obiect <hi>insolencie, vanting, shifting and deceit</hi> to any other.

For why should I helpe him, that pronounceth sentence against himselfe, by his owne iudgement, while he remained among vs? And now no doubt but in his owne conscience he is condemned, knowing that it is idolatry to giue diuine honour to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords body, and to the images of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and heresie to hold, that a man can liue without al sinne, or at the least to fulfill the law perfectly.

               <p>AGainst all our aduersaries accusations, beside particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar defences, we haue these generall exceptions for the most part: first we say, of matters criminall that we are cleare.

speake for his prince and country, when he like a traitorous knaue without commission or allowance taketh to himselfe liberty to speake for notorious traitors &amp; publike enemies? Thirdly, it is a matter ridiculous for an enemy to accuse men of bitternesse and bloody cruelty, of slanderous accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and sedition, and yet to bring neither proofe nor sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition to conuince them. This therefore is rather a tricke of a scurrilous rayler, then a graue accuser: and such termes <hi>Tully</hi> in his oration <hi>pro Caelio,</hi> calleth rather <hi>railing and scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> then <hi>accusing.</hi> Fourthly he sheweth himselfe an absurd fellow, to talke either <hi>of bitter and bloodie pamphlets,</hi> or of <hi>odious calumniations,</hi> or of <hi>bloodshed and crueltie,</hi> or of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes,</hi> when as himselfe is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We are therefore to beséech his knaueship, séeing he pleadeth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and traitors and heretickes, to giue vs leaue to speake for our countrey, our Soueraigne, our Religion and libertie. Fiftly, Catholikes are they, <hi>which beleeue and hold that which the Catholicke church in old time did vniuersally hold,</hi> as sayth <hi>Vincentius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Sixthly, when we speake against Papists, we meane properly the factious adherents to the Pope and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Parsons</hi> his crew of seditious archipresvyterial and diabolical practisers against the state: against whom when we discourse, our whole intention is to saue, &amp; not to spill blood, which they séeke to do, and will, if they be not speedily restrained. Finally, séeing <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> is so braue a disputer, we must pray him to bring good arguments, or else to lay aside his great bombasted Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiticall words of <hi>slander and calumniation.</hi> He may do wel also, to shew vs the difference betwéene <hi>slaunder</hi> and <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation,</hi> which he in great heate hath distinguished, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being so excellent a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Speaking of sir <hi>Francis Hastings</hi> in his Epistle to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he would gladly fasten vpon him a suspicion, <hi>as if he desired some diuidend of the liuings of Papists.</hi> And againe, 1. <hi>encont. c.</hi> 11. he chargeth him and other knights with dayly féeding vpon papisticall fellows goods.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:25623:128"/>
and promotions in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> which they hope will be conquered daily. But their ambitious desire is like a hungry mans dreame, that thinketh he eateth, and yet ariseth in the morning sore ahungred. In his table he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>I am poore &amp; needy,</hi> but if he had not bene a poore and needy pamphleter, he would haue bene more wary, then thus desperatly to lie vpon the credit of his intelligencer. For it is well knowne, that <hi>Sir Fr. Hastings</hi> liueth in hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reputation without desire of any mans goods. I, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I had no preferment of the Church, yet could I liue of my patrimony. Neither of vs, nor any knight professing the Gospell, doth liue in such estate, that he being a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Friar by his profession, and by birth a poore blacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smithes wiues sonne, may well obiect either neede, or grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die scraping for other mens goods vnto vs. Nay we are so farre from desiring the goods of papists, that we wish them, as <hi>Saint Augustine epist.</hi> 50. did the <hi>Donatists, that they were Catholikes and honest men, and so we would not onely leaue them that is theirs, but giue them also part of that is ours.</hi> With vs they deale as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did with <hi>S.

Which if the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> and the bloody Inquisitors would permit to men of our profession, they would accompt it a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.

This mans destruction will come quickly, and he shall suddenly be broken in peeces, and shall find no further remedie.</hi> As for the folly, falshood and vanitie he talketh of, they are so surely fastened vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he shall neuer put them vpon me. To conuince me offolly, he hath alledged the words of <hi>Tully,</hi> that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him <hi>a noddy orator,</hi> as he saith, <hi>that alledgeth such matter as maketh no lesse for his aduersarie, then for himselfe.</hi> But if this be the part of a noddy, then is <hi>Parsons</hi> a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold noddy, who alledgeth almost nothing, but it may with better reason be reiected vpon himselfe, then cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others: as for example, where he talketh of heresie, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, bloody pamphlets, folly and such predominant humors and qualities in himselfe. Against me the words of Tully make nothing. For albeit I do call him noddy that taketh for his deuise <hi>N.

                  </gap>, which I do not meane to borrow at this time. Againe, if he may come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stage with the maske of <hi>N.

E?</hi> The lawes are<note place="margin">1. ff. quod quisque iuris.</note> plaine that no man may refuse to stand to that law, by which himselfe meaneth to receiue aduantage. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more talking of two letters, where I say <hi>he is a man of two or three letters;</hi> he answereth but by halfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is like to rest a noddy, and a man of three letters, that is <hi>Fur,</hi> and the rather for that like a thiefe he came into <hi>England,</hi> entring not by the doore, but stealing in some other way with picklocke faculties, and treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous instructions from the Pope. Finally the man sheweth himselfe to be, not an orator, but rather a foolish grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that calleth consonants the material part, &amp; vowels the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:25623:130"/>
formall part of words. For if this were true; then should no word be compounded of vowels, nor should vowels stand without consonants, nor should forme and matter be proper to bodies, but common to words also, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Thus we sée how <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> since he ran out of <hi>England</hi> hath outrun both grammer and logike, &amp; is now learning to spell <hi>N. D.</hi> It may be if he passe Tiburne clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he wil shortly enter into his Puerilis, and learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue <hi>stans puer ad mensam,</hi> or percase <hi>pendens in patibulo.</hi> To conuince me of <hi>apparant falshood,</hi> he saith, <hi>albeit he might remit himselfe to a multitude of examples in the encounters ensuing, yet he will shew one for a proofe of the ministers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this kind.</hi> But whosoeuer list to compare my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers with his examples, shall find that his multitude of examples doth shew the multiplicitie of his vanities, and that his whole <hi>Warneword,</hi> is but a fardell of foolery. As for this one example, which he alleadgeth, it may serue to iustifie my honest dealing throughout the whole booke, and to shew, that he hath neither wit, nor honesty. In my reply I charge him, that he hath written diuers odious chartels and bookes, both against particular men and the State, and namely, <hi>First certaine chartels against some in Oxford: Next Leicesters common-wealth. Thirdly, a libell intitled a Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of pretended feares.</hi> Fourthly, the booke set out vnder the name of <hi>Andreas Philopater:</hi> Fiftly, the Libell <hi>to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and people of England and Ireland,</hi> set out vnder <hi>Card.

For if euery one lyed, that reckned not vp all his pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pamphlets; he would bring himselfe and his owne

                     </gap> lies,</hi> for else he doth nothing. It standeth him also vpon, to shew that euery one is to take notice of his fooleries, and patcheries. For such is the howling of <hi>Parsons Houlet,</hi> and the <hi>Epistle of persecution,</hi> where he taketh that which is in question for granted. The Censure of <hi>Charke,</hi> and <hi>Discouery of Nicols</hi> do consist prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally of rayling. The Directory is stollen out of <hi>Gaspar Loarti, Granatensis</hi> &amp; others. He hath no reason therefore to brag of such bald inuentions. Where he obiecteth fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood to me, for charging him with certaine libels written against some in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and with the libell called <hi>Leicesters</hi> Common-wealth, &amp; the treatises entitled <hi>a Confutation of certaine pretended feares, &amp; Letters to the nobilitie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England and Ireland;</hi> his friends are much ashamed in his behalfe. For the stile and phrase of these bookes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Wardword,</hi> and other pamphlets confessed to be his, the testimony of diuers priests in <hi>England,</hi> that ordinarily charge him with these bookes, the confessions of some of his friends, do conuince to lie most shamefully. Nay his owne conscience doth accuse him, and conuict him. For listen, I pray you, what he answereth. <hi>I neuer heard,</hi> saith he, <hi>any man of notice and iudgement ascribe them to him before: and if I be not deceiued, other authors are knowne to haue written them.</hi> Now what is this, but to confesse that couertly, that he denyeth coldly? And what traitour or fellon, or séely fellow being charged at the barre with noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious treasons and fellonies cannot answere thus, albeit he be charged with things most manifest? For what trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor cannot say, I neuer heard any man of iudgement or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ascribe this treason vnto me? And againe; If I be not deceiued, others are knowne to haue committed this treason. But if <hi>Ro. Parsons</hi> answere no better, he will soone be conuicted and trussed for a traitor. In the meane while, he shall here onely rest conuicted of lying and foolery. Of which he may also be conuicted, in that taking on him to disproue me, where I charge him to be the authour of the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:25623:131"/>
                  <hi>Wardword,</hi> he doth afterward plainely confesse it. He doth also make me to say, that <hi>he hath written in all, eight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible treatises</hi> (which are no words of mine, but cogged in by him) and chargeth me <hi>with suppressing his bookes:</hi> where I confesse plainely, <hi>that he hath written other base and paltry pamphlets.</hi> Whosoeuer therefore will estéeme the rest of my discourse, by this against which he taketh such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, as he would haue it, may see, that as I haue dealt in all things plainely and sincerely, so this fellow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>To conuince me of <hi>ridiculous vanitie in vaunting,</hi> (as he calleth it) he alleageth nothing, but only a challenge made by me to himselfe in fiue new encounters. I do also request, if himselfe be busie about some packe or practise of treason, or els percase about some plot to win a Cardinals hat, &amp; wil not or hath no leisure to answere; that either <hi>Creswel,</hi> or some other babling <hi>Iebusite</hi> may be set forth to try his skill in this combat. But neither is it a ridiculous matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the truth, nor any vanity to challenge <hi>Parsons,</hi> or his paltry schollers, and seditious companions. Beside that, if it be vanitie in vs to challenge some few, then should <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> be a most notorious vaine fellow, that in defence of his Censure against master <hi>Charke,</hi> doth most proudly challenge the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> to dispute, and in his Wardword vanteth that we dare not to deale with him and his fellowes; <hi>Campian</hi> also challenged all commers, in his ten reasons, as if a common fencer should challenge all men at ten weapons.

And were not Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seuenth, <hi>Iulius</hi> the second, and other Popes, whom he dare not disclaime, great men of warre? Let him therefore beware, least desiring to strike others, he wound the lame souldier his founder, and the Popes his holy fathers, and himselfe, that counterfeiteth sometime to be a souldier, and calleth himselfe captaine <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> being but a cow and a coward. But it may be percase, that he accompteth it <hi>irregularitie,</hi> for a man of the Church to be a souldier: for so he seemeth to insinuare. But he is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his own canons. For albeit, to be a bastard is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, yet is it not so to be a souldier. And if it were so by the Popes laws, who (because the <hi>Iews</hi> said, <hi>it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<note place="margin">Ioan. 18.</note> for them to put any to death)</hi> do therefore exclude their clergie from iudging of matters of death; yet it is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to exact the obseruation of the Popes lawes of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when the papists do reason so absurdly from the words of the Iewes, and regard their owne constitutions nothing at all. Beside that, if such traitors as himselfe and the <hi>Iebusites</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> thinke it lawfull to beare armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their liege Souereignes; I hope he cannot disproue them that haue serued their princes against foreine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and traitors.</p>
               <p>He saith also, <hi>I haue bene a pirate.</hi> But that sheweth, he is badly informed, and worse affected, that calleth all that serue their countrey by sea, pirats. As for me, I count it honour, to be rayled on by professed enemies of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:25623:132"/>
their Prince and countrey, and shall the rather endeuour to do seruice both against enemies, traitors and railers.</p>
               <p>Further; saith he, <hi>I vnderstand, that he hath bene iudge marshall among souldiers.</hi> But while he thinketh to offer me disgrace, he saith more honour of me, then I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case haue sayd of my selfe, if I had not bene occasioned by him. For that is a place of honour, as the Auditors ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the <hi>Spanish</hi> armies can assure him. Neither is the same incompatible with my calling, although I ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the <hi>

                  </hi> in that place in the low countries, before I had any function in the Church.</p>
               <p>He is also much offended, that I haue sometime taken vpon me the trayning of yong souldiers, that were to be led against such villeines and traitors as himselfe, comming with <hi>Spainiards,</hi> and forraine enemies against their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But if he be sorie that he and his consorts could not cut his countrimens throats without resistance, I am glad, if I haue made my countrimen the more able to serue both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst common enemies, and such cut-throate traitors: and I doubt not but to vse my skil to the benefit of my country, if euer such traitors as himselfe is, offer to bring with him any bougerly <hi>Italians,</hi> or bragadocio <hi>Spaniards</hi> against <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proceedeth and saith, <hi>I am married and matched, as a minister ought to be.</hi> In an other place he glanceth at my wiues French hood. But what if I was married before I entred into the ministery, and be able to maintaine her so without any profits of my Ecclesiasticall liuings? Beside that himselfe being a filthy bastard, and borne of a base queane, as the Quodlibetist being a goodly martyr in the Calendar of traitors telleth him, he sheweth himselfe both witlesse and shamelesse, to speake against honorable mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and such as are knowne to be descended of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parentage. Furthermore he giueth vs occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the filthie masse-priests, monkes and Iebusites, that abiuring lawfull marriage, burne in vnlawfull lustes, and are knowne to be adulterers, fornicators, sodomites, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:25623:132"/>
most beastly and swinish fellowes.</p>
               <p>He shameth not also to affirme, <hi>that I was forced to retire out of Ireland for certaine iniurious speeches against the Earle of Ormond, and the Irish nation.</hi> But what if the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Irish nation will cleare me? Is not he a busie fellow to meddle with their matters without fée? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what if I came away with the leaue and liking both of the generall and others? Wil it not appeare that he lieth like a shamelesse fellow, without leaue or liking of any but himself, who like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As for those whom he stileth witnesses, <hi>Omni exceptione maiores,</hi> they neuer receiued any greater disgrace then in medling with me, and haue since declared themselues to be men rather to be lamented for their folly, then credited for their dignitie.</p>
               <p>But nothing is more ridiculous, then that <hi>Robert Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> should find fault with my intemperancy of spéech, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I do but answer his intemperate and exorbitant inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiues, that in scurrility and rayling are superlatiue. But if he will néeds find fault, let him bring reason, least his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting séeme to want both wit and reason.</p>
               <p>His last charge against me in his answer to my Epistle concerneth discontentment, and complaints against the State. But it is like the rest, that is, fond, false, and friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For neither is it likely that I should be discontent with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> present state, or grieued with any ordinary charge, when both in most honorable actions, and in my publike writings, I haue to the vttermost of my power defended the State, and haue willingly put my self to extraordinary charge in all seruices for my countrey. This resolution also is both in my selfe and others, not onely to spend our goods, but our liues also in defence of our country and of the truth against all malignant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:25623:133"/>
that I haue séene such notorious trechery, as is discouered in <hi>Parsons</hi> and his leud consorts to escape vnpunished, and sometimes vncontrolled.</p>
               <p>Not content to accuse vs, the ranging fellow runneth out in diuers places, and rayleth with a wide and filthy mouth against the late noble Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> whose calamity all that knew him do much lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and whose blood, I doubt not but God will require at all the hands of some of his consorts that sought to spill it, as he hath already begun to reuenge it in some principal persons that eagerly followed the matter against him. Well, let us sée notwithstanding what this Blackesmiths dog hath to say against that noble lord. First, saith he, <hi>the Earle of Essex was pitifully seduced by<note place="margin">Fol. 6. b.</note> the puritanes.</hi> But euery one that is not ignorant of the true causes of his discontentment, knoweth well, that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was not for religion, but rather for other causes. It is also well knowne, that sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish faction was the cause of his ruine. For vnderstanding his discontentment, they set him forward with hope and promise of assistance in priuate quarels, not doubting, but either to trouble the state by his means, or els to bring him into a snare, whom they knew to be firme for religion. It may be also, that his enemies by their cunning drew him into this dangerous action, by practise of traiterous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that were about him. Howsoeuer it was, much it is to be lamented, that refusing a pension offered him by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he could not also discouer this traine layed for him by the Popes agents. And I cannot but much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that so bastardly and base a swaine as this paltry <hi>Parsons</hi> is, should insult ouer so noble and magnanimous an Earle: a dog ouer a Lyon: a bauling curre ouer a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and worthy man of warre.</p>
               <p>He telleth vs further, <hi>that he was stout against peace with forraine princes,</hi> and <hi>that he had wrought such a troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnder hand, that if his streame had not bene turned against him, he might chance to haue inhooked the greatest fish in England.</hi> But this deuise of a great fish, is nothing but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:25623:133"/>
a vaine surmise of a great conger-headed companion. For neither did he, nor could he pretend any title to the crowne. And as for his stoutnesse against peace with <hi>Spaine,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded from the loue of his country, and was occasioned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on iust grounds, for that he saw no sincere dealing on the behalfe of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but rather a surceasing of hostility, that in the meane while Masse-priests and Iebusites, and their adherents might worke treason. It may be also, that he meant to shew the weaknesse of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> &amp; the power of the English nation, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore too much despised. Neither he certes, nor any man else misliketh an honorable, profitable, safe, and durable peace. Fol. 8. a. he doth againe talke vainely, and telleth vs of the Essexian assault, and sayth, <hi>it may be presumed, that it would haue abbreuiated the Queenes dayes, especially in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the puritanes.</hi> But he is an absurd fellow to obiect that which his greatest enemies sought to proue, and of which he cleared himself sufficiently at the barre. And most shamelesse he sheweth himself, to impute that to men of our profession, which like a leud <hi>Laiolian</hi> he calleth <hi>puritanes,</hi> which was continually desired of Papists, and much feared of all that truly professed religion. Againe, fol. 13. he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth the Earle of <hi>Essex his attempt, and golden purposes,</hi> and sayth, <hi>that my Lord and young king Essex plotted her Maiesties ouerthrow vnder pretence of meeting at a puritane sermon.</hi> But if all plotters of her Maiesties ouerthrow had bin rewarded according to their desert, then had the crowes long ere this fed on <hi>Parsons</hi> his quarters, the most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arch-plotter of treason that this age hath affoorded. Likewise he and his consorts haue made many attempts against the State, and in the destruction of their Quéen and country they hoped to haue a new world, and therin placed their golden time. As for the good Earle, his purposes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they were drawne to his destruction, and disorderly managed, yet could no man proue that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> harme to the Quéene. Séeing therefore this Patch obiecteth to the Earle an imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that which the traiterous consorts
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:25623:134"/>
of <hi>Parsons</hi> haue long desired: I will here bestow on him a crowne of fox tayles, and make him the King of al renegate traitors: and doubt not if he come into <hi>England,</hi> but to sée him crowned at <hi>Tiburne,</hi> and his quarters enstalled at <hi>Newgate</hi> and <hi>Moregate.</hi> Finally, fol. 88. b. he doth againe inculcate the same matters, and pretendeth <hi>that he was set on by certaine puritanes and hungrie protestants.</hi> But if he knew any of vs guilty of such a crime, I doubt not but he would haue reuealed their names, vsing to kéepe nothing secret that might hurt vs. We haue rather great cause to suspect Papists, who were the principall men about him, and some percase suborned by the Spanish <hi>Infantaes</hi> faction that feared him, and by all meanes sought his destruction. And thus euery man may see, that no man euer pleaded the Popes cause with worse grace then <hi>Parsons,</hi> who obiecteth nothing to his aduersaries, but that which falleth beside them, and reboundeth backe on himselfe and his friends.</p>
               <p>In the places aboue mentioned, he endeuoreth also to sprinkle some suspition vpon sir <hi>Francis</hi> and me, as if we had bene priuy to the Earles intentions. But we were too farre off to be partakers of his counsels, and too far different from sir <hi>Chr. Blunt</hi> and other Papists to consort with them: and I may boldly say, not so simple as to allow of such an action. <hi>Parsons</hi> therefore may do well, either to forbeare such foolish toyes, or to take better information of matters. He calleth the Earle my master: but therein he is no lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, then in the rest. For albeit I haue in diuers actions serued vnder him; yet so did diuers others Knights &amp; Lords that neuer called him master.</p>
               <p>Fol. 20. he giueth out foolish words, as if some of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which he calleth Puritanes, should intend <hi>to take some port or towne in England.</hi> But that, as it is a matter far from our doctrine and practise, so it is common with the Papists, as may be proued by the example of such as came with the <hi>Spaniards, an. 1597. &amp;</hi> 98. for <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I say further, that he is neither Catholike nor honest man, but a furious sycophant, hired for crusts of bread to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate honest men, and an irreligious apostate and heretike, and yet not more wicked for religion, then damnable for his odious conuersation. And where I say that Papists, as many as were linked to <hi>Parsons</hi> and his packing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts, were enemies to her Maiesties person: their manifold plots and attempts against her Maiesty, &amp; their continuall adhearing to her enemies, do proue my saying true. <hi>Parsons</hi> also hath by diuers libels, and namely by <hi>Philopater,</hi> which he denieth to be his, and by the printing and publishing of <hi>Sanders</hi> booke <hi>de Schismate,</hi> and the libell which was partly made by him, and partly by <hi>Allen,</hi> and by diuers practises against her life and state, proued himselfe to be a dogge in barking, and a poysoned enemie in conspiring against her. We will onely alledge a few lines out of <hi>Allens</hi> libell prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Parsons</hi> against the Queene. <hi>She is</hi> (sayth he) <hi>a most vniust vsurper, an open iniurer of all nations, an infamous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, accursed, excommunicate hereticke, the very shame of her sexe and princely name, the chiefe spectacle of sinne and abhomination in this our age, and the onely poyson, calamity, and destruction of our noble Church and countrey.</hi> Now would I gladly know, whether those that allow this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> be no Catholikes, nor should the Catholike church consist of particular men. And finally, al the members of the Catholike church should be agents to deliuer, and all members to receiue, and no distinction should be betwéene the giuer and receiuer. But I vsed onely one argument, drawne from a common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of schoolemen, viz. <hi>that actions are acted of singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and not of the body collectiue:</hi> supposing that I had had to do with a schóole-man, or a man at the least that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood logicke. But now I see I am fronted with an asse, and a fellow deuoyd of logicke and reason. For otherwise he would not haue talked so idly of <hi>suppositum</hi> and <hi>singulare,</hi> and <hi>vniuersale,</hi> nor deriued his logick from <hi>Tolet,</hi> nor denied my argument. For if in God the whole essence doth suffer, and not the sonne of God, or if the whole essence should be borne, and not the sonne of God, as <hi>Parsons</hi> must graunt, if he will haue actions to proceed <hi>à toto collectiuo:</hi> then doth he fall flatly into the heresie of the <hi>Patripassians,</hi> &amp; ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the high mystery of the holy Trinitie.

and not to the vniuersall body of the Church. The same is also proued by the example of a body politicke.

The Pope therefore may do wel to lash this asse, and to graunt him no pardon, that knoweth not the grounds and first principles of his owne foole (or as some call it school) diuinitie. Nay he remembreth not the common formes of pardons. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. <hi>anno</hi> 1578. granting a<note place="margin">Meteran. hist.

               <p>AS it is a grosse fault in an Orator to vse such an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,<note place="margin">Cic. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. lib. 1.</note> as may also be vsed by his aduersary, or turned backe vpon himselfe; so it is a fault to begin with a sentence that may as well fit our aduersaries as our selues. But <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> litle regardeth this obseruation, who fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his booke with this sentence of the Apostle, <hi>Tit. 3. Flie an heretical man after one or two warnings, knowing that such a one is subuerted, and sinneth damnably against his own iudgement.</hi> A testimonie that may fitly be applied to him. For he is an hereticall man, and hath bene often warned of his faults, albeit we sée no amendment in him. He sinneth also, as may be guessed, against his owne conscience, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which being in <hi>England</hi> somtimes he condemned, and is vtterly subuerted and damned, if God do not in his great mercie recall him. If he denie himselfe to be an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:25623:150"/>
let him shew how he can hold all the heresies of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, which in auncient time haue bene condemned, and yet be no heretike. To vs he cannot apply these words, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we hold nothing against the scriptures, by which we are to iudge most certainely of the faith of the Catholike Church. Neither doth <hi>Parsons</hi> alleage this place against vs impertinently, but also falsly. The words of the Apostle are those, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which emport thus much, <hi>And sinneth being condemned by himselfe:</hi> and not as <hi>Parsons</hi> translateth: viz. <hi>And sinneth damnably against his owne iudgement.</hi> Where this word <hi>damnably,</hi> and <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is added to the Apostles sentence most falsly. For euery heretike after once or twise admonition doth not sinne damnably against his owne iudgement, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the Popes, their Cardinals, and others, that think they do well percase, albeit noble and notorious heretikes. But rather euery heretike doth by his leud opinions, which he will not reforme, seuer and diuide himselfe from the Church, and as the Apostle saith, sinneth, <hi>being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by his owne act, or by him selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise do the rest of his testimonies and authorities serue fitly against himselfe. In the beginning of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, fol. 1. he aymeth at the Apostles words, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Where he forbiddeth vs <hi>to contend about words, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing, but to peruert the hearers. Robert Parsons</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Apostles words so, as if he should say, <hi>that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of words tendeth to nothing, but the subuersion of the hearers.</hi> But the Apostle talketh of <hi>contention about words,</hi> and not <hi>of contention of words:</hi> and of the effect, and not of tending to an end. But to omit his error in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I say that nothing could be more fitly spoken against <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> then this, which the Apostle here vttereth. For what with his <hi>Wardword,</hi> and his <hi>Warneword,</hi> and his idle contention about words, he hath abused and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted his simple and credulous followers, that looked for better things at his hands. And therefore leauing as much as we can, his brabling words, we answere that, which is
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:25623:151"/>
most materiall of his discourse.</p>
               <p>In the same leafe, he addeth another text out of the 26. of the Prouerbs, where the wise man aduiseth vs, <hi>to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere a foole according to his folly, least he thinke himselfe wise.</hi> According whereunto we haue shaped an answere to <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> his <hi>Warneword,</hi> praying him very heartily to take it in good part, and not to thinke himselfe ouer wise in his owne conceit, seeing the author of that péece could neuer haue vttered such stuffe, vnlesse he had bene a thrée piled foole, and had attained to a higher degree, then a Cardinall in the consistory of fooles.</p>
               <p>Likewise these words out of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> oration in <hi>Vatini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> which he like a dolt supposeth to be taken out of <hi>Tullies</hi> second <hi>Philppic, viz. vt vexatum potiùs, quàm despectum vellem dimittere,</hi> doe fit vs as well against <hi>Parsons,</hi> as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised. For albeit he be but a base, bastardly, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible fellow, and almost spent out in rayling and libelling, and discrasied in plotting of treason and villany; yet haue I thought it better to send him away well corrected, then to passe by him as a worthlesse and despised companion. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I doubt, but to returne him as large a measure of bastonadoes, as he hath offered others, and so to handle him, that his friends shall say he is dressed like a calues head souced in veriuyce.</p>
               <p>These words of our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn 3. He that doth euill, hateth the light, and will not come to it, least his workes should be reproued;</hi> he applieth to me. And why? For sooth because to answere Capt. <hi>Cowbuckes</hi> fencing <hi>Wardword,</hi> set out vnder the name of <hi>N. D.</hi> I take the two next let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to make vp <hi>N. D.</hi> a full Noddy. For this cause he sayth, <hi>I entertaine my selfe in some darknesse for a time, and expect my prey, vnder a ciphred name.</hi> And this obiection pleaseth him so well, that not onely in the eleuenth and twelth leafe, but also in diuers others places he doth incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same. But against me these obiections come all too late. For albeit at the first I could haue bene content to haue bene vnknowne in this foolish brable betwixt <hi>Parsons</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:25623:151"/>
and me, and that not so much in regard of any thing sayd by me, as in regard of the bastardly companion, with whom I am matched, being an aduersary, of any learned man to be scorned. And not least of all, because such contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies would rather be handled in Latin, then in English: yet being occasioned to renew my challenge, I haue set my name vnto it, and declared, that I neither feare light, nor the foules of darknesse, nor néed to looke for spoyle, as this rauinous Iebusite pretendeth. Against <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> this text and obiection cometh both fitly and timely. For albeit he obiecteth ciphring of names to others, yet will he not discipher his owne name vnto vs. Nay, albeit we know his name and qualitie very well; yet will he not bewray himselfe, albeit often admonished of his playing the owle. He hath long bene plotting of treason, and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the light. He hath for many yeares gone masked like a vagabond vp and downe England, and in the day time hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den himselfe in corners. He hath long looked to diuide the spoile of his country with strangers. What then resteth, seeing he will not be dismasked, but that some of Buls pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie doe vnmaske him, vncase him, and trusse him?</p>
               <p>Likewise fol. 12. he calleth me <hi>Owle,</hi> and saith, <hi>He will draw me to the light.</hi> But this foule shold haue remembred that himselfe in a paltry pamphlet, which he set forth to disswade men from coming to Church, tooke on him the name of <hi>Iohn Houlet,</hi> as a fit name for such a night bird, and that this is one of his owne proper titles.

Was he then wel in his wits, trow you, to talk of his owne deare fathers cruelties, and to accuse Christs sheepe, as cause of the wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish Papists notorious murders and cruell executions?</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Parsons</hi> asketh <hi>Sir Francis, whether he hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith by his owne reading, or by the credite of some others:</hi> we may aske his friarship likewise, or because he is but a doogeon dunce, of the Pope, who is, as it were, an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Papists, the same question. And if he answer, that he hath it by his owne reading, then we shall much wonder at his impudencie. For <hi>Parsons</hi> knoweth that Popes reade li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing, and for the most part are ignorant of schoole diuinitie. If he say his Popeship hath it by the vertue of his close stool, then is the same but filthy learning, especially the Pope being laxatiue, as was <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourteenth.

                  </gap>, and not from the head of the church. <hi>Parsons</hi> therefore to cleare this doubt, fol. 110. saith, <hi>That they do not depend on the Pope as a priuate man, but as he is head and chiefe pastor of Christs vniuersal Church.</hi> He saith also, <hi>That his rudenesse is turned into wisedome.</hi> But that the Pope is the head of Christs vniuersall Church, is the thing in question. That a man should be a sot, as he is a priuate man, and wise as he is a publike person, is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. That he is made wise and learned being made Pope, is most false. So it appeareth, <hi>Parsons</hi> is ensnared in his owne question, and must confesse that the faith of papists is nothing else but the Popes priuate fancie, and grounded on the Popes chaire, and most absurd and sottish: which can

               <p>In his first encounter, chap 15. he spendeth much talke about the rule of faith. But most of his words are direct contrary both to himselfe and to his holy fathers profite. For in the <hi>Wardword,</hi> page 6. he said, <hi>the vniuersal Church was the squire and pole-star, which euery one was to follow:</hi> confounding like an ideot the thing ruled with the rule. In the <hi>Warneword</hi> fol. 100. he saith, <hi>the summe and corpes of Christian doctrine deliuered at the beginning by the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; preachings of the Apostles,</hi> is the rule of faith. Which is contrary to the Popes profit. For if this be true, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Popes determinations and traditions ecclesiastical were preached by the Apostles and confirmed by mracles, they are to be excluded from being the rule of faith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This being the <hi>Adelantadoes</hi> proclamation <hi>anno</hi> 1598. let the world iudge of the impudencie of <hi>Parsons,</hi> that lyeth wittingly, and saith, <hi>the alarme was false.</hi> Thereby it may appeare also, what maner of man <hi>Parsons</hi> is, that bringeth forreine enemies vpon his countrey, and is consorted with them, and yet faceth all downe that shall say the contrarie.</p>
               <p>In his Epistle likewise he saith, <hi>that the Ward word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming abroade, the newes was in most mens mouthes, that the Knight disauowed the Watchword, attributing the same to certaine Ministers.</hi> Where, me thinkes, I heare <hi>Thraso</hi> say, <hi>Metuebant omnes me: All stood in dread of me.</hi> But that is not the fault that I meane here to touch. For it is his egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious lying, that we are here to talke of. Let him therefore either name these most men that he mentioneth, or at the least some honest man, that gaue out this report as from sir <hi>Francis</hi> his mouth, or else we must say, that this lie came out of his owne foule mouth, that is now become a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of lies. He must shew also how <hi>Sir Francis</hi> could disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow a treatise subscribed and published by himselfe, or else it will be said, that this report of <hi>Parsons</hi> is a lie, without shew or probabilitie.</p>
               <p>Afterward he affirmeth, <hi>that a certaine Minister wrote in supply of the Knights defence.</hi> And againe, fol. 1. he telleth, <hi>how I perusing the reply of Sir Francis, thought in mine owne opinion to make a better defence.</hi> But how can he proue that I perused the Knights answere,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:25623:157"/>
or once saw it? And whence doth he gather, what opinion I had of mine owne doings? If he proue nothing, then will it be an easie matter to gather, that he hath made two impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable lies. The same is proued also, for that my reply was made before the Knights Apologie was published or seene of me. For if I had seene it first, my labour might well haue bin spared, the same being more then sufficient for the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of such a banglers babling discourse.</p>
               <p>In his obseruations vpon my preface, fol. 11. b. he sayth, <hi>My proiect and purpose of writing, is to irritate and stir vp her Maiesty, and the Councel, to ingulfe themselues in Catholikes bloud, and to spoile their goods, that I and my crew might come to haue a share.</hi> But first it is most false, that Papists are Catholikes. Secondly, no one word can he alleage out of my whole book, wherby it may be gathered, that I would haue any rigour vsed against such simple Papists, that are not factious nor mutinous. For all the harme I wish them, is, that they were wel instructed. Thirdly, if he meane those traitors, that either came or meant to ioyne with the <hi>Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantado</hi> against their prince and countrey: then are they no Catholikes, nor true subiects. The same may be said also of <hi>Parsons</hi> his consorts. Finally, it is a shamelesse vntruth to say, we desire either blood or spoile; all our actions tending onely to resist forrein enemies, and wicked traitors, which séeke to shed their countrimens blood like water, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it to the Pope, and to giue the spoile of their country to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the factious Masse-priests and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists their consorts haue done diuers times, and namely <hi>an.</hi> 1588. and 1598. and since.</p>
               <p>In his obseruations vpon <hi>Sir Francis</hi> his Epistle, fol. 6. <hi>He obiecteth</hi> (saith <hi>Parsons) that I seeke the ruine both of church and common wealth by my exhortation to peace, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and mitigation in religion.</hi> A notorious lie, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by reading of <hi>Sir Francis</hi> his Apology, where there is no one word sounding that way. Neither do we blame any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man that talketh of peace, but scorne, that traitors that haue warre in their hearts, should talke of peace, and that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:25623:157"/>
idolaters and heretikes should prate and talke of religion, when they meane nothing but to erect idolatrie, and to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish popish errors and superstition.</p>
               <p>Fol. 16. speaking of me, <hi>He blusheth not</hi> (saith he) <hi>to affirme that which all his fellowes haue denied.</hi> And what is this, trow you? Forsooth, that blasphemous and scandalous dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing heretikes may be put to death. But where he saith, that all my fellows haue denied this, he sheweth him selfe a shamelesse lying companion, and the diuels fellow in forging lies. For none of my fellowes euer denied that which I affirme, but only wold not haue ignorant, &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and simple heretikes, that neither blaspheme, nor dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matise, nor are offensiue to the State, punished with death. Likewise they condemne the cruell and bloody Papists, that burne &amp; massacre men, women and children, for denying or contradicting any one point of their filthy, abominable, and erronious doctrine.</p>
               <p>Fol. 18. he saith, <hi>The Emperour in a certaine edict begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, reddentes: Cod. de sum. Trin. &amp; fid. Cath. professeth his due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and of all his empire to the church of Rome:</hi> which is a notorious and an impudent ly. For in that law there is no one word to be found, that importeth subiection either of the Emperour, or of the Empire to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> much lesse to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay, at that time the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> belonged to the Emperour, which lately the Pope hath vsurped, excluding the Emperour from thence. But were there any thing contained in that law, which may séeme spoken in fauour of the Romane Bishop, yet is the same proued counterfet in my late treatise concerning falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Romish synagogue.</p>
               <p>Fol. 19. a. speaking of the Emperors, <hi>They professed</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Bishops of Rome to be the heads and chiefe leaders of this vniuersall and visible Catholicke Church: as before hath bene shewed by the examples of Gratian, Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> to Pope <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:25623:158"/>
This he saith boldly. But in these few words, a cluster of lies is packed vp close together. For neither do <hi>Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodsius</hi> write to <hi>Damasus,</hi> as the title of the law, <hi>cunctos populos Cod. de sum. trinit.</hi> doth shew, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they say, that <hi>Damasus</hi> was head and leader of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall visible Church. Nor do <hi>Arcadius, Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosus</hi> the second talke of any such matter to be due to <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the first. Nor can it be proued out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> or <hi>Iustinians</hi> decrée, <hi>inter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For beside that the law <hi>inter claras,</hi> is counterfeit, the interpreter doth corruptly translate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>the head of all priests,</hi> the head of all Churches. Nay hardly will <hi>Parsons</hi> be able to shew, that any of these did speake of the vniuersall visible Church, where they speake of the bishops of <hi>Romes</hi> authoritie. These therefore are pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, if not visible lies. And that which he saith of <hi>Iohn</hi> the first, is a ridiculous lye. For he was dead, as Chronicles teach, before <hi>Iustinians</hi> reigne.</p>
               <p>He thinketh it lawfull to lie all manner of lies of <hi>Caluin.</hi> And therefore boldly saith, <hi>He was a priest,</hi> and that <hi>he sayd<note place="margin">Fol. 20. 2.</note> masse.</hi> Both which are denyed by those which wrote his life, which say he departed out of France <hi>before he receiued any orders.</hi> The same may be proued, for that his name is found in no bishops records, and for that he begunne to write his Institutions before 24. yeares of age. Of which we gather, that he hated the popish priesthood, before he was of yeares to be made priest.</p>
               <p>Fol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. b. he maketh <hi>Sir Francis</hi> to say, <hi>that we haue changed old religion into Protestancy:</hi> not changing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his old fashion of cogging and lying. For neither doth he, nor any of vs acknowledge popish religion to be aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor do we call our religion <hi>protestancy:</hi> although his dealing giueth vs oft occasion to protest against his wicked and false dealing.</p>
               <p>Fol. 23. a. he affirmeth, that <hi>Sir Francis talketh of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but feares, frights and terrors.</hi> But he might doe well
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:25623:158"/>
to cease talking, if he tell nothing but lies. In the place mentioned <hi>Sir Francis</hi> talketh neither of <hi>feares, frights, nor terrors.</hi> Nor doth it follow, because <hi>Parsons</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts are still packing vnderhand, and dealing with the Spaniards, that we are terrified. For we haue neither cause to feare treason, nor publike force, vnlesse we will trust traytors, and wilfully throw away our armes. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue Papists cause to begin to stirre, vnlesse they be weary of their liues, of peace, of ease, and of their natiue countrey.</p>
               <p>Fol. 25. a. he boldly auoucheth, that I count it a blessing, <hi>to haue Catholike rites and seruice abolished:</hi> whereas in truth I desire nothing more, then that Catholike religion may be restored, and speake onely against the filthy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of popish masse, the idolatrous worship of saints and idols, the tyranny of the Pope, and such like: which none but the slaues of Antichrist can endure, and wil affirme to be Catholike.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Iouinian</hi> and <hi>Vigilantius</hi> held some errors, we will not deny. But <hi>that Hierome called them heretikes for the same points that wee hold, concerning virginitie, prayers to saints, and lights at martyrs tombes,</hi> as <hi>Parsons</hi> fol. 27. affirmeth most falsly, will not be proued. For <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> doth rather excuse those, that lighted candels at noone day, then condeinne those that thought contrary. Neither did he euer place perfection in forced virginity, or teach prayers to saints, or allow those, that worshipped false relikes, as the papists do. This therefore which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> sayth, is to be scored vp among the relikes of his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
               <p>In the same leafe he addeth another grosse lye, saying, <hi>That Iewell</hi> (writing) <hi>against Harding, and Fulke against Allen and Bristow, do often call Saint Hierome borne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist and scolding doctor.</hi> For neither the one terme, nor the other is found in their writings. Nay we should great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrong <hi>Saint Hierome,</hi> if we should call him either papist, or <hi>borne papist,</hi> séeing that in his time neither the monster
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:25623:159"/>
of the masse, nor other popish abominations, were either borne, or conceiued. Unlesse therefore he quote <hi>B. Iewels,</hi> and <hi>M. Fulkes</hi> words; as he was borne a bastard, so we will hold him by condition for a lying accuser, and a scol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding companion, and a fellow borne to tell lyes.</p>
               <p>Fol. 28. b. he telleth loud lies of <hi>Panormitane,</hi> saying, <hi>That he in the chap. licet. de electione,</hi> expounding these words of <hi>Hostiensis, Cum idem sit Christiatque Papae consistori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quasiomnia potest facere Papa, quae Christus, excepto peccato: sheweth the meaning to be, that in matters of iurisdiction, and spirituall authoritie, for gouernment of his Church vpon earth, Christ hath left so great power vnto his substitute Saint Peters successor, as he may do thereby, and in his name and vertue, whatsoeuer his master &amp; Lord might do in his Church, if he were now conuersant among vs vpon earth.</hi> This I say, is a loudlye, consisting of two or thrée branches. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Panormitan</hi> expound the words of <hi>Hostiensis:</hi> nor doth he affirme, that which <hi>Parsons</hi> writeth in his name. Nor is he so shamelesse to write that which <hi>Parsons</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. A second lye is also auouched by the forger of lyes <hi>Parsons,</hi> where he sayth, <hi>That all both diuines &amp; canonists do agree, that all Christs power of gouernment is left to the Pope, except onely his power of excellency, according to that great commission in Saint Matthew, I will giue vnto thee, the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, &amp;c.</hi> For neither all, nor any ancient father doth agrée to this conclusion, albeit we may boldly call them better diuines then the schoolemen: nor do all, or most of the Canouists speake of this power of excellencie; nor do the words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. belong to the Pope, or conteine any such commission as is pretended. And that without alleaging further proofes, the Popes owne doctors will confesse. For <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 10. sheweth, that <hi>Peter had nothing granted in the 16. of Matth. but promised onely.</hi> And with him also diuers others are consorted.

               <p>In the same leafe, he belyeth the same man againe, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs, <hi>That Panormitan, de electione c. venerabilem, saith, that Hostiensis founded his doctrine vpon the commission gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Pope, Matth.</hi> 16.

               </p>
               <p>Fol. 36. b. speaking of <hi>Cromwell</hi> and bishop <hi>Cranmer: The first of them,</hi> sayth he, <hi>was principally employed in the sayd Queenes condemnation and death, as appeareth yet by publike records, and the second was vsed for her defamation after her death, as is extant at this day in the foresayd statute it selfe, where Cranmers sentence is recorded iudicially giuen by him.</hi> This saith he, but so impudently and falsly, as the same may conuince him of most shamelesse lying. For first there is no such sentence, as is here mentioned, recorded in the act, as any man may see, that listeth to reade it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what needeth a sentence of diuorce against her, that was now put to death, that diuorceth all marriages? Thirdly, no man euer grieued more at this act, and at that Quéenes death, then the <hi>Lord Cromwell.</hi> So farre was he off from being a stickler in it. Finally, not onely printed statutes, but the acts of the tower also do conuince this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes most shamelesse reports. Do you then thinke that he blusheth to say any thing, that is not ashamed to lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst publike acts and records?</p>
               <p>Fol. 37. a. he saith, <hi>Cranmer carried about with him his woman in a trunke.</hi> An impudent popish fiction, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But if he had bene disposed to haue kept her with him; yet nothing is more ridiculous or improbable, then that she should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in a trunke.

For first, <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> were learned men, aswell as <hi>Luther,</hi> and taught truth before they knew him. <hi>Carolstadius</hi> also taught matters neuer learned of him. Secondly, except in the exposition of the words of the Lords supper, in which the Papists do differ more then any others, all consented with <hi>Luther</hi> in most things, and in this did modestly dissent from him.

                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:25623:161"/>Hauing belyed vs before, in the seuenth chapter of his first encounter he telleth lies also of himselfe, and of his owne consorts. First he saith, If Papists <hi>were idolaters, that this error was vniuersally receiued among them.</hi> But that followeth not. For all Papists haue not one opinion of Saints, of relikes, of images of Saints. The second, <hi>Nicene</hi> councell denieth, <hi>That Latria is due to images, or that the images of the godhead are to be made by Christians.</hi> Some hold, that not the image, but the thing signified is to be worshipped: many hold contrary. All giue not diuine worship to the crosse, nor pray to it in one sort. Finally, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his bookes, <hi>de imaginibus,</hi> and <hi>de Sanctis,</hi> doth confesse, that there are many different opinions among the worshippers of images. Secondly, <hi>Parsons</hi> denyeth, that Papists <hi>are idolaters.</hi> But <hi>Lactantius lib. 1. instit. diuin. c.</hi> 19. and other fathers shew, that all are idolaters, that giue the worship of God to creatures, as the Papists do, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sacrament, the crosse, and images of the Trinitie with diuine worship. This point is also fully proued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papists in my last challenge, chap. 5. Thirdly, he sayth most falsly, <hi>That all Friers and Monkes professed one faith without any difference in any one article of beliefe.</hi> The falshood of his assertion I haue shewed by diuerse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances heretofore. Fourthly, he sayth, <hi>The Papists may haue a ministeriall head of the Church, as well as we haue a woman for the head.</hi> But it is a greater matter to be head of the vniuersall Church, then of one Realme. Againe, we call the King supreme gouernour, for no other cause, then for that he is the chiefe man of his Realme, and chiefe disposer of externall matters. But they giue one consistory to <hi>Christ</hi> and the Pope. Furthermore, in matters of faith, we say, all princes ought to submit themselues to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and their doctrine. The Pope will be equall to them, if not aboue them, and determine matters of faith, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, as <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Finally, he sayth; <hi>Difference of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites or particular manner of life breaketh not vnitie of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> But the Apostle reproueth those, that sayd, <hi>I hold of

               <p>Fol. 66. b. he saith, <hi>That in S. Hieromes time the Romaine faith was accompted the generall Catholike faith.</hi> And <hi>that this Island hath had twise participation of the Romaine faith.</hi> Both manifest lyes. For as well might the city of <hi>Rome</hi> be called the world, as the Romaine faith, the <hi>generall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith.</hi> Againe, it is false, that in old time we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Romaine faith, that now is professed and declared in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> For we receiued the <hi>Christian</hi> faith, which not these <hi>Romaines,</hi> that are a collection of the scumme of the world, but the old generouse Romaines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>
               <p>Fol. 69. he denyeth, that the Apostle teacheth, <hi>that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers should be in a knowne language:</hi> where boldly he giueth the lye to <hi>Ambrose, Chrysostome, Theophylact,</hi> and other fathers, that shew, that the Apostle speaketh of publike prayers, in a knowne tongue.</p>
               <p>To iustifie the vse of the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue in reading of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he maketh two loud lyes, as I must néedes tell him in <hi>English.</hi> First he saith, <hi>That Ioan Bourcher by reading scriptures in English, learned that Christ had not taken flesh of his mother, and that a tanner of Colchester learned, that Baptisme was worth nothing,</hi> and that <hi>others fell into here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies by reading scriptures.</hi> And <hi>secondly, That euery man light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstandeth somewhat of the Latin tongue.</hi> Both vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntrue. For neither do the vulgar people among the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italians</hi> vnderstand Latin: nor do Christians ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now fall into error by reading vulgar scriptures, then the old Gréekes and Romaines, that read scriptures in Greeke and Latin. But rather therefore did they erre, for
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:25623:162"/>
that they did not reade them diligently or reuerently.</p>
               <p>Fol. 71. he saith <hi>we teach that good workes are perilous.</hi> Let him therefore name those which haue committed this fault, or else acknowledge himselfe to be a perilous lyer.</p>
               <p>Fol. 79. he cannot be content to lie, where he talketh of matter of charge, but will néeds haue me testifie matters which I neuer thought. I might as well make him speake all villany against the Pope: but I wilt not now vse the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of so bad a fellow.</p>
               <p>That which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the Popes exactions <hi>out of great<note place="margin">Encon. 1. c. 11</note> benefices onely, and of his employments of mony against the Turkes,</hi> are méere leasings. For he taketh by one meanes or other both of great and litle, and rather destroyeth Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then <hi>Turkes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fol. 89. he exclaimeth and sayth, <hi>What will you say to this man, that maketh all his auncestors for so many hundred yeares together, and the auncestors of her Maiestie, her father, and grandfather, and the rest meere infidels?</hi> I answer in his owne forme. What will you say to this beast, that lieth as fast as a dog can trot? My words that he setteth downe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him. For I speake not of all, but of the most part of Christians of former times: and of their ignorance I haue brought sufficient proofe. If then those that lie, <hi>deserue cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelling,</hi> as he saith: it is not halfe a loade of wood that will serue for the bastonading of this brutish and senselesse beast.</p>
               <p>Fol. 99. <hi>By which words it is euident</hi> (saith <hi>Parsons) that his rule consisteth of the consent and establishment of certain men in England, what to beleeue, which is a different matter from scriptures.</hi> But whatsoeuer he thinketh of the rule of faith, he kéepeth no rule in speaking vntruth. For albeit the rule of faith, which euery priuate man in <hi>England</hi> is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, was established by consent of the synode of the Clergy of <hi>England:</hi> yet I say not, nor doth it follow of these words, that the consent of men is our rule of faith. For the canon of scriptures is the generall rule, that all the Church ought to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:25623:163"/>
follow, and because euery priuate man vnderstandeth not all points of himselfe, therefore the Church, to helpe the weaknesse of the ignorant, hath gathered the summe of faith out of scriptures, and proposed the same as conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thence deduced for priuate men to follow.</p>
               <p>Fol. 105. like a shamelesse beast he sayth, <hi>The Emperours</hi> (in the <hi>l. cunctos. Cod. de sum. Trin. &amp; fid.

               </p>
               <p>In his second encounter chap. 2. it séemeth he hath put on
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:25623:163"/>
his vizour of impudency, telling lies vpon reports without all shame or proofe. In King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his dayes, he saith, <hi>that a certaine Catholike man in Louth in Lincolnshire was put to death, being baited in a beares skin,</hi> and that <hi>the fame thereof is yet fresh in Louth.</hi> Matters very false, as all the old men in Louth wil testifie vpon their othes. Further the same is so improbable, as nothing more. For neither can the partie that was so put to death, nor the iudges, or executioners, or parties present be named. Nay it cannot be proued, that any was put to death at <hi>Louth</hi> at that time: albeit some of <hi>Louth</hi> were in danger for the rebellion, as is yet remembred. <hi>Parsons</hi> also must tell, how any durst put men to death contrary to law, &amp; who they were, knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the very rebels were not executed without trial. Another like lie he fathereth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Sir Edw. Carew</hi> brother to the Lord Chamberlaine, who is said to haue reported, <hi>That certaine Nobles or Gentlemen baited a certaine cacolike man with spaniels.</hi> But what if the Lord Chamberlaine had no bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called <hi>Sir Edward Carew?</hi> What if none of his brothers euer said any such thing? Againe, what if none was euer baited with spaniels? Doeth not <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> deserue to be baited by all the dogs in <hi>Rome,</hi> for telling vs such fables? In the meane while, how doeth this agrée with <hi>Verstegan,</hi> that telleth, how in <hi>Douer</hi> certaine cacolikes were baited with bandogs? And in what case are the Papists, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Saints baited in beares skins, that neuer were in the world? A third lie he would father vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham.</hi> But it cannot be gathered out of him, <hi>that either the lying Friers in king Richard</hi> the second his time were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Wicleffe, or that any corruption of manners grew in his doctrine:</hi> although <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> boldly auoucheth both these lies.</p>
               <p>In the second encounter, cap. 3. he saith, <hi>Thomas Arundell permitted and appointed vulgar translations of scriptures.</hi> But the truth is, he forbad them.

               <p>In his Epistle to the reader, he saith, <hi>Sir Francis is known to be one of the Puritan crew:</hi> and, as if he were a blind har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he is stil harping vpon this string of Puritanisme. But I must tell him that, which he will be much grieued to heare: that the contention about ceremonies and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church raysed by some more zealous then wise, and set forward by the enemies of the Church, is by the Kings great wisedome now ended. As for the terme <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> it will farre better agree with the pharisaicall Papists, then with any of our communion. For they hold that all men, if they will, <hi>are able to performe the whole law,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:25623:167"/>
and that the precepts of God are easie. Of which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth necessarily, that a man may be without sinne. For he that transgresseth not the law, is without sinne. But to hold that, is Pelagianisme and true Puritanisme. <hi>Verum ne</hi>

Is it true, that I heare you haue written, that a man may be without sinne, if he will, and that Gods commandements are easie?</hi> And in the beginning of his third booke against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> he sheweth, that it is Pelagianisme to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Constantines donation, and not the words of <hi>Constantine</hi> or <hi>Nicholas,</hi> do plainely testifie against him. If then these be his words, and be annexed to the former without diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then both must be his.</p>
               <p>Fol. 65. he cryeth out, <hi>Marke the fraudulent manner of these men alleaging fathers.</hi> And yet <hi>Hielome in Prol. 2. in comment. in Galat.</hi> and <hi>Augustine in Psal.</hi> 99. do well proue, that the people praying, did in time past and ought to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the language of their publike prayers: which is the thing against which he cryeth. Where I argue thus, that the Pope and his agents haue bene the stirrers of all the warres and troubles, that of late haue happened in <hi>Europe</hi> for the most part, and therefore not we, that haue alwayes desired peace: he cryeth out fol. 88. <hi>That the deuill hath taught me to make this malicious consequence.</hi> But the deuill, as I suppose, oweth him a shame to denie it, and he sheweth himselfe a dolt to giue me occasion so often to touch his owne and his consorts deuilish practises. The consequent is most true, and necessary. For that which is done by these bloodthirstie wolues, is not to be imputed to vs, whose onely labour is to resist their malice. Nay it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was cause of the wars of <hi>France,</hi> and the low countryes, and that he stirred sedition both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The diabolicall Iebusites also were the instruments to stirre the rebellious leaguers in <hi>France,</hi> and haue alwayes done their best to trouble <hi>Suethland, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The angels of <hi>Satan</hi> possessing the heads of Iebusites and masse-priests, wrought the massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres of <hi>France,</hi> and troubles of <hi>Flanders. Anno</hi> 1588. the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and Pope sent a fleete against <hi>England,</hi> and not we against <hi>Spaine.</hi> Finally, all stories almost testifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the consistory of the Pope, and his agents heads are the forges to frame mischiefe and trouble.</p>
               <p>Fol. 90. and 91. he cryeth out <hi>oflyes and impudencies.</hi> But for my part, I say, shame take him that lyeth. For first it is notorious, that in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, although the aduersary would deny it, there is, and hath bene great
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:25623:176"/>
variety in their liturges, as the missals and formularies of <hi>Toledo, Seuil, Sarum, Paris, Rome, Yorke and Millan</hi> do shew. Neither hath <hi>Parsons</hi> any thing to answere, but <hi>that in the substance of the sacrifice they agree.</hi> As if that were all, or the most part of the Romish seruice: or as if I had not shewed that this is most false, in my bookes <hi>De Missa.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is true that the Conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> hath aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed diuers old missals and formularies, as the bull prefixed before them shew. Thirdly, it is true that <hi>Iustine</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyse</hi> describe the forme that Christians vsed in their Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, as <hi>Iustines</hi> second Apologie, and <hi>Dionyse</hi> his bookes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Fourthly, the instruction of the <hi>Armenians</hi> was no act of the Conuenticle of <hi>Florence,</hi> but of some odde Masse-priest that vsed that conuenticles name. It is no lie therefore, notwithstanding this instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> did not by any canon esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish seuen sacraments. Fifthly, the Conuenticle of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, doth mention penance, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the name of sacrament, as I sayd most truly, to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> Finally it is most true, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish sacrifice of the Masse was not knowne of the auncient fathers: and I haue proued it in my third booke <hi>De Missa</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Which if <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> confute, I shall be content that the Pope bestow on him a Cardinals hat. But if he be not able to answer, and yet will néedes cry out <hi>famous falshood,</hi> I will bestow on him a pointed cap with a bell, and a capons feather, to let all the world know, that at that house dwelleth a sot. <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus,</hi> &amp; other fathers that he doth mention, speake not of the body and bleud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offered in the Masse, but of an oblation made in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that sacrifice. Our writers, albeit they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the fathers in some things, yet no where do they yéeld, that they speake of the popish sacrifice of the Masse, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered after the damnable fashion of the synagogue of Satan.</p>
               <p>Fol. 107. he calleth <hi>for two reall differences betweene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in the points of faith.</hi> And therefore I count my selfe

bound to shew him not two onely, but many more. It may please him therefore to reade what I haue sayd before, and to answere to euery point particularly: and then I hope he will cease his harsh and currish bawling. He must also shew, that his consorts differ not in matters of moment, or in any thing, if he will defend their vnion.</p>
               <p>Fol. 111. he crieth out, and in his dogges voyce sayth, <hi>If this woodcocke, or any of his crew can shew any one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, as an article of faith in our religion, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>If O.

For if I do not make him in this poynt a foote length of nose like a Curliew, let the Pope, if it be his pleasure, make him king of the Canaries. Nay I haue already shewed diuers both nouelties and heresies to be contained in Popish religion, and no Popish woodcocke yet hath thrust out his beake to answere, shewing themselues by their wits to be woodcockes, and by their silence Codfish. Onely one woodcocke of <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the maske of <hi>W. R. aliás Walphoole,</hi> or wicked <hi>Richard</hi> flusheth forth with his long bill. But his answere is such as confirmeth my chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge very much: the man being not able to answere any one argument. Parsons also toucheth the heresie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,</hi> which among many other, I obiected to him, and answereth, <hi>that Papists differ from Collyridians manifestly.</hi> But it is not inough to shew a difference, vnlesse he also shew, that his consorts hold no one point condemned as heresie in the <hi>Collyridians.</hi> But that the congerhead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do. For like to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> they pray to the Uirgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and offer in her honour. This answere therefore sheweth him to be of the lignage of woodcockes. But of these matters we shall talke else where.</p>
               <p>In his 2. enconter c. 2. he cryeth out, <hi>ô cogging, ô cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinage:</hi> and all because <hi>Sir Francis</hi> reporteth, that the blood of a Ducke was worshipped, as the blood of Hales, and that <hi>D.

of <hi>Aix</hi> called the Pope <hi>God on earth,</hi> and spoke foolishly. But what if all this were true? May not we then with more reason say, O coggers, O cosiners, O Scogans, O cods-heads! But that appeareth plainly. For the imposture about the duckes blood was openly detected, and the rest is reported in the acts of <hi>Bassinets</hi> examination. Neither is it vnlikely, that vnlearned prelates should speake vnlearned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or that schoole-doctors should be ignorant in scriptures, séeing all their diuinity is grounded vpon <hi>Thomas</hi> his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of questions and answers. <hi>But,</hi> saith <hi>Parsons, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Here therefore <hi>Parsons</hi> sheweth himselfe to haue a shallow capacitie: and the Papists are declared to be miserably se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by cogging and cousening priests, and caried away most simply and idiotlike to the worship of idoles and false reliques.</p>
               <p>Fol. 43. b. of his second encounter he cryeth out, <hi>Who shall be iudge?</hi> Meaning to conuey the highest authoritie in iudgement, concerning matters of controuersie about the interpretation of scriptures, to the Pope. But that is a shamelesse and most absurd course, to place a béetleheaded, ignorant and impious Pope aboue al learned holy fathers, and Councels. Beside that, the Popes sentence is alwayes vncertaine.

In my reply I alleage two places out of <hi>Hosius</hi> his confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the first, where he sayth, <hi>That ignorance is not only worthy pardon, but reward also:</hi> the second where he sayth, <hi>That to know nothing is to know all things.</hi> These places I say, as he vseth the matter, are <hi>Hosius</hi> his owne, and not <hi>Hilaries,</hi> or <hi>Tertullians.</hi> For <hi>Hilary lib. 8. de Trinit.</hi> where he produceth the like words, speaketh of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the meaning of these words, <hi>Ego &amp; pater vnum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> And <hi>Tertull. lib. de praescript. aduers. haeret.</hi> where he sayth, <hi>That to know nothing, is to know all things;</hi> speaketh of curious knowledge beyond the rule of faith.

The history which we report of <hi>king Iohn</hi> is neither absurd, considering the hatred of the swinish ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of polshorne priests, nor vntrue. <hi>Caxtons</hi> Chronicle sayth, he dyed of poyson giuen him by a Monke. <hi>Polychro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon lib. 7. c.</hi> 33. and <hi>Polydore virgil</hi> deny not, but that this was a common spéech. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Where was then <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> his honesty to shift off things so notorious?</p>
               <p>In my Preface to the reader, I say, that obstinate recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:25623:180"/>
are for the most part reconciled to the Pope, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to forreine enemies: and yet notwithstanding doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their lands and goods. And gladly would <hi>Ro. Parsons</hi> answere somewhat. But neither can he deny, that they are reconciled (for then the masse-priests would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them) nor that they adhere to forreine enemies (for then in vaine should the <hi>Adelantado</hi> presume of their helpe in his proclamation penned as it séemeth by English traytors) nor can he deny, they inioy lands and goods. For that is notorious. What then doth he? Forsooth he talketh idlely of the <hi>enioying of my benefices,</hi> and of the testimonie of certaine masse-priests. Of the which two, the first is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose. The second is leudly reiected without colour, séeing euery mans confession is strong against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and these mens confessions being in record, are not lightly to be refused. In the same place I say, that <hi>Parsons</hi> defendeth publike enemies and traytors, and seeketh the disgrace of the country and nation. To all which he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing, but by telling a tale of prosecuting Papists, which he termeth Catholikes. As if such may play the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ioyne with publike enemies openly and lawfully.</p>
               <p>The Papists being charged for mainteining the, words of <hi>Hostiensis and Panormitane,</hi> that say, <hi>That the Pope is able to do almost all things, which Christ can do, except sinne:</hi> he thinketh to shift off the matter by speaking with <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitan,<note place="margin">Fol. 29 b.</note> That the Pope can do al things with the keye of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that erreth not.</hi> But this is nothing els, but to presume, that the Pope hath discretion, and the keyes of the Church; and that in the determination of matters of faith he cannot erre: whereas all the world séeth, that the Pope cometh into the Church not with keyes, but with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and yron barres: and that he doth not so much vse the keyes, as swords and clubs; and that also without discretion or reason, killing all that speake against his triple crowne.</p>
               <p>Where I say, that such English as are reconciled to the Pope, haue renounced their obedience to the Quéene: he telleth vs of the subiects of the king of <hi>Spaine, France, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fol. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:25623:180"/>
and of the Emperour, <hi>that haue not renounced their obedience to their Princes.</hi> But his shift is most ridiculous. For the Pope was enemy to the Quéene of <hi>England,</hi> and not to them. But if at any time the Pope happen to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any of these Princes; then is it cleare, that such subiects as follow the Pope, cannot by any meanes adhere to their lawfull Princes. Unlesse <hi>Parsons</hi> can shew, how a man can please two contrary masters, and can himselfe serue both God and the deuill.</p>
               <p>Fol. 28. and 29. he runneth out into a large exposition of these words of <hi>Hostiensis</hi> and <hi>Panormitan: Quòd Papa potest quasi omniafacere quae Christus, excepto peccato:</hi> but all to no purpose. For he should shew, that these fellowes do not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pope, and not tell vs a tale of their fooleries, which as they are exorbitant, so are they vnpleasant.</p>
               <p>In the same place he sayth, it is no more adsurditie to say, <hi>That the Pope can do almost all that Christ can, except sinne: then if a man shold say, That the Viceroy of Naples can do all that the king of Spaine can do in that kingdome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept being free from treason.</hi> But first the words of <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis</hi> and <hi>Panormitan,</hi> importing that <hi>Christ</hi> can sinne, are blasphemous; albeit they meant, that except auoyding sinne, the Pope can do all, that <hi>Christ</hi> can do. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a simple shift to make the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> like to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of Naples like the Pope, or else to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare these two spéeches together. Finally, it is absurd to say, that the Uiceroy can do all things that the king of Spaine can. For he can neither moue warre, alienate the territory, nor do infinit other matters else. Beside that, there is greater difference betwixt <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> that is God and man, then betwéene man and man. Here therefore <hi>Parsons</hi> talking of the Uiceroy of Naples playeth the Uize, and 'sheweth that he hath the Neapolitan scabbes in his braine.</p>
               <p>Fol. 30. the canonists being charged for calling the Pope <hi>their Lord &amp; God.</hi> He answereth, <hi>That he cannot find it.</hi> As if it were not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, because his nodyship cannot find it.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:25623:181"/>
Or else, as if a Cardinals hat were not to be found in <hi>Rome,</hi> because <hi>Parsons</hi> could not find it. Let him therefore looke the glosse <hi>in c. inter nonnullos. extr. Ioan</hi> 22. <hi>de verb. signif.</hi> And it may be, with the help of his spectacles and a draught of greeke wine, he may find it. Oh, may his brother say, that he could as easily find a Cardinals hat.</p>

One sayth, <hi>That no lesse honor is due to the Pope then to Angels.</hi> Another, <hi>That the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours maiestie is as much inferior to the Pope, as a creature to God.</hi> The third, <hi>That the Pope is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Where I bring examples, and instances of notorious<note place="margin">Fol. 37.</note> flattery out of canonists, he sayth, <hi>They are the same for the most part which Sir Francis brought before, and are before answered:</hi> matters most false, and poorely shifted off. For neither are they the same, nor hath he answered any thing vnto them. Nay of fiue that Sir <hi>Francis</hi> brought, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth onely two, and them very leudly, loosely and vnsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently; and of a doozen brought by me toucheth scarce two. Would not he then be turned backe with a doozen stripes, to turne ouer these doozen places?

               <p>For maintenance of the rebellious attempts of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers in <hi>France,</hi> and other popish disloyalties against Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he telleth vs, 2. encon. c. 13. that <hi>when the Apostles prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against the Iewish magistrates commandement, it seemed to the Iewes disloyaltie, but was not.</hi> But this is a most poore shift. For the Papists haue not onely preached against the Princes commandement, but also haue murored them, and prosecuted them with armes: which the Apostles neuer did, or thought lawfull. Was not this Iebusite therfore a false Apostle, to pretend the Apostles examples for maintenance of rebels and traitors?</p>
               <p>Fol. 104. he shifteth off this argument, <hi>The Pope is to be obeyed as Christ, therefore if he commaund blasphemies:</hi> by saying, <hi>that it followeth not,</hi> and <hi>that this folly is no lesse ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, then if one should say, The Neapolitans professe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto their Viceroy, as to the King of Spaine, crgo he is to be obeyed if he commaund treasons against the King.</hi> But his answer is so learned and wise, that <hi>Parsons</hi> for the same doth deserue to be Uizeroy, or rather a Uize in the kingdom of fooles. For first no man will affirme, that the Uiceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> cannot erre. But that is denied in Christs Uiceroy the Pope. The case therefore is vnlike. Furthermore, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists will obey the Pope, if he commaund heresie or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, because they take his iudgement to be infallible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Neapolitans will not follow their Uiceroy in his rebellions. Likewise doeth he absurdly shift off the obiection concerning the absolute obedience required of Christians by <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. He sayth also, <hi>that it standeth with Gods prouidence to preserue the Church from error.</hi> As if the Pope were the Church, and not rather Antichrist, and the enemy of Christ and his Church: or as if the church could not stand if the Pope were dead, and <hi>Parsons</hi> hanged by him to beare

               <p>Fol. 113. 2. encont. c. 14. he saith, <hi>That Parry</hi> in his letter to <hi>Gregory the thirteenth, discouered no intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enterprise he had in hand:</hi> and thereby would shift off our obiection concerning the intelligence the Pope had of his purpose to kill the Quéene. But his shift is very simple. For albeit he said nothing, yet the letters of credit included fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some great man, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he imparted the secret, disclosed all. Now it is euident by Cardinall <hi>Comoes</hi> letter, that the Pope receiued <hi>Parries</hi> letter together with the letters of credit included. <hi>La santitá di N. S.</hi> (sayth Cardinall <hi>Como) havedute le lettere di V. S. con la fede inclusa.</hi> By this then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that the Pope granting a plenary indulgence to a murderer, that went to kill an innocent Queene, was also a most execrable murderer, and no shepheard: a limb of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that was a murderer from the begining, and not the head of the Church; a wolfe, and no Christian Bishop. <hi>Yea but</hi> (saith <hi>Parsons) this indulgence tooke effect, if Parry were contrite and confessed of his sinnes.</hi> As if these wicked mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers did not account it an act meritorious to kill a Prince excommunicated by the Pope. So it appeareth, that in this respect rather he obtained this indulgence. Nay if <hi>Ch. P.</hi> say true, <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> was also acquainted with <hi>Parries</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular treason, so that this will not onely remaine as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall blot of indulgences, but also of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>In his obseruations vpon <hi>Sir Francis Hastings</hi> his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, fol. 10. b. he vanteth of his heroicall actes and exploits against him, as if his reputation were not onely <hi>crased and shaken,</hi> but also <hi>quite ouerthrowne,</hi> and that by his terrible <hi>Warneword.</hi> Afterward he talketh vainely, as if he had not onely <hi>battered and beaten,</hi> but also <hi>broken and shiuered</hi> his credit. But it séemes the man when he vttered these great words had swallowed too much Gréeke wine, and was in some distemper. His friends do wish, that he had as much skill in the Gréeke tongue, as he hath delight in Gréeke and Spanish wine, not doubting but he would then speake good Gréeke. But now (God wot) his wits are wind-shaken with the fume of wine, and his braine discrasied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of his <hi>Iaponian</hi> kingdome. As for his battering, beating, breaking and shiuering, we do not much feare, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his shins are shiuered with rottennesse, and his wits broken with idle conceits.

               <p>In the same obseruations, fol. 6. he will not haue any man iudge of his matters, <hi>but her Maiesties most honorable Counsell,</hi> to whom he remitteth himselfe. But if he come into <hi>England,</hi> he must haue other iudges: and if he will write, he must submit himselfe to euery readers censure. As for the Lords of the Counsell, they are no fauorable iudges to traytors, that seeke to bring in forraine enemies, nor are they at leysure, to reade such paltry and confused pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets.</p>
               <p>In the end of his answere to my Epistle he talketh <hi>of his exceeding gaine both in merit with God, and credit with all good men:</hi> which sheweth, that he wanteth not onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,

               <p>In the same enconter c. 4. he talketh of his challenges of disputation, refusing altogether to procure vs libertie to dispute in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> But if any disputation be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I assure my selfe, <hi>Parsons</hi> will be none of the party, being ignorant of tongues, slow of capacitie, and shallow in all learning.

               <p>STrange it is, that <hi>Parsons</hi> and his mates should accuse others, either for flattering, or else for lying, whereas we are cleare of these faults, and they most guilty.

                  <hi>Robert Parsons taketh vp Sir Francis,</hi> as he sayth, fol. 23. <hi>for a false and flattering Prophet, by these words of Isay 3. My people, they that say thou art blessed, are those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thee.</hi> But first, the Prophet talketh of deceiuing, and not of flattering. Looke then how farre deceit differeth from flattery, so farre shot <hi>Parsons</hi> wide from the scope of the Prophet. Secondly, the words of the Prophet do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touch the Sodomiticall priests, and that filthy gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then vs. For he speaketh in that place of such, <hi>as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:25623:187"/>
layd open their sinnes, as did the people of Sodome: Qui pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum suum quasi Sodoma praedicauerunt.</hi> Which is the case of the Romanists. For albeit the whole world cryeth shame vpon them for their corruptions in doctrine and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in liuing; yet with them all Sodomiticall filthinesse is holinesse, and all truth heresie, and many corrupt points of doctrine, religion. Thirdly, it is no flattery for Christians to commend religion, or good subiects to like well of good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. Which being the case of <hi>Sir Francis,</hi> how is he accused of flattery? Finally, this patch hath forgotten his <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 115. <hi>art.</hi> 1. doth define <hi>flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be immoderat prayse for hope of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Likewise it is the custome of papists to flatter Princes, hoping thereby to allure them to defend their sect.

               <p>This is also a great part of the argument of their lying legends, to set out the prayses of Monkes, Friars and such like superstitious Papists.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Parsons</hi> doth further threaten, to shew out of <hi>M. Foxe,</hi> and others of our writers, infinite doctrinall lies.

For most false it is, <hi>that either the rebels in king Richard</hi> the second his dayes, or else the friars, whom <hi>Thomas Walsingham</hi> called lyars, were <hi>Wickleffes schollers:</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this shamelesse frier affirmeth both.

               <p>It is a common tricke also of Papists, to proue their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with lies &amp; fables. To proue transsubstantiation, they make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>To proue the real presence, they make tales of bloud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the sacrament, and sometimes they say Christ appeared like a litle child: which are toyes to mock children withall.</p>

               </gap>, is K. and the man is noted among his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a great quareller about his commons.

The fellow talketh idly of <hi>new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> but neither doeth he know what is new, nor what is old, nor what belongeth to religion, that taketh popery for religion, and estéemeth the masse and decretaliue doctrine, which this Church of <hi>England</hi> refuseth, to be auncient: and the apostolike faith which we professe, to be new.</p>
            <p>The fourth is termed <hi>A briefe and cleare confutation of a new, vaine, and vanting challenge:</hi> and is directed against a treatise set out some two or thrée yeares agone by mee; wherein is proued, that the Masse-priests and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are neither Catholikes nor good Christians. But so learnedly and wisely hath the author of this braggard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> handled the matter, that his good friends are sory to sée so worthy a worke misnamed. For if he had done me right he should haue called his pamphlet <hi>A confirmation of my challenge,</hi> for so in truth it is, the author answering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, and rather by silence consenting, then by good answering contradicting our arguments. The most of his discourse standeth vpon bitter railing, vaine talking, and childish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> about serious matters. If any man doubted whether popery were heresie before, I doubt not but that this weake discourse, that yéeldeth no satisfaction to any indifferent Reader may resolue him. The author of this deuise, as we are credibly informed, is <hi>VValpoole,</hi> the ruler of the kitchin or porredge pot of the colledge of yong English popish traitors in <hi>Rome.</hi> In Italian they call him
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:25623:192"/>
               <hi>Padre ministro,</hi> or <hi>padre de minestra,</hi> or Lord chiefe steward of the schollers porredge. The same man is that <hi>Walpoole</hi> that gaue poyson to <hi>Squire,</hi> and corrupted him by promises of great rewards, both in this life and the life to come, if he would vndertake to empoyson Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; the late Earle of <hi>Essex:</hi> and hauing gained a promise at his hands, swore him vpon the sacrament to performe the same. The fellow is recorded in publike act bookes for these infamous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and knowne to be a notorious traitor and an atheist. We are not therfore much to maruell, if this wicked Iebusites libel be ful of bitternes, atheisme and poison, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding from so impious an atheist, and so cunning a master in the art of empoisoning. If any thing wanted in <hi>Walpool,</hi> whose wits are grosse &amp; muddy, like a standing poole or sink of villany: yet was the same bountifully supplied by <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> the Rector of the quire of Romish conspirators. You may then imagine what a loade of leasings, calumniations and fooleries such two coach horses were able to draw out of their miry inuentions. Much are the simple papists to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, that liste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to such wicked traitors, and suffer themselues to be abused by such notorious and infamous impostors.</p>
            <p>Unto all these libels there are seueral answers in making. If they be not presently answered, maruel not. They are of too large a blocke to be read ouer hastily. My countrimen thinke, if the whole impressions of these foure books might be had, that they would wel serue to paue <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> causy. There would onely be this difference, that for cobble stones and rough slates, we should haue cobbled bookes and rough hewne libels, as fit to be troden vpon as read ouer. Others think, because they are in forme octagonall, and for the most part as thick as long made like brick-bats, that they would finely serue, séeing the holy father is said to be the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pope-holy church, to lay vpon him, for the rearing vp of the wals of some Romish synagogue: &amp; so it wold be, like foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like wals.

It is a sufficient course of conuiction of them to declare their perfidious falshood.</hi> So writeth <hi>Hierome</hi> in an epistle to <hi>Marcella</hi> of like stuffe. <hi>Haec sunt, quae coargutione non indigent: perfidiam eorum exposuisse, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perasse est.</hi> Big they looke, if we respect the bulk: but nothing is more friuolous, if we respect the matter. Out of great heapes of chaffe, there is no corne to be gathered: neither can we expect better substance out of these fardles of wast paper, which like chaffe may be blowne away with any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blast of reason and discussion.</p>
            <p>All of them are of like argument, and for the most part repeate the same things. <hi>Parsons</hi> he playeth the part of that friuolous pleader, of whom <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh in his 86. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle. <hi>Eadem atque eadem saepe dicit, non aliud inueniendo quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, nisi quod inaniter, &amp; adrem non pertinens dicit. He inculcateth the same things often, finding nothing else to say, but that he repeateth matters vainely, and which are not to the purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The authors spread abroade shamefull rumors against most honest and innocent men, and that which procéeded first from themselues, they pretend to haue heard of others, being themselues both the authors and amplifiers of those rumors. Such fellowes <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Furia de vid. seruand.</hi> doth rightly describe. <hi>Hirumores turpissimos serunt</hi> (sayth he) <hi>&amp; quod ab ipsis egressum est, id ab alijs se audisse simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, ijdem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:25623:194"/>
traitors and empoysoners.</p>
            <p>The treatise of thrée conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is deuided into two parts. The summe and scope of the first is comprised in these few words: <hi>England hath bin thrise conuerted to Christian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by preachers sent from Rome: ergo England is to submit it selfe to the Pope, and to accept of that religion which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth vnto vs.</hi> This <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> doth suppose to be a good consequence. For else he should but trifle in his whole discourse, and then especially where he talketh <hi>of our obligation to the sea of Rome,</hi> &amp; of <hi>S. Peters</hi> chaire. Neither doeth he doubt but to proue his triple conuersion, and that in honor of the Popes triple crowne. But if we do well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his grounds and allegations, we shall find, that vnder the title of <hi>S. Peters chaire,</hi> and apostolical doctrine, the man doth séek nothing else but to recommend vnto vs the Popes close stoole, with a decoction of his decretaliue doctrine, and most beastly abominations.</p>
            <p>The grounds of the whole discourse are false, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made out of them, most weake and euil concluding. First, most false it is that <hi>Britannie,</hi> or as <hi>Parsons</hi> sayth <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> was thrise conuerted by preachers sent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Of <hi>Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>Britaine,</hi> whereupon the first suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed conuersion standeth, the obliuious fellow is but lately aduised. For in his <hi>Wardword,</hi> wherein he maketh the best ward for <hi>Rome</hi> that he can, he could not find any more then two conuersions: and those he rather fancieth then proueth. His proofes for <hi>S. Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>England,</hi> stand wholy vpon the testimony of <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes,</hi> a lying pedant full of fabulous narrations, whereto the aduersaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues make conscience to giue credit: of <hi>Surius</hi> a <hi>Carthusian</hi> Monke, and a great eater of stockfish, and a codshead para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site hired to speak for the Pope: and vpon a forged lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal set out vnder the name of <hi>Innocent</hi> the first, wherein notwithstanding we reade nothing specially of <hi>Britaines</hi> conuersion.</p>
            <p>Those that were sent from <hi>Eleutherus</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Christian King <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Britannie,</hi> séeme rather to haue
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:25623:194"/>
bin <hi>Britans</hi> then <hi>Romanes,</hi> as the names of them set downe by <hi>Galfridus,</hi> by <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and other writers of British histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do report. <hi>Lucius</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had no reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to craue baptisme at the hands of <hi>Eleutherus</hi> his mandataries, vnlesse he had bin well instructed in Christian religion before. Beside that the <hi>Romanes</hi> in these times ruling in most part of <hi>Britaine,</hi> it may be a question, how far the kingdome of <hi>Lucius</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it selfe. Suppose then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this historie is authentical, which may well be doubted, the same being onely found in legends and fabulous writers, all the glory of this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must néedes stand vpon weake surmises and fabulous legends.</p>
            <p>As for the Monke <hi>Austine,</hi> he could not speake one <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>British</hi> word, but was faine to bring interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him out of <hi>France,</hi> then called <hi>Gallia.</hi> How then could he conuert them, which vnderstood not one word spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him? We do not reade, that he preached to the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Britans,</hi> but only that he baptized. And very likely it is that he holp onely to baptize those, whom either the <hi>Britans</hi> alwayes remaining among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and submitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues vnto them, or the interpreters, which <hi>Austin</hi> brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him from <hi>Gallia,</hi> which then had a tongue common to both <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> had before conuerted. But suppose that either himselfe speaking <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> or by some interpreter, should haue conuerted some few: yet all that amounteth to nothing, and is scarce worth the speaking of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, suppose some <hi>Britans</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Christian Religion by preachers sent from <hi>Rome</hi> in auncient time, when religion was pure and sincere: yet <hi>Parsons</hi> hath no reason to make any great clamor vpon so small aduantage. For first, all those that are conuerted to religion, are not to subiect themselues to those churches fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence those came that did conuert the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or else to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bishops that sent them. The church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledgeth no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or to the Bishop thereof. Neither doth <hi>Friseland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> that was conuerted by

            <p>The second part of <hi>Parsons</hi> his treatise, wherein he pretendeth <hi>to make search for the religion professed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> is wholly without the compasse of his title of thrée conuersions. So simple was he in his choise, that he could not choose a title to fit his fantasticall worke. Beside that, he seemeth to be blind that could not find our Religion in the auncient Church of Christ for a thousand yeares after Christ, and long after. For there is no point or article
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:25623:196"/>
of faith taught by the Apostles, &amp; receiued by the consent of the whole Church in any auncient and lawfull Councell, but we receiue it and embrace it. Nor do we professe any thing in the Creed of the Apostles, or of the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auncient Councels, which the auncient fathers did not also together with vs receiue and professe. While therefore the light-headed frier ranne poasting through all ages, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to enquire for newes of our Church, which he might sée if he would, in all places: he resembleth much that wise fellow, that could not see wood for trées. Neither is it material that in auncient time he findeth no opposition made against the Popes primacy, or vniuersall power, or to the Masse, or to the doctrine of transsubstantiation, the carnall presence in the Eucharist, the sacrifice of the masse, the 7. sacraments, purgatory, indulgences, &amp; such like. For who seeth not, that it is most ridiculous to make search for opposition against popish doctrine &amp; heresie, before the same was extant in the world? But as soone as any began to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the name of <hi>Oecumenical, or vniuersal Bishop, Gregory</hi> the first challenged him for it, <hi>as the fore-runner of Antichrist.</hi> The worship of images, allowed after a sort in the second Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> though not in such grosse maner as now, was oppugned in the Councell of <hi>Francford</hi> in the time of <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> The carnall presence of Christs body in the sacrament, was not beleeued by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. as <hi>Beno</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and was both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and afterward disliked by many. Transsubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was disputed against by the schoolmen. All the Easterne Church spurned against the Popes head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, his purgatory and indulgences. Neither since the time of the first beginning of these corruptions, did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Albigenses, Valdenses, Wiclephians,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> as they are called, together with diuers others, cease to exclaime against these popish abuses. But (saith <hi>Parsons)</hi> these did not in all things agrée with vs. Yet if he speake of matters of faith, he wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them and vs. If of ceremonies, it is not necessary that al churches shold agrée in all points. Furthermore, if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries had not calmniously layed diuers imputations of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:25623:196"/>
heresies vpon them, which they neuer held; the variation wold not haue séemed so great as they pretend. Wherfore if <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> séeke no better, it is not like that he wil find a Cardinals hat, which, as his friends charge him, he hath long sought.</p>

               </gap> of that which is materiall in <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> his treatise of thrée conuersions. The rest is nothing else but froth of the mans fury and foolery, and containeth only certaine idle inuectiues against <hi>M. Fox,</hi> that good man, &amp; against <hi>M.

He forgot not also to raile against our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quéene lately deceased, and to call her <hi>old persecutor,</hi> and to lay an aspersion of slaunder vpon the State, as if the same did persecute Papists for religion: a matter of which the secular Masse-priests are ashamed, and sticke not to cleare those, whom this conuertible <hi>Proteus</hi> most vniustly chargeth. Finally, his fardle of wast pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers containeth diuers corruptions and deprauations of holy Scriptures, miss-allegations of Fathers, weake col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, grosse errors, rebellious positions, notorious lies and calumiations, which in a large treatise herafter are to be discouered.</p>

For albeit <hi>Gifford</hi> hate religion like a <hi>Turk,</hi> yet he answereth no more, then if by vertue of <hi>Parsons</hi> his thrée conuersions, he were turned into a mute <hi>Turbot.</hi> This K. also of his owne hath added a glozing and flattering Epistle to the King,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:25623:197"/>
a certaine preface concerning <hi>inanimate and vnreasonable creatures,</hi> percase like the Arcadian beasts of <hi>Doway,</hi> and certaine fragments &amp; old ends of diuers stale declamations, made (as it seemeth) at the drinking out of a pot of Kenish wine. His schollers (I heare) gape and wonder at his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible eloquence. But yet the wisest of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> see, that they haue no affinitie with his purpose, and onely serue to fringe his chapters, like as mustie ends of mockado serue to stitch his lacket of <hi>perpetuana.</hi> All the whole amounteth to nothing, saue to declare the man to be a perpetuall railer, and a most sottish declaimer.</p>
            <p>The idle fellow in all his scuruy collection, which he like a surueyor without commission hath made to lttle purpose, doth neither shew wisedome, nor modestie, nor learning. If the fellow had bene wise, he would not haue touched any matter of <hi>noueltie or absurditie.</hi> For therein he giueth his aduersaries iust occasion, not onely to iustifie their religion to be most ancient and consonant to holy scriptures, but also to declare his popish religion refused by vs, to be a packe of nouelties, and a masse of grosse absurdities. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the Komish Church consisting of a triple-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and crosse-slippard Pope, with his guard of <hi>Suizzers,</hi> a consistory of purple Cardinals, that hath neare affinitie to the purple whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a rabble of rakehellike masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests, filthy monkes, friars, and nunnes, with a people worshipping idols, and beléeuing the decretaliue doctrine of Popes, and the decrées of <hi>Trent</hi> is new, and neuer séene before vntill of late. Who doeth not vnderstand, that both the grounds of popery, &amp; the doctrine thereon built is new? For neither can R. shew, that the auncient Church was founded vpon the Pope and his decretals, or vpon traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allowed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that the Church was tied to such senses of scriptures, as the Romish Church alloweth, or bound to follow the old Latine translation of the Bible. Neither can he proue, either out of fathers or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, that Christs true body is both in heauen and earth, and in euery pixe at one and the same time, or that
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:25623:197"/>
his body is inuisible or impalpable, or that there are iust seuen sacraments, and neither more nor lesse, and that Christians receiue Christs flesh with their téeth and mouth, or that the Pope is the head and spouse of the Church, or that he hath two swords, or that any images are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with latria, or that diuels torment soules in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or that the Popes indulgences deliuer soules fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those torments, or such like points of popery.</p>
            <p>Now what I pray you is more absurd, then to beléeue that a man can eate himself, as the Masse-priests say Christ did at his last Supper, nay that a dogge or a hogge can eate Christs body, or that a spider can be drowned in his bloud, which saueth all, destroyeth none, that can receiue it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what is more senselesse then to adore crosses and dumbe images, which neither see, nor heare, nor moue, and whose honor is not séene or knowne of those saints to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they belong, for ought we know? Thirdly, what is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient then to make a blind Pope, that is ignorant of all matters of religion for the most part, supreme iudge of controuersies of religion? Can blind men iudge of colours, or ignorant atheists of religion? Fourthly, what is more blasphemous then to teach, that the Scriptures to vs are not authenticall, vnlesse the Pope consigne them vnto vs? Shall not truth be truth, vnlesse it please the Pope to say it? Finally, seeing faith ought to be most certaine, and built vpon grounds most certaine; the popish religion must néedes be an absurd faith, and a false religion, that is built vpon traditions as well as Scriptures, of which traditions the papists can yéeld no certaine proofe, but are driuen to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage either lying legends, or old motheaten missals, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain customes. It were an easie thing to alleage infinite such like absurdities, of which this surueying K. hath very foolishly offered vs occasion to discourse at large.</p>
            <p>He doeth also very simply talke of the sacrifice of the Masse, <hi>Suruey li.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2. For if Papists say truly, that Christs body and blood is really offered in the Masse, and that euery externall sacrifice requireth a reall destruction: then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:25623:198"/>
that these masse-mongers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> really destroy <hi>Christs</hi> body and blood. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de missa. c.</hi> 2. (sayth) that an externall sacrifice <hi>doth require a reall destruction. Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit realem destructionem.</hi> Was then this fellow wise trow you, to talke of this braue sacrifice? Further do we thinke him wise, that in a booke offered to the king, doth rayle on the kings religion, saying, <hi>That it leadeth vnto atheisme?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it is a note of desperate folly to affirme, <hi>That our religion leadeth to Atheisme</hi> for want of a Pope, or <hi>for want of the Popish masse or sacrifice.</hi> The contrary hereof rather is to be gathered against the Popish religion: wherein, as we may collect out of the aduersaries owne confession in <hi>c. si Papa dist.</hi> 40. the Pope may lead with him thousands of soules into hell. The masse also is a masse and sinke of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and idolatry. Neither is any thing more repugnant to Christs only sacrifice, then the priesthood and sacrifice of the masse.</p>
            <p>Modesty he sheweth none, with a face as hard as a lopster, affirming, <hi>That we teach, that God is the author of sin: That we despoyle Christ of his diuinitie. That we wrong him in his office of redemption, and bereaue him of his title of lawgiuer and priest: And doubt not to say, that Christ dispaired.</hi> Now what greater impudency can be imagined, then to ascribe that to vs, which we vtterly deny and disclaime? Nay, we pronounce him accursed, whosoeuer shall hold any of these points. But the Papists in some things rub very néere vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these rocks, &amp; namely, where they giue to euery man power to satisfie for the temporall paine of his sins, and yéeld, that others beside Christ may be called redéemers, and make the Pope <hi>a law-giuer, able to bind mens consciences,</hi> and giue power to the priest to intercede for Christs body and blood, that God would be pleased to accept it, <hi>as he accepted the sacrifice of Melchisedech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Impudently also he belieth vs, &amp; raileth vpon vs, saying, <hi>that we make euery priuate mans spirit supreme iudge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies;</hi> and that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:25623:198"/>Neither doth he onely raile vpon vs, but also vpon scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where he sayth, <hi>that founding our selues only on scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we open a gate to all heretikes and heresies.</hi> As if the Fathers and auncient Councels which founded their faith vpon holy scriptures only, opened a gap to all heresies. Or as if this could be spoken without disgrace to holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he that relieth vpon the word of God deliuered in scriptures, doth open a gate to all heresies.</p>
            <p>Finally, he taketh vpon him the title <hi>of the legate of the great monark of heauen;</hi> being but a base, fugitiue, renegued companion, set on by Antichrist and his supposts, to raile at religion, and the professors thereof, and lying without rule or order.</p>
            <p>His want of learning doeth euery where appeare throughout his whole Suruey. The Scriptures he citeth very rarely. The Fathers he mistaketh and misalleageth. In Ecclesiasticall histories he is but a nouice. Nay, albeit he talketh much of our Religion, yet he vnderstandeth not what we professe, what we reiect. Finally, although the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low be but a poore translator and collector of other mens slanders, yet could he not well relate that which is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of others. His principal witnesses are <hi>Staphilus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus, Bolser, Nicol Borne, Stapleton, Surius,</hi> and such like railing and base authors. Was it then likely that he should shew learning, that is wholly conuersant in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> authors, deuoyd either of learning, or else of all religion and honestie?</p>
            <p>And all this, God willing, shall by many particulars be verified, by those who already haue vndertaken to controle his Suruey, and to examine euery article of this leud li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell. Not that such an asses head deserueth any curious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, but because such a barking cur dog would be silenced with a sharpe censure.</p>
            <p>It resteth now, that I speak a word or two more of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool</hi> &amp; his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>Fol. 2. he telleth vs how <hi>Heraclitus</hi> affirmed <hi>that the snow was blacke.</hi> But vnlesse he produce his author, his friends with <hi>Heraclitus</hi> may wéepe, to sée his pittifull ignorance. We haue heard such a thing of <hi>Anaxagoras:</hi> but this of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> is ridiculously forged. In the same place he writeth also, how <hi>Zeno</hi> taught, <hi>That it was impossible for any thing to moue.</hi> A matter very stupendious. But this he findeth, that hath read exactly the fathers. Would he name his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, he will make a Stoicke to laugh.</p>
            <p>Fol. 8. he sayth, that <hi>Christs body hath a being in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like to a soule.</hi> But our Sauiour <hi>(Luke 24.)</hi> sheweth a notorious difference betwixt a body and a spirit. Out of his reading of the fathers, he neuer learned that Christ had a body vnlike to ours.</p>
            <p>Fol. 16. he compareth <hi>Christs</hi> body to God, <hi>that is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places.</hi> A matter that tendeth to the destruction of the article of Christs incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and much repugnant to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fathers. Unto these words of <hi>Hilary, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de Trin. Of the truth of the flesh and blood of Christ, there is no place of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> left:</hi> he addeth diuers words, falsifying them in this sort, <hi>Of the true presence of the flesh and bloud of Christ in the blessed sacrament, there is no place of doubting left.</hi> Belike his great and exact study of diuinity, and particular care in reading, will beare him out in it. Yet <hi>Hilary</hi> talketh of <hi>Christs</hi> true incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not of the presence of <hi>Christs</hi> body and bloud in the sacrament.</p>
            <p>Fol. 31. he sayth, <hi>That our bodies are nourished with the body and blood of Christ.</hi> But the holy fathers teach vs, that <hi>Christs body and blood is food for the soule, and not for the body. Cyprian De Coena Domini,</hi> sayth, <hi>We sharpe not our teeth to bite.</hi> And <hi>Augustine tractat.</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioan.</hi> sayth,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:25623:200"/>
               <hi>We are not to prepare our teeth,</hi> viz. when we receiue this holy sacrament. Here therefore this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> followed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> and not the fathers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fol. 174. he distinguisheth <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> from <hi>Vermilio,</hi> whereas this is <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> surname. He telleth vs also that <hi>Flauianus</hi> taught, that <hi>God was the author of all sinne.</hi> But if he produce not his author, it will be an easie matter to shew, that he belyeth <hi>Flauianus,</hi> and mistaketh one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother through pitifull ignorance.</p>
            <p>To bely &amp; falsify the fathers with this bastardly Iebusit, is but a <hi>peccadillio.</hi> Fol. 18. he auoucheth boldly, that <hi>Gregory speaketh not of satisfying for the guilt, but for temporal paine.</hi> But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Gregory</hi> do plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince him of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood. For in him these termes &amp; subtilties are not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</p>
            <p>Fol. 23. he is very bold with <hi>Lactantius,</hi> &amp; maketh him to assigne thrée notes, <hi>by which heretikes may be discerned from true Christians.</hi> But this is more then euer <hi>Lactantius</hi> spoke or thought. He doth also giue suspition by his corrupt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, as if <hi>Lactantius</hi> had spoken of popish auricular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and penance theron enioyned, which was neuer the authors meaning.</p>
            <p>Fol. 25. he writeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Cyprian demonstrated Peter to be the head &amp; root of the church.</hi> Which if <hi>Walpool</hi> had had a true tong in his head, he wold neuer haue affirmed. Beside that, what a ridiculous toy is it, to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slate <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiue to the Pope, that is liker to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Calipha</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> then to <hi>Peter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fol. 27. 31. &amp; 34. he corrupteth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> most grosly, making him in the first place to speak of those traditions of which he neuer thought, &amp; in the 2. to maintaine the vniuersal power of the Pope, which he neuer knew. In the third place where <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath <hi>imaginibus,</hi> he blotteth out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, &amp; putteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>magia,</hi> least he might seeme to speak against images.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he onely bely the fathers, but his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries also. Fol. 114. he sayth that <hi>Aurifaber, Snepfius, Heshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Vergerius, Beza, Musculus, Socinus, and other ministers in this agree, that the auncient fathers are against them, and for the Papists.</hi> A matter neither agreed vppon by all,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:25623:200"/>
nor in these termes confessed by any. As for <hi>Socinus,</hi> he was an Italian heretike, cast out and condemned by our church. Why then is he ranked with honest men? Doth this ranke fellow in this multiforme lie, think it reason to range toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of such disformitie? In another place he affirmeth boldly, that <hi>Luther, Caluine, Peter Martyr, and Melancthon make God the author of sinne:</hi> not considering, as it séemeth, what a sinfull act it is to calumniate and bely honest men. That they are desperatly belied, their words and writings, where they professe and declare the contrary of this which <hi>Walpoole</hi> affirmeth, do manifestly demonstrate. But this monster hath filed his tongue to speake vntruth.</p>
            <p>Fol. 157. speaking of popish <hi>

For neither is this word <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> nor the popish distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the parts of hell, nor the popish doctrine concerning <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> and purgatory, held by any one, much lesse by all the ancient fathers. And thereon I ioyne issue with this disioynted companion, requiring him to answer that which I haue written <hi>De Purgatorio,</hi> and <hi>contra limbum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum papisticum,</hi> to this purpose.</p>
            <p>Of his great skil in Latin, his words fol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Of his skil in the Gréeke, we find good proofe, fol. 54. b. where in two words he maketh thrée faults. First he deuideth this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and maketh it two words. Next he writeth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: and thirdly, he putteth an accent of aspiration in the midst of a word. If he had bene put to vse much Greeke, we should haue had good stuffe, that find him so faulty in this only one Gréeke word.</p>
            <p>To conclude with our partie for this time: neither in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> against his aduersary, nor in defending himselfe, his consorts &amp; his cause, doth he acquite himself in any tolerable sort. Unto me he obiecteth, <hi>that I vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the state of the question.</hi> A matter ridiculous. For he himself cannot deny,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:25623:201"/>
but I report the aduersaries meaning and words truly. He chargeth me also with vntruths. Yet is it no vntruth that I say, <hi>that Stapleton denieth the scriptures to be the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion.</hi> For I cite his words truly.

               </gap> of the Church, which are not to the purpose. But in all this discourse he doth not once attempt to answer any thing said by vs. Likewise in the Challenge, wherein Papists are declared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
