            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This History, as for the raritie and varietie of the subiect, so much more for the judicious <hi>Eyes</hi> it is like to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and most of all for that great <hi>Name,</hi> whereof it dareth implore Protection, might and ought to haue beene clad in better robes then my rude military hand can cut out in Paper Ornaments. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, of the most things therein, I am no Compiler by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, but haue beene a reall Actor; I take my selfe to haue a propertie in them: and therefore haue beene bold to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge them to come vnder the reach of my owne rough Pen. That, which hath beene indured and passed through with hardship and danger, is thereby sweetned to the <hi>Actor,</hi> when he becometh the <hi>Relator.</hi> I haue deeply hazarded my selfe in doing and suffering, and why should I sticke to hazard my reputation in Recording? He that acteth two parts is the more borne withall if he come short, or fayle in one of them. Where shall we looke to finde a <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> whose at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuments shine as cleare in his owne Commentaries, as they did in the field? I confesse, my hand, though able to weild a weapon among the Barbarous, yet well may trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:12162:4"/>
in handling a Pen among so many <hi>Indicious</hi>: especially when I am so bold as to call so piercing, and so glorious an <hi>Eye,</hi> as your <hi>Grace,</hi> to view these poore ragged lines</p>
            <p>Yet my comfort is, that heretofore honorable and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Ladies,</hi> and comparable but amongst themselues, haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred me rescue and protection in my greatest dangers: even in forraine parts, I haue felt reliefe from that sex. The beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lady <hi>Tragabigzanda,</hi> when I was a slaue to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> did all she could to secure me. When I overcame the <hi>Bashaw</hi> of <hi>Nalbrits</hi> in <hi>Tartaria,</hi> the charitable Lady <hi>Call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When I escaped the crueltie of Pirats and most furious stormes, a long time alone in a small Boat at Sea, and driven ashore in <hi>France,</hi> the good Lady <hi>Madam Chanoyes,</hi> bountifully assisted me.</p>
            <p>And so verily these my adventures haue tasted the same <hi>influence</hi> from your <hi>Gratious hand,</hi> which hath given birth to the publication of this <hi>Narration.</hi> If therefore your <hi>Grace</hi> shall daigne to cast your eye on this poore Booke, view I pray you rather your owne <hi>Bountie</hi> (without which it had dyed in the wombe) then my <hi>imperfections,</hi> which haue no helpe but the shrine of your <hi>glorious Name</hi> to be sheltered from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious condemnation. Vouchsafe some glimpse of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable <hi>aspect,</hi> to accept these my labours; to protect them vnder the shadow of your excellent <hi>Name</hi>: which will ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to be presented to the <hi>Kings royall Maiestie,</hi> the most admired Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi>: your sweet Recommendations will make it the worthier of their good countenances. And as all my endevours are their due tribute: so this Page shall record to posteritie, that my service shall be to pray to <hi>God,</hi> that you may still continue the renowned of your sexe, the most honored of men, and the highly blessed of <hi>God.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His plaine History humbly sheweth the truth; that our most royall King <hi>Iames</hi> hath place and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to inlarge his ancient <hi>Dominions</hi> without wronging any; (which is a condition most agreeable to his most iust &amp; pious resolutions:) and the Prince his <hi>Highness</hi> may see where to plant new Colonies. The gaining Prouinces addeth to the Kings Crown: but the reducing Heathen people to ciuilitie and true Religion, bringeth honour to the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. If his Princely wisedome and powerfull hand, renowned through the world for admirable government, please but to set these now Estates into order; their composure will be singular: the counsell of divers is confused; the generall Stocke is consumed; nothing but the touch of the Kings sacred hand can erect a Monarchy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Most noble Lords and worthy Gentlemen, it is your <hi>Honors</hi> that haue imployed great paines and large expence in laying the foundation of this State, wherein much hath beene buried vnder ground, yet some thing hath sprung vp, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you a taste of your adventures. Let no difficulties alter your noble intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The action is an honour to your Country: and the issue may well reimburse you your summes expended. Our practices haue hitherto beene but assayes, and are still to be amended. Let your bountie supply the necessities of weake begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and your excellent iudgements rectifie the proceedings; the returne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose in the end but bring you good Commodities, and good contentments, by your aduancing shipping and fishing so vsefull vnto our Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Yee valiant and generous spirits, personall possessors of these new-found Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, banish from among you Cowardise, covetousnes, iealousies, and idlenes, enemies to the raising your honours and fortunes; vertue, industry, and amitie, will make you good and great, and your merits liue to ensuing Ages. You that in contempt of necessities, hazard your liues and estates, imploying your studies &amp; labours in these faire endevours, liue and prosper as I desire my soule should prosper.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> For my selfe let emulation and enuie cease, I ever intended my actions should be vpright: now my care hath beene that my Relations should giue every man they concerne, their due. But had I not discovered and liued in the most of those parts, I could not possibly haue collected the substantiall truth from such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of variable Relations, that would haue made a Volume at least of a thousand sheets. Though the beginning may seeme harsh in regard of the Antiquities, breuitie, and names; a pleasanter Discourse ensues. The stile of a Souldier is not eloquent, but honest and iustifiable; so I desire all my friends and well-wishers to excuse and accept it, and if any be so noble as to respect it, he that brought <hi>New England</hi> to light, though long since brought in obscuritie, he is againe to be found a true servant to all good designes.</p>

This king was at <hi>Chawonock</hi> two yeares agoe to trade with blacke pearle, his worst sort whereof I had a rope, but they were naught; but that King he sayth hath store of white, and had trafficke with white men, for whom he reserued them; he promised me guides to him, but aduised me to goe strong, for he was vnwilling strangers should come in his Country, for his Country is populous and valiant men. If a supply had come in Aprill, I resolued to haue sent a small Barke to the Northward to haue found it, whilest I with small Boates and 200. men would haue gone to the head of the riuer <hi>Chawonock,</hi> with sufficient guides by land, inskonsing my selfe euery two dayes, where I would leaue Garrisons for my retreat till I came to this Bay.</p>

All which so changed the heart of <hi>Pemissapan,</hi> that vpon the aduise of <hi>Ensenore,</hi> when we were ready to famish they came and made vs wires, and planted their fields they intended to abandon (we not hauing one corne till the next haruest to sustaine vs).<note place="margin">The death of a most rare Salvage.</note> This being done our old friend <hi>Ensenore</hi> dyed the twenty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, then all our enemies wrought with <hi>Pemissapan</hi> to put in practise his deuises, which he easily imbraced, though they had planted corne by vs, and at <hi>Dasamon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peack</hi> two leagues from vs. Yet they got <hi>Okisco</hi> our tributary to get seuen or eight hundred (and the <hi>Mandoages</hi> with the <hi>Chisapeans</hi> should doe the like) to meete (as their custome is) to solemnize the Funerall of <hi>Ensenore.</hi> Halfe of whom should lye hid, to cut off the straglers, seeking crabs and prouision: the rest come out of the mayne vpon the Signall by fire. Twenty of the principall of <hi>Pemissapans</hi> men had charge in the night to beset my house, put fire in the Reeds that couered it, which might cause me run out so naked and amazed, they might without danger knocke out my braines. The same order for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Heriots,</hi> and the rest: for all should haue beene fired at an instant. In the meane time they should sell vs nothing, and in the night spoyle our wires, to make nenessitie disperse vs. For if we were but ten together, a hundred of them would not meddle with vs. So our famine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, I was forced to send Captaine <hi>Stafford</hi> to <hi>Croatan,</hi> with twentie to feed himselfe, and see if he could espie any sayle passe the coast; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pemissapan</hi> sequestring himselfe, I should not importune him for victuall, and to draw his troupes, found not the <hi>Chawonests</hi> so forward as he expected, being a people more faithfull and powerfull, and desired our friendships, and was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him for raising such tales, and all his proiects were revealed to me by <hi>Skico</hi> my prisoner; who finding himselfe as well vsed by me, as <hi>Pemissapan</hi> tould me all.

But the towne tooke the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum before I ment it.

The next day came to me himselfe (of whom I must say this, from the first to the last, he neither spared labour, or perill by land or sea, fayre weather, or foule, to performe any serious seruice committed to him.) He brought me a letter from Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> whose generous mind offered to supply all my defects, of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, boats, munition, victuall, clothes, and men to further this action: and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good consultation and deliberation, he appointed me a ship of 70. tuns,<note place="margin">A most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courtesie of <hi>Sir Francis Drake.</hi>
                  </note> with an hundred men, and foure moneths victuals, two Pinnaces, foure small Boats, with two sufficient Masters, with sufficient Gangs. All this being made ready for me, suddenly arose such a storme for foure dayes, that had like to haue driuen the whole Fleete on shore: many of them were forced to the Sea, whereof my ship so lately giuen me was one, with all my prouision and Company appoynted.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, the storme ceasing, the Generall appointed me a ship of 170. tuns, with all prouisions as before, to carry me into <hi>England</hi> the next August, or when I had performed such Discoueries as I thought fit. Yet they durst not vndertake to bring her into the harbour, but she must ride in the road, leauing the care of the rest to my selfe, advising me to consider with my Company what was fittest, and with my best speed returne him answer.</p>
               <p>Herevpon calling my Company together, who were all as priuy of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals offer as my selfe; their whole request was, (in regard of all those former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and no hope of the returne of Sir <hi>Richard Grenvill,</hi>) and with a generall consent, they desired me to vrge him,<note place="margin">

                  <p>To confirme this they told me of two men that had beene lately dead, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12162:14"/>
againe; the one hapned but few yeares before our comming into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; of a bad man, which being dead and buried, the next day the earth over him being seene to moue, was taken vp, who told them his soule was very neare ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into <hi>Popogusso,</hi> had not one of the gods saued him and gaue him leaue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, to teach his friends what they should doe to avoyd such torment. The other hapned the same yeare we were there, but sixtie myles from vs, which they told me for news, that one being dead, buried, &amp; taken vp as the first, shewed,<note place="margin">Two men ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from death.</note> that although his body had layne dead in the graue, yet his soule liued, and had travailed far in a long broad way, on both sides whereof grew more sweet, fayre, and delicate trees and fruits, then ever he had seene before; at length he came to most braue and fayre houses, neare which he met his Father, that was dead long agoe, who gaue him charge to goe backe, to shew his friends what good there was to doe, to inioy the pleasures of that place; which when hee had done hee should come againe.</p>
                  <p>What subtiltie so ever be in the <hi>Weroances,</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi>; this opinion worketh so much in the common sort, that they haue great respect to their Governours:<note place="margin">The subtiltie of their Priests.</note> and as great care to avoyde torment after death, and to enioy blisse. Yet they haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sorts of punishments according to the offence, according to the greatnesse of the fact. And this is the sum of their Religion, which I learned by having speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all familiaritie with their Priests, wherein they were not so sure grounded, nor gaue such credit, but through conversing with vs, they were brought into great doubts of their owne, and no small admiration of ours: of which many desired to learne more then we had meanes for want of vtterance in their Language to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse.</p>
                  <p>Most things they saw with vs as Mathematicall Instruments, Sea Compasses;<note place="margin">Their simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</note> the vertue of the Loadstone, Perspectiue Glasses, burning Glasses: Clocks to goe of themselues; Bookes, writing, Guns, and such like; so far exceeded their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, that they thought they were rather the workes of gods then men; or at least the gods had taught vs how to make them, which loued vs so much better then them; &amp; caused many of them giue credit to what wespake concerning our God. In all places where I came, I did my best to make his immortall glory knowne. And I told them, although the Bible I shewed them, contained all; yet of it selfe, it was not of any such vertue as I thought they did conceiue. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing many would be glad to touch it, to kisse, and imbrace it, to hold it to their breasts, and heads, and stroke all their body over with it.</p>
                  <p>The King <hi>Wingina</hi> where we dwelt, would oft be with vs at Prayer. Twice he was exceeding sicke and like to dye. And doubting of any helpe from his Priests,<note place="margin">Their desire of salvation.</note> thinking he was in such danger for offending vs and our God, sent for some of vs to pray, and be a meanes to our God, he might liue with him after death. And so did many other in the like case. One other strange Accident (leauing others) will I mention before I end, which mooued the whole Country that either knew or heard of vs, to haue vs in wonderfull admiration.</p>
                  <p>There was no Towne where they had practised any villany against vs (we lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it vnpunished, because we sought by all possible meanes to winne them by gentlenes) but within a few dayes after our departure, they began to dye;<note place="margin">A wonderfull Accident.</note> in some Townes twenty, in some forty, in some sixty, and in one an hundred and twenty, which was very many in respect of their numbers. And this hapned in no place (we could learn) where we had bin, but where they had vsed some practise to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray vs. And this disease was so strange, they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; nor had they knowne the like time out of minde; a thing specially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by vs, as also by themselues, in so much that some of them who were our friends, especially <hi>Wingina,</hi> had observed such effects in foure or fiue Townes, that they were perswaded it was the worke of God through our meanes: and that we by him might kill and slay whom we would, without weapons, and not come
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12162:15"/>
neare them. And therevpon, when they had any vnderstanding, that any of their enemies abused vs in our Iourneyes, they would intreat vs, we would be a meanes to our God, that they, as the others that had dealt ill with vs, might dye in like sort: although we shewed them their requests were vngodly; and that our GOD would not subiect himselfe to any such requests of men, but all things as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed came to passe: and that we to shew our selues his true servants, ought rather to pray for the contrary: yet because the effect sell out so suddenly after, according to their desires, they thought it came to passe by our meanes, and would come giue vs thankes in their manner, that though we satisfied them not in words, yet in deeds we had fulfilled their desires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their strange opinions.</note>This marueilous Accident in all the Country wrought so strange opinions of vs, that they could not tell whether to thinke vs gods or men. And the rather that all the space of their sicknesse, there was no man of ours knowne to die, or much sicke. They noted also we had no women, nor cared for any of theirs: some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought we were not borne of women, and therefore not mortall, but that we were men of an old generation many yeares past, &amp; risen againe from immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie. Some would Prophesie there were more of our generation yet to come, to kill theirs and take their places. Those that were to come after vs they imagined to be in the ayre, yet invisible and without bodies: and that they by our intreaties, for loue of vs, did make the people die as they did, by shooting invisible bullets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>To confirme this, their Physicians to excuse their Ignorance in curing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, would make the simple people beleeue, that the strings of bloud they suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the sicke bodies, were the strings wherein the invisible bullets were tyed, and cast. Some thought we shot them our selues from the place where we dwelt, and killed the people that had offended vs, as we listed, how farre distant soever. And others said it was the speciall worke of God for our sakes, as we had cause in some sort to thinke no lesse, whatsoever some doe, or may imagine to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; especially some <hi>Astrologers</hi> by the eclipse of the Sunne we saw that yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Voyage, and by a <hi>Comet</hi> which began to appeare but a few dayes before the sicknesse began: but to exclude them from being the speciall causes of so spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall an Accident, there are farther reasons then I thinke fit to present or alledge.</p>
                  <p>These their opinions I haue set downe, that you may see there is hope to imbrace the truth, and honor, obey, feare and loue vs, by good dealing and government: though some of our company towards the latter end, before we came away with Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> shewed themselues too furious, in slaying some of the people in some Townes, vpon causes that on our part might haue bin borne with more mildnesse; notwithstanding they iustly had deserued it. The best neverthelesse in this, as in all actions besides, is to be indevoured and hoped; and of the worst that may happen, notice to be taken with consideration; and as much as may be eschewed; the better to allure them hereafter to Civilitie and Christianitie.</p>

               <p>By the History it seemes <hi>Simon Ferdinando</hi> did what he could to bring this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to confusion; but yet they all arrived at <hi>Hatorask.</hi> They repayred the old hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at <hi>Roanock,</hi> and Master <hi>George How,</hi> one of the Councell, stragling abroad,<note place="margin">One of the Councell slaine.</note> was slaine by the Salvages.

On both sides more were hurt; but our men retyring to the water side, got their boat, &amp; ere they had rowed a quarter of a myle towards <hi>Hatorask,</hi> they tooke vp foure of their fellowes, gathering Crabs and Oysters: at last they landed on a little Ile by <hi>Hatorask,</hi> where they remained a while, but after departed they

               <p>Our ships being ready to depart, such a storme arose, as the Admirall was forced to cut her Cables: and it was six dayes ere she could recover the shore, that made vs doubt she had beene lost, because the most of her best men were on shore. At this time Controversies did grow betwixt our Governour and the Assistants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout choosing one of them 12. to goe as Factor for them all to <hi>England</hi>; for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused saue one, whom all men thought most insufficient: the Conclusion was by a generall consent, they would haue the Governour goe himselfe, for that they thought none would so truly procure there supplyes as he.<note place="margin">A controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie who to send for Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

At their setting sayle for <hi>England,</hi> waighing Anchor, twelue of the men in the flyboat were throwne from the Capstern, by the breaking of a barre, and most of them so hurt, that some never recovered it. The second time they had the like fortune, being but 15. they cut the Cable and kept company with their Admirall to <hi>Flowres</hi> and <hi>Coruos</hi>; the Admirall stayed there looking for purchase: but the flyboats men grew so weake they were driuen to <hi>Smerwick</hi> in the West of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Governour went for <hi>England</hi>; and <hi>Simon Ferdinando</hi> with much adoe at last arrived at <hi>Portsmouth.</hi> 1587.</p>

The next morning we prepared againe for <hi>Roanoack.</hi> Captaine <hi>Spicer</hi> had then sent his Boat ashore for water, so it was ten of the Clocke ere we put from the ships, which rode two myles from the shore. The Admirals boat, being a myle before the other, as she passed the bar, a sea broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boat and filled her halfe full of water: but by Gods good will, and the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full stearage of Captaine <hi>Cook,</hi> though our provisions were much wet we safe es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, the wind blew hard at Northeast, which caused so great a current and a breach vpon the barre; Captaine <hi>Spicer</hi> passed halfe over, but by the indiscreet steering of <hi>Ralph Skinner,</hi> their boat was overset, the men that could catch hold hung about her, the next sea cast her on ground, where some let goe their hold to wade to shore, but the sea beat them downe.<note place="margin">Captaine <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and seauen others drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> The boat thus tossed vp and downe Captaine <hi>Spicer</hi> and <hi>Skinner</hi> hung there till they were drowne; but 4. that could swim a little, kept themselues in deeper water, were saued by the meanes of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Cook,</hi> that presently vpon the oversetting of their boat, shipped himselfe to saue what he could. Thus of eleuen, seuen of the chiefest were drowned.

It was late ere we arrived, but seeing a fire through the woods, we sounded a Trumpet, but no answer could we heare. The next morning we went to it, but could see nothing but the grasse, and some rotten trees burning. We went vp and downe the Ile, and at last found three faire Romane Letters carved. <hi>C.R.O.</hi> which presently we knew to signifie the place where I should find them, according to a secret note betweene them &amp; me: which was to write the name of the place they would be in, vpon some tree, dore, or post: and if they had beene in any distresse, to signifie it by making a crosse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. For at my departure they intended to goe fiftie myles into the mayne. But we found no signe of distresse; then we went to a place where they were left in sundry houses, but we found them all taken downe, and the place strongly inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a high Palizado, very Fortlike; and in one of the chiefe Posts carued in fayre capitall Letters <hi>CROATAN,</hi> without any signe of distresse,<note place="margin">They finde where they had buryed their provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and many barres of Iron, two pigs of Lead, foure Fowlers, Iron shot, and such like heauie things throwne here and there, overgrowne with grasse and weeds. We went by the shore to seeke for their boats but could find none, nor any of the Ordnance I left them. At last some of the Sailers found divers Chists had beene hidden and digged vp againe, and much of the goods spoyled, and scattered vp and downe, which when I saw, I knew three of them to be my owne; but bookes, pictures, and all things els were spoyled. Though it much grieued me, yet it did much comfort me that I did know they were at <hi>Croatan</hi>; so we returned to our Ships, but had like to haue bin cast away by a great storme that continued all that night.</p>

And by the blossomes we might perceiue there would be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Strawberries, Respises, Gousberries, and divers other fruits: besides, Deere and other Beasts we saw, and Cranes, Hernes, with divers other sorts of fowle; which made vs call it <hi>Martha's Vineyard.</hi>

               <p>The rest of the Isles are replenished with such like; very rocky,<note place="margin">

Though we met many <hi>Indians,</hi> yet we could not see their habitations: they gaue vs fish, Tobacco, and such things as they had. But the next Isle we arrived at was but two leagues from the Maine, &amp; 16. myle about, invironed so with creekes and coves, it seemed like many Isles linked together by small passages like bridges. In it is many places of plaine grasse, and such other fruits, and berries as before were mentioned. In mid-May we did sow Wheat, Barley, Oates, &amp; Pease, which in 14. dayes sprung vp 9. inches. The soyle is fat and lusty: the crust therof gray, a foot or lesse in depth. It is full of high timbred Okes, their leaues thrise so broad as ours: Cedar straight and tall, Beech, Holly, Walnut, Hazell, Cherry trees like ours, but the stalke beareth the blossom or fruit thereof like a cluster of Grapes, forty or fiftie in a bunch. There is a tree of Orange colour, whose barke in the filing is as smooth as Velvet. There is a lake of fresh water three myles in compasse, in the midst an Isle containing an acre or thereabout, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrowne with wood: here are many Tortoises, and abundance of all sorts of foules, whose young ones we tooke and cate at our pleasure. Grounds nuts as big as egges, as good as Potatoes, and 40. on a string, not two ynches vnder ground. All sorts of shell fish, as Schalops, Mussels, Cockles, Crabs, Lobsters, Welks, Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, exceeding good and very great; but not to cloy you with particulars, what God and nature hath bestowed on those places, I refer you to the Authors owne writing at large. We called this Isle <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Isle, from whence we went right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the mayne, where we stood a while as ravished at the beautie and dilicacy of the sweetnesse, besides divers cleare lakes, whereof we saw no end, &amp; meadows very large and full of greene grasse, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here we espyed 7. Salvages, at first they expressed some feare, but by our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous vsage of them, they followed vs to the necke of Land, which we thought had beene severed from the Mayne, but we found it otherwise. Here we imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was a river, but because the day was farre spent, we left to discover it till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leasure. But of good Harbours, there is no doubt, considering the Land is all rocky and broken lands. The next day we determined to fortifie our selues in the Isle in the lake. Three weekes we spent in building vs there a house. But the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day after our comming from the Mayne, 11. Canows with neare 50.

We saw them haue much red Copper, whereof they make chaines, collars, and drinking cups,<note place="margin">A 'Copper Mine.</note> which they so little esteemed they would giue vs for small toyes, &amp; signified vnto vs they had it out of the earth in the Mayne: three dayes they stayed with vs, but every night retyred two or three myle from vs: after with many signes of loue and friendship they departed, seaven of them staying behind, that did helpe vs to dig and carry Saxafras, and doe any thing they could, being of a comely proportion and the best condition of any Salvages we had yet incountred. They haue no Beards but counterfeits, as they did thinke ours also was: for which they would haue changed with some of our men that had great beards. Some of the baser sort would steale; but the better sort, we found very civill and iust. We saw but three of their women, and they were but of meane stature, attyred in skins like the men,

but fat and well favoured. The wholesomenesse and temperature of this climate, doth not onely argue the people to be answerable to this Description, but also of a perfect constitution of body, actiue, strong, healthfull, and very witty, as the sundry toyes by them so cunningly wrought may well testifie. For our selues, we found our selues rather increase in health and strength then otherwise; for all our toyle, bad dyet and lodging; yet not one of vs was touched with any sicknesse. Twelue intended here a while to haue stayed, but vpon better consideration, how meanely we were provided,<note place="margin">Their return.</note> we left this Island (with as many true sorrowfull eyes as were before desirous to see it) the 18. of Iune, and arrived at <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to sea; and the 24 of Aprill fell with <hi>Flowres</hi> and <hi>Coruos.</hi> We intended as we were directed towards the Southward of 39. But the winds so crossed vs wee fell more Northwards about 41. and 20. minuits, we sounded at 100. fathom,<note place="margin">Dangerous shoules.</note> &amp; by that we had run 6 leagues we had but 5. yet saw no land; from the mayne top we descryed a whitish sandy clift, West North-west some 6. leagues from vs, but ere we had run two leagues further we found many shoules and breaches, sometimes in 4. fadom and the next throw 15. or 18. Being thus imbayed among those shoules, we were constrained to put back againe, which we did with no small danger, though both the winde and weather were as fayre as we could desire. Thus we parted from the Land, which we had not before so much desired, and at the first sight reioyced, as now we all ioyfully praysed God that he had delivered vs from so eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Here we found excellent Cod,<note place="margin">Cod and Whales.</note> and saw many Whales as we had done 2. or 3. daies before. Being thus constrained to put to sea, the want of wood &amp; water cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs take the best advantage of the winde, to fall with the shore wheresoever: but we found our Sea cards most directly false. The 17. of May we made the Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but it blew so hard, we durst not approach it. The next day it appeared to vs a mayne high land, but we found it an Island of 6. myles in compasse: within a league of it we came to an anchor, and went on shore for wood &amp; water,<note place="margin">Their first landing.</note> of which we found sufficient. The water gushing forth downe the rocky clifts in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are all overgrown with Firre, Birch, Beech, &amp; Oke, as the Verge is with Gousberries, Strawberries, wild Pease, and Rose bushes, and much foule of divers sorts that breed among the rockes: here as in all places els where we came, we found Cod enough.</p>
               <p>From hence we might discerne the mayne land and very high mountaines, the next day because we rode too open to the Sea, we waighed, and came to the Isles adioyning to the mayn: among which we found an excellent rode, defended from all windes, for ships of any burthen, in 6.7.8.9. or 10. fadom vpon a clay oze. This was vpon a Whitsonday, wherefore we called it <hi>Pentecost Harbour.</hi>

                     <hi>Pentecost</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> Here I cannot omit for foolish feare of imputation of flattery, the painfull industry of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, who as at Sea he was alwayes most carefull &amp; vigilant, so at land he refused no paines: but his labour was ever as much or rather more then any mans; which not onely incouraged others with better content, but also effected much with great expedition. We digged a Garden the 22. of May,<note place="margin">The Captains diligence.</note> where among our garden-seeds we sowed Pease and Barley, which in 16. dayes grew vp 8. ynches, although this was but the crust of the ground, and much inferiour to the mould we after found in the mayne.</p>
               <p>After we had taken order for all our necessary businesses, we marched through two of these Isles. The biggest was 4. or 5. myles in compasse; we found here all sorts of ordinary trees, besides, Vines, Currants, Spruce, Yew, Angelica, and divers gummes: in so much many of our company wished themselues setled here. Vpon the 30. our Captaine with 13. went to discover the mayne: we in the ship espyed 3. Canowes that came towards the ship. Which after they had well viewed, one of them came aboord with 3. men, and by our good vsage of them not long after the rest, two dayes we had their companies, in all respects they are but like them at <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Isles, therefore this may suffice for their description. In this time our Captain had discovered a fayre river, trending into the mayne 40 myles, and returned backe to bring in the ship. The Salvages also kept their words and brought vs 40. Bever, Oter, and sable skins, for the value of 5. shillings in kniues,<note place="margin">Trade with the Salvages.</note> glasses, combes, and such toyes, and thus we vsed them so kindly as we could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we intended to inhabit in their Country, they lying aboord with vs and we ashore with them; but it was but as changing man for man as hostages, and in this manner many times we had their companies.</p>
               <p>At last they desired our Captaine to goe with them to the mayne to trade with their <hi>Bashabes,</hi> which is their chiefe Lord, which we did, our boat well manned with

14. yet would they row faster with 3. Ores in their Canowes then we with 8. but when we saw our old acquaintance, would not stay aboord vs as before for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage, but did what they could to draw vs into a narrow c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Salvages with bowes &amp; arrows, but not any thing at all to trade as they pretended. These things considered, we conceited them to be but as all Salvages ever had beene, kinde till they found opportunitie to do mischiefe. Wherefoer we determined to take some of them, before they should suspect we had discovered their plot, lest they should absent themselues from vs,<note place="margin">Fiue Salvages surprised.</note> so the first that ever after came into the ship were three which we kept, and two we tooke on shore with much adoe, with two Canowes, their bowes and arrowes.</p>
               <p>Some time we spent in sounding all the Isles, channels, and inlets thereabouts, and we found 4. severall waies a ship might be brought into this Bay. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim there came 2. Canowes more boldly aboord vs, signifying we should bring our ship to the place where he dwelt to trade. We excused our selues why we could not, but vsed them kindly, yet got them away with all the speed we could, that they should not be perceiued by them in the houle, then we went vp the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver 26. myles,<note place="margin">A description of the river.</note> of which I had rather not write, then by my relation detract from it, it is in breadth a myle, neare 40. myles; and a channell of 6.7.8.9. or 10. fadom, &amp; on both sides every halfe myle gallant Coues, to containe in many of them 100 sayle, where they may lye on Oze without Cable or Anchor, onely mored with a Hanser, and it floweth 18. foot, that you may make, docke, or carine ships with much facilitie: besides the land is most rich, trending all along on both sides in an equall plaine, neither rocky nor mountainous, but verged with a greene border of grasse, doth make tender to the beholder her pleasant fertilitie, if by cleansing away the woods she were converted into meadow.</p>
               <p>The woods are great, and tall, such as are spoken of in the Islelands, and well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with many fresh springs.

Leaving our ship we went higher, till we were 7. myles higher then the salt water flowed; we marched towards the mountains we had seene, but the weather was so hot, &amp; our labour so great, as our Captaine was contented to returne: after we had erected a crosse we left this faire land and river, in which the higher we went the better we liked it, and returned to our ship. By the way we met a Canow that much desired one of our men to go vp to their <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shabes,</hi> but we knew their intents, and so turned them off; and though we had both time and provision to haue discovered much more, and might haue found perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture good trade, yet because our company was but small, we would not haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard so hopefull a businesse as this was, either for our private, or particular ends, being more regardfull of a publicke good, and promulgating Gods holy Church by planting Christianity, which was the intent of our adventurers so well as ours; returning by the Isles in the entry of the Sound we called them S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

In the Bay and rivers are many Isles both great &amp; small, some woody, some plaine, most of them low and not inhabited. This Bay lyeth North and South, in which the water floweth neare 200. myles, and hath a channell for 140 myles, of depth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 6 and 15 fadome, holding in breadth for the most part 10 or 14 myles. From the head of the Bay to the Northwest, the land is mountanous, and so in a manner from thence by a Southwest line; So that the more Southward, the farther off from the Bay are those mountaines. From which fall certaine brookes which after come to fiue principall navigable rivers. These run from the Northwest into the South east, and so into the West side of the Bay, where the fall of every River is within 20 or 15 myles one of another.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note>The mountaines are of divers natures: for at the head of the Bay the rockes are of a composition like Mill stones. Some of Marble, &amp;c. And many peeces like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall we found, as throwne downe by water from those mountaines. For in Winter they are covered with much snow, and when it dissolveth the waters fall with such violence, that it causeth great inundations in some narrow valleyes, which is scarce perceived being once in the rivers. These waters wash from the rocks such glistering tinctures, that the ground in some places seemeth as guilded, where both the rocks and the earth are so splendent to behold, <hi>that better iudgements then ours might haue beene perswaded, they contained more then probabilities.</hi> The vesture of the earth in most places doth manifestly proue the nature of the soyle to be lusty and very rich. The colour of the earth we found in diverse places,<note place="margin">The soyle.</note> resembleth <hi>bole Armoniac, terra sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> and <hi>Lemnia,</hi> Fullers earth, Marle, and divers other such appearances. But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for the most part it is a blacke sandy mould, in some places a fat slimy clay, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places a very barren gravell. But the best ground is knowne by the vesture it beareth, as by the greatnesse of trees, or abundance of weeds, &amp;c.</p>

               <note place="margin">The valleyes.</note>The Country is not mountanous, nor yet low, but such pleasant plaine hils, and fertile valleyes, one prettily crossing another, &amp; watered so conveniently with fresh brookes and springs,<note place="margin">Plaines.</note> no lesse commodious, then delightsome. By the rivers are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plaine marishes, containing some 20 some 100. some 200 Acres, some more, some lesse.

            <p>On the west side of the Bay, we sayd were 5. faire and delightfull navigable rivers. The first of those, and the next to the mouth of the Bay hath his course from the West Northwest.<note place="margin">The river <hi>Powhatan.</hi>

Such great and well proportioned men are seldome seene, for they seemed like Giants to the English, yea and to the neighbours, yet seemed of an honest and simple disposition, with much adoe restrained from ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vs as Gods.

The Acornes of one kinde, whose barke is more white then the other, &amp; somewhat sweetish, which being boyled, at last affords a sweet oyle, that they keepe in gourds to annoint their heads and ioynts.

On these round about the house they lie heads and points one by th'other against the fire, some covered with Mats, some with skins, and some starke naked lie on the ground, from 6 to 20 in a house. Their houses are in the midst of their fields or gardens,<note place="margin">Their gardens</note> which are small plots of ground. Some 20 acres, some 40. some 100. some 200. some more, some lesse. In some places from 2 to 50 of those houses together, or but a little separated by groues of trees. Neare their habitations is little small wood or old trees on the ground by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their burning of them for fire.

                     <note place="margin">How they strike fire.</note>Their fire they kindle presently by chafing a dry pointed sticke in a hole of a little square peece of wood, that firing it selfe, will so fire mosse, leaues, or any such like dry thing, that will quickly burne. In March and Aprill they liue much vpon their fishing wires; and feed on fish, Turkies, and Squirrels.<note place="margin">The order of dyet.</note> In May and Iune they plant their fields, and liue most of Acornes, Walnuts, and fish. But to amend their dyet, some disperse themselues in small companies, and liue vpon fish, beasts, crabs, oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, land Tortoises, strawberries, mulberries, and such like. In Iune, Iuly, and August, they feed vpon the rootes of <hi>Tocknough</hi> berries, fish, and greene wheat. It is strange to see how their bodies alter with their dyet, even as the deere &amp; wilde beasts they seeme fat and leane, strong and weake. <hi>Powhatan</hi> their great King, and some others that are provident, rost their fish and flesh vpon hurdles as before is expressed, and keepe it till scarce times.</p>

Their arrowes are made some of straight young sprigs, which they head with bone, some 2 or 3 ynches long. These they vse to shoot at Squirrels on trees. Another sort of arrowes they vse made of Reeds. These are peeced with wood, headed with splinters of christall, or some sharpe stone, the spurres of a Turkey, or the bill of some bird.<note place="margin">Their kniues.</note> For his knife he hath the splinter of a Reed to cut his feathers in forme.

His arrow head he quickly maketh with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his bracert, of any splint of a stone, or glasse in the forme of a heart, and these they glew to the end of their arrowes. With the sinewes of Deere, and the tops of Deeres hornes boyled to a ielly, they make a glew that will not dissolue in cold water.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Their Targets and Swords.</note>For their warres also they vse Targets that are round and made of the barkes of trees, and a sword of wood at their backes, but oftentimes they vse for swords the horne of a Deere put through a peece of wood in forme of a Pickaxe. Some a long stone sharpned at both ends, vsed in the same manner. This they were wont to vse also for hatchets, but now by trucking they haue plentie of the same forme of yron. And those are their chiefe instruments and armes.</p>

In stead of Oares, they vse Paddles and stickes, with which they will row faster then our Barges.<note place="margin">How they spin.</note> Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin, the barkes of trees, Deere sinewes, or a kind of grasse they call <hi>Pemmenaw,</hi> of these they make a thread very even and readily. This thread serveth for many vses. As about their housing, apparell, as also they make nets for fishing, for the quantitie as formally braded as ours. They make also with it lines for angles. Their hookes are either a bone grated as they noch their arrowes in the forme of a crooked pinne or fish-hooke,<note place="margin">Their fish-hookes.</note> or of the splinter of a bone tyed to the clift of a little sticke, and with the end of the line, they tie on the bait. They vse also long arrowes tyed in a line, wherewith they shoote at fish in the rivers. But they of <hi>Accawmack</hi> vse staues like vnto Iauelins headed with bone. With these they dart fish swimming in the water. They haue also many artificiall wires, in which they get abundance of fish.</p>
                  <p>In their hunting and fishing they take extreame paines; yet it being their ordinary exercise from their infancy, they esteeme it a pleasure and are very proud to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert therein. And by their continuall ranging, and travell, they know all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and places most frequented with Deere, Beasts, Fish, Foule, Roots, and Berries. At their huntings they leaue their habitations, and reduce themselues into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,<note place="margin">How they hunt.</note> as the <hi>Tartars</hi> doe, and goe to the most desert places with their families, where they spend their time in hunting and fowling vp towards the mountaines, by the heads of their rivers, where there is plentie of game. For betwixt the rivers the grounds are so narrowe, that little commeth here which they devoure not. It is a marvell they can so directly passe these deserts, some 3 or 4 dayes iourney without habitation. Their hunting houses are like vnto Arbours covered with Mats. These their women beare after them, with Corne, Acornes, Morters, and all bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage they vse. When they come to the place of exercise, every man doth his best to shew his dexteritie, for by their excelling in those qualities, they get their wiues. Fortie yards will they shoot levell, or very neare the marke, and 120 is their best at Random. At their huntings in the deserts they are commonly two or three hundred together. Having found the Deere, they environ them with many fires, &amp; betwixt the fires they place themselues. And some take their stands in the midsts. The Deere being thus feared by the fires, and their voyces, they chase them so long within that circle, that many times they kill 6, 8, 10, or 15 at a hunting. They vse also to driue them into some narrow poynt of land, when they find that advantage; and so force them into the river, where with their boats they haue <hi>Ambuscadoes</hi> to kill them. When they haue shot a Deere by land, they follow him like bloud-hounds by the bloud, and straine, and oftentimes so take them. Hares, Partridges, Turkies, or Egges, fat or leane, young or old, they devoure all they can catch in their power. In one of these huntings they found me in the discovery of the head of the river of <hi>Chicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamania,</hi> where they slew my men, and tooke me prisoner in a Bogmire, where I saw those exercises, and gathered these Observations.</p>

Thus shrowding his body in the skinne by stalking, he approacheth the Deere, creeping on the ground from one tree to another.

Being for most part of such tender educations, and small experience in Martiall accidents, because they found not English Cities, nor such faire houses, nor at their owne wishes any of their accustomed dainties, with feather beds and downe pillowes, Tavernes and Alehouses in every breathing place, neither such plentie of gold and silver and dissolute libertie, as they expected, had little or no care or any thing, but to pamper their bellies, to fly away with our Pinnaces, or procure their meanes to returne for <hi>England.</hi> For the Country was to them a misery, a ruine, a death, a hell, and their reports here, and their actions there according.</p>

And those with their great words deluded the world with such strange promises, as abused the businesse much worse then the rest. For the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being builded vpon the foundation of their fained experience, the planters, the money and meanes haue still miscarried: yet they ever returning, and the planters so farre absent, who could contradict their excuses? which, still to maintaine their vaine glory and estimation, from time to time haue vsed such diligence as made them passe for truths, though nothing more false.

               </p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Bartholomew Gosnoll,</hi> one of the first movers of this plantation, having many yeares solicited many of his friends, but found small assistants; at last prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with some Gentlemen, as Captaine <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edward-maria Wingfield,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Robert Hunt,</hi> and divers others, who depended a yeare vpon his proiects, but nothing could be effected, till by their great charge and industrie, it came to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by certaine of the Nobilitie, Gentry, and Marchants, so that his Maiestie by his letters patents, gaue commission for establishing Councels, to direct here; and to governe, and to execute there. To effect this, was spent another yeare, and by that, three ships were provided, one of 100 Tuns, another of 40. and a Pinnace of 20. The transportation of the company was committed to Captaine <hi>Christopher New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> a Marriner well practised for the Westerne parts of <hi>America.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orders for government.</note> But their orders for government were put in a box, not to be opened, nor the governours knowne vntill they arrived in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 19 of December, 1606. we set sayle from Blackwall, but by vnprosperous winds, were kept six weekes in the sight of <hi>England</hi>; all which time, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hunt</hi> our Preacher, was so weake and sicke, that few expected his recovery. Yet although he were but twentie myles from his habitation (the time we were in the Downes) and notwithstanding the stormy weather, nor the scandalous imputations (of some few, little better then Atheists, of the greatest ranke amongst vs) suggested against him, all this could never force from him so much as a seeming desire to leaue the busines, but preferred the service of God, in so good a voyage, before any affection to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with his godlesse foes, whose disasterous designes (could they haue prevailed)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12162:34"/>
had even then overthrowne the businesse, so many discontents did then arise, had he not with the water of patience, and his godly exhortations (but chiefly by his true devoted examples) quenched those flames of envie, and dissention.</p>
               <p>We watered at the Canaries, we traded with the Salvages at <hi>Dominica</hi>; three weekes we spent in refreshing our selues amongst these west-India Isles; in <hi>Gwardalupa</hi> we found a bath so hot, as in it we boyled Porck as well as over the fire. And at a little Isle called <hi>Monica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Monica</hi> an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented Isle full of Birds.</note> we tooke from the bushes with our hands, neare two hogsh-heads full of Birds in three or foure houres. In <hi>Mevis, Mona,</hi> and the Virgin Isles, we spent some time, where, with a lothsome beast like a Crocodil, called a Gwayn, Tortoises, Pellicans, Parrots, and fishes, we daily feasted. Gone from thence in search of <hi>Virginia,</hi> the company was not a little discomforted, seeing the Marriners had 3 dayes passed their reckoning and found no land, so that Captaine <hi>Ratliffe</hi> (Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Pinnace) rather desired to beare vp the helme to returne for <hi>England,</hi> then make further search. But God the guider of all good actions, forcing them by an extreame storme to hull all night, did driue them by his providence to their desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Port, beyond all their expectations, for never any of them had seene that coast. The first land they made they called <hi>Cape Henry</hi>; where thirtie of them recreating themselues on shore,<note place="margin">Their first landing.</note> were assaulted by fiue Salvages, who hurt two of the English very dangerously. That night was the box opened, and the orders read, in which <hi>Bartholomew Gosnoll, Iohn Smith, Edward Wingfield, Christopher Newport, Iohn Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe, Iohn Martin,</hi> and <hi>George Kendall,</hi> were named to be the Councell, and to choose a President amongst them for a yeare, who with the Councell should governe. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moment were to be examined by a Iury, but determined by the maior part of the Councell, in which the President had two voyces. Vntill the 13 of May they sought a place to plant in,<note place="margin">Matters of government.</note> then the Councell was sworne, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wingfield</hi> was chosen President, and an Oration made, why Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> was not admitted of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell as the rest.</p>
               <p>Now falleth every man to worke, the Councell contriue the Fort, the rest cut downe trees to make place to pitch their Tents; some provide clapbord to relade the ships, some make gardens, some nets, &amp;c. The Salvages often visited vs kindly. The Presidents overweening iealousie would admit no exercise at armes, or fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but the boughs of trees cast together in the forme of a halfe moone by the extraordinary paines and diligence of Captaine <hi>Kendall. Newport, Smith,</hi> and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie others,<note place="margin">The discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Falles</hi> &amp; <hi>Powhatan.</hi>
                  </note> were sent to discover the head of the river: by divers small habitations they passed, in six dayes they arrived at a Towne called <hi>Powhatan,</hi> consisting of some twelue houses, pleasantly seated on a hill; before it three fertile Isles, about it many of their cornefields, the place is very pleasant, and strong by nature, of this place the Prince is called <hi>Powhatan,</hi> and his people <hi>Powhatans,</hi> to this place the river is naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but higher within a myle, by reason of the Rockes and Isles, there is not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for a small Boat, this they call the Falles, the people in all parts kindly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, till being returned within twentie myles of <hi>Iames</hi> towne, they gaue iust cause of iealousie, but had God not blessed the discoverers otherwise then those at the Fort, there had then beene an end of that plantation; for at the Fort, where they arrived the next day,<note place="margin">The Fort as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by the Salvages.</note> they found 17 men hurt, and a boy slaine by the Salvages, and had it not chanced a crosse barre shot from the Ships strooke downe a bough from a tree amongst them, that caused them to retire, our men had all beene slaine, being securely all at worke, and their armes in dry fats.</p>
               <p>Herevpon the President was contented the Fort should be pallisadoed, the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance mounted, his men armed and exercised, for many were the assaults, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscadoes of the Salvages, &amp; our men by their disorderly stragling were often hurt, when the Salvages by the nimblenesse of their heeles well escaped. What toyle we had, with so small a power to guard our workemen adayes, watch all night, resist our enemies, and effect our businesse, to relade the ships, cut downe trees, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ground to plant our Corne, &amp;c, I referre to the Readers consideration. Six weekes being spent in this manner, Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> (who was hired onely for

               <p>What happened till the first supply.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The occasion of sicknesse.</note>BEing thus left to our fortunes, it fortuned that within ten dayes scarce ten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs could either goe, or well stand, such extreame weaknes and sicknes oppressed vs. And thereat none need marvaile, if they consider the cause and reason, which was this; whilest the ships stayed, our allowance was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bettered,<note place="margin">The Sailers abuses.</note> by a daily proportion of Bisket, which the sailers would pilfer to sell, giue, or exchange with vs, for money, Saxefras, furres, or loue. But when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, there remained neither taverne, beere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>house, nor place of reliefe, but the common Kettell. Had we beene as free from all sinnes as gluttony, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we might haue beene canonized for Saints; But our President would never haue beene admitted, for ingrossing to his private, Oatmeale, Sacke, Oyle, <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,</hi> Beefe, Egges, or what not, but the Kettell; that indeed he allowed equally to be distributed, and that was halfe a pint of wheat, and as much barley boyled with water for a man a day, and this having fryed some 26. weekes in the ships hold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as many wormes as graines; so that we might truely call it rather so much bran then corne, our drinke was water, our lodgings Castles in the ayre: with this lodging and dyet, our extreame toile in bearing and planting Pallisadoes, so strained and bruised vs, and our continuall labour in the extremitie of the heat had so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs, as were cause sufficient to haue made vs as miserable in our natiue Countrey, or any other place in the world. From May, to September, those that escaped, liued vpon Sturgeon,<note place="margin">A bad Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> and Sea-crabs, fiftie in this time we buried, the rest seeing the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents proiects to escape these miseries in our Pinnace by flight (who all this time had neither felt want nor sicknes) so moved our dead spirits, as we deposed him; and established <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> in his place, (<hi>Gosnoll</hi> being dead) <hi>Kendall</hi> deposed, <hi>Smith</hi> newly recovered, <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> was by his care preserved and relieued, and the most of the souldiers recovered, with the skilfull diligence of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> our Chirurgian generall. But now was all our provision spent, the Sturgeon gone, all helps abandoned, each houre expecting the fury of the Salvages; when God the patron of all good indevours, in that desperate extremitie so changed the hearts of the Salvages,<note place="margin">Plentie vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note> that they brought such plenty of their fruits, and provision, as no man wanted.</p>
               <p>And now where some affirmed it was ill done of the Councell to send forth men so badly provided, this incontradictable reason will shew them plainely they are too ill advised to nourish such ill conceits; first, the fault of our going was our owne,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12162:35"/>
what could be thought fitting or necessary we had, but what we should find, or want, or where we should be, we were all ignorant, and supposing to make our passage in two moneths, with victuall to liue, and the advantage of the spring to worke; we were at Sea fiue moneths, where we both spent our victuall and lost the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the time, and season to plant, by the vnskilfull presumption of our ignorant transporters, that vnderstood not at all, what they vndertooke.</p>
               <p>Such actions haue ever since the worlds beginning beene subiect to such acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and every thing of worth is found full of difficulties, but nothing so difficult as to establish a Common-wealth so farre remote from men and meanes, and where mens mindes are so vntoward as neither doe well themselues, nor suffer others. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>The new President and <hi>Martin,</hi> being little beloved, of weake iudgement in dangers, and lesse industrie in peace, committed the managing of all things abroad to Captaine <hi>Smith</hi>: who by his owne example, good words, and faire promises, set some to mow, others to binde thatch, some to build houses, others to thatch them,<note place="margin">The building of <hi>Iames Towne.</hi>
                  </note> himselfe alwayes bearing the greatest taske for his owne share, so that in short time, he provided most of them lodgings, neglecting any for himselfe. This done, seeing the Salvages superfluitie beginne to decrease (with some of his workemen) shipped himselfe in the Shallop to search the Country for trade. The want of the language, knowledge to mannage his boat without sailes, the want of a sufficient power, (knowing the multitude of the Salvages) apparell for his men, and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were infinite impediments, yet no discouragement. Being but six or seauen in company he went downe the river to <hi>Kecoughtan,</hi> where at first they scorned him, as a famished man, and would in derision offer him a handfull of Corne,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Trade abroad.</note> a peece of bread, for their swords and muskets, and such like proportions also for their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. But seeing by trade and courtesie there was nothing to be had, he made bold to try such conclusions as necessitie inforced, though contrary to his Commission: Let fly his muskets, ran his boat on shore, whereat they all fled into the woods. So marching towards their houses, they might see great heapes of corne: much adoe he had to restraine his hungry souldiers from present taking of it, expecting as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the Salvages would assault them, as not long after they did with a most hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous noyse. Sixtie or seaventie of them, some blacke, some red, some white, some party-coloured, came in a square order, singing and dauncing out of the woods, with their <hi>Okee</hi> (which was an Idoll made of skinnes, stuffed with mosse, all painted and hung with chaines and copper) borne before them: and in this manner being well armed, with Clubs, Targets, Bowes and Arrowes, they charged the English, that so kindly receiued them with their muskets loaden with Pistoll shot, that downe fell their God, and divers lay sprauling on the ground; the rest fled againe to the woods, and ere long sent one of their <hi>Quiyoughkasoucks</hi> to offer peace, and redeeme their <hi>Okee. Smith</hi> told them, if onely six of them would come vnarmed and loade his boat, he would not only be their friend, but restore them their <hi>Okee,</hi> and giue them Beads, Copper, and Hatchets besides: which on both sides was to their contents performed: and then they brought him Venison, Turkies, wild-foule, bread, and what they had, singing and dauncing in signe of friendship till they departed. In his returne he discovered the Towne and Country of <hi>Warraskoyack.</hi>

               </lg>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smith</hi> perceiving (notwithstanding their late miserie) not any regarded but from hand to mouth (the company being well recovered) caused the Pinnace to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with things fitting to get provision for the yeare following;<note place="margin">

Presidents weaknes, and their small loue to <hi>Martins</hi> never mending sicknes, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened themselues with the sailers, and other confederates to regaine their former credit and authority, or at least such meanes abord the Pinnace, (being fitted to saile as <hi>Smith</hi> had appointed for trade) to alter her course and to goe for <hi>England. Smith</hi> vnexpectedly returning had the plot discovered to him, much trouble he had to prevent it, till with store of sakre and musket shot he forced them stay or sinke in the riuer, which action cost the life of captaine <hi>Kendall.</hi> These brawles are so disgust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as some will say they were better forgotten, yet all men of good iudgement will conclude, it were better their basenes should be manifest to the world, then the busines beare the scorne and shame of their excused disorders. The President and captaine <hi>Archer</hi> not long after intended also to haue abandoned the country, which proiect also was curbed,<note place="margin">Another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> and suppressed by <hi>Smith.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> never more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily desired gold then he victuall, nor his souldiers more to abandon the Country, then he to keepe it. But finding plentie of Corne in the riuer of <hi>Chickahamania</hi> where hundreds of Salvages in diuers places stood with baskets expecting his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And now the winter approaching, the rivers became so covered with swans, geese, duckes, and cranes, that we daily feasted with good bread, Virginia pease, pumpions, and putchamins, fish, fowle, and diverse sorts of wild beasts as fat as we could eate them: so that none of our Tuftasfaty humorists desired to goe for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But our <hi>Comaedies</hi> never endured long without a <hi>Tragedie</hi>; some idle excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being muttered against Captaine <hi>Smith,</hi> for not discovering the head of <hi>Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahamania</hi> river, and taxed by the Councell, to be too slow in so worthy an attempt. The next voyage hee proceeded so farre that with much labour by cutting of trees in sunder he made his passage, but when his Barge could passe no farther, he left her in a broad bay out of danger of shot, commanding none should goe a shore till his returne: himselfe with two English and two Salvages went vp higher in a Canowe, but hee was not long absent, but his men went a shore, whose want of government, gaue both occasion and opportunity to the Salvages to surprise one <hi>George Cassen,</hi> whom they slew, and much failed not to haue cut of the boat and all the rest. <hi>Smith</hi> little dreaming of that accident, being got to the marshes at the rivers head, twentie myles in the desert, had his <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iehu Robinson</hi> and <hi>Thomas Emry</hi> slaine.</note> two men slaine (as is supposed) sleeping by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowe, whilst himselfe by fowling sought them victuall, who finding he was beset with 200. Salvages, two of them hee slew, still defending himselfe with the ayd of a Salvage his guid, whom he bound to his arme with his garters, and vsed him as a buckler, yet he was shot in his thigh a little, and had many arrowes that stucke in his cloathes but no great hurt, till at last they tooke him prisoner. When this newes came to <hi>Iames</hi> towne, much was their sorrow for his losse, fewe expecting what ensued. Sixe or seuen weekes those Barbarians kept him prisoner, many strange triumphes and coniurations they made of him, yet hee so demeaned himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, as he not onely diverted them from surprising the Fort, but procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his owne libertie, and got himselfe and his company such estimation amongst them, that those Salvages admired him more then their owne <hi>Quiyouckosucks.</hi> The manner how they vsed and deliuered him, is as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> taken prisoner.</note>The Salvages hauing drawne from <hi>George Cassen</hi> whether Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> was gone, prosecuting that oportunity they followed him with. 300. bowmen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the King of <hi>Pamavnkee,</hi> who in diuisions searching the turnings of the riuer, found <hi>Robinson</hi> and <hi>Emry</hi> by the fire side, those they shot full of arrowes and slew. Then finding the Captaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is said, that vsed the Salvage that was his guide as his sheld (three of them being slaine and diuers other so gauld) all the rest would not come neere him. Thinking thus to haue returned to his boat, regarding them, as he marched, more then his way, slipped vp to the middle in an oasie creeke &amp; his Salvage with him, yet durst they not come to him till being neere dead with cold, he threw away his armes. Then according to their composition they drew him forth and led him to the fire, where his men were slaine. Diligently they chafed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:12162:36"/>
limbs. He demanding for their Captaine, they shewed him <hi>Opechanka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> King of <hi>Pamavnkee,</hi> to whom he gaue a round Ivory double compass Dyall. Much they marvailed at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they could see so plainely, and yet not touch it, because of the glasse that covered them. But when he demonstrated by that Globe-like Iewell, the roundnesse of the earth and skies, the spheare of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, and how the Sunne did chase the night round about the world continually; the greatnesse of the Land and Sea, the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Nations, varietie of complexions, and how we were to them <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other such like matters, they all stood as amazed with admiration. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, within an houre after they tyed him to a tree, and as many as could stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him prepared to shoot him, but the King holding vp the Compass in his hand, they all laid downe their Bowes and Arrowes, and in a triumphant manner led him to <hi>Orapaks,</hi> where he was after their manner kindly feasted, and well vsed.</p>
               <p>Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themselues all in fyle,<note place="margin">The order they observed in then tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vmph.</note> the King in the middest had all their Peeces and Swords borne before him. Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him fast by each arme: and on each side six went in fyle with their Arrowes nocked. But arriving at the Towne (which was but onely thirtie or fortie hunting houses made of Mats, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue as they please, as we our tents) all the women and children staring to behold him, the souldiers nrst all in fyle performed the forme of a <hi>Bissom</hi> so well as could be; and on each flanke, officers as Serieants to see them keepe their orders. A good time they continued this exercise, and then cast themselues in a ring, dauncing in such severall Postures, and singing and yelling out such hellish notes and screeches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strangely painted, every one his quiver of Arrowes, and at his backe a club; on his arme a Fox or an Otters skinne, or some such matter for his vambrace; their heads and shoulders painted red, with Oyle and <hi>Pocones</hi> mingled together, which Scarlet-like colour made an exceeding handsome shew; his Bow in his hand, and the skinne of a Bird with her wings abroad dryed, tyed on his head, a peece of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a white shell, a long feather, with a small rattle growing at the tayles of their snaks tyed to it, or some such like toy. All this while <hi>Smith</hi> and the King stood in the middest guarded, as before is said, and after three dances they all departed. <hi>Smith</hi> they conducted to a long house, where thirtie or fortie tall fellowes did guard him, and ere long more bread and venison was brought him then would haue served twentie men, I thinke his stomacke at that time was not very good; what he left they put in baskets and tyed over his head. About midnight they set the meate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before him, all this time not one of them would eate a bit with him, till the next morning they brought him as much more, and then did they eate all the old, &amp; reserved the new as they had done the other, which made him thinke they would fat him to eat him. Yet in this desperate estate to defend him from the cold, one <hi>Mao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassater</hi> brought him his gowne, in requitall of some beads and toyes <hi>Smith</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him at his first arrivall in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two dayes after a man would haue slaine him (but that the guard prevented it) for the death of his sonne,<note place="margin">How he should haue beene slaine at <hi>Orapacks.</hi>
                  </note>to whom they conducted him to recover the poore man then breathing his last. <hi>Smith</hi> told them that at <hi>Iames</hi> towne he had a water would doe it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would not permit that; but made all the preparations they could to assault <hi>Iames</hi> towne, crauing his advice, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence he should haue life, libertie, land, and women. In part of a Table booke he writ his minde to them at the Fort, what was intended, how they should follow that direction to affright the messengers, and without fayle send him such things as he writ for. And an Inventory with them. The difficultie and danger, he told the Salvages, of the Mines, great gunnes, and other Engins exceedingly affrighted them, yet according to his request they went to <hi>Iames</hi> towne, in as bitter weather as could be of fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But when they came to <hi>Iame</hi> towne, seeing men sally out as he had told them they would, they fled; yet in the night they came againe to the same place where he had

told them they should receiue an answer, and such things as he had promised them, which they found accordingly, and with which they returned with no small expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to the wonder of them all that heard it, that he could either divine, or the paper could speake: then they led him to the <hi>Youthtanunds,</hi> the <hi>Mattapanicuts,</hi> the <hi>Payankatanks,</hi> the <hi>Nantaughtacunds,</hi> and <hi>Onawmanients</hi> vpon the rivers of <hi>Rapaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> and <hi>Patawomek,</hi> over all those rivers, and backe againe by divers other severall Nations,<note place="margin">How they did Coniure him at <hi>Pamavnkee.</hi>

                  <l>As if neare led to hell,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>Not long after, early in a morning a great fire was made in a long house, and a mat spread on the one side, as on the other, on the one they caused him to sit, and all the guard went out of the house, and presently came skipping in a great grim fellow, all painted over with coale, mingled with oyle; and many Snakes and Wesels skins stuffed with mosse, and all their tayles tyed together, so as they met on the crowne of his head in a tassell; and round about the tassell was as a Coronet of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the skins hanging round about his head, backe, and shoulders, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner covered his face; with a hellish voyce and a rattle in his hand. With most strange gestures and passions he began his invocation, and environed the fire with a circle of meale; which done, three more such like devils came rushing in with the like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique tricks, painted halfe blacke, halfe red: but all their eyes were painted white, and some red stroakes like Mutchato's, along their cheekes: round about him those fiends daunced a pretty while, and then came in three more as vgly as the rest; with red eyes, and white stroakes over their blacke faces, at last they all sat downe right against him; three of them on the one hand of the chiefe Priest, and three on the other. Then all with their rattles began a song, which ended, the chiefe Priest layd downe fiue wheat cornes: then strayning his armes and hands with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that he sweat, and his veynes swelled, he began a short Oration: at the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they all gaue a short groane; and then layd down three graines more. After that, began their song againe, and then another Oration, ever laying downe so many cornes as before, till they had twice incirculed the fire; that done, they tooke a bunch of little stickes prepared for that purpose, continuing still their devotion, and at the end of every song and Oration, they layd downe a slicke betwixt the divisions of Corne. Till night, neither he nor they did either eate or drinke, and then they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted merrily, with the best provisions they could make. Three dayes they vsed this Ceremony; the meaning whereof they told him, was to know if he intended them well or no. The circle of meale signified their Country, the circles of corne the bounds of the Sea, and the stickes his Country. They imagined the world to be flat and round, like a trencher, and they in the middest. After this they brought him a bagge of gunpowder, which they carefully preserved till the next spring, to plant as they did their corne; because they would be acquainted with the nature of that seede. <hi>Opitchapam</hi> the Kings brother invited him to his house, where, with as many platters of bread, soule, and wild beasts, as did environ him, he bid him well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; but not any of them would eate a bit with him, but put vp all the remainder in Baskets. At his returne to <hi>Opechancanoughs,</hi> all the Kings women, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, flocked about him for their parts, as a due by Custome, to be merry with such fragments.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>But his waking mind in hydeous dreames did oft see wondrous shapes,</l>
                  <l>Of bodies strange, and huge in growth, and of stupendious makes.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>At last they brought him to <hi>Meronocomoco,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How <hi>Powha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him.</note> where was <hi>Powhatan</hi> their Emperor. Here more then two hundred of those grim Courtiers stood wondering at him, as he had beene a monster; till <hi>Powhatan</hi> and his trayne had put themselues in their greatest braveries. Before a fire vpon a seat like a bedsted, he sat covered with a great robe, made of <hi>Rarowcun</hi> skinnes, and all the tayles hanging by. On either hand did sit a young wench of 16 or 18 yeares, and along on each side the house, two rowes

The Queene of <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matuck</hi> was appointed to bring him water to wash his hands, and another brought him a bunch of feathers, in stead of a Towell to dry them: having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could, a long consultation was held, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion was, two great stones were brought before <hi>Powhatan</hi>: then as many as could layd hands on him, dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines, <hi>Pocahontas</hi> the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his to saue him from death: whereat the Emperour was contented he should liue to make him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper;<note place="margin">How <hi>Poca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hontas</hi> saved his life.</note> for they thought him aswell of all occupations as themselues.

Not long after from behinde a mat that divided the house, was made the most dolefullest noyse he ever heard; then <hi>Powhatan</hi> more like a devill then a man with some two hundred more as blacke as himselfe, came vnto him and told him now they were friends,<note place="margin">How <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan</hi> sent him to <hi>Iames</hi> Towne.</note> and presently he should goe to <hi>Iames</hi> towne, to send him two great gunnes, and a gryndstone, for which he would giue him the Country of <hi>Capahowosick,</hi> and for ever esteeme him as his sonne <hi>Nantaquoud.</hi> So to <hi>Iames</hi> towne with 12 guides <hi>Powhatan</hi> sent him. That night they quarterd in the woods, he still expecting (as he had done all this long time of his imprisonment) every houre to be put to one death or other: for all their feasting.

               <p>ALL this time our care was not so much to abandon the Countrey; but the Treasurer and Councell in <hi>England,</hi> were as diligent &amp; carefull to supply vs. Two good ships they sent vs, with neare a hundred men, well furnished with all things could be imagined necessary, both for them and vs; The one commanded by Captaine <hi>Newport</hi>: the other by Captaine <hi>Francis Nelson,</hi> an honest man, and an expert Marriner. But such was the lewardnesse of his Ship (that though he was within the sight of <hi>Cape Henry</hi>) by stormy contrary winds was he forced so farre to Sea, that the West <hi>Indies</hi> was the next land, for the repaire of his Masts, and reliefe of wood and water.<note place="margin">The <hi>Phoenix</hi> from Cape <hi>Henry</hi> forced to the West <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </note> But <hi>Newport</hi> got in and arrived at <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, not long after the redemption of Captaine <hi>Smith.</hi> To whom the Salvages, as is sayd, every other day repaired, with such provisions that sufficiently did serue them from hand to mouth: part alwayes they brought him as Presents from their Kings, or <hi>Pocahontas</hi>; the rest he as their Market Clarke set the price himselfe, how they should sell: so he

had inchanted these poore soules being their prisoner; and now <hi>Newport,</hi> whom he called his Father arriving, neare as directly as he foretold, they esteemed him as an Oracle, and had them at that submission he might command them what he listed. That God that created all things they knew he adored for his God: they would also in their discourses tearme the God of Captaine <hi>Smith.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>But the President and Councell so much envied his estimation among the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, (though we all in generall equally participated with him of the good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,) that they wrought it into the Salvages vnderstandings (by their great bounty in giving foure times more for their commodities then <hi>Smith</hi> appointed) that their greatnesse and authoritie as much exceeded his, as their bountie and liberalitie. Now the arrivall of this first supply so overioyed vs, that wee could not devise too much to please the Marriners. We gaue them libertie to trucke or trade at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. But in a short time it followed, that could not be had for a pound of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which before was sould vs for an ounce: thus ambition and sufferance cut the throat of our trade, but confirmed their opinion of the greatnesse of Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> (wherewith <hi>Smith</hi> had possessed <hi>Powhatan</hi>) especially by the great presents <hi>Newport</hi> often sent him, before he could prepare the Pinnace to goe and visti him: so that this great Savage desired also to see him.

Then renewing their feasts with feares, dauncing and singing, and such like nurth, we quartered that night with <hi>Powhatan.</hi> The next day <hi>Newport</hi> came a shore and receiued as much content as those people could giue him: a boy named <hi>Thomas Salvage</hi> was then giuen vnto <hi>Powhatan,</hi> whom <hi>Newport</hi> called his sonne;<note place="margin">The excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of a Christian for a Salvage.</note> for whom <hi>Powhatan</hi> gaue him <hi>Namontack</hi> his trustie servant, and one of a shrewd, subtill capacitie.

A long time he importunately desired them, but <hi>Smith</hi> seemed so much the more to affect them, as being composed of a most rare substance of the coulour of the skyes, and not to be worne but by the greatest kings in the world. This made him halfe madde to be the owner of such strange Iewells: so that ere we departed, for a pound or two of blew beades, be brought ouer my king for 2. or 300. Bushells of corne; yet parted good friends. The like entertainment we found of <hi>Opechankanough</hi> king of <hi>Pamavnkee,</hi> whom also he in like manner fitted (at the like rates) with blew beads, which grew by this meanes, of that estimation, that none durst weare any of them but their great kings, their wiues and children.

Good Master <hi>Hunt</hi> our Preacher lost all his Library and all he had but the cloathes on his backe: yet none neuer heard him repine at his losse.

When they departed what there discretion could spare vs, to make a little poore meale or two, we called feastes, to relish our mouthes: of each somwhat they left vs, yet I must confesse, those that had either money, spare clothes credit to giue billes of paiment, gold rings, furrs, or any such commodities, were euer welcome to this remouing tauerne, such was our patience to obay such vile Commanders, and buy our owne provisions at 15. times the value, suffering them feast (we bearing the charge) yet must not repine, but fast, least we should incurre the censure of factious and seditious persons: and then leakage, ship-rats, and other casuallties occasioned them losse, but the vessels and remnants (for totals) we were glad to receaue with all our hearts to make vp the account, highly commending their prouidence for preseruing that, least they should discourage any more to come to vs. Now for all this plenty our ordynary was but meale and water, so that this great charge little releeued our wants, whereby with the extremitie of the

We digged and searched in many places, but before two daies were expired,<note place="margin">An extreame want of fresh water.</note> we would haue refused two barricoes of gold for one of that puddle water of <hi>Wighcocomoco.</hi> Being past these Isles which are many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but all naught for habitation, falling with a high land vpon the mayne, we found a great Pond of fresh water, but so exceeding hot wee supposed it some bath; that place we called poynt <hi>Ployer,</hi> in honor of that most honourable House of <hi>Mousay</hi> in <hi>Britaine,</hi> that in an extreame extremitie once relieued our Captaine.

               <p>Being thus refreshed in crossing ouer from the maine to other Isles, we discouered the winde and waters so much increased with thunder, lightning, and raine, that our mast and sayle blew ouerbord and such mighty waues ouerracked vs in that small barge that with great labour we kept her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinking by freeing out the water.<note place="margin">Their Barge neare sunke in a gust.</note> Two dayes we were inforced to inhabite these vninhabited Isles which for the extremitie of gusts, thunder, raine, stormes, and ill wether we called <hi>Limbo.</hi> Repairing our saile with our shirts, we set sayle for the maine and fell with a pretty convenient riuer on the East called <hi>Cuskarawaok,</hi>

Towards the euening we wayed, &amp; approaching the shoare, discharging fiue or six shot among the reedes, we landed where there lay a many of baskets and much bloud, but saw not a Salvage. A smoake appearing on the other side the riuer, we rowed thither, where we found two or three little houses, in each a fire, there we left some peeces of copper, beads, bells, and looking glasses, and then went into the bay, but when it was darke we came backe againe.

Arming our selues with these light Targets (which are made of little small sticks woven betwixt strings of their hempe and silke grasse, as is our Cloth, but so firmely that no arrow can possibly pierce them:) we rescued <hi>Todkill,</hi> who was all bloudy by some of them who were shot by vs that held him, but as God pleased he had no hurt; and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them vp to the woods, we found some slaine, and in divers places much bloud. It seems all their arrowes were spent, for we heard no more of them. Their Canows we tooke; the arrowes we found we broke, saue them we kept for <hi>Mosco,</hi> to whom we gaue the Canowes for his kindnesse, that entertained vs in the best trivmphing manner, and warlike order in armes of conquest he could procure of the <hi>Moraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacunds.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The Salvages disguised like bushes fight.</note>The rest of the day we spent in accomodating our Boat, in stead of thoules wee made stickes like Bedstaues, to which we fastened so many of our <hi>Massawomek</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, that invironed her as wast clothes. The next morning we went vp the river, and our friend <hi>Mosco</hi> followed vs along the shore, and at last desired to goe with vs in our Boat. But as we passed by <hi>Pisacack, Matchopeak,</hi> and <hi>Mecuppom,</hi> three Townes situated vpon high white clay clifts; the other side all a low playne marish, and the river there but narrow. Thirtie or fortie of the <hi>Rapahanocks,</hi> had so accommodated themselues with branches, as we tooke them for little bushes growing among the sedge, still seeing their arrowes strike the Targets, and dropped in the river: where-at <hi>Mosco</hi> fell flat in the Boat on his face, crying the <hi>Rapahanocks,</hi> which presently we espied to be the bushes, which at our first volley fell downe in the sedge: when wee were neare halfe a myle from them, they shewed themselues dauncing and singing very merrily.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Pissassack, Nandtaughtacund,</hi> and <hi>Cuttatawomen,</hi> vsed vs kindly, and all their people neglected not any thing to <hi>Mosco</hi> to bring vs to them. Betwixt <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobeck</hi> and <hi>Massawteck</hi> is a small Isle or two, which causeth the river to be broader then ordinary; there it pleased God to take one of our Company called M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The next day wee sayled so high as our Boat would float, there setting vp crosses, and graving our names in the trees. Our Sentinell saw an arrow fall by him, though we had ranged vp and downe more then an houre in digging in the earth, looking of stones, herbs, and springs, not seeing where a Salvage could well hide himselfe.</p>

But not seeing nor hearing any people, and the riuer very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, we returned to the great riuer, to see if we could finde any of them. Coasting

the shore towards <hi>Nandsamund,</hi> which is most Oyster-bankes; at the mouth of that riuer, we espied six or seauen Salvages making their wires, who presently fled: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore we went, and where they wrought we threw diuers toyes, and so departed. Farre we were not gone ere they came againe, and began to sing, and daunce, and recall vs: and thus we began our first acquaintance.

Seauen or eight myles we say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp this narrow riuer: at last on the Westerne shore we saw large Cornefields, in the midst a little Isle, and in it was abundance of Corne; the people he told vs were all a hunting, but in the Isle was his house, to which he inuited vs with much kindnesse: to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his wife, and children, we gaue such things as they seemed much contented them. The others being come, desired vs also to goe but a little higher to see their houses: here our host left vs, the rest rowed by vs in a Canow, till we were so far past the Isle the riuer became very narrow. Here we desired some of them to come abord vs, wherat pausing a little, they told vs they would but fetch their bows and arrowes and goe all with vs, but being a-shore and thus armed, they perswaded vs to goe forward, but we could neither perswade them into their Canow, nor into our Boat.

for the most part: God doth know they little knew what they did, nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood their owne estates to conclude his conclusions, against all the inconveniences the foreseeing President alledged. Of this Supply there was added to the Councell,<note place="margin">A consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where all the Councell was against the President.</note> one Captaine <hi>Richard Waldo,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Wynne,</hi> two auncient Souldiers, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Gentlemen, but yet ignorant of the busines, (being but newly arriued.) <hi>Ratliffe</hi> was also permitted to haue his voyce, &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Scrivener,</hi> desirous to see strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: so that although <hi>Smith</hi> was President, yet the Maior part of the Councell had the authoritie and ruled it as they listed. As for clearing <hi>Smiths</hi> obiections, how Pitch and Tarre, Wainscot, Clapbord, Glasse, and Sope ashes, could be provided, to relade the ship, or provision got to liue withall, when none was in the Country, and that we had, spent, before the ship departed to effect these projects. The answer was, Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> vndertooke to fraught the Pinnace of twentie tunnes with Corne in going and returning in his Discovery, and to refraught her againe from <hi>Werowocomoco</hi> of <hi>Powhatan.</hi> Also promising a great proportion of victualls from the Ship; inferring that <hi>Smiths</hi> propositions were onely devices to hinder his iourney, to effect it himselfe; and that the crueltie he had vsed to the Salvages, might well be the occasion to hinder these Designes, and seeke revenge on him. For which taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all workes were left, and 120 chosen men were appointed for <hi>Newports</hi> guard in this Discovery. But Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> to make cleare all those seeming suspitions, that the Salvages were not so desperate as was pretended by Captaine <hi>Newport,</hi> and how willing (since by their authoritie they would haue it so) he was to assist them what he could, because the Coronation would consume much time, he vndertooke himselfe their message to <hi>Powhatan,</hi> to intreat him to come to <hi>Iames</hi> Towne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his presents. And where <hi>Newport</hi> durst not goe with lesse then 120. he onely tooke with him Captaine <hi>Waldo,</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Andrew Buckler, Edward Brinton,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Collier</hi>: with these foure he went over land to <hi>Werowocomoco,</hi> some 12 myles;<note place="margin">Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> goeth with 4. to <hi>Powhatan,</hi> when <hi>Newport</hi> feared with 120.</note> there he passed the river of <hi>Pamavnkee</hi> in a Salvage Canow. <hi>Powhatan</hi> being 30 myles of, was presently sent for: in the meane time, <hi>Pocahontas</hi> and her women entertained Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> in this manner.</p>
               <p>In a fayre plaine field they made a fire, before which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he sitting vpon a mat, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly amongst the woods was heard such a hydeous noise and shreeking, that the English betooke themselues to their armes, and seized on two or three old men by them, supposing <hi>Powhatan</hi> with all his power was come to surprise them. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <hi>Pocahontas</hi> came, willing him to kill her if any hurt were intended,<note place="margin">A <hi>Virginia</hi> Maske.</note> and the beholders, which were men, women, and children, satisfied the Captaine there was no such matter. Then presently they were presented with this anticke; thirtie young women came naked out of the woods, onely covered behind and before with a few greene leaues, their bodies all painted, some of one colour, some of another, but all differing, their leader had a fayre payre of Bucks hornes on her head, and an Otters skinne at her girdle, and another at her arme, a quiver of arrowes at her backe, a bow and arrowes in her hand; the next had in her hand a sword, another a club, another a pot-sticke; all horned alike: the rest every one with their severall devises. These fiends with most hellish shouts and cryes, rushing from among the trees, cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in a ring about the fire, singing and dauncing with most excellent ill varietie, oft falling into their infernall passions, and solemnly againe to sing and daunce; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spent neare an houre in this Mascarado, as they entred in like manner they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>Having reacco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated themselues, they solemnly invited him to their lodgings,<note place="margin">The Womens entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> where he was no sooner within the house, but all these Nymphes more tormented him then ever, with crowding, pressing, and hanging about him, most tediously crying, Loue you not me? loue you not me? This salutation ended, the feast was set, consisting of all the Salvage dainties they could devise: some attending, others sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dauncing about them; which mirth being ended, with fire-brands in stead of Torches they conducted him to his lodging.</p>

Arriving at the Falles we marched by land some fortie myles in two dayes and a halfe, and so returned downe the same path we went.

With this poore tryall, being contented to leaue this fayre, fertile, well watered Country; and comming to the Falles, the Salvages fayned there were divers ships come into the Bay,<note place="margin">How the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages deluded Cap. <hi>Newport.</hi>
                  </note> to kill them at <hi>Iames</hi> Towne.

               <p>No sooner were we landed, but the President dispersed so many as were able, some for Glasse, others for Tarre, Pitch, and Sope-ashes, leauing them with the Fort to the Councels oversight, but 30 of vs he conducted downe the river some 5 myles from <hi>Iames</hi> towne, to learne to make Clapbord, cut downe trees, and lye in woods. Amongst the rest he had chosen <hi>Gabriel Beadle,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Russell,</hi> the onely two gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of this last Supply, and both proper Gentlemen. Strange were these pleasures to their conditions; yet lodging, eating, and drinking, working or playing, they but doing as the President did himselfe. All these things were carried so pleasantly as within a weeke they became Masters: making it their delight to heare the trees thunder as they fell; but the Axes so oft blistered their tender fingers, that many times every third blow had a loud othe to drowne the eccho; for remedie of which sinne, the President devised how to haue every mans othes numbred,<note place="margin">A punishment for swearing.</note> and at night for every othe to haue a Cann of water powred downe his sleeue, with which every offender was so washed (himselfe and all) that a man should scarce heare an othe in a weeke.</p>

                  <l>He doth contemne, not man but God, nor God, nor man, but both.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>By this, let no man thinke that the President and these Gentlemen spent their times as common Wood-haggers at felling of trees, or such other like labours, or that they were pressed to it as hirelings, or common slaues; for what they did, after they were but once a little invred, it seemed and some conceited it, onely as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and recreation, yet 30 or 40 of such voluntary Gentlemen would doe more in a day then 100 of the rest that must be prest to it by compulsion,<note place="margin">3.

               <p>Master <hi>Scrivener,</hi> Captaine <hi>Waldo,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Winne</hi> at the Fort, every one in like manner carefully regarded their charge. The President returning from amongst the woods, seeing the time consumed and no provision gotten, (and the Ship lay idle at a great charge and did nothing) presently imbarked himselfe in the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry barge, giving order to the Councell to send Lieutenant <hi>Percie</hi> after him with the next barge that arrived at the Fort; two Barges he had himselfe and 18 men, but arriving at <hi>Chickahamania,</hi>

The President perceiuing it was <hi>Powhatans</hi> policy to starue vs, told them he came not so much for their Corne, as to revenge his imprisonment, and the death of his men murthered by them, and so landing his men and readie to charge them, they immediately fled: and presently after sent their Ambassadors with corne, fish, foule, and what they had to make their peace, (their Corne being that yeare but bad) they complained extreamely of their owne wants, yet fraughted our Boats with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bushels of Corne, and in like manner Lieutenant <hi>Percies,</hi> that not long after arrived, and having done the best they could to content vs, we parted good friends, and returned to <hi>Iames</hi> towne.</p>
               <p>Though this much contented the Company,<note place="margin">A bad reward for well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> (that feared nothing more then starving) yet some so envied his good successe, that they rather desired to hazzard a starving, then his paines should proue so much more effectuall then theirs. Some proiects there were invented by <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Ratliffe,</hi> not onely to haue deposed him, but to haue kept him out of the Fort; for that being President, he would leaue his place and the Fort without their consents, but their hornes were so much too short to effect it, as they themselues more narrowly escaped a greater mischiefe.</p>

From your Ship we had not provision in victuals worth twenty pound, and we are more then two hundred to liue vpon this: the one halfe sicke, the other little better. For the Saylers (I confesse) they daily make good cheare, but our dyet is a little meale and water, and not sufficient of that. Though there be fish in the Sea, foules in the ayre, and Beasts in the woods, their bounds are so large, they so wilde, and we so weake and ignorant, we cannot much trouble them. Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> we much suspect to be the Authour of those inventions. Now that you should know, I haue made you as great a discovery as he, for lesse charge then he spendeth you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very meale; I haue sent you this Mappe of the Bay and Rivers, with an annexed

Relation of the Countries and Nations that inhabit them, as you may see at large. Also two barrels of stones, and such as I take to be good Iron ore at the least; so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as by their notes you may see in what places I found them. The Souldiers say many of your officers maintaine their families out of that you send vs: and that <hi>Newport</hi> hath an hundred pounds a yeare for carrying newes. For every master you haue yet sent can find the way as well as he, so that an hundred pounds might be spared, which is more then we haue all, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For in over-toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our weake and vnskilfull bodies, to satisfie this desire of present profit, we can scarce ever recover our selues from one Supply to another. And I humbly intreat you hereafter, let vs know what we should receiue, and not stand to the Saylers courtesie to leaue vs what they please, els you may charge vs with what you will, but we not you with any thing.

But this is my torment, that if I escape them, our malicious Councell with their open mouthed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will make me such a peace breaker (in their opinions in England) as will breake my necke. I could wish those here, that make these seeme Saints, and me an oppressor. But this is the worst of all, wherein I pray you aid mee with your opinions. Should wee beginne with them and surprise the King, we cannot keepe him and defend well our selues. If wee should each kill our man, and so proceed with all in the house; the rest will all fly: then shall wee get no more then the bodies that are slaine, and so starue for victuall. As for their fury it is the least danger, for well you know, being alone assaulted with two or three hundred of them, I made them by the helpe of God compound to saue my life. And wee are sixteene, and they but seauen hundred at the most; and assure your selues, God will so assist vs, that if you dare stand but to discharge your pieces, the very smoake will bee sufficient to affright them. Yet howsoeuer, let vs fight like men, and not die like sheepe: for by that meanes you know God hath oft deliuered mee, and so I trust will now. But first, I will deale with them, to bring it to passe wee may fight for something, and draw them to it by conditions. If you like this motion, promise me you will be valiant.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>WHen the Ships departed, all the provision of the Store (but that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident had gotten) was so rotten with the last Summers rayne, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with Rats and Wormes, as the Hogges would scarcely eate it. Yet it was the Souldiers dyet till our returnes, so that we found nothing done, but our victuals spent, and the most part of our tooles, and a good part of our Armes conveyed to the Salvages. But now casting vp the Store, and finding sufficient till the next harvest, the feare of starving was abandoned, and the company divided into tens, fifteens, or as the businesse required; six houres each day was spent in worke, the rest in Pastime and merry exercises, but the vntowardnesse of the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber caused the President advise as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Countrymen, the long experience of our late miseries,</hi>

                  <hi>I hope is sufficient to perswade eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to a present correction of himselfe, and thinke not that either my pains, nor the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers purses, will ever maintaine you in idlenesse and sloath. I speake not this to you all, for divers of you I know deserue both honour and reward, better then is yet here to be had: but the greater part must be more industrious, or starue, how euer you haue beene heretofore tollerated by the authoritie of the Councell, from that I haue often commanded you. You see now that power resteth wholly in my selfe: you must obey this now for a Law, that he that will not worke shall not eate (except by sicknesse he be disabled:) for the labours of thirtie or fortie honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to maintaine an hundred and fiftie idle loyterers. And though you presume the authoritie here is but a shadow, and that I dare not touch the liues of any but my owne must answer it: the Letters patents shall each weeke be read to you, whose Contents will tell you the contrary. I would wish you therefore without contempt seeke to obserue these orders set downe, for there are now no more Counsellers to protect you, nor curbe my endevours. Therefore he that offendeth, let him assuredly expect his due punishment.</hi>

               <p>He made also a Table, as a publicke memoriall of every mans deserts, to incourage the good, and with shame to spurre on the rest to amendment. By this many became very industrious, yet more by punishment performed their businesse, for all were so tasked, that there was no excuse could prevaile to deceiue him: yet the <hi>Dutch</hi>-mens consorts so closely convayed them powder, shot, swords, and tooles, that though we could find the defect, we could not finde by whom, till it was too late.</p>

Long they strugled in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till the President got such hold on his throat, he had neare strangled the King; but having drawne his faucheon to cut off his head, seeing how pittifully he begged his life, he led him prisoner to <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, and put him in chaynes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi>-man ere long was also brought in, whose villany though all this time it was suspected, yet he fayned such a formall excuse, that for want of language Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Winne</hi> vnderstood him not rightly, and for their dealings with <hi>Powhatan,</hi> that to saue their liues they were constrained to accommodate his armes, of whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely complained to haue detained them perforce, and that he made this escape with the hazard of his life, and meant not to haue returned, but was onely walking in the woods to gather Walnuts. Yet for all this faire tale, there was so small appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of truth, and the plaine confession of <hi>Paspahegh</hi> of his trechery, he went by the heeles: <hi>Smith</hi> purposing to regaine the <hi>Dutch</hi>-men, by the saving his life. The poore Salvage did his best by his daily messengers to <hi>Powhatan,</hi> but all returned that the <hi>Dutch</hi>-men would not returne, neither did <hi>Powhatan</hi> stay them; and to bring them fiftie myles on his mens backes they were not able. Daily this Kings wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and people came to visit him with presents, which he liberally bestowed to make his peace. Much trust they had in the Presidents promise: but the King fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his guard negligent, though fettered yet escaped. Captaine <hi>Winne</hi> thinking to pursue him found such troupes of Salvages to hinder his passage, as they exchanged many vollies of shot for flights of Arrowes. Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> hearing of this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Fort,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>Smith</hi> taketh two Salvages pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</note> tooke two Salvages prisoners, called <hi>Kemps</hi> and <hi>Tussore,</hi> the two most exact villaines in all the Country. With these he sent Captaine <hi>Winne</hi> and fiftie choise men, and Lieutenant <hi>Percie,</hi> to haue regained the King, and revenged this iniury, and so had done, if they had followed his directions, or beene advised with those two villaines, that would haue betrayed both King &amp; kindred for a peece of Copper, but he trifling away the night, the Salvages the next morning by the rising of the Sunne, braved him to come ashore to fight: a good time both sides let fly at other, but we heard of no hurt, onely they tooke two Canowes, burnt the Kings house, and so returned to <hi>Iames</hi> towne.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Salvages desire Peace.</note>The President fearing those Bravado's would but incourage the Salvages, began againe himselfe to try his conclusions, whereby six or seauen were slaine, as many made prisoners. He burnt their houses, tooke their Boats, with all their fishing wires, and planted some of them at <hi>Iames</hi> towne for his owne vse, and now resolved not to cease till he had revenged himselfe of all them had iniured him. But in his iourney passing by <hi>Paspahegh</hi> towards <hi>Chickahamania,</hi> the Salvages did their best to draw him to their Ambuscadoes; but seeing him regardlesly passe their Country, all shewed themselues in their bravest manner. To try their valours he could not but let fly, and ere he could land, they no sooner knew him, but they threw downe their armes and desired peace. Their Orator was a lustie young fellow called <hi>Okaning,</hi> whose worthy discourse deserveth to be remembred. And thus it was:</p>

                  <hi>Captaine</hi> Smith, <hi>my Master is here present in the company, thinking it Capt.</hi> Winne, <hi>and not you, (of him he intended to haue beene revenged) having never offended him. If he hath offended you in escaping your imprisonment, the fishes swim, the foules fly, and the very beasts striue to escape the snare and liue. Then blame not him being a man. He would intreat you remember, you being a prisoner, what paines he tooke to saue your life. If since he hath iniured you he was compelled to it: but howsoeuer, you haue revenged it with our too great losse. We perceive and well know you intend to destroy vs, that are here to intreat and desire your friendship, and to enioy our houses and plant our fields, of whose fruit you shall participate: otherwise you will haue the worse by our absence; for we can plant any where,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12162:55"/>
though with more labour, and we know you cannot liue if you want our harvest, and that reliefe we bring you. If you promise vs peace, we will beleeue you; if you proceed in revenge we will abandon the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vpon these tearmes the President promised them peace, till they did vs iniury, vpon condition they should bring in provision. Thus all departed goods friends, and so continued till <hi>Smith</hi> left the Countrey.</p>
               <p>Arriving at <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, complaint was made to the President,<note place="margin">A Salvage smoothered at <hi>Iames</hi> towne, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> that the <hi>Chicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamanians,</hi> who all this while continued trade and seemed our friends, by colour thereof were the onely theeues. And amongst other things a Pistoll being stolne and the theefe fled, there was apprehended two proper young fellowes, that were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, knowne to be his confederates. Now to regaine this Pistoll, the one was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, the other was sent to returne the Pistoll againe within twelue houres, or his brother to be hanged. Yet the President pittying the poore naked Salvage in the dungeon, sent him victuall and some Char-coale for a fire: ere midnight his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned with the Pistoll, but the poore Salvage in the dungeon was so smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with the smoake he had made, and so pittiously burnt, that wee found him dead. The other most lamentably bewayed his death, and broke forth into such bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agonies, that the President to quiet him, told him that if hereafter they would not steale, he would make him aliue againe: but he little thought he could be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Yet we doing our best with <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineger,</hi> it pleased God to restore him againe to life, but so drunke &amp; affrighted, that he seemed Lunaticke, the which as much tormented and grieued the other, as before to see him dead. Of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie vpon promise of their good behaviour, the President promised to recover him: and so caused him to be layd by a fire to sleepe, who in the morning having well slept, had recovered his perfect senses, and then being dressed of his burning, and each a peece of Copper giuen them, they went away so well contented, that this was spread among all the Salvages for a miracle, that Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> could make a man aliue that was dead.</p>
               <p>Another ingenuous Salvage of <hi>Powhatans,</hi> having gotten a great bag of Powder,<note place="margin">Two or three Salvages slaine in dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powder.</note> and the backe of an Armour, at <hi>Werowocomoco</hi> amongst a many of his companions, to shew his extraordinary skill, he did dry it on the backe as he had seene the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at <hi>Iames</hi> Towne. But he dryed it so long, they peeping over it to see his skill, it tooke fire, and blew him to death, and one or two more, and the rest so scorched, they had little pleasure to meddle any more with powder.</p>
               <p>These and many other such pretty Accidents, so amazed and affrighted both <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan,</hi> and all his people, that from all parts with presents they desired peace; retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many stolne things which we never demanded nor thought of; and after that, those that were taken stealing, both <hi>Powhatan</hi> and his people haue sent them backe to <hi>Iames</hi> towne, to receiue their punishment; and all the Country became absolute as free for vs, as for themselues.</p>

               <p>By this you may see for all those crosses, trecheries, and dissentions,<note place="margin">Note these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</note> how hee wrestled and overcame (without bloudshed) all that happened: also what good was done; how few dyed; what food the Countrey naturally affoordeth; what small cause there is men should starue, or be murthered by the Salvages, that haue discretion to mannage them with courage and industrie. The two first yeares, though by his adventures, he had oft brought the Salvages to a tractable trade, yet you see how the envious authoritie ever crossed him, and frustrated his best ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. But it wrought in him that experience and estimation amongst the Salvages, as otherwise it had bin impossible, he had ever effected that he did. Notwithstanding the many miserable, yet generous and worthy adventures, he had oft and long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in the wide world, yet in this case he was againe to learne his Lecture by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.

What shall I say but thus, we left him, that in all his proceedings, made Iustice his first guide, and experience his second, even hating basenesse, sloath, pride, and indignitie, more then any dangers; that neuer allowed more for himselfe, then his souldiers with him; that vpon no danger would send them where he would not lead them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; that would never see vs want, what he either had, or could by any meanes get vs; that would rather want then borrow, or starue then not pay; that loued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more then words, and hated falshood and covetousnesse worse then death; whose adventures were our liues, and whose losse our deaths.</p>
               <p>Leaving vs thus with three ships, seaven boats, commodities readie to trade, the harvest newly gathered, ten weeks provision in the store, foure hundred nintie and od persons, twentie-foure Peeces of Ordnance, three hundred Muskets, Snaphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Firelockes, Shot, Powder, and Match sufficient, Curats, Pikes, Swords, and Morrios, more then men; the Salvages, their language, and habitations well knowne to an hundred well trayned and expert Souldiers; Nets for fishing; Tooles of all sorts to worke; apparell to supply our wants; six Mares and a Horse; fiue or sixe hundred Swine; as many Hennes and Chickens; some Goats; some sheepe; what was brought or bred there remained. But they regarding nothing but from hand to mouth, did consume that wee had, tooke care for nothing, but to perfect some colourable complaints against Captaine <hi>Smith.</hi> For effecting whereof three weekes longer they stayed the Ships, till they could produce them.

that could doe little, but desired to be learners: two Blacksmiths; two saylers, &amp; those we write labourers were for most part footmen, and such as they that were Adventurers brought to attend them, or such as they could perswade to goe with them, that neuer did know what a dayes worke was, except the <hi>Dutch</hi>-men and <hi>Poles,</hi> and some dozen other. For all the rest were poore Gentlemen, Tradsmen, Serving-men, libertines, and such like, ten times more fit to spoyle a Common-wealth, then either begin one, or but helpe to maintaine one. For when neither the feare of God, nor the law, nor shame, nor displeasure of their friends could rule them here, there is small hope ever to bring one in twentie of them ever to be good there. Notwithstanding, I confesse divers amongst them, had better mindes and grew much more industrious then was expected: yet ten good workemen would haue done more substantiall worke in a day, then ten of them in a weeke. Therefore men may rather wonder how we could doe so much, then vse vs so badly, because we did no more, but leaue those examples to make others beware, and the fruits of all, we know not for whom.</p>

               <p>To conclude, the greatest honour that ever belonged to the greatest Monarkes, was the inlarging their Dominions, and erecting Common-weales. Yet howsoever any of them haue attributed to themselues, the Conquerors of the world: there is more of the world never heard of them, then ever any of them all had in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the <hi>Medes, Persians,</hi> and <hi>Assyrians,</hi> never Conquered all <hi>Asia,</hi> nor the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> but part of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> indeed had a great part of both, as well as <hi>Affrica</hi>: but as for all the Northerne parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> the interior Southern and Westerne parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi> all <hi>America</hi> &amp; <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> they were all ignorant: nor is our knowledge yet but superficiall. That their beginnings, ending, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were proportioned by the Almightie is most evident: but to consider of what small meanes many of them haue begun is wonderfull. For some write that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Rome</hi> her selfe, during the Raigne of <hi>Romulus,</hi> exceeded not the number of a thousand houses. And <hi>Carthage</hi> grew so great a Potentate, that at first was but incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed in the thongs of a Bulls skinne, as to fight with <hi>Rome</hi> for the Empire of the world. Yea <hi>Venice</hi> at this time the admiration of the earth, was at first but a Marish, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by poore Fishermen. And likewise <hi>Ninivie, Thebes, Babylon, Delus, Troy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Mycena</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> grew from small beginnings to be most famous States, though now they retaine little more then a naked name. Now this our yong Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in <hi>Virginia,</hi> as you haue read once consisted but of 38 persons, and in two yeares increased but to 200. yet by this small meanes so highly was approved the Plantation in <hi>Virginia,</hi> as how many Lords, with worthy Knights, and braue Gentlemen pretended to see it, and some did, and now after the expence of fifteene yeares more, and such massie summes of men and money, grow they disanimated? If we truely consider our Proceedings with the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and the rest, we haue no reason to despayre, for with so small charge, they never had either greater Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with such certaine tryals of more severall Commodities, then in this short time hath beene returned from <hi>

But ere all was consumed, Captaine <hi>West</hi> and Captaine <hi>Sickelmore,</hi> each with a small ship and thirtie or fortie men well appointed, sought abroad to trade. <hi>Sickelmore</hi> vpon the confidence of <hi>Powhatan,</hi> with about thirtie others as carelesse as himselfe, were all slaine, onely <hi>Ieffrey Shortridge</hi> escaped, and <hi>Pokahontas</hi> the Kings daughter saued a boy called <hi>Henry Spilman,</hi> that liued many yeeres after, by her meanes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Patawomekes.

This was that time, which still to this day we called the staruing time; it were too vile to say, and scarce to be beleeued, what we endured: but the occasion was our owne, for want of prouidence, industrie and gouernment, and not the barrennesse and defect of the Countrie, as is generally supposed; for till then in three yeeres, for the numbers were landed vs, we had neuer from <hi>England</hi> prouision sufficient for six moneths, though it seemed by the bils of loading suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient was sent vs, such a glutton is the Sea, and such good fellowes the Mariners; we as little tasted of the great proportion sent vs, as they of our want and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet notwithstanding they euer ouer-swayed and ruled the businesse, though we endured all that is said, and chiefly liued on what this good Countrie naturally afforded; yet had wee beene euen in Paradice it selfe with these Gouernours, it would not haue beene much better with vs; yet there was amongst vs, who had they had the gouernment as Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> appointed, but that they could not maintaine it, would surely haue kept vs from those extremities of miseries.

               <p>The Lord Gouernour, after mature deliberation, deliuered some few words to the Companie, laying iust blame vpon them, for their haughtie vanities and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish idlenesse, earnestly intreating them to amend those desperate follies, lest hee should be compelled to draw the sword of Iustice, and to cut off such delinquents, which he had rather draw, to the shedding of his vitall bloud, to protect them from iniuries; heartning them with relation of that store hee had brought with him, constituting officers of all conditions, to rule ouer them, allotting euery man his particular place, to watch vigilantly, and worke painfully: This Oration and direction being receiued with a generall applause, you might shortly behold the idle and restie diseases of a diuided multitude, by the vnitie and authoritie of this gouernment to be substantially cured. Those that knew not the way to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before, but cherished singularitie and faction, can now chalke out the path of all respectiue dutie and seruice: euery man endeuoureth to outstrip other in diligence: the <hi>French</hi> preparing to plant the Vines, the <hi>English</hi> labouring in the Woods and grounds; euery man knoweth his charge, and dischargeth the same with alacritie. Neither let any man be discouraged, by the relation of their daily labour (as though the sap of their bodies should bee spent for other mens profit) the setled times of working, to effect all themselues, or as the Aduenturers need desire, required no more paines than from six of the clocke in the morning, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ten, and from two in the afternoone, till foure, at both which times they are prouided of spirituall and corporall reliefe. First, they enter into the Church, and make their praiers vnto God, next they returne to their houses and receiue their proportion of food. Nor should it bee conceiued that this businesse exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Gentlemen, whose breeding neuer knew what a daies labour meant, for though they cannot digge, vse the Spade, nor practice the Axe, yet may the stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed spirits of any condition, finde how to imploy the force of knowledge, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of counsell, the operation and power of their best breeding and qualities.

Our forces are now such as are able to tame the furie and trecherie of the Saluages: Our Forts assure the Inhabitants, and frustrate all assaylants. And to leaue no discouragement in the heart of any, who personally shall enter into this great action, I will communicate a double com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; first,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>George Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> returne to the <hi>Bermudas.</hi>

               <p>But his Lordship being at the fales, the Saluages assaulted his troopes and slew three or foure of his men.

               <p>I told him, by my Interpreter, Sir <hi>Thomas Dale</hi> hath sent you two pieces of Copper, fiue strings of white and blue Beads, fiue woodden Combes,<note place="margin">His message to <hi>Powhatan.</hi>

I replyed, I knew his greatnesse in restoring the Rawre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noke, might call her againe to gratifie his brother, and the rather, because she was but twelue yeeres old, assuring him, besides the band of peace, hee should haue for her, three times the worth of the Rawrenoke, in Beads, Copper, Hatchets, &amp;c. His answer was, he loued his daughter as his life, and though hee had many children, hee delighted in none so much as shee, whom if he should not often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, he could not possibly liue, which she liuing with vs he could not do, hauing resolued vpon no termes to put himselfe into our hands, or come amongst vs; therefore desired me to vrge him no further, but returne his brother this answer: That I desire no former assurance of his friendship, than the promise hee hath made, from me he hath a pledge, one of my daughters, which so long as she liues shall be sufficient, when she dies, he shall haue another: I hold it not a brotherly part to desire to bereaue me of my two children at once. Farther, tell him though he had no pledge at all, hee need not distrust any iniurie from me or my people; there haue beene too many of his men and mine slaine, and by my occasion there shall neuer be more, (I which haue power to performe it, haue said it) although I should haue iust cause, for I am now old, &amp; would gladly end my daies in peace; if you offer me iniurie, my countrie is large enough to goe from you: Thus much I hope will satisfie my brother. Now because you are wearie, and I sleepie, wee will thus end. So commanding vs victuall and lodging, we rested that night, and the next morning he came to visit vs, and kindly conducted vs to the best cheere hee had. <hi>William Parker.</hi>

               <p>But ere I goe any farther, let vs remember there was a running Lottery, vsed a long time in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, where this stood, that brought into the Treasury good summes of mony dayly, though the Lot was but small.</p>
               <p>Now for the points, the first is, for as much as the Aduenturers came in so slackly for the yeere past, without preiudice to the generality, in losing the blankes and prises, we were forced to petition to the honourable Lords, who out of their noble care to further this Plantation, haue recommended their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Countries, Cities, and good townes in <hi>England,</hi> which we hope by sending in their voluntary Aduenturers, will sufficiently supply vs.</p>
               <p>The second for satisfaction to all honest well affected minds, is, that though this expectation answer not our hopes, yet wee haue not failed in our Christian care, the good of that Colony, to whom we haue lately sent two sundry sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and were they but now supplied with more hands, wee should soone resolue the diuision of the Country by Lot, and so lessen the generall charge.</p>
               <p>The third is our constant resolution, that seeing our credits are so farre ingaged

for other rich Commodities there that inrich them, those of the Contraction house were neuer able to subsist by the Mines onely; for the greatest part of their Commodities are partly naturall, and partly transported from other parts of the world, and planted in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> as in their mighty wealth of Sugarcanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first transported from the Canaries; and in Ginger and other things brought out of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> in their Cochanele, Indicos, Cotton, and their infinite store of Hides, Quick-siluer, Allum, Woad, Brasill woods, Dies, Paints, Tobacco, Gums, Balmes, Oiles, Medicinals and Perfumes, Sassaparilla, and many other physicall drugs: These are the meanes whereby they raise that mighty charge of drawing out their gold and siluer to the great &amp; cleare reuenue of their King.

               <p>These I would imploy onely in ranging the Countries, and tormenting the Saluages, and that they should be as a running Army till this were effected, and then settle themselues in some such conuenient place, that should euer remaine a garison of that strength, ready vpon any occasion against the Saluages, or any other for the defence of the Countrey, and to see all the English well armed, and instruct them their vse. But I would haue a Barke of one hundred tunnes, and meanes to build sixe or seuen Shalops, to transport them where there should bee occasion.</p>
               <p>Towards the charge, because it is for the generall good, and what by the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre and other accidents, <hi>Virginia</hi> is disparaged, and many men and their purses much discouraged, how euer a great many doe hasten to goe, thinking to bee next heires to all the former losses, I feare they will not finde all things as they doe imagine; therefore leauing those gilded conceits, and diue into the true estate of the Colony; I thinke if his Maiestie were truly informed of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, and the benefit of this proiect, he would be pleased to giue the custome of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the Planters also according to their abilities would adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a contribution, as would be fit to maintaine this garison till they be able to subsist, or cause some such other collections to be made, as may put it with all expedition in practice; otherwise it is much to be doubted, there will neither come custome, nor any thing from thence to <hi>England</hi> within these few yeares.</p>
               <p>Now if this should be thought an imploiment more fit for ancient Souldiers there bred, then such new commers as may goe with me; you may please to leaue that to my discretion, to accept or refuse such voluntaries, that will hazard their fortunes in the trialls of these euents, and discharge such of my company that had rather labour the ground then subdue their enemies: what releefe I should haue from your Colony I would satisfie and spare them (when I could) the like courtesie. Notwithstanding these doubts, I hope to feede them as well as defend them, and yet discouer you more land vnknowne then they all yet know, if you will grant me such priuiledges as of necessity must be vsed.</p>
               <p>For against any enemy we must be ready to execute the best can be deuised by your state there, but not that they shall either take away my men, or any thing else to imploy as they please by vertue of their authority, and in that I haue done somewhat for <hi>New-England</hi> as well as <hi>Virginia,</hi> so I would desire liberty and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make the best vse I can of my best experiences, within the limits of those two Patents, and to bring them both in one Map, and the Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, giuing alwaies that respect to the Gouernors and gouernment, as an Englishman doth in <hi>Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Now though they be generally persidious, yet necessity constraines those to a kinde of constancy because of their enemies, and neither my selfe that first found them, Captaine <hi>Argall, Chroshow,</hi> nor <hi>Hamar,</hi> neuer found themselues in fifteene yeares trials: nor is it likely now they would haue so hostaged their men, suffer the building of a Fort, and their women and children amongst them, had they intended any villany; but suppose they had, who would haue desired a better aduantage then such an aduertisement, to haue prepared the Fort for such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, and surely it must be a poore Fort they could hurt, much more take, if there were but fiue men in it durst discharge a peece: Therefore a man not well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their conditions, may be as wel too iealous as too carelesse; Such another Lope Skonce would I haue had at <hi>Onawmanient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and one hundred men more to haue made such another at <hi>Atquacke</hi> vpon the Riuer of <hi>Toppahanock,</hi> which is not past thirteene miles distant from <hi>Onawmanient:</hi> each of which twelue men would keepe, as well as twelue thousand, and spare all the rest to bee imploied as there should be occasion. And all this with these numbers might easily haue beene done, if not by courtesie, yet by compulsion, especially at that time of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when all their fruits were ripe, their beasts fat, and infinite numbers of wilde Fowle began to repaire to euery creeke, that men if they would doe any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could not want victuall. This done, there remained yet one hundred who should haue done the like at <hi>Ozinicke,</hi> vpon the Riuer of <hi>Chickahamania,</hi> not past six

Then hauing so many Ships, Barks, and Boats in <hi>Virginia</hi> as there was at that present, with what facility might you haue landed two hundred and twentie men, if you had but onely fiue or six Boats in one night; forty to range the branch of <hi>Mattapanyent,</hi> fortie more that of <hi>Youghtanund,</hi> and fortie more to keepe their randiuous at <hi>Pamavuke</hi> it selfe.

For hauing thus so many conuenient randeuous to beleeue each other, though all the whole Countries had beene our enemies, where could they rest, but in the depth of Winter we might burne all the houses vpon all those Riuers in two or three daies? Then without fires they could not liue, which they could not so hide but wee should finde, and quickly so tire them with watching and warding, they would be so weary of their liues, as either fly all their Countries, or giue all they had to be released of such an hourely misery. Now if but a small number of the Saluages would assist vs, as there is no question but diuers of them would; And so suppose they could not be drawne to such faction; were to beleeue they are more vertuous then many Christians, and the best gouerned people in the world. All the <hi>Pamavukes</hi> might haue beene dispatched as well in a moneth as a yeare, and then to haue dealt with any other enemies at our pleasure, and yet made all this toile and danger but a recreation.</p>
               <p>If you think this strange or impossible, 12 men with my selfe I found sufficient, to goe where I would adaies, and surprise a house with the people, if not a whole towne in a night, or incounter all the power they could make, as a whole Army, as formerly at large hath beene related: And it seemes by these small parties last amongst them, by Captaine <hi>Crashow, Hamar,</hi> and <hi>Madyson,</hi> they are not growne to that excellency in policy and courage but they might bee encountred, and their wiues and children apprehended. I know I shall bee taxed for writing so much of my selfe, but I care not much, because the iudiciall know there are few such Souldiers as are my examples, haue writ their owne actions, nor know I who will or can tell my intents better then my selfe.</p>
               <p>Some againe finde as much fault with the Company for medling with so many Plantations together, because they that haue many Irons in the fire some must burne; but I thinke no if they haue men enow know how to worke them, but howsoeuer, it were better some burne then haue none at all. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards but how many powerfull Kingdomes he keepes vnder his obedience, and for the Saluage Countries he hath subiected, they are more then enow for a good Cosmographer to nominate, and is three Mole-hills so much to vs; and so many Empires so little for him? For my owne part, I cannot chuse but grieue, that the actions of an Englishman should be inferior to any, and that the command of <hi>England</hi> should not be as great as any Monarchy that euer was since the world began, I meane not as a Tyrant to torment all Christendome, but to suppresse her disturbers, and conquer her enemies.</p>

The ioyfull morning appearing, they found their Boat and goods driue ashore, not farie from them, but so split shee was vnseruiceable: but so much was the frost, their clothes did freeze vpon their backs, for they durst not make any great fire to dry them, lest thereby the bloudy Saluages might discry them, so that one of them died the next day, and the next night digging a graue in the Sands with their hands, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. In this bodily feare they liued and fasted two daies and nights, then two of them went into the Land to seeke fresh water; the others to the Boat to get some meale and oyle, <hi>Argent</hi> and his Comrado found a Canow, in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to aduenture to their ship, but shee was a drift in the Riuer before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: thus frustrate of all hopes, Captaine <hi>Butler</hi> the third night ranging the shore in his Boat to seeke them, discharged his Muskets, but they supposing it some Saluages had got some English peeces, they grew more perplexed then euer, so he returned and lost his labour. The fourth day they vnloaded their Boat, and stopping her leakes with their handkerchiefes, and other rags, two rowing, and two bailing out the water; but farre they went not ere the water grew vpon them so fast, and they so tired, they thought themselues happy to be on shore againe, though they perceiued the <hi>Indians</hi> were not farre off by their fires. Thus at the very period of despaire, <hi>Fuller</hi> vndertooke to sit a stride vpon a little peece of an old Canow; so well it pleased God the wind and tide serued, by padling with his hands and feet in the water, beyond all expectation God so guided him three or foure houres vpon this boord, he arriued at their ship, where they no lesse amazed then he tired, they tooke him in. Presently as he had concluded with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he caused them discharge a peece of Ordnance if he escaped, which gaue no lesse comfort to Master <hi>Argent</hi> and the rest, then terror to those Plantations that heard it, (being late) at such an vnexpected alarum: but after, with warme clothes and a little strong water, they had a little recouered him, such was his courage and care of his distressed friends, he returned that night againe with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Felgate</hi> to conduct him to them, and so giuing thanks to God for so hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a deliuerance, it pleased his Diuine power, both they and their prouision came safely aboord, but <hi>Fuller</hi> they doubt will neuer recouer his benumbed legs and thighes.</p>

               <head>A briefe relation written by Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> to his Maiesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for the reformation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> concerning some asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions against it.</head>
               <p>HOnourable Gentlemen, for so many faire and Nauigable Riuers so neere adioyning, and piercing thorow so faire a naturall Land, free from any inundations, or large Fenny vnwholsome Marshes, I haue not seene, read, nor heard of: And for the building of Cities, Townes, and Wharfage, if they will vse the meanes, where there is no more ebbe nor floud, Nature in few places affoords any so conuenient, for salt Marshes or Quagmires.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12162:92"/>
In this tract of <hi>Iames</hi> Towne Riuer I know very few; some small Marshes and Swamps there are, but more profitable then hurtfull: and I thinke there is more low Marsh ground betwixt <hi>Eriffe</hi> and <hi>Chelsey,</hi> then <hi>Kecoughton</hi> and the Falls, which is about one hundred and eighty miles by the course of the Riuer.</p>
               <p>Being enioyned by our Commission not to vnplant nor wrong the Saluages,<note place="margin">The causes of our first miseries.</note> because the channell was so neere the shore, where now is <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, then a thicke groue of trees; wee cut them downe, where the Saluages pretending as much kindnesse as could bee, they hurt and slew one and twenty of vs in two houres: At this time our diet was for most part water and bran, and three ounces of little better stuffe in bread for fiue men a meale, and thus we liued neere three moneths: our lodgings vnder boughes of trees, the Saluages being our enemies, whom we neither knew nor vnderstood; occasions I thinke sufficient to make men sicke and die.</p>
               <p>Necessity thus did inforce me with eight or nine,<note place="margin">But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8 English in all <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                  </note> to try conclusions amongst the Saluages, that we got prouision which recouered the rest being most sicke. Six weeks I was led captiue by those Barbarians, though some of my men were slaine, and the rest fled, yet it pleased God to make their great Kings daughter the means to returne me safe to <hi>Iames</hi> towne, and releeue our wants, and then our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth was in all eight and thirty, the remainder of one hundred and fiue.</p>
               <p>Being supplied with one hundred and twenty,<note place="margin">Proofes of the healthfulnesse of the Countrey.</note> with twelue men in a boat of three tuns, I spent foureteene weeks in those large waters; the contents of the way of my boat protracted by the skale of proportion, was about three thousand miles, besides the Riuer we dwell vpon, where no Christian knowne euer was, and our diet for the most part what we could finde, yet but one died.</p>
               <p>The Saluages being acquainted,<note place="margin">How the Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges became sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.</note> that by command from <hi>England</hi> we durst not hurt them, were much imboldned; that famine and their insolencies did force me to breake our Commission and instructions, cause <hi>Powhatan</hi> fly his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and take the King of <hi>Pamavuke</hi> Prisoner; and also to keepe the King of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahegh</hi> in shackels, and put his men to doubletaskes in chaines, till nine and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Kings paied vs contribution, and the offending Saluages sent to <hi>Iames</hi> towne to punish at our owne discretions: in the two last yeares I staied there, I had not a man slaine.</p>
               <p>All those conclusions being not able to preuent the bad euents of pride and idlenesse, hauing receiued another supply of seuentie,<note place="margin">How we liued of the natural fruits of the Countrey.</note> we were about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in all, but not twentie work-men: In following the strict directions from <hi>England</hi> to doe that was impossible at that time; So it hapned, that neither wee nor they had any thing to eat, but what the Countrey afforded naturally; yet of eightie who liued vpon Oysters in Iune and Iuly, with a pint of corne a week for a man lying vnder trees, and 120 for the most part liuing vpon Sturgion, which was dried til we pounded it to powder for meale, yet in ten weeks but seuen died.</p>
               <p>It is true, we had of Tooles, Armes, &amp; Munition sufficient, some <hi>Aquavitae,</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger,<note place="margin">Proofe of the Commodities we returned.</note> Meale, Pease, and Otemeale, but in two yeares and a halfe not sufficient for six moneths, though by the bils of loading the proportions sent vs, would well haue contented vs, notwithstanding we sent home ample proofes of Pitch, Tar, Sope Ashes, Wainskot, Clapboord, Silke grasse, Iron Ore, some Sturgion and Glasse, Saxefras, Cedar, Cypris, and blacke Walnut, crowned <hi>Powhaton,</hi> sought the <hi>Monacans</hi> Countrey, according to the instructions sent vs, but they caused vs neglect more necessary workes: they had better haue giuen for Pitch and Sope ashes one hundred pound a tun in <hi>Denmarke:</hi> Wee also maintained fiue or six seuerall Plantations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames</hi> towne being burnt, wee rebuilt it and three Forts more,<note place="margin">What we built.</note> besides the Church and Store-house, we had about fortie or fiftie seuerall houses to keepe vs warme and dry, inuironed with a palizado of foureteene or fifteene foot, and each as much as three or foure men could carrie. We digged a faire Well of fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Fort, where wee had three Bulwarks, foure and twentie peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12162:93"/>
of Culuering, Demiculuering, Sacar and Falcon, and most well mounted vpon conuenient plat-formes, planted one hundred acres of Corne. We had but six ships to transport and supply vs, and but two hundred seuenty seuen men, boies, and women, by whose labours <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi> being brought to this kinde of perfection, the most difficulties past, and the foundation thus laid by this small meanes; yet because we had done no more, they called in our Commission, tooke a new in their owne names, and appointed vs neere as many offices and Officers as I had Souldiers, that neither knew vs nor wee them, without our consents or knowledge; since there haue gone more then one hundred ships of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, and eight or ten thousand people. Now if you please to compare what hath beene spent, sent, discouered and done this fifteene yeares, by that we did in the three first yeares, and euery Gouernor that hath beene there since, giue you but such an account as this, you may easily finde what hath beene the cause of those disasters in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came in Captaine <hi>Argall,</hi> and Master <hi>Sedan,</hi> in a ship of Master <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to fish for Sturgion, who had such good prouision, we contracted with them for it, whereby we were better furnished then euer.</p>
               <p>Not long after came in seuen ships, with about three hundred people; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to supplant vs then supply vs, their Admirall with their authoritie being cast away in the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> very angry they were we had made no better prouision for them. Seuen or eight weekes we withstood the invndations of these disorderly humors, till I was neere blowne to death with Gun-powder, which occasioned me to returne for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How I left the Country.</note>In the yeare 1609 about Michaelmas, I left the Countrey, as is formerly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with three ships, seuen Boats, Commodities to trade, haruest newly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, eight weeks prouision of Corne and Meale, about fiue hundred persons, three hundred Muskets, shot, powder, and match, with armes for more men then we had. The Saluages their language and habitation, well knowne to two hundred expert Souldiers; Nets for fishing, tooles of all sorts, apparell to supply their wants: six Mares and a Horse, fiue or six hundred Swine, many more Powl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, what was brought or bred, but victuall there remained.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">My charge.</note>Hauing spent some fiue yeares, and more then fiue hundred pounds in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Letters Patents and setting forward, and neere as much more about <hi>New England,</hi> &amp;c. Thus these nineteene yeares I haue here and there not spared any thing according to my abilitie, nor the best aduice I could, to perswade how those strange miracles of misery might haue beene preuented, which lamentable experience plainly taught me of necessity must insue, but few would beleeue me till now too deerely they haue paid for it. Wherefore hitherto I haue rather left all then vndertake impossibilities, or any more such costly taskes at such chargeable rates:<note place="margin">My reward.</note> for in neither of those two Countries haue I one foot of Land, nor the very house I builded, nor the ground I digged with my owne hands, nor euer any content or satisfaction at all, and though I see ordinarily those two Countries shared before me by them that neither haue them nor knowes them, but by my descriptions: Yet that doth not so much trouble me, as to heare and see those contentions and diuisions which will hazard if not ruine the prosperitie of <hi>Virginia,</hi> if present remedy bee not found, as they haue hindred many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, who would haue beene there ere now, and makes them yet that are willing to stand in a demurre.</p>
               <p>For the Books and Maps I haue made, I will thanke him that will shew me so much for so little recompence, and beare with their errors till I haue done better. For the materials in them I cannot deny, but am ready to affirme them both there and here, vpon such grounds as I haue propounded, which is to haue but fifteene hundred men to subdue againe the Saluages, fortifie the Countrey, discouer that yet vnknowne, and both defend &amp; feed their Colony, which I most humbly refer to his Maiesties most iudiciall iudgement, and the most honourable Lords of his

               <head>Out of these Obseruations it pleased his Maiesties Commissioners for the reformation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to desire my answer to these seuen Questions.</head>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>Quest. 1. <hi>WHat conceiue you is the cause the Plantation hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered no better since you left it in so good a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Idlenesse and carelesnesse brought all I did in three yeeres in six moneths to nothing, and of fiue hundred I left, scarce threescore remained, and had Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> not got from the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> I thinke they had beene all dead before they could be supplied.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What conceiue you should be the cause, though the Country be good, there comes nothing but Tobacco</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The oft altering of Gouernours it seemes causes euery man make vse of his time, and because Corne was stinted at two shillings six pence the bushell, and Tobacco at three shillings the pound, and they value a mans labour a yeere worth fifty or threescore pound, but in Corne not worth ten pound, presuming Tobacco will furnish them with all things; now make a mans labour in Corne worth threescore pound, and in Tobacco but ten pound a man, then shall they haue Corne sufficient to entertaine all commers, and keepe their people in health to doe any thing, but till then, there will be little or nothing to any purpose.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 3. <hi>What conceiue you to haue beene the cause of the Massacre, and had the Saluages had the vse of any peeces in your time, or when, or by whom they were taught</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The cause of the Massacre was the want of marshall discipline, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would haue all the English had by destroying those they found so carelesly secure, that they were not prouided to defend themselues against any enemy, being so dispersed as they were. In my time, though Captaine <hi>Nuport</hi> furnished them with swords by truck, and many fugitiues did the like, and some Peeces they got accidentally, yet I got the most of them againe, and it was death to him that should shew a Saluage the vse of a Peece. Since I vnderstand they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so good shot, they were imployed for Fowlers and Huntsmen by the English.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 4. <hi>What charge thinke you would haue setled the gouernment both for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and planting when you left it</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Twenty thousand pound would haue hyred good labourers and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall men, and haue furnished them with cattle and all necessaries, and 100. of them would haue done more then a thousand of those that went, though the Lord <hi>Laware,</hi> Sir <hi>Ferdinando Waynman,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Dale</hi> were perswaded to the contrary, but when they had tried, they confessed their error.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 5. <hi>What conceiue you would be the remedy and the charge?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The remedy is to send Souldiers and all sorts of labourers and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for them, that they may be there by next <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the which to doe well will stand you in fiue thousand pound, but if his Maiesty would please to lend two of his Ships to transport them, lesse would serue, besides the benefit of his grace to the action would encourage all men.</p>
                     <p>Quest. 6. <hi>What thinke you are the defects of the gouernment both here and there?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The multiplicity of opinions here, and Officers there, makes such delaies by questions and formalitie, that as much time is spent in complement as in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12162:94"/>
besides, some are so desirous to imploy their ships, hauing six pounds for euery Passenger, and three pounds for euery tun of goods, at which rate a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand ships may now better be procured then one at the first, when the common stocke defrayed all fraughts, wages, prouisions and Magazines, whereby the Ships are so pestred, as occasions much sicknesse, diseases and mortality, for though all the Passengers die they are sure of their fraught; and then all must be satisfied with Orations, disputations, excuses and hopes. As for the letters of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice from hence, and their answers thence, they are so well written, men would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue there were no great doubt of the performance, and that all things were wel, to which error here they haue beene euer much subiect; and there not to beleeue, or not to releeue the true and poore estate of that Colony, whose fruits were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spent before they were ripe, and this losse is nothing to them here, whose great estates are not sensible of the losse of their aduentures, and so they thinke; or will not take notice; but it is so with all men: but howsoeuer they thinke or dispose of all things at their pleasure, I am sure not my selfe onely, but a thousand others haue not onely spent the most of their estates, but the most part haue lost their liues and all, onely but to make way for the triall of more new conclusions, and he that now will aduenture but twelue pounds ten shillings, shall haue better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and as much fauour then he that sixteene yeere agoe aduentured as much, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he haue money as the other hath, but though he haue aduentured fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, and spent there neuer so much time, if hee haue no more and not able to begin a family of himselfe, all is lost by order of Court.</p>
                     <p>But in the beginning it was not so, all went then out of one purse, till those new deuices haue consumed both mony and purse; for at first there were but six Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees, now more then a thousand, then but thirteene Counsailors, now not lesse then an hundred; I speake not of all, for there are some both honourable and honest, but of those Officers, which did they manage their owne estates no better then the affaires of <hi>Virginia,</hi> they would quickly fall to decay so well as it; but this is most euident, few Officers in <hi>England</hi> it hath caused to turne Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querupts, nor for all their complaints would leaue their places, neither yet any of their Officers there, nor few of the rest but they would be at home, but fewer Aduenturers here will aduenture any more till they see the businesse better esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, although there be some so wilfully improuident they care for nothing but to get thither, and then if their friends be dead, or want themselues, they die or liue but poorely for want of necessaries, and to thinke the old Planters can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them were too much simplicity; for who here in <hi>England</hi> is so charitable to feed two or three strangers, haue they neuer so much; much lesse in <hi>Virginia</hi> where they want for themselues. Now the generall complaint saith, that pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, extortion and oppression in a few that ingrosses all, then sell all againe to the comminalty at what rate they please, yea euen men, women and children for who will giue most, occasions no small mischiefe amongst the Planters.</p>
                     <p>As for the Company, or those that doe transport them, prouided of necessaries, God forbid but they should receiue their charges againe with aduantage, or that masters there should not haue the same priuilege ouer their seruants as here, but to sell him or her for forty, fifty, or threescore pounds, whom the Company hath sent ouer for eight or ten pounds at the most, without regard how they shall be maintained with apparell, meat, drinke and lodging, is odious, and their fruits sutable, therefore such merchants it were better they were made such merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize themselues, then suffered any longer to vse that trade, and those are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects sufficient to bring a well setled Common-wealth to misery, much more <hi>Virginia.</hi>

maintaining one hundred men for the Gouernour, one hundred for two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, fifty for the Treasurer, fiue and twenty for the Secretary, and more for the Marshall and other Officers who were neuer there nor aduentured any thing, but onely preferred by fauour to be Lords ouer them that broke the ice and beat the path, and must teach them what to doe, if any thing happen well, it is their glory; if ill, the fault of the old directors, that in all dangers must endure the worst, yet not fiue hundred of them haue so much as one of the others; also that there bee some present course taken to maintaine a Garrison to suppresse the Saluages, till they be able to subsist, and that his Maiesty would please to remit his custome, or it is to be feared they will lose custome and all, for this cannot be done by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, hopes, counsels and countenances, but with sufficient workmen and meanes to maintaine them, not such delinquents as here cannot be ruled by all the lawes in <hi>England,</hi> yet when the foundation is laid, as I haue said, and a common-wealth established, then such there may better be constrained to labour then here: but to rectifie a common-wealth with debaushed people is impossible, and no wise man would throw himselfe into such a society, that intends honestly, and knowes what he vndertakes, for there is no Country to pillage as the Romans found: all you expect from thence must be by labour.</p>
                     <p>For the gouernment I thinke there is as much adoe about it as the Kingdomes of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> men here conceiting <hi>Virginia</hi> as they are, erecting as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stately Offices as Officers with their attendants, as there are labourers in the Countrey, where a Constable were as good as twenty of their Captaines, and three hundred good Souldiers and labourers better then all the rest that goe onely to get the fruits of other mens labours by the title of an office. Thus they spend <hi>Michaelmas</hi> rent in <hi>Mid-summer</hi> Moone, and would gather their Haruest before they haue planted their Corne.</p>
                     <p>As for the maintenance of the Officers, the first that went neuer demanded any, but aduentured good summes, and it seemes strange to me, the fruits of all their labours, besides the expence of an hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and such multitudes of people, those collaterall Officers could not maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so well as the old did, and hauing now such liberty to doe to the Saluages what they will, the others had not. I more then wonder they haue not fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Saluages to worke for them towards their generall maintenance, and as many more to returne some content and satisfaction to the Aduenturers, that for all their care, charge and diligence, can heare nor see nothing but miserable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; therefore vnder your correction to rectifie all, is with all expedition to passe the authority to them who will releeue them, lest all bee consumed ere the differences be determined. And except his Maiestie vndertake it, or by Act of Parlament some small tax may be granted throughout his Dominions, as a Penny vpon euery Poll, called a head-penny; two pence vpon euery Chimney, or some such collection might be raised, and that would be sufficient to giue a good stocke, and many seruants to sufficient men of any facultie, and transport them freely for paying onely homage to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and such duties to the publike good as their estates increased reason should require. Were this put in practice, how many people of what quality you please, for all those disasters would yet gladly goe to spend their liues there, and by this meanes more good might be done in one yeere, then all those pety particular vndertakings will effect in twenty.</p>
                     <p>For the Patent the King may, if he please, rather take it from them that haue it, then from vs who had it first, pretending to his Maiesty what great matters they would doe, and how little we did, and for any thing I can conceiue, had we remained still as at first, it is not likely we could haue done much worse; but those oft altering of gouernments are not without much charge, hazard and losse. If I be too plaine, I humbly craue your pardon; but you requested me, therefore I doe but my duty. For the Nobility, who knowes not how freely both in their
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12162:95"/>
Purses and assistances many of them haue beene to aduance it, committing the managing of the businesse to inferiour persons, amongst whom questionlesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many haue done their vtmost best, sincerely and truly according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, opinion and vnderstanding; yet grosse errors haue beene committed, but no man liues without his fault; for my owne part, I haue so much adoe to amend my owne, I haue no leisure to looke into any mans particular, but those in generall I conceiue to be true.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we present you the matters of fact, it is fit to offer to your view the Stage whereon they were acted, for as Geography without History seemeth a carkasse without motion, so History without Geography, wandreth as a Vagrant without a certaine habitation.<note place="margin">The description of the Iles.</note> Those Ilands lie in the huge maine Ocean, and two hundred leagues from any continent, situated in 32. degrees and 25. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, of Northerly latitude, and distant from <hi>England</hi> West South-West, about 3300. miles, some twenty miles in length, and not past two miles and a halfe in breadth, enuironed with Rocks, which to the North-ward, West-ward, and South-East, extend further then they haue bin yet well discouered: by reason of those Rocks the Country is naturally very strong, for there is but two places, &amp; scare two, vnlesse to them who know them well, where shipping may safely come in, and those now are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well fortified, but within is roome to entertaine a royall Fleet: the Rocks in most places appeare at a low water, neither are they much couered at a high, for it ebbs and flowes not past fiue foot; the shore for most part is a Rocke, so hardened with the sunne, wind and sea, that it is not apt to be worne away with the waues, whose violence is also broke by the Rocks before they can come to the shore: it is very vneuen, distributed into hills and dales; the mold is of diuers colours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clay nor sand, but a meane betweene; the red which resembleth clay is the worst, the whitest resembling sand and the blackest is good, but the browne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them both which they call white, because there is mingled with it a white meale is the best: vnder the mould two or three foot deep, and sometimes lesse, is a kinde of white hard substance which they call the Rocke: the trees vsually fasten their roots in it; neither is it indeed rocke or stone, or so hard, though for most part more harder then Chalke; nor so white, but pumish-like and spungy, easily receiuing and containing much water. In some places Clay is found vnder it, it seemes to be ingendred with raine water, draining through the earth, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it of his substance vnto a certaine depth where it congeales; the hardest kinde of it lies vnder the red ground like quarries, as it were thicke slates one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, through which the water hath his passage, so that in such places there is scarce found any fresh water, for all or the most part of the fresh water commeth out of the Sea draining through the sand, or that substance called the Rocke, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the salt behinde, it becomes fresh: sometimes we digged wells of fresh water which we finde in most places, and but three or foure paces from the Sea side, some further, the most part of them would ebbe and flow as the Sea did; and be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell or little higher then the superficies of the sea, and in some places very strange, darke and cumbersome Caues.</p>

               <note place="margin">The clime, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and fertility.</note>The aire is most commonly cleere, very temperate, moist, with a moderate heat, very healthfull and apt for the generation and nourishing of all things, so as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things transported from hence yeeld a farre greater increase, and if it be any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thing it becomes fatter and better; by this meanes the country is so reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Hens and Turkies, within the space of three or foure yeeres, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them being neglected, forsake the houses and become wilde, and so liue in great abundance; the like increase there is in Hogs, tame Conies, and other Cattle according to their kindes. There seemes to be a continuall Spring, which is the cause some things come not to that maturity and perfection as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site; and though the trees shed their leaues, yet they are alwaies full of greene; the Corne is the same they haue in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>West-Indies</hi>: of this and many other things without plowing or much labour, they haue two Haruests euery yeere, for they set about March, which they gather in Iuly; and againe in August, which they reape in December; and little slips of Fig-trees and Vines doe vsually beare fruit within the yeere, and sometimes in lesse; but we finde not the Grapes as yet come to any perfection; the like fertility it hath in Oranges and Limons, Pomgranates, and other things. Concerning the serenity and beauty of the skie, it may as truly be said of those Ilands as euer it was said of the Rhodes, that there is no one day throughout the 12. moneths, but that in some houre thereof, the sun lookes singularly &amp; cleere vpon them: for the temperature it is beyond all others most admirable; no cold there is beyond an English Aprill, nor heat much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then an ordinary Iuly in <hi>France,</hi> so that frost and snow is neuer seene here, nor stinking and infectious mists very seldome, by reason of the maine Ocean, there is some wind stirring that cooles the aire: the winter they haue obserues the time with ours, but the longest daies and nights are shorter then ours almost by two houres.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Trees and Fruits.</note>We found it at first all ouergrowne with weeds, and plants of seuerall kinds, as many tall and goodly Cedars, infinite store of Palmetoes, numbers of Mulberies, wild Oliue-trees store, with diuers others vnknowne both by name and nature, so that as yet they become lost to many vsefull imployments, which time and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry no doubt will one day discouer, and euen already certaine of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious of them haue gotten them appellations from their apparent effects, as the Prickell-peare which growes like a shrub by the ground,<note place="margin">The Prickell Peare.</note> with broad thick leaues, all ouer-armed with long and sharpe dangerous thornes, the fruit being in forme not much vnlike a small greene Peare, and on the outside of the same colour, but within bloud red, and exceeding full of iuice; with graines not much vnlike the Pomgranat,<note place="margin">The poison weed.</note> and colouring after its nature. The poysoned weed is much in shape like our English Iuy, but being but touched, causeth rednesse, itching, and lastly blisters, the which howsoeuer after a while passe away of themselues without further harme, yet because for the time they are somewhat painfull, it hath got it selfe an ill name, although questionlesse of no ill nature. Here is also frequently growing a certaine tall Plant,<note place="margin">The red weed.</note> whose stalke being all ouer couered with a red rinde, is thereupon termed the red weed, the root whereof being soked in any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, or but a small quantity of the Iuice drunke alone, procures a very forcible vomit, and yet is generally vsed by the people, and found very effectuall against the paines and distempers of the stomacke.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The purging Beane.</note>A kinde of Wood-bind there is likewise by the Sea very commonly to bee found, which runnes vpon trees twining it selfe like a Vine: the fruit somewhat resembles a Beane, but somewhat flatter, the which any way eaten worketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently in the nature of a purge, and though very vehemently, yet without all perill.<note place="margin">The costiue tree.</note> Contrary to this, another small tree there is, which causeth costiuenesse; there is also a certaine Plant like a bramble bush, which beares a long yellow fruit, hauing the shell very hard, and within it a hard berry, that beaten and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly purgeth gently.<note place="margin">Red Pepper.</note> There is another fruit much like our Barberies, which being beaten or brused betweene the teeth, sets all the mouth on an extreme heat very terrible for the time, to auoid which they are swallowed downe whole,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12162:96"/>
and found of the same or better operation then the red Pepper, and thence bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth the name. In the bottome of the Sea there is growing vpon the Rocks a large kinde of Plant in the forme of a Vine leafe, but far more spread with veines in colour of a pale red, very strangely interlaced &amp; wouen one into another, which we call the Feather, but the vertue thereof is altogether vnknowne,<note place="margin">The Sea feather.</note> but only regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the rarity. Now besides these naturall productions,<note place="margin">Fruits transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> prouidences &amp; paines since the Plantation, haue offered diuers other feeds &amp; plants, which the soile hath greedlily imbraced &amp; cherished, so that at this present 1623. there are great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of white, red and yellow coloured Potatoes, Tobacco, Sugarcanes, Indicos, Parsnips, exceeding large R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Neither hath the aire for her part been wanting with due supplies of many sorts of Fowles, as the gray and white Hearne, the gray and greene Plouer,<note place="margin">Birds.</note> some wilde Ducks and Malards, Coots and Red-shankes, Sea-wigions, Gray-bitterns, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants, numbers of small Birds like Sparrowes and Robins, which haue lately beene destroyed by the wilde Cats, Wood-pickars, very many Crowes, which since this Plantation are kild, the rest fled or seldome seene except in the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited places, from whence they are obserued to take their flight about sun set, directing their course towards the North-west, which makes many coniecture there are some more Ilands not far off that way. Sometimes are also seene Falcons &amp; Iar-falcons, Ospraies, a Bird like a Hobby, but because they come seldome, they are held but as passengers; but aboue all these, most deseruing obseruation and respect are those two sorts of Birds, the one for the tune of his voice, the other for the effect, called the Cahow, and Egge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bird, which on the first of May, a day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly obserued, fall a laying infinite store of Eggs neere as big as Hens,<note place="margin">Egge-Birds.</note> vpon certaine small sandie baies especially in <hi>Coupers</hi> Ile; and although men sit downe amongst them when hundreds haue bin gathered in a morning, yet there is hath stayed amongst them till they haue gathered as many more: they continue this course till <hi>Midsummer,</hi> and so tame &amp; feareles, you must thrust them off from their Eggs with your hand; then they grow so faint with laying, they suffer them to breed &amp; take infinite numbers of their yong to eat, which are very excellent meat.</p>
            <p>The Cahow is a Bird of the night,<note place="margin">Cahowes.</note> for all the day she lies hid in holes in the Rocks, where they and their young are also taken with as much ease as may be, but in the night if you but whoop and hollow, they will light vpon you, that with your hands you may chuse the fat and leaue the leane; those they haue only in winter: their Eggs are as big as hens, but they are speckled, the other white. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Norwood</hi> hath taken twenty dozen of them in three or foure houres, and since there hath beene such hauocke made of them, they were neere all destroyed, till there was a strict inhibition for their preseruation. The Tropicke bird is white,<note place="margin">The Tropicke Bird and the Pemblicos pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sagements.</note> as large as a Pullet, with one onely long Feather in her taile, and is seldome seene far distant from other of the Tropicks: another small Bird there is, because she cries Pemblyco they call her so, she is seldome seene in the day but when she sings, as too oft she doth very clamorously; too true a Prophet she proues of huge winds and boysterous weather: there were a kinde of small Owles in great abundance, but they are now all slaine or fled: some tame Ducks, Geese and Pigeons there are, but the two latter prosper not.</p>
            <p>Concerning vermine and noisome creatures, there are not many,<note place="margin">Of Vermine.</note> but onely Rats and Cats, there increased since the Plantation, but how they agree together you shall heare hereafter. The Musketas and Flies are also too busie, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine India Bug, called by the Spaniards a Cacarootch, the which creeping into Chests they eat and defile with their ill-sented dung: also the little Ants in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time are so troublesome, they are forced to dry their figs vpon high frames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and anoint their feet with tar, wherein they sticke, else they would spoile them all

ere they could be dryed: Wormes in the earth also there are, but too many, so that to keepe them from destroying their Corne and Tobacco, they are forced to worme them euery morning, which is a great labour, else all would be destroyed. Lizards there were many and very large, but now none, and it is laid they were destroyed by the Cat.<note place="margin">

The most of which being vnknowne to our Northerne parts, got there new names, either for their shapes or conditions; as the large Rocke-fish from his like hew, and haunting amongst the Rocks, the fat Hog-fish from his swine-like shape and shout: for this is not the old knowne Hog-fish with brussels on his backe; the delicate Amber-fish from his taste and smell, Angell-fish, Cony-fish, the small yellow taile from that naturall painting; the great Growper from his odde and strange grunting, some of them yet knowne to the <hi>Americans,</hi> as the Purgoose, the Cauallo, the Gar-fish, Flying-fish and Morerayes: the rest are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to other Continents; as the Whale in great numbers, the Sharke, the Pilot-fish, the Sea-Breame, the Oyster and Lobster, with diuers others; twenty Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toises haue beene taken in a day, and some of them will affoord halfe a bushell of Egges, and suffice to feed forty men at a meale.

further then thus; our men found diuers crosses, peeces of Spanish monies here and there. Two or three wracks also they found, by certaine inscriptions to bee some Spanish, some Dutch, some French; but the greatest rumour is, that a Spanish ship called <hi>Bermudas</hi> was there cast away, carrying Hogges to the West-Indies that swam a shore, and there increased: how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> escaped is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine: but they say, from that ship those Iles were first called <hi>Bermudas,</hi> which tilt then for six thousand yeares had beene namelesse.</p>
               <p>But the first English-man that was euer in them, was one <hi>Henry May,</hi> a worthy Mariner that went with Captaine <hi>Lancaster</hi> to the East-Indies 1591. and in their returne by the West-Indies, being in some distresse, sent this <hi>Henry May</hi> for England by one <hi>Mounsier de la Barbotier,</hi> to acquaint the Merchants with their estate. The last of Nouember, saith <hi>May,</hi> we departed from <hi>Laguna</hi> in <hi>Hispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> and the seuenteenth of December following, we were cast away vpon the North-west of the <hi>Bermudas</hi>; the Pilots about noone made themselues South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Iles twelue leagues, and demanded of the Captaine their Wine of hight as out of all danger, which they had: but it seeme, they were either drunke, or carelesse of their charge; for through their negligences a number of good men were cast away. I being but a stranger amongst fiftie and odde French-men, it pleased God to appoint me to be one of them should be saued. In this extremity we made a raft, which we towed with our Boat, there were but six and twentie of vs saued; and I seeing scarce roome for the one halfe, durst not passe in amongst them till the Captaine called me along with him, leauing the better halfe to the seas mercy: that day we rowed till within two houres of night ere we could land, being neere dead with thirst, euery man tooke his way to seeke fresh water, at length, by searching amongst many weeds, we found some raine water, but in the maine are many faire Baies, where we had enough for digging.</p>
               <p>Now it pleased God before our ship split we saued our Carpenters tooles,<note place="margin">The building and calking their Barke.</note> some Nailes, Sailes, and Tacklings, wherewith we went roundly to worke, and built a Barke of eighty tunues: In stead of Pitch, we made Lime, mixed with Tortoise oyle, and as the Carpenters calked her, I and another paied the seames with this plaster, which being in Aprill, became quickly dry, and as hard as a stone.</p>
               <p>In Aprill it was so hot, we feared our water would faile,<note place="margin">His returne for England.</note> two great Chests wee made, which we calked as our ship; those we stowed on each side our maine Mast, filled them with water and thirtie liue Tortoises: wee found many Hogges, but so leane wee could not eat them; the tops of the Palmetaberries was our bread, and the iuyce we got out of the trees we cut downe our drinke, and of the leaues, which are more then an Ell long, we couered our Cabens, &amp; made our beds, and found many of those prouisions as is related, but little foule weather.

               <p>This feare thus past, appeares another much worse, which was the extremity of famine; in this extemity God sent Captaine <hi>Daniel Elfrid</hi> with a caruell of meale which a little relieued them, but brought withall so many Rats, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two yeeres after neere ruined all; now though <hi>Elfrid</hi> had deceiued his friend <hi>Fisher</hi> of this Caruell in the <hi>West.

                  <note place="margin">A wonderfull accident.</note>In the month of March, a time most subiect of all others to such tempests; on a Friday there went seuen men in a boat of two or three runnes to fish. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being faire, so eager they were of their iourney, some went fasting: neither carried they either meat or drinke with them, but a few Palmeta berries, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their fishing place some foure leagues from the shoare, such a tempest arose, they were quickly driuen from the sight of land in an ouergrowne Sea, despairing of all hope, onely committing themselues to Gods mercy, set the boat driue which way shee would. On Sunday the storme being somewhat abated, they hoysed saile as they thought towards the Island. In the euening it grew starke calme; to that being too weake to vse their oares, they lay a drift that night. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Andrew Hilliard,</hi> for now all his companions were past strength either to helpe him or themselues: before a small gale of wind spred his saile againe. On Tuesday one died, whom they threw ouer board. On Wednesday three. And on Thursday at night the sixt. All these but the last were buried by <hi>Hilliard</hi> in the Sea, for so weake hee was growne hee could not turne him ouer as the rest, whereupon hee stripped him, ripping his belly with his knife, throwing his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els into the water, hee spread his body abroad tilted open with a sticke, and so lets it lie as a cisterne to receiue some lucky raine-water, and this God sent h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But within an houre after to his greater comfort you will not doubt, he once againe descried the land, and within foure houres after was cast vpon a rocke neere to Port royall, where his boat was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently split in pieces, but himselfe, though exreamly weake, made shift to clamber vp so steepe and high a rocke, as would haue troubled the ablest man in the Ile to haue done that by day hee did by night.</p>

But at last according to the <hi>Virginia</hi> order, hee set euery one was with him at Saint <hi>Georges,</hi> to his taske, to cleere grounds, fell trees, set corne, square timber, plant vines and other fruits brought out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> These by their taske Masters by breake a day repaired to the wharfe, from thence to be imployed to the place of their imployment, till nine of the clocke, and then in the after-noone from three till Sunne-set. Beside meat, drinke and cloaths, they had for a time a certaine kinde of brasse money with a hogge on the one side, in memory of the abundance of hogges was found at their first landing.</p>
               <p>This course thus squared, imitating diuers orders vsed in <hi>Virginia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Captaine <hi>Tuckars</hi> proceedings.</note> by Sir <hi>Tho. Dale</hi>: he began by them to looke into his instructions giuen by the Company. Whereupon by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard Norwood</hi> a Suruayor, sent ouer for that purpose, in the time of Master <hi>Moore,</hi> hee began to lay out the eight tribes in the maine, which were to consist of fifty shares to a tribe; and twenty fiue acers to euery share. He also began to plant some Colony men, on some of the especiall shares. He swore also certaine of the chiefe men of euery tribe to bee Bailiffes thereof; and appointed as many men as hee was able for all supplied shares. The goods landed in the store houses hee sent from thence, and dispersed it to his worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in generall: some Boats also began to be builded; but the pinace called the <hi>Thomas</hi> suspected might make an escape, was laid vp in a docke, were shee yet remaineth.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the second moneth of his gouernment,<note place="margin">A Barke sent to the West Indies.</note> he directed war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to all the Bailiffes, for the holding of a generall Assise at Saint <hi>Georges,</hi> and appointed Master <hi>Stokes</hi> Lieutenant of the Kings Castle at the Gurnets head. The <hi>Edwin</hi> came with him he sent to the West Indies by directions from <hi>England,</hi> to trade with the natiues, for cattell, corne, plants, and other commodities. A course of great importance, which had it been pursued, would certainly haue produced more hopefull effects for the good of the Colony, then all the supplies and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines</hi> from <hi>England</hi> hath or will in a long time.</p>
               <p>Presently after her departure began the Assises, executed by his Deputy. The chiefe matter handled was the hanging one <hi>Iohn Wood</hi> a French man,<note place="margin">The Assises.</note> for spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many distastefull and mutinous speeches against the Gouernour, to shew the rest by that example, the power of his authority, which after with his owne hands he so oft executed with a bastinado amongst the poorer sort; many tearmed it a cruelty, not much lesse then tyranny: but the sequell is more then strange.</p>
               <p>So it was that fiue of them,<note place="margin">The strange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of fiue men in a boat.</note> seeing by no meanes they could get passage for <hi>England,</hi> resolued to vndergoe all hazards but they would make an escape from such seruitude. The chiefe mariner and plotter of this businesse, was <hi>Richard San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and his confederates, <hi>William Goodwin</hi> a ship Carpenter, <hi>Thomas Harison</hi> a Ioyner, <hi>Iames Barker</hi> a Gentleman, and <hi>Henry Puet.</hi> These repairing to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and with pleasing insinuations told him, if hee would allow them but
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:12162:103"/>
things necessary, they would build him a boat of two or three tunnes, with a close decke, should goe a fishing all weathers. The Gouernour halfe proud that hee had brought his men to so good a passe, as he conceiued, to offer themselues to so necessary a worke; instantly with all willingnesse furnished them with all things they could desire, and many faire promises to incourage them to performe it with all expedition. Hauing made choise of a place most fit from molestation, they went forward with that expedition, that in a short time shee was brought to perfection. By this time, the ship that brought the Gouernour, being ready to depart, hee sends a lusty gange to goe fetch his new boat to carry him aboard, but arriuing at the place where she was built, they could heare no more of her, but she was gone the last euening to Sea, to try how shee would saile. Much search and dispute was where this boat should be: but at last they found diuers letters in the cabbins, to this effect, directed to the Gouernour, and other their friends: that their hard and bad vsage was so intolerable, and their hope so small euer againe to see their Countrey, or be deliuered from such seruitude, they did rather chuse to put themselues to that desperate hazard to goe for <hi>England,</hi> in which if they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried, as it was much to be mistrusted, their liues and bloods should be required at their hands was the cause. A compasse Diall <hi>Barker</hi> had borrowed of Master <hi>Hues,</hi> to whom he writ that as hee had oft perswaded them to patience, and that God would pay them though none did: hee must now bee contented with the losse of his Diall, with his owne doctrine. Such leasure they found to bee merry when in the eye of reason they were marching into a most certaine ruine. The Gouernour being thus satisfied of their escape, extreamly threatned them no lesse then a hanging, but the stormes of the Ocean they now more feared then him; good prouision by bartering they had got from the ship, where <hi>Goodwin</hi> in a brauado told the Mariners, though he could not be permitted to goe with them, yet peraduenture hee might be in <hi>England</hi> before them, whereat the Master and his Mate laughed merrily. But hauing beene now vnder saile three weekes, the winds so fauoured them, they felt nothing of what they had cause to feare: then a blustering gale blowing in their teeth, put them to much extremity for diuers dayes, then becomming more gentle away they past prosperously some eight or ten dayes more, till meeting a French Piccaroune of whom they desired succour, hee like himselfe tooke from them what hee liked, leauing them not so much as a crosse-staffe to obserue withall, and so cast them off: their course still they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till their victuall began to fall to the lowest ebbe; and the very knees of their small vessell were halfe hewed away for fire wood. At last to their infinit ioy they arriued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the Earle of <hi>Tomund</hi> honorably entertained them, and caused the boat to be hung vp for a Monument, and well she might, for shee had sailed more then 3300. miles by a right line thorow the maine Sea, without any sight of land, and I thinke since God made the world, the like nauigation was neuer done, nor heard of. This fortunate <hi>Sanders</hi> going to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> in the rifling some ships there tooke, it was his chance to buy an old chest, for three or foure shillings, but because it wanted a key hee repented his bargaine, and would gladly haue sold it againe for lesse. A certaine time it lay tossed to and fro as a thing hee little regarded, but at last hauing little to doe, hee broke it open, where he found a thousand pounds starling, or so much gold as bought him in <hi>England</hi> a good estate, which leauing with his wife he returned againe to the <hi>East Indies.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>George</hi> setting saile three dayes after this escape,<note place="margin">Plants from the West Indies.</note> the Gouernour seazed and confiscated all that those fugitiues left behinde them.

A great league of kindnesse is soone made betweene them, vpon confidence whereof, <hi>Powell</hi> and some of the chiefe with him being inuited aboord him, is easily entised, and in the midst of their cups both hee and his company treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously made prisoners; and thus was forced to giue him their prise, or hang at the yards arme with all his company. Hauing set them a shore, away goes the French man; <hi>Powels</hi> ship being but hard by, presently fetcht them all a boord, but finding his victuall neere spent, and no hope at all to recouer his prize, set his Portugales on shore, and set saile for the Summer Iles; where safely arriuing, hee declared the whole passage to the Gouernour, lest some other in telling might make it worse, of which the Gouernour seemed well enough to approue.</p>
               <p>This Gouernour still spent his time in good husbandry,<note place="margin">The second Assise.</note> although some of the snarling sort here in <hi>England,</hi> whom nothing will please, writ to him hee was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a Gardiner then a Gouernour: some time he spent in digging of a great pond, but that worke proued altogether vnprofitable: about that time was held the second Assise. The greatest matter passed, was a Proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against the spoile of Cahowes, but it came too late, for they were most destroyed before: a platforme hee caused to be erected by <hi>Pagits</hi> Fort, where a good Fort were very necessary. Captaine <hi>Powell</hi> not hauing performed his seruice in the West Indies, he conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with the Company, is sent thither againe by this Gouernour, and thirteene or fourteene of his best men, furnished with all things necessary. In the meane time the Company vnderstanding, that in Ianuary, February and March, there are many Whales, for which fishing they sent the Neptune, a tall ship well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided with euery thing fitting for that purpose. But before she arriued, Captaine <hi>Tuckar,</hi> who had brought also with him most prouisions for that imploiment, sent three good Shalops to try what could be done, but whether it was the swiftnes of the Whale in swimming, or the condition of the place, certaine it is for all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and hazard, they could kill none, though they strucke many.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1617"/> To begin his second yeere, he called the third Assise,<note place="margin"> The third Assise.

               <p>But the great God of heauen being angry at somewhat happened in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, caused such an increase of silly rats,<note place="margin">The countrey neere deuoured with rats.</note> in the space of two yeeres so to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, before they regarded them, that they filled not onely those places where they were first landed, but swimming from place to place, spread themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts of the Countrey, insomuch that there was no Iland but it was peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them; and some fishes haue beene taken with rats in their bellies, which they caught in swimming from Ile to Ile: their nests they had almost in euery tree, and in most places their burrowes in the ground like conies: they spared not the fruits of the plants, or trees, nor the very plants themselues, but are them vp. When they had set their corne, the rats would come by troupes in the night and scratch it out of the ground. If by diligent watch any escaped till it came to earing, it should then very hardly escape them: and they became noysome euen to the very persons of men. They vsed all the diligence they could for the destroying of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12162:104"/>
them, nourishing cats both wilde and tame, for that purpose; they vsed rats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, and many times set fire on the woods, that oft ran halfe a mile before it was extinct; euery man was enioyned to set twelue traps, and some of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord haue set neere an hundred, which they euer visited twice or thrice in a night; they also trained vp their dogges to hunt them, wherein they became so expert, that a good dog in two or three houres would kil forty or fity. Many other deuices they vsed to destroy them, but could not preuaile, finding them still increasing against them: nay they so deuoured the fruits of the earth, that they were destitute of bread for a yeere or two; so that when they had it afterwards, they were so wained from it, they easily neglected to eat it with their meat. Besides they endeuoured so much for the planting Tobacco for present gaine, that they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected many things might more haue preuailed for their good, which caused a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them much weaknesse and mortality, since the beginning of this vermine.</p>
               <p>At last it pleased God, but by what meanes it is not well knowne, to take them away;<note place="margin">A strange confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of rats.</note> in so much that the wilde cats and many dogs which liued on them, were famished, and many of them leauing the woods, came downe to their houses, and to such places where they vse to garbish their fish, and became tame. Some haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the destruction of them the to encrease of wild cats, but that is not likely they should be so suddenly encreased rather at that time, then foure yeeres before; and the chiefe occasion of this supposition was, because they saw some companies of them leaue the woods, and slew themselues for want of food. Others by the coldnesse of winter, which notwithstanding is neuer so great there, as with vs in March, except it be in the wind: besides the rats wanted not the fethers of young birds and chickins, which they daily killed, and Palmeta mosse to build them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues warme nests out of the wind, as vsually they did; neither doth it appeare that the cold was so mortall to them, seeing they would ordinarily swimme from place to place, and bee very fat euen in the midst of winter. It remaineth then, that as God doth sometimes effect his will without subordinate and secondary causes, so wee need not doubt, but that in the speedy encrease of this vermine; as also by the preseruation of so many of them by such weake meanes as they then enioyed, and especially in the so sudden remouall of this great annoyance, there was ioyned with and besides the ordinary and manifest meanes, a more mediate and secret worke of God.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Henry Long,</hi> with seuen others in an extreame storme were cast away, but three of them escaped. One of them being asked what hee thought in the worst of that extremity, answered, he thought nothing but gallowes claime thy right, and it seemes God well heard his prayer, and rewarded his ingratitude; for he was hanged within halfe a yeere after. In that March also fiue men went to Sea, but as yet was neuer heard of, and three more drowned in a boat. By <hi>Hilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> house grew a very faire Cedar, which by a thunder clap was rent almost to small shiuers, and a man stood by him, and <hi>Samuel Tanton,</hi> most fearfully blasted, yet neither they, the house, not a little childe, yet a paire of racks in the house was all torne to fitters. The <hi>Neptune</hi> not long after arriuing to fish for whale, her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune proued no better then the Gouernours, yet some are of opinion, profit might be made by them.</p>
               <p>In May they discried foure saile, so that manning all their Forts, they stood two daies in Armes,<note place="margin">The returne of M. <hi>Powel</hi> from the Indies.</note> expecting what they were; at last they found it Master <hi>Powell</hi> returned from the West-Indies in the <hi>Hopewell,</hi> where missing such trade as he expected, these three Frigots comming in his way, he could not chuse but take them; Meale, Hides and Munition was their lading: Faire weather the Gouernor made with <hi>Powell,</hi> till he had got all the goods into his owne possession, and then called <hi>Powell</hi> to a strict account for doing such an vnwarrantable act; much a doe then was betwixt the taker and receiuer; but <hi>Powell</hi> was glad to be excused to answer it in <hi>England,</hi> leauing all hee had taken behinde him in the Iles: The <hi>Neptune</hi> also returned with him, but noble <hi>Powell</hi> lost all his pay and pillage for

                  </note> as they had determined by lot, M. <hi>Norwood</hi> tooke a plot of the Ile, and diuided it with as much faithfulnes as he could, assigning to euery Aduenturer his share or proportion, as namely, to lay out a large proportion, to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the generall land, and imployed for publike vses, as for the maintenance of the Gouernour, Ministers, Commanders of Forts, souldiers, and such like: and to this end was assigned S. <hi>Georges</hi> Iland, S. <hi>Dauids</hi> Iland, <hi>Longbridge</hi> Iland, <hi>Smiths</hi> Iland, <hi>Coopers</hi> Iland, <hi>Cony</hi> Iland, <hi>Nonesuch</hi> Iland, part of the maine, and sundry other small Iles. The rest was to be diuided into eight parts, each part to be called a tribe, and to haue his denomination of some principall person that was Aduenturer therein: and accordingly the first Tribe to bee Eastward, was then called <hi>Bedfords</hi> Tribe, now <hi>Hamiltons</hi>: the second, <hi>Smiths</hi>: Tribe the third, <hi>Cavendish,</hi> now <hi>Deuonshires</hi>: the fourth, <hi>Pembrooks</hi>: the fift, <hi>Pagits</hi>: the sixt, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils,</hi> now <hi>Warwicks</hi>: the seuenth, <hi>Southhampton</hi>: the eighth, <hi>Sands</hi>: in the honours of the Right honorable the Marquis <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> the <hi>Lord Pagit,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Southhampton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edwin Sands.</hi> Againe each of those Tribes were to bee diuided into fifty parts, called shares; and euery Aduenturer to haue his shares in these tribes as was determined, by casting lots in <hi>England,</hi> the manner of it appeares by the <hi>Map,</hi> and more largely by his Booke of the Suruay of the Countrey, which is in the Records of the Colony. And then began this which was before as you haue heard, but as an vnsetled and confused Chaos, to receiue a disposition, forme, and order, and become indeed a Plantation.</p>

               <p>Now though the Countrey was small, yet they could not conueniently haue beene disposed and well setled, without a true description and a suruey of it; and againe, euery man being setled where he might constantly abide, they knew their businesse, and fitted their houshold accordingly: then they built no more Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens, but substantiall houses, they cleered their grounds, and planted not onely such things as would yeeld them their fruits in a few moneths, but also such as would affoord them profit within a few yeares, so that in a short time the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey began to aspire, and neerely approach vnto that happinesse and prosperitie, wherein now it flourisheth, &amp;c.</p>

About this time arriued the <hi>Diana</hi> with a good supply of men and prouision, and the first Magazin euer seene in those Iles; which course is not so much commended here, as cursed and abhorred by reason of enhanse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Inhabitants there; six or seuen weeks this ship staied, then hauing towards her fraught thirtie thousand weight of Tobacco; which prouing good, and comming to a lucky Market, gaue great encouragement to the Aduenturers to goe lustily forward in their Plantation, and without such successe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but grudging and repining. But about the appropriation of this new built house, many bad discontents grew betwixt the oppressed Colony and the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, especially betwixt him and the Minister, and <hi>Lewes,</hi> who would neither be feared with threats nor imprisonment, that their malice continued till they met in <hi>England,</hi> of which the Minister made the cause so plaiue, hee very well and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly it seemes, discharged himselfe.</p>

house, and that land he had planted for himselfe, by the extreme oppression of the Comminalty. This caused so many ielousies to arise in his conceit, that at last he fully resolued to returne by this ship, that no sooner set saile from <hi>England,</hi> then they proceeded to the nomination of a new Gouernor. Many were presented according to the affections of those that were to giue in their voices, but it chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rested betwixt one Captaine <hi>Southwell,</hi> and one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <note place="margin">The arriuall of two ships.</note>THE vnexpected returne of Captaine <hi>Tuckar,</hi> caused a demurre in the election of the new Gouernor; some perswading these oft changes were so troublesome, dangerous, and chargeable, it were best to continue Captaine <hi>Kendall</hi>; others againe stood for Captaine <hi>Tuckar,</hi> but during the time of these opinions, the <hi>Gilliflower</hi> was dispatched with a supply. Now I should haue remembred, <hi>Tuckar</hi> was no sooner out of the harbour, but he met Master <hi>Elfred</hi> in a ship called the <hi>Treasurer,</hi> sent from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi> to trade: by her he writ to his Deputy Master <hi>Kendall,</hi> to haue a care of all things, and beware of too much acquaintance with this ship, which hee suspected was bound for the West-Indies. Notwithstanding, <hi>Elfred</hi> receiued what kindnesse the Ile could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; he promised to reuisit them at his returne; this done, because they would not be gouernlesse when his Deputiship was expired, there was a generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and by that Election <hi>Kendall</hi> was confirmed to succeed still Gouernor. Now they began to apply themselues to the finishing some plat-forme about <hi>Smiths</hi> Fort, and laying the foundation of a Church to be built of Cedar, till the <hi>Gilly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower</hi> arriued with some priuate letters to <hi>Kendall,</hi> how he was elected Gouernor of those Iles for three yeeres. During her stay they held their Assises, where for some few suspected facts three were condemned, and the better to terrifie the rest, led to the place of execution, but reprieued; diuers of the rest had their faults par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and the <hi>Gilliflower</hi> set saile for <hi>New found land.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Captaine <hi>Butler</hi> chosen Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note>The loue and kindnesse, honesty and industry of this Captaine <hi>Kendall,</hi> hath beene very much commended; by others, somewhat disliked: but an Angell in those imploiments cannot please all men, yet this consideration bred much ill bloud as well here as there, so that the Company directly concluded, Captaine <hi>Butler</hi> should with what expedition they could, goe to be their Gouernor: In the <hi>Interim</hi> they tooke the opportunitie of a ship, called the <hi>Sea-flower,</hi> bound for <hi>Virginia,</hi> and by her sent a Preacher and his Family, with diuers Passengers, and newes of a new Gouernor. This bred a great distaste amongst many, that still they should haue new officers and strangers for their Gouernors they neuer heard of, and themselues still kept there whether they would or no, without any prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no nor scarce any of them their inhabiting, to haue any land at all of their owne, but liue all as tenants, or as other mens poore seruants.</p>
               <p>About this time came in Captaine <hi>Kerby</hi> with a small Barke from the West-Indies, who hauing refreshed himselfe, was very kindly vsed by the Gouernor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12162:106"/>
and so departed. Not long after a Dutch Frigot was cast away vpon the Westerne shore, yet by the helpe of the English they saued the men, though the ship peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed amongst the Rocks. A little after one Ensigne <hi>Wood</hi> being about the loading of a peece, by thrusting a pike into the concauitie, grating vpon the shot, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what about the powder, strucke fire within her and so discharged, but wounded him cruelly and blew him into the Sea, though hee was got out by some that stood by him, yet hee died of those wounds. Within two or three daies after, Captaine <hi>Elfred</hi> now comes in a second time: but of that we shall say more in the gouernment of Captaine <hi>Butler,</hi> who presently after arriued with a good supply, and was kindly entertained by Captaine <hi>Kendall</hi> and all the Colony.</p>

               <p>CAptaine <hi>Butler</hi> being arriued the twentieth of October,<note place="margin">A plat-forme burnt, and much hurt by a <hi>Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano.</hi> 1619.</note> 1619. some mutterings there was how to maintaine their election of Captaine <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> but better remembring themselues, that conceit quickly dissolued. The next day, <hi>Kendall,</hi> the Ministers, and the Counsell went aboord to salute the new Gouernor, where after they had dined with the best entertainment he could giue them; they saw the Redout belonging to the Kings Castle by a mischance on fire, whither he repaired with all the meanes he could to quench it; but all the platforme and cariages were consumed before their faces, and they could not helpe it. Two daies after he went vp to the Towne, had his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publikely read, made a short speech to the Company, and so tooke vpon him the gouernment. Then presently he began to repaire the most necessary defects: The next moneth came in the <hi>Garland,</hi> sent from <hi>England</hi> six or seuen weekes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; so that being seuenteene weeks in her voyage, it was so tedious and grieuous to diuers of the Fresh-water Passengers, that such a sicknesse bred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, many died as well Sailers as Passengers. Hauing taken the best or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he could for their releefe, passed through all the Tribes, and held his first As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sise in Captaine <hi>Tuckars</hi> house at the ouer-plus. Towards the last of this moneth of Nouemb. there arose a most terrible storme or <hi>Hericano,</hi> that blew vp many great trees by the roots: the <hi>Warwick</hi> that brought the Gouernor was cast away, but the <hi>Garland</hi> rid by her, saued her selfe by cutting downe her Masts; and not long after a second storme, no lesse violent then the first, wherein the Mount which was a frame of wood built by Master <hi>More</hi> for a Watch-tower to looke out to Sea, was blowne vp by the roots, and all that Winter crop of corne blasted: And thus was the new Gouernor welcomed.</p>
               <p>With the beginning of the new yeere he began his first peece of fortification,<note place="margin">The refortifying the Kings Castle.</note> vpon a Rocke which flankers the Kings Castle, and finding the ship called the <hi>Treasurer</hi> starke rotten and vnseruiceable, hee tooke nine peeces of Ordinance from her to serue other vses. The <hi>Garland</hi> for want of meanes, could not make her voiage to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi> as she was appointed; wherefore he entertained her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>England,</hi> with all the Tabacco they had in the Ile. It was Ianuary before she departed, in which time shee failed not much to haue beene twice cast away. But those strange and vnauoidable mischances, rather seemed to quicken the Gouernors industry then to dull it. Hauing finished the Church begun by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Kendall,</hi> with an infinite toile and labour he got three peeces out of the wracke <hi>VVarwicke.</hi> Hauing an excellent Dutch Carpinter he entertained of them that were cast away in the Dutch Frigot; he imploied him in building of Boats, whereof they were in exceeding great want. In February they discouered a tall ship beating too and againe, as it seemed by her working, being ignorant of the Coast; some thought her a <hi>Spaniard</hi> to view their Forts, which stand most to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12162:107"/>
that part she so neerely approached; some, English; but the most, some Dutch man of Warre: The wind blew to high, they durst not send out a Boat, though they much doubted she would be foule of their Rocks, but at last she bore vp rommy for the Sea,<note place="margin">Amber-greece found.</note> and we heard of her no more. That euening, a lucky fellow it should seeme he was, that found a peece of Amber-greece of eight ounces, as he had twice before, which bringing to the Gouernor, he had ready money for the one halfe, after three pound an ounce, according to their order of Court, to encourage others to looke out for more, and preuent the mischiefe insueth by concealing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The arriuall of two Dutch Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots.</note>Within a few daies after, they descried two Frigots that came close to the shore, and sent a Letter to the Gouernor, writ in <hi>Italian,</hi> that they were <hi>Hollanders</hi> had beene in the West-Indies, and desired but to arriue, refresh themselues with wood and water, and so be gone. The Gouernor forthwith sent them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that being there vnder his Maiestie of <hi>England</hi> to command those Iles, he was to carrie himselfe a friend to his friends, and an enemy to his enemies; if therefore he could shew a lawfull Commission for his being honestly and nobly emploied, he and his should be kindly welcome, otherwise they were to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at their perills. But his Commission was so good, he staied there two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and was so well fitted with Oile &amp; Bacon, they were all glad and happy of this Dutch Captaine <hi>Scoutans</hi> arriuall, with many thanks to their old friend Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Powell</hi> that had conducted him thither: the Colony being exceedingly in great want and distresse, bought the most part of it at reasonable rates, so Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Scoutan</hi> returned to the West-Indies, and Captaine <hi>Powell</hi> for his part in the Low-Countries. Whilest these things were in action, the Aduenturers in \
<hi>England</hi> made many a long looke for their ships; at last the <hi>Garland</hi> brought them all the newes, but the Tobacco was so spoiled either in the leaking ship, or the making vp, it caused a great suspicion there could none was good come from those Iles; where (were they but perfit in the cure) questionlesse it would be much better then a great quantitie of that they sell for <hi>Verinas,</hi> and many a thousand of it in <hi>London</hi> hath beene bought and sold by that title.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The differences betwixt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note>The Gouernor being cleere of those distractions, falls vpon the restoring of the burnt Redoubt, where he cuts out a large new plat-forme, and mounts seuen great peece of Ordnance vpon new cariages of Cedar. Now amongst all those troubles, it was not the least to bring the two Ministers to subscribe to the Booke of Common Praier, which all the Bishops in <hi>England</hi> could not doe. Finding it high time to attempt some conformitie, bethought himselfe of the Liturgie of <hi>Garnsey</hi> and <hi>Iarse,</hi> wherein, all those particulars they so much stumbled at, were omitted. No sooner was this propounded, but it was gladly imbraced by them both, whereupon the Gouernor translated it <hi>verbatim</hi> out of French into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and caused the eldest Minister vpon Easter day to begin the vse thereof at <hi>S. Georges</hi> towne, where himselfe, most of the Councell, Officers and Auditorie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament: the which forme they continued during the time of his gouernment.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The rebuilding the Mount.</note>Much about this time, in such a faire morning, that had inuited many Boats farre out to the Sea to fish, did rise such a <hi>Hericano</hi> that much indangered them all, so that one of them with two Boies were driuen to Sea and neuer more heard of. The Ministers thus agreed, a Proclamation was published for keeping of the Sabbath, and all the defectiue cariages he endeuoured to haue renewed, builded a small Boat of Cedar onely to goe with Ores, to be ready vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to discouer any shipping, and tooke order euery Fort should haue the like: Also caused numbers of Cedars to be brought from diuers places in flotes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build the Mount, which with an vnspeakable toile, was raised seuen foot higher then before, and a Falcon mounted at the foot, to be alwaies discharged for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all the Forts vpon the discouery of any shipping, and this he called Rich Mount. This exceeding toile and labour, hauing no Cattle but onely mens
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12162:107"/>
strengths, caused many petitions to the Gouernour, that all those generall works might cease till they had reaped their haruests, in that they were in great distresse for victuall; which hee so well answered, their owne shames did cause them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist from that importunity, and voluntarily performe as much as hee required.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Their Acts.</note>The first was against the vniust sale and letting of apprentises and other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and this was especially for the righting the vndertakers in <hi>England.</hi> The second, concerning the disposing of aged, diseased, and impotent persons, for it being considered how carelesse many are in preferring their friends, or sending sometimes any they can procure to goe, such vnseruiceable people should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back at their charge that sent them, rather then be burdensome to the poore Inhabitants in the Iles. The third, the necessary manning the Kings Castle, being the key of the Ile, that a garison of twelue able men should bee there alwaies resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and 3000. eares of corne, and 1000. pounds of Tobacco payed them by the generality yeerely, as a pension. The fourth, against the making vnmarchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Tobacco, and Officers sworne to make true trials, &amp; burne that was naught. The fist, inioyned the erection of certaine publike bridges, and the maintenance of them. The sixt, for a continuall supply of victuall for all the Forts, to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, till some great occasion to vse it. The seuenth was, for two fixed dayes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere for the Assises. The eight, commands the making of high-waies, and prohibiting the passage ouer mens grounds and planted fields, as well to preuent the spoyling of gardens, as conueniencie to answer any alarum. The ninth, for the preseruing young tortoises and birds, that were carelesly destroyed. The tenth, prouided against vagabonds, &amp; prohibited the entertainement of other mens ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. The eleuenth, compelled the setting of a due quantity of corne for euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The twelfth, the care corne being set, enioyned the keeping vp of their poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try till it was past their reaches. The thirteenth, for the preseruation of sufficient fences, &amp; against the selling of marked trees appointed for bounds. The fourteenth, granted to a leuy for a thousand pound weight of Tobacco, towards the payment of publike workes, as the bridges and the mount. The fifteenth, for the enioyning an acknowledgement and acception of all resident Gouernours, and the warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to continue, though his time be expired, till the arriuall of a legitimate successor from <hi>England,</hi> to preuent all vomeet and presumptuous elections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it was desired by petition in <hi>England,</hi> the new Gouernous should liue two months as a priuate man after his arriuall, if his predecessor did stay so long, the better to learne and obserue his course. And these are the contents of those fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Acts, applied as you may perceiue: which the lawes of <hi>England</hi> could not take notice of, because euery climate hath somewhat to it selfe in that kinde in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; for otherwise as it is conceiued, it had beene a high impudency and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to haue medled with them, or indeed with any such as these lawes, that had with such great iudgement and iustice alwaies prouided for.</p>

But this bad, weake, sickly supply being dispersed for their best reliefe, by the much imployment of his boats in remoouing them, many of his owne men became infected, so that for some weekes, they were not able to doe him any seruice at all.

                  <note place="margin">A strange deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish wracke.</note>The very next daies night after the arriuall of the Magazins ship, newes was brought the Gouernor by a dismaied Messenger from <hi>Sands</hi> his Tribe, that one hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> were landed in that part, and diuers ships discouered at Sea, whereupon he presently manned the Forts, and instantly made thitherward in person with twentie men, determining as he found cause to draw together more strength by the way. Being got thither by the breake of the next day, in stead of an enemy which he expected, he met onely with a company of poore distressed <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who in their passage from <hi>Carthagena</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> in consort with the Spanish fleet of Plait; by the same storme that had indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Magazin ship, lost theirs vpon those terrible Rocks, being to the number of seuenty persons, were strangely preserued; and the manner was thus.</p>
               <p>About Sunne-set their ship beating amongst the Rocks, some twenty of the Sailers got into the Boat with what treasure they could, leauing the Captaine, the Master, and all the rest to the mercy of the Sea. But a Boy not past foureteene yeares of age that leaped after to haue got into the Boat, missing that hope, it pleased God he got vpon a Chest a drift by him, whereon they report he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued two daies, and was driuen neere to the cleane contrary part of the Ile, where he was taken vp neere dead, yet well recouered. All this night the ship sticking fast, the poore distressed in her the next day spying land, made a raft, and were those gaue the alarum first a shore about three of the clocke in the after noone. The morning after, about seuen of the clocke came in the Boat to a place called <hi>Mangroue Bay</hi>; and the same day their Carpenter was driuen a shore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Planke neere <hi>Hog-Bay.</hi> There was a Gentlewoman that had stood wet vp to the middle vpon the raft from the ship to the shore, being big with childe; and although this was vpon the thirteenth of September, she tooke no hurt, and was safely deliuered of a Boy within three daies after. The best comfort could be giuen them in those extremities they had, although some of the baser sort had beene rifling some of them before the Gouernors arriuall: Also the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Captaine and the chiefe with him, much complained of the treachery of his men to leaue him in that manner, yet had conueyed with them the most of the money they could come by, which he easily missed; whereupon hee suddenly caused all them he accused, to be searched, and recouered to the value of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fortie pounds starling, which he deliuered into the Captaines hands, to be imploied in a generall purse towards their generall charge: during their stay in the Iles, some of the better sort, nine or ten weeks dieted at his owne table, the rest were billited amongst the Inhabitants at foure shillings the weeke, till they found shipping for their passage, for which they paied no more then the English paied themselues; and for the passage of diuers of them, the Gouernor was glad to stand bound to the Master; some others that were not able to procure such friendship, were so constrained to stay in the Iles, till by their labours they had got

so much as would transport them; and thus they were preserued, releeued, and deliuered.</p>

The fift of Nouember the damnable plot of the powder treason was solemnized, with Praiers, Sermons, and a great Feast, whereto the Gouernor inuited the chiefe of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where drinking the Kings health, it was honored with a quicke volly of small shot, which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered from the Forts with the great Ordnance, and then againe concluded with a second volley of small shot; neither was the afternoone without musicke and dancing, and at night many huge bone-fires of sweet wood.</p>

He had beene there before presently after her ruine, for neuer had ship a more sudden death, being now split in peeces all vnder water. He found small hope to recouer any thing, saue a Cable and an Anchor, and two good Sacars; but the wind was so high hee was forced to returne, being ten miles from the shore, onely with three Murderers, which were knowne to be the same Captaine <hi>Kendall</hi> had sold to Captaine <hi>Kerby,</hi> whose ship was taken by two men of warre of <hi>Carthagena,</hi> the most of his men slaine or hanged, and he being wounded, died in the woods.

This yeare hauing a very faire crop, some of the Inhabitants, none of the best husbands, hastily gathered it for feare of the penaltie, threw it in great heaps into their houses vnhusked, and so let it lie foure or fiue moneths, which was thought would haue spoiled it: where the good husbands husked it, and with much labour hung it vp, where the Flies did so blow on it, they increased to so many Weauels, they generally

The second was appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Cities of <hi>Bristol, Exeter</hi> and <hi>Plimoth,</hi> &amp;c. and the West parts of <hi>England,</hi> and all those that would aduenture and ioine with them, and they might make their choise any where betwixt the degrees of 38. and 44. prouided there should bee at least 100. miles distance betwixt these 2. Colonies, each of which had lawes, priuileges and authoritie, for the gouernment and aduancing their seuerall Plantations alike. Now this part of <hi>America</hi> hath formerly beene called <hi>Norumbega, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia, Nuskoncus, Penaquida, Cannada,</hi> and such other names as those that ranged the Coast pleased. But because it was so mountainous, rocky and full of Iles, few haue aduentured much to trouble it, but as is formerly related; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that honourable Patron of vertue, Sir <hi>Iohn Popham,</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice of <hi>England,</hi> in the yeere 1606. procured meanes and men to possesse it, and sent Captaine <hi>George Popham</hi> for President, Captaine <hi>Rawley Gilbert</hi> for Admirall,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Treasurer.</note> Captaine <hi>Edward Harlow</hi> master of the Ordnance, Captaine <hi>Robert Dauis</hi> Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant-Maior, Captaine <hi>Elis Best</hi> Marshall, Master <hi>Seaman</hi> Secretary, Captaine <hi>Iames Dauis</hi> to be Captaine of the Fort, Master <hi>Gome Carew</hi> chiefe Searcher: all those were of the Councell, who with some hundred more were to stay in the Country: they set saile from <hi>Plimoth</hi> the last of May, and fell with <hi>Monahigan</hi> the eleuenth of August. At <hi>Sagadahock</hi> 9. or 10. leagues southward, they planted themselues at the mouth of a faire nauigable Riuer, but the coast all thereabouts most extreme stony and rocky: that extreme frozen Winter was so cold they could not range nor search the Country, and their prouision so small, they were glad to send all but 45. of their company backe againe: their noble President Captaine <hi>Popham</hi> died, and not long after arriued two ships well prouided of all necessaries to supply them, and some small time after another, by whom vnderstanding of the

            <p>Notwithstanding, the right Honourable <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of South-hampton and those of the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> imploied Captaine <hi>Edward Harlow</hi> to discouer an Ile supposed about Cape <hi>Cod,</hi> but they found their plots had much abused them, for falling with <hi>Monahigan,</hi> they found onely Cape <hi>Cod</hi> no Ile but the maine, there they detained three Saluages aboord them, called <hi>Pechmo, Monopet</hi> and <hi>Peke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimne,</hi> but <hi>Pechmo</hi> leapt ouer board, and got away; and not long after with his consorts cut their Boat from their sterne, got her on shore, and so filled her with sand, and guarded her with Bowes and Arrowes the English lost her: not farre from thence they had three men sorely wounded with Arrowes. Anchoring at the Ile of <hi>Nohone,</hi> the Saluages in their Canowes assaulted the Ship till the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Guns made them retire, yet here they tooke <hi>Sakaweston,</hi> that after he had liued many yeeres in <hi>England</hi> went a Souldier to the warres of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> At <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pawo</hi> they tooke <hi>Coneconam</hi> and <hi>Epenow,</hi> but the people at <hi>Agawom</hi> vsed them kindly, so with fiue Saluages they returned for <hi>England,</hi> yet Sir <hi>Francis Popham</hi> sent diuers times one Captaine <hi>Williams</hi> to <hi>Monahigan</hi> onely to trade and make core fish, but for any Plantations there was no more speeches. For all this, as I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Virginia</hi> well, though not their proceedings, so I desired also to see this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and spend some time in trying what I could finde for all those ill rumors and disasters. <hi>From the relations of Captaine</hi> Edward Harlow <hi>and diuers others.</hi>

I dare boldly say, because I haue seene naturally growing or breeding in those parts, the same materials that all these are made of, they may as well bee had here, or the most part of them within the distance of seuentie leagues for some few ages, as from all those parts, vsing but the same meanes to haue them that they doe; but surely in <hi>Virginia,</hi> their most tender and daintiest fruits or commodities, would be as perfit as theirs, by reason of the heat, if not in <hi>New England,</hi> and with all those aduantages.</p>
               <p>First, the ground is so fertill,<note place="margin">The nature of the ground ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued.</note> that questionlesse it is capable of producing any Graine, Fruits, or Seeds, you will sow or plant, growing in the Regions afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named: But it may be not to that perfection of delicacy, because the Summer is not so hot, and the Winter is more cold in those parts we haue yet tried neere the Sea side, then wee finde in the same height in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Asia:</hi> yet I made a Garden vpon the top of a Rocky Ile in three and forty degrees and an halfe, foure leagues from the maine in May, that grew so well, as it serued vs for Sallets in Iune and Iuly. All sorts of Cattle may here be bred and fed in the Iles or Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulaes securely for nothing. In the <hi>Interim,</hi> till they increase (if need be) obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the seasons, I durst vndertake to haue Corne enough from the Saluages for three hundred men, for a few trifles; and if they should be vntowards, as it is most certaine they will, thirtie or fortie good men will be sufficient to bring them all in subiection, and make this prouision, if they vnderstand what to doe; two hundred whereof may eight or nine moneths in the yeere be imploied in helping the Fisher-men, till the rest prouide other necessaries, fit to furnish vs with other Commodities.</p>
               <p>In March, Aprill, May, and halfe Iune, heere is Cod in abundance; In May,<note place="margin">The seasons for fishing approued.</note> Iune, Iuly, and August, Mullit and Sturgion, whose Roes doe make Cauiare and Puttargo; Herring, if any desire them: I haue taken many out of the bellies of Cods, some in nets; but the Saluages compare the store in the Sea with the haires of their heads: and surely there are an incredible abundance vpon this Coast.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12162:119"/>
In the end of August, September, October, and Nouember, you may haue Cod againe to make Core-fish or Poore-Iohn: Hake you may haue when the Cod failes in Summer, if you will fish in the night, which is better then Cod. Now each hundred you take here, is as good as two or three hundred in <hi>New found Land</hi>; so that halfe the labour in hooking, splitting and touring, is saued: And you may haue your fish at what market you will, before they haue any in <hi>New found land,</hi> where their fishing is chiefely but in Iune and Iuly, where it is here in March, Aprill, May, September, October and Nouember, as is said; so that by reason of this Plantation, the Merchants may haue their fraught both out and home, which yeelds an aduantage worth consideration. Your Core-fish you may in like manner transport as you see cause, to serue the Ports in <hi>Portugall,</hi> as <hi>Lisbone, Auera, Porta</hi> Port, and diuers others, (or what market you please) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Ilanders returne. They being tied to the season in the open Sea, and you hauing a double season, and fishing before your doores, may euery night sleep quietly ashore with good cheere, and what fires you will, or when you please with your wiues and family: they onely and their ships in the maine Ocean, that must carie and containe all they vse, besides their fraught. The Mullits here are in that abundance, you may take them with nets sometimes by hundreds, where at Cape <hi>Blanke</hi> they hooke them; yet those are but a soot and a halfe in length; these two, three, or foure, as oft I haue measured, which makes me suspect they are some other kinde of fish, though they seeme the same, both in fashion and goodnesse. Much Salmon some haue found vp the Riuers as they haue passed, and here the aire is so temperate,<note place="margin">Imploiment for poore people and fatherlesse children.</note> as all these at any time may be preserued. Now, young Boies and Girles Saluages, or any other bee they neuer such idlers, may turne, carie or returne a fish, without either shame or any great paine: He is very idle that is past twelue yeeres of age and cannot doe so much, and she is very old that cannot spin a threed to make Engins to catch a fish.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The facilitie of the Plantation.</note>For their transportation, the ships that goe there to fish may transport the first: who for their passage will spare the charge of double manning their ships, which they must do in <hi>New found land</hi> to get their fraught; but one third part of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany are onely proper to serue a stage, carie a Barrow, and turne Poore-Iohn; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, they must haue meat, drinke, clothes, &amp; passage so well as the rest.

Strange they thought it, that a Barke of threescore tuns with foure guns should stand vpon such termes, they being eightie expert Sea-men, in an excellent ship of one hundred and fortie tuns, and thirty six cast Peeces and Murderers: But when they knew our Captaine, so many of them had beene his Souldiers, and they but lately runne from <hi>Tunis,</hi> where they had stolne this ship, wanted victuall, and in combustion amongst themselues, would haue yeelded all to his protection, or wafted vs any whither: but those mutinies occasioned vs to reiect their offer, which afterward we all repented.

Now how I haue or could preuent these accidents, hauing no more meanes, I rest at your censures; but to proceed to the matter; yet must I sigh and say, How oft hath Fortune in the world (thinke I) brought slauery, freedome, and turned all diuersly. <hi>Newfoundland</hi> I haue heard at the first, was held as desperate a fishing as this I proiect for <hi>New England, Placentia,</hi> and the <hi>Banke</hi> nere also as doubtfull to the French: But for all the disasters hapned me, the businesse is the same it was, and the fiue ships went from <hi>London,</hi> whereof one was reported more then three hundred tunnes, found fish so much, that neither <hi>Izeland</hi> man, nor <hi>Newfoundland</hi> man I could heare of hath bin there, will go any more to either place, if they may go thither.

For this fishing stretcheth along the Sea Coast from Cape <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> which is seuen or eight hundred miles at the least, and hath his course in the deepes, and by the shore, all the yere long, keeping their hants and feedings, as the beasts of the field, and the birds of the aire. But all men are not such as they should be, that haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken those voyages: All the <hi>Romans</hi> were not <hi>Scipiocs,</hi> nor <hi>Carthagenians Hanibals,</hi> nor all the <hi>Genw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> nor all the <hi>Spaniards Courteses:</hi> had they diued no deeper in the secrets of their discoueries then we, or stopped at such doubts and poore accidentall chances, they had neuer beene remembred as they are, yet had they no such certainties to begin as we.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> did first begin this innocent worke to plant the earth to remaine to posterity, but not without labour, trouble, and industry. <hi>Noe</hi> and his family began againe the second Plantation; and their seed as it still increased, hath still planted new Countries, and one Countrey another, and so the world to that estate it is: but not without much hazard, trauell, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities, discontents, and many disasters. Had those worthy Fathers, and their memorable off-spring, not beene more diligent for vs now in these ages, then we are to plant that yet are vnplanted for the after liuers. Had the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Sauiour Christ, and his Apostles, exposed themselues to no more dangers to teach the Gospell then we, euen wee our selues had at this present beene as saluage, and as miserable as the most barbarous Saluage, yet vnciuilized. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the rest, what was it they would not vndertake to inlarge their Teritories, enrich their subiects, resist their enemies. Those that were the founders of those great Monarchies and their vertues, were no siluered idle golden Pharises, but indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Iron steeled Publicans: They regarded more prouisions and necessaries
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12162:126"/>
for their people, then Iewels, riches, ease, or delight for themselues; Riches were their Seruants, not their Masters. They ruled (as Fathers, not as Titants) their people as Children, not as Slaues; there was no disaster could discourage them; and let none thinke they incountred not with all manner of incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And what hath euer beene the worke of the greatest Princes of the Earth, but planting of Countries, and ciuilizing barbarous and inhumane Nations to ciuilitie and humanitie, whose eternall actions fills our Histories.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose euer-liuing actions before our eies will testifie with them our idlenesse, and ingratitude to all posterities, and the neglect of our duties, in our pietie and religion. We owe our God, our King and Countrey, and want of Charitie to those poore Saluages, whose Countrey wee challenge, vse and possesse; except wee be but made to vse, and marre what our fore-fathers made, or but onely tell what they did, or esteeme our selues too good to take the like paines. Was it vertue in them to prouide that doth maintaine vs, and basenesse in vs to doe the like for others? Surely no. Then seeing we are not borne for our selues, but each to help other, and our abilities are much alike at the houre of our birth, and the minute of our death: seeing our good deeds or our bad by faith in Christs merits, is all we haue, to carie our soules to heauen or hell.

But your home-bred ingrossing Proiecters will at last finde, there is a great difference betwixt saying and doing, or those that thinks their directions can be as soone and easily performed, as they can conceit them; or that their conceits are the fittest things to bee put in practise, or their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances maintaine Plantations.

               <p>By his estimation and calculation these 8. Boats with 22. men in a Summer doe vsually kill 25000. fish for euery Boat, which may amount to 200000. allowing 120. fishes to the 100. sometimes they haue taken aboue 35000. for a Boat, so that they load not onely their owne ship, but prouide great quantities for sacks, or other spare ships which come thither onely to buy the ouerplus: if such ships come not, they giue ouer taking any more, when sometimes there hath beene great abundance, because there is no fit houses to lay them in till another yeere, now most of those sacks goeth empty thither, which might as well transport mens prouision and cattle at an easie rate as nothing, either to <hi>New-England</hi> or <hi>New-found land,</hi> but either to transport them for nothing or pay any great matter for their liberty to fish, will hardly effect so much as freedome as yet; nor can this be put in practice as before I said, till there be a power there well planted and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to entertaine and defend them, assist and releeue them as occasion shall require, otherwaies those small diuisions will effect little, but such miserable conclusions as both the French and we too long haue tried to our costs.
