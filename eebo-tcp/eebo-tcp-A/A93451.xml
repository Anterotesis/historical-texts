            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sober and Serious QUAERIES about the Popiſh Plot, and the
Proteſtants of ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>THo in this unparallel'd age ſome might think nothing could ſeem too ſtrange;
Yet the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Impudence, in a Proteſtant Country, is certainly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd;
'Tis an intolerable preſumption that they dare contrive all poſſible
Villanies, and then endeavour to wipe off the Guilt by laying it upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
Amongſt the reſt, we cannot but take notice of that Popiſh Drudge <hi>N. T.</hi>
the Jeſuits Tool, and common Hackney for conveying their Venom into the minds of
the unthinking and unwary People, that by the noiſe of PLOTS and Deſigns amongſt
Proteſtants, they might ſuppreſs the proſecution of that Undeniable one of their own.
This Impudent News-monger in his Lying <hi>Intelligence</hi> Numb. 162. out of Zeal forſooth,
to propagate the <hi>Reformed Religon,</hi> by ridiculing the True Profeſſors thereof, muſt
needs make the world believe, by his Falſe and Impertinent <hi>Quaeres,</hi> That Proteſtants em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
as pernicious Doctrines, and uſe worſe Practices than the <hi>Papists,</hi> or the very
<hi>Fryars, Priests</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> though Malice it ſelf cannot inſtance one Proteſtant in
<hi>England</hi> Guilty of any ſuch Crimes; or that will not freely renounce all Dangerous
and Diſloyal Principles inconſiſtent with the Government. But becauſe I intend ſhortly
to publiſh a particular Confutation of theſe Idle <hi>Quaeres;</hi> I will in the mean time only
deſire Loyal <hi>N. T</hi>'s ſpeedy Anſwer to the following Interrogatories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> Whether it be not Arraigning the Juſtice of the Nation, and the Wiſdom of <hi>Three Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Parliaments,</hi> to ſay, That the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was but a Contrivance of
the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> when ſo many Jeſuits and known Traytors have been Executed upon that
account, and <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters were ſo full to confirm the Testimonies of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> Capt.
<hi>Bedlow,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> Whether the Commitment and Perſecution of the Earl of <hi>Shafts.</hi> was not a Contrivance
of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> managed by their Agents and Hirelings, in order to frighten others from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
the Helliſh Conſpiracies of that Faction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Whether the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> produced at the Proceedings againſt that Noble Peer, was
not framed by a <hi>Popiſh Polititian,</hi> and foisted in among other <hi>Papers,</hi> by thoſe that pretend to
have found it in his Lordſhip's Cloſet, the better to gain credit to the Incredible Depoſitions of
their <hi>Pupils?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Whether it be not great Inſolence in any Man in</hi> England <hi>to proſecute</hi> Diſſenting
Proteſtants <hi>upon</hi> Penal Laws <hi>made againſt</hi> Papiſts; <hi>eſpecially ſince the</hi> Repreſentative bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>of the Nation have reſolv'd in</hi> Parliament, That to put thoſe Laws in Execution againſt
Proteſtants, is at this time a Grievance to the Subject, and a great encouragement to
Popery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> Whether there be any relying on the Fidelity or Interest of the <hi>Addreſſors,</hi> and <hi>Aſſociation-Abhorrors?</hi>
And whether they are more Loyal now, than when they petitioned for a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
Or, can it be thought, if time will ſerve, but they may again turn <hi>Petitioners?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VI.</hi> Whether <hi>Warcup, Fitz-Gerald, Marriot</hi> and <hi>Graham,</hi> the Great Managers of the
late <hi>Sham-Plots,</hi> have not been more zealous for the Gentleman in the North, than for the
<hi>KING;</hi> And as active to ſtifle Evidences of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> as to create <hi>New Ones</hi> to fix
a <hi>Proteſtant Conſpiracy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VII.</hi> Whether theſe Managers have <hi>won</hi> or <hi>loſt</hi> by their new Imployment? And whether
they are not ſupported by ſome of the firſt Magnitude about Court (as is ſpecified in the <hi>1ſt. 2d.</hi>
and <hi>3d.</hi> parts of <hi>No Proteſtant-plot</hi>) in order to advance the Intereſt of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
and put an end to the <hi>Popiſh Plot?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> Whether <hi>Warcup</hi> and <hi>Fitz Gerald,</hi> (who have often declared, that the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi>
in <hi>Ireland</hi> was Voted in <hi>Parliament</hi> upon falſe and groundleſs ſurmiſes) do not ſtudy to ſtifle
the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and aſperſe the Wiſdom of the <hi>Parliament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IX.</hi> Whether <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> (that had the Impudence to ſay, that <hi>Stafford</hi> and <hi>Plunket</hi> died
<hi>Innocent,</hi> and that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> ought not to be Tryed in <hi>England</hi>) be not as much a
<hi>Papiſt</hi> as he is an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> and deſerves rather a cloſe Confinement, till he is called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> than to have the liberty of trotting the <hi>Iriſh-Boggs,</hi> or be fed at Court
for God knows what?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>X,</hi> Whether the Interest of the Gentleman in the North, or the ability and policy of <hi>Wor. Hal:
Clar. H—d, S—r,</hi> or <hi>J.</hi> will be able to protect their Mercenary Hirelings, or juſtifie
their own Proceedings ſince the Diſſolution of the laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> when called to an accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
