            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On a day as I was syttynge in my lytell cell dyuers bokes of dyuers matters aboute me. Myne entente was at that tyme to trauayle and to gather in to my consayte the wayenge of dyuers sentences of dyuers auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours by my longe tyme before studyed.

I thought that in maner of solace I wolde vysyte hym. And yet I had not loked longe on hym but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my good moder that bare me called me to the refeccyon of

souper wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre was come purposynge to se hym in the mornynge / I lefte hym at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme / &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we folowynge I sate me agayne to my study as I dyde of custome I forgate it not in put my wyll to effecte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came to me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nyght before to vysyte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foresayd boke of Matheolus.

But as me se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter was not ryght pleasaunt to people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> delyted them not in euyll sayenge / nor it was of no profyte to ony edyfyenge of vertue / seynge the wordes &amp; the matters dyshonest of whiche it tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched vysytynge here &amp; there / &amp; so came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende I lefte hym &amp; toke hede of more hygher matters &amp; of more profyte / yet the syght of this foresayd boke howe be it that he was of none auctoryte it enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred in me a newe thought / whiche made grete meruayle to growe in my courage / &amp; thynkynge what myght be the cause and wherof it myght co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me that so many dyuers men clerkes and others haue ben and ben enclyned to say by mouthe / &amp; in theyr treatyse and wrytynges so many slaundres and blames of women and of theyr condycyons &amp; not onely one or twayne nor this Matheolus / whiche amonge others hath no maner of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon and treateth in maner of scorne / but general<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in all treatyses of phylosphres / poetes / and all rethorycyens / whiche sholde be longe to reherce all theyr names / speketh as it were by one mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the and accordeth all in semble conclusyon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynynge that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condycyons of women ben fully

enclyned to all vyces. These thynges thynkynge in me ryght depely / I began to examyne myselfe and my condycyons as a woman naturall. And in lyke wyse I dyscuted of other women / whos companye I haunted / as well of pryncesses and of grete ladyes as of meane gentyll women ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght grete plentye / whiche of theyr graces haue tol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de me theyr pryuytees and strayte thoughtes to knowe by my Iugement in conscyence and with out fauoure yf it it myght be trewe that so many notable men of one and other wytnesseth / yet not withstandynge that for thynges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I myght kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we as longe as I haue sought and serched I cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de not perceyue that suche Iugementes myght be trewe agaynst the naturall condycyons or ma ners of women. I argued strongly agaynst these women sayenge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it sholde be to grete a thynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so many famous men / so solempne clarkes of soo hyghe and grete vnderstandynge / so clerely seyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in all thynges as it semed that sholde haue spo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken or wryten lyengly / and in so many places y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of payne I founde ony morall volume what so euer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auctoure were y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> or I had redde it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende but some chapytres or certayne clauses were of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge of theym. This onely shorte reason made me to conclude that myne vnderstandynge / for his symplenesse &amp; ygnoraunce ne coude not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we my grete defautes and semblably of other wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men that alwaye it accorded that it was so true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / and soo I reported me more to the Iugement

of other then to that I felte or knowe of myselfe. Thus in this thought was I as a persone halfe from hymselfe / &amp; there came before me ryght gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te foyson of dyttyes &amp; prouerbes of many dyuers auctours to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I remembred in myselfe one after another / as it were a welle spryngyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.

Of that Am brose hadde grete Ioye. And forth with Sagurat made to delyuer hym an house. And for to deceyue hym the better she toke hym money in his handes And shewed hym so grete sygne of loue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was alwaye with hym. And she made hym to tell that Iape before the Sowdan to make hym to laughe And to saye shortely howe the thynge was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned. So moche Sagurat dyde and pourcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that she dyde so moche to the Ieneuoys that were in that countre after that that she knewe the estate of Baruabo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was fallen in pouerte. what for the grete fynaunce that he had payed / and for

And then Ambrose chaunged co loure as he to whom the trouthe myght vnethes suffre to couer soo an vntrue fraude / for it was to hym a sodayne thynge of the whiche he toke no he de. Then he toke to hym a lytell maner and answe red. My lorde it is no force thoughe I tell it not. Barnabo knoweth well ynoughe. I haue shame of his shame. And then Barnabo full of sorowe &amp; of shame prayed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he myght neuer here of it more / and that he wolde lette hym leue. But Sagurat answered as in laughynge that he sholde not go / and that it was conuenyent that he lete hym tell it. Then Ambrose whiche sawe that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned
<pb facs="tcp:192563:138"/>
began to say all with a tremblynge voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that he had made Barnabo to vnderstande and all as he had tolde them. And when he had ended his reason Sagurat asked of Barnabo yf it were true that Ambrose had sayd / and he answered and sayd ye without fayle. And howe sayd Sagurat be ye well certayne that this man here laye with your wyfe / for that that he tolde to you certayne tokens / be you suche a beest that you can not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we that by wayes ynowe fraudelently he myght knowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> facyon of her body without lyenge with her / and ye haue for this cause made your wyfe to dye / ye are worthy to dye yourselfe for ye haue no suffycyent profe.

There was a grete assemble / what of lordes of the Sowdans as of grete foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Lombardes whiche meruayllously herke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this thynge.
