         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The EXPLANATION.</p>
            <p>Such is the Juſt and Generous Deteſtation and Hatred of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation againſt the Tyranny and Superſtition of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion (if it be lawful to call ſuch a Maſs ot Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Nonſence by ſo Sacred a Name) that they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all occaſions to expreſs their Abhorrence thereof; but more eſpeciailly ſince the Diſcovery of that Horrid and Trayterous Conſpiracy againſt His Majeſties Perſon, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Government Eſtabliſhed, which they ſufficiently Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified upon the 17th. of <hi>November;</hi> That being the Day wherein the Unfortunate Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Died, and that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sun, Queen <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> of Happy Memory, aroſe in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horizon, and thereby diſpelled thoſe thick Fogs and Miſts of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Blindneſs, and reſtored to theſe Kingdoms their juſt Rights both as Men and Chriſtians. In Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of this great Bleſſing, ſome Honourable and Worthy Gentlemen, both, in <hi>London,</hi> and at the <hi>Temple</hi> (remembring the Burning of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> by <hi>Popiſh</hi> Hands) were pleaſed to be at the Charge of an extraordinary Tryumph up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Day aforeſaid, to Confront the Inſolence of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction, who after all the Miraculous Diſcoveries of their Curſed Contrivances, have ſtill the Impudence yet to hope of <hi>Succeeding</hi> in their Traiterous Deſigns for Enſlaving theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſaid 17th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1679. the Bells began ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to Ring at Three of the Clock in the Morning: About Five a Clock in the Evening, all things being in readineſs, the Solemn Proceſſion began, ſetting forth from <hi>More-Gate,</hi> and of proceeded to <hi>Biſhops-Gate,</hi> and down <hi>Hownſditch</hi> to <hi>Aid-Gate,</hi> and from thenee through <hi>London-Hall-Street,</hi> the <hi>Royal Exchange, Cheapſide,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> in the following Order;</p>

VIII. Six <hi>Jeſuits</hi> with Bloody Daggers. IX. A Confort of Wind-Muſick, call'd the <hi>waits.</hi> X. Four Popiſh Biſhops in Purple and Lawn Sleeves, with Golden Croſſes on their Breaſts. XI. Four other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Biſhops in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> with Surplices, Rich Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered Copes, and Golden Miters on their Heads. XII. Six Cardinals in Scarlet Robes and Red Caps. XIII. The Popes Chief Phyſitian with <hi>Jeſuites Powder</hi> in one hand, and an <hi>Urinal</hi> in the other. XIV.

Laſtly, The <hi>Pope</hi> in a Lofty Glorious Pageant, Repreſenting a Chair of State, covered with Scarlet, the Chair Richly Embroydered, Fringed, and bedeckt with Golden Balls and Croſſes; at his Feet a Cuſhion of State, two Boys in Surplices, with white Silk Banners and Red Croſſes, and bloody Daggers for Murdering Heretical Kings and Princes, painted on them, with an Incence — Pot before them, fate on each ſide cenſing his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> who was arrayed in a rich Scarlet Gown, Lined through with <hi>Ermin,</hi> and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gold and Silver Lace; on his Head a Tripple Crown of Gold, and a Glorious Collor of Gold and precious Stones, St. <hi>Peters</hi> Keys, a number of Beads, <hi>Agnus Det</hi>'s and other <hi>Catholick</hi> Trumpery; at his Back ſtood his <hi>Holineſs</hi>'s Privy Councellor, the <hi>Devil,</hi> frequently Careſſing, Hugging and Whiſpering, and oft-times Inſtructing him aloud, to deſtroy His Majeſty, to forge a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Plot, and to Fire the City again; to which purpoſe he held an Infernal Torch in his hand. The whole Proceſſion was attended with 150. Flambeaus and Torches by Order; but ſo many more came in Voluntiers as made them up ſome Thouſands.
