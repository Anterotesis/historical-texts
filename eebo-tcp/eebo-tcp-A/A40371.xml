            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Upon this, certain Vagabond Jews, Exorciſts, or Conjurers, who had improv'd themſelves in theſe Arts of Magick and Incantation, whilſt they were at <hi>Epheſus</hi> (as being a City particularly under the Juriſdiction of the Devil) perceiving how that no ſooner St. <hi>Paul</hi> call'd upon the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but the Evil Spirits flew like Lightning from the Bodies of <hi>Demoniacks;</hi> they thought to do the like; and the Experiment being made by no leſs than <hi>ſeaven Sons of one</hi> SCeva <hi>a Jew</hi> (not being willing it ſeems to truſt themſelves ſingly) all Students of the Black Art, in this Form of Words; <hi>We adjure you</hi>

And the man in whom the Evil Spirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed againſt them, ſo that they fled out of that houſe naked and wounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Remarkable an Occurrence as this could not but be ſoon Noiſed abroad in ſo Populous and Inquiſitive a City; and the event was anſwerable; <hi>For, Fear fell on all</hi> dwelling at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> both Jews and Greeks; <hi>and the</hi>

farther token of the reallity of their Converſion, and utter Abhorrence of their former Life; many of them who had practiſed theſe Magick Arts, of their own accord, brought their Books, and burn'd them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which, had they been ſold, would have yeilded no leſs than <hi>Fifty thouſand pieces of Silver. So mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a crafty Tradeſ-man, and Maſter of the Corporation of Silver-Smiths, who made Silver Shrines for <hi>Diana,</hi> or little Temples with her Image in them, and had all this time been a Spy on the Words and Actions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> finding that his Religion and Fortune were both at ſtake, and would certainly be loſt, were not ſome timely ſtop put to his Preaching, and Miracles; he calls together the Workmen of like Occupation, and in a Riotous Aſſembly (for Tradeſ-men are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reformers) he tells them,</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Paul</hi> who had not only at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but<note place="margin">verſe 24. to 27.</note> throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> perverted much People; Broaching a moſt Unreaſonable and Heretical Doctrine; That they be no Gods, which are made with Hands; That the Divinity of the Great Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> had been Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Acknowledg'd by all Mankind, and that her Worſhip had been Eſtabliſh'd upon the Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and Practice of all Nations, <hi>whom</hi> not only <hi>all Aſia, but</hi> the World Worſhip'd. But if what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid was true, both the Temple, and the Goddeſs would ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and her Magnificence deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>This, had he ſaid no more, muſt be acknowledg'd to have been a good ſort of Metaphyſical Argument; but <hi>Demetrius</hi> knowing that Tradeſ-mens heads lie not much that way, was too wiſe to venture the Worſhip of his Goddeſs, and along with it his <hi>All,</hi> upon ſuch a nice Speculation, and therefore to make Sure work of it, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100308:4"/>
firſt prepares the way by a right faithful Argument, which he knew, amongſt ſuch Auditors, would never fail him; <hi>Sirs, Ye know that by this Craft we have our wealth, which now is in danger to be ſet at nought. And when they heard theſe ſayings, they were full of wrath, and cryed out ſaying, Great is Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar continuing, <hi>about two hours,</hi> the Beaſts of <hi>Epheſus</hi> all that time bellowing nothing out, but <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians, Great is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that the Words are a perfect Inference from a heap of Arguments which went before; <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues ſtiffly for his Goddeſs, the People repeat his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and infer the Concluſion. Doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſay <hi>they be no Gods which are made with hands,</hi> and is the Ruine of our Goddeſs involv'd in this ſingle Aſſertion? Has her Divinity been Acknowledg'd and Ador'd by all Nations, and by the Romans themſelves, receiv'd into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Deae Majorum Gentium,</hi> and is our whole Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity ſupported by her, and do we and ſhe fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Why then, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Words thus knit together, we have theſe Three very Obſervables.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is no Evidence of Senſe, Reaſon, or<note place="margin">I.</note> in conſequent thereto, Scripture, ſo plain and undoubted, againſt which Education, and Intereſt are not of force enough to byaſs and carry the Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The exact Harmony, or Agreement betwixt<note place="margin">II.</note> the Religion of the Heathens, and that of the Romiſh Church at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The wonderful Force of a miſguided, or ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded<note place="margin">III.</note> Zeal, which uſually is fiercer, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous than a true one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100308:4"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no Evidence of Senſe, Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the truth of which,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The whole Heathen World is an undeniable Evidence, who before the coming of Our Bleſſed Lord, were ſunk, and degenerated into ſuch groſs ſottiſh Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices relating to God, and Humane Nature, as were altogether inconſiſtent with either, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Impair and Endanger the whole Law of Nature, which as to the Moral World, is no other than a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Opinions and Practices appertaining to God, our ſelves, and one another. But to keep to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance in the Text; what can be more evident to Senſe and Reaſon, than that the Goddeſs the Silver-Smith made, did not make the Silver-Smith? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, and tho' the whole Corporation of Silver-Smiths got their Livelihood by doing Work about her; nay tho' perhaps theſe very individual men had mended, or adorn'd her Goddeſship, when Ruinous or Ruſty; yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be exclaim'd againſt, and brought in danger of his Life, for ſaying, <hi>They are no Gods which are made with Hands.</hi> To this may be added, that inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Practice which did of Old, and doth at this time prevail amongſt ſome Heathen Nations, of Sacrificing the Wife, the deareſt Friends, and moſt faithful Servants, at the Funerals of their ſeveral Relations. And what renders this Practice more wonderful, is, there is nothing of Intereſt in it, beyond the avoiding Shame and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, which by long Uſe and Practice, is clearly of their own making. The like may be ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the Jewiſh Church, which would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the Saviour of the World, but Crucified him as a Malefactor, tho' the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the Old Teſtament foretelling him to come, joyn'd to, and explained by the Hiſtory of Our Lord's

Life and Death, did ſo plainly Deſcribe, and Point out his Perſon, that it was not poſſible any thing to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which acknowledg'd the Divine Original of them, as the Jews did, ſhould be more Evident to Reaſon, or more Convictive of the Judgment. And yet alaſs, all theſe ſignified no more, againſt the Education and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which then prevail'd, by which they were taught to expect a Temporal <hi>Meſſias,</hi> nor againſt the ſenſual Intereſt, and worldly Grandure of that Church, than Bullets ſhot againſt a Marble ſtone.</p>
            <p>Nay, when theſe forcible Weapons were afterwards manag'd by an Omnipotent Arm, and received an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Strength, and a New Edge, by the Acceſſion of the Miracle of the Reſurrection, yet made they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no Impreſſion on the Jewiſh Church, but a very Fatal one upon the Publican, and Fiſhermen, with their Followers, who were the Preachers of that Divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Of all which Our Lord has given a moſt Wiſe profound Reaſon. <hi>How can ye Believe, that receive Honour of Men?</hi> That is, 'tis Morally impoſſible ye ſhould. But beyond theſe, and all other inſtances in the World put together,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> is the fulleſt proof how much it is within the Power of Intereſt and Education, to warp the Judgment againſt the cleareſt Evidence of Senſe, Reaſon, and Scripture. Of a great heap of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to ſingle out but a few.</p>
            <p>What can be more againſt the clear Evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than half Communion? What more againſt Senſe and Reaſon, than that Popes, and Councils, who for theſe many years have been doing little, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting not only one another, but themſelves, ſhould ſet up for Infallibility? Reaſon tells they may be deceiv'd, Senſe and Experience tell that they are ſo, and they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100308:5"/>
have not yet been able to urge the leaſt plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to prove their Exemption from the common calamity of Humane Nature. What more againſt the common Reaſon of Mankind, and the Evidence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than, that ſince Prayer is a lifting up of the Heart to God, giving Thanks for what we have receiv'd, and imploring what we need, men ſhould not be permitted to pray to God in a Tongue they underſtand?</p>
            <p>Or what more againſt the Evidence of Senſe, Reaſon, and Scripture, than the Monſtrous Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation? Which to go about to confute, would be to abuſe the Auditory. A Doctrine, which if any thing in Senſe, Reaſon, or Scripture be true, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe. A Doctrine which as one has moſt inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly obſerv'd, if it be true; 'tis the moſt ill natur'd truth in the World, for 'twill permit nothing elſe to be true beſides it ſelf. A and Laſtly a Doctrine, in favour of which were a Miracle wrought, it could not prove it true, in as much as after ſuch a Miracle wrought, we ſhould have the ſame Reaſon to believe the Doctrine to be falſe, that we had to believe the Miracle was true.</p>
            <p>And yet to the Eternal Diſgrace of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> they have laid the greateſt Wits of <hi>Europe,</hi> both of our Church, and their own, under an abſolute neceſſity of ſpending the Flower of their Years, and the Strength of their Parts, in Reading and Writing great Volumes, for, and againſt this portentous Doctrine; tho' after all their Labours and Study, they can arrive to no more knowledge in the whole matter, than what every Child of Six years of Age has; <hi>viz.</hi> To know that Bread is Bread. Thus much Intereſt, and Education, is able to do againſt the ſtrongeſt, and moſt unconteſted Evidence; of the latter of which I think the World has not a fuller proof than the groſs body of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100308:6"/>
in which we live affords us, who have not the leaſt imaginable ſhadow of Reaſon, why they are rather Papiſts, than Proteſtants, but that 'twas the Religion their Fathers profeſt before them; pleading nothing in their Defence, but this, as 'tis notoriouſly known to all who converſe with them. And now 'twere to be wiſht theſe were all that are concerned in this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Every Sect or Sept, has a ſhare in it more or leſs, as 'twere eaſie to inſtance in the ſeveral Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which of late years have prevail'd amongſt us, well nigh to the utter deſolation of one of the moſt Flouriſhing Kingdoms, and Apoſtolick Churches in the World; whoſe Wounds are yet Green and Gaping; ſo that the Romiſh Church is more Catholick than we Proteſtants think of; extending it ſelf not only to <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Places ſubject to the Papal Power, but to <hi>Geneva</hi> likewiſe, and thoſe who value themſelves moſt for having no Communion with her. I ſay 'twere eaſie to inſtance in the Opinions and Practices, but I forbear; this being a day hallow'd by the Blood of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Innocents to the Romiſh Church, and upon that account, 'tis great pity but it ſhould be all their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The exact Harmony, or Agreement betwixt the Religion of the Heathens, and that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And now we are Engag'd in a Sea of Matter, where Plenty makes it difficult to chooſe, and time will not permit to inſiſt on all that offers. But I diſcourſe before an Auditory that knows how to ſupply Defects, and to go before the Preacher; and truly 'tis well it is ſo, ſince 'tis the great Unhappineſs of Diſcourſes of this kind, that being meaſur'd by a ſhort ſcantling of time, nothing can be handled as it ought to be. And therefore to lay the Proof of this Doctrinal Obſervation in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars only; ſome of which I ſhall mention ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100308:6"/>
than inſiſt on. The exact Harmony and Agreement betwixt both Religions.</p>
            <p>I. As to the ſottiſh Idolatrous Worſhip of both.</p>
            <p>II. As to the Arguments upon the ſtrength of which, both Religions have been received.</p>
            <p>III. As to the ſame Ends, for the Promotion of which, both are continued.</p>
            <p>IV. As to the ſame Methods of Propagation; Artifices of Impoſture to prevail over the Weak and Simple; and Practices of Blood, and Cruelty over the more Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Reſolute.</p>
            <p>In the Aſſigning of which particulars of Agreement, we have not ranſackt the Body of the Heathen, and Romiſh Religion, (which would furniſh us with many more,) but have kept our ſelves ſtrictly to the Letter of the Text; all theſe being formally contain'd in the Words we have read to you, as will even now appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the Sottiſh Idolatry of both, in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images: For what can be more Sottiſh than it? <hi>Since they are but Silver and Gold, and the work of mens</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 135. ver. 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Hands. They have Mouths but they ſpeak not, Eyes have they but ſee not. They have Ears but they hear not, neither is there any Breath in their Mouths. They that make them, are like unto them, ſo is every one that truſteth in them.</hi> And they that make them, and put their truſt in them, are the Heathen, and Romiſh Church.</p>
            <p>The Trade of making Images is not leſs gainful to the Romiſh Church, than 'twas to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his fellow Crafts-men, or rather much more; for amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens one Houſhold God many times ſerv'd a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100308:7"/>
but now each ſingle perſon abounds with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Images, and the Worſhip that is paid to them, by both, is the ſame; nor can any thing be ſaid in the Defence of the one which may not reaſonably be urg'd in the Defence of the other. If St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick, (as they of that Church tell us he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was) and had come to a perſonal Debate with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> touching the Worſhip of Images and departed Souls; with what Fore-head do we think he could have Objected Idolatry to him, and his Companions; or if he had been ſo unreaſonable, do we think <hi>Demetrius</hi> would not have been as ready with his <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> his <hi>Terminatively</hi> and <hi>Tranſitively,</hi> wherewith the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts incruſtate their Idolatry as they themſelves are.</p>
            <p>Where Saints themſelves are not Worſhip'd, there their Images are not; and we have the Confeſſion of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Perron,</hi> that in the earlier Ages of the Church, Saints were not invok'd, for which he gives this Reaſon; for fear the Heathens might Judge the Chriſtians were Guilty of Idolatry: An ingenuous Confeſſion, how like the one is to the other.</p>
            <p>And one would think this Charge againſt them, of Symbolizing with the Heathens in their Image Worſhip, is not very unacceptable to them; for a Jeſuite who has<note place="margin">Corn. a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100308:7"/>Nay, the Jeſuite goes yet a pitch higher, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſtifly with the Heathens for <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelf; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their <hi>Diana</hi> (meaning the Heathen) was Falſe, and Suppoſititious, but the true Chriſtian <hi>Diana,</hi> was the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary, (riſum teneatis)</hi> which he endeavours to prove in Six particulars, three whereof I ſhall lay before you.</p>
            <p>The Heathen <hi>Diana</hi> was the Daughter of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Latona,</hi> but Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> is the Daughter of the Eternal Father, who has brought light to the World, and ſhews the way to Heaven. Again, in the Temple of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Diana,</hi> Kings us'd to lay up their moſt precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which no Enemy when they Sack'd and Plunder'd a City, would be ſo prophane as to touch; but <hi>Mary</hi> is the faithful Preſervatrix of Vertue and Safety, ſo that 'tis impoſſible for him to periſh, who doth but diligently commit himſelf, and his Goods to her Care and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as the common experience of every one ſhews. And laſtly, the Heathen <hi>Diana</hi> had many Breaſts, as being the Nurſe of all living Creatures; but <hi>Mary</hi> is the ſecond <hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of all living, who gives the Milk of Grace and Conſolation, to all that Worſhip her; which things are little leſs than Blaſphemy; but I forbear to inſiſt upon theſe Follies.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Arguments upon the ſtrength of which both Religions have been receiv'd; Univerſality, and Antiquity; Diana <hi>whom all</hi> Aſia, and the World<note place="margin">Ver. 27. 35</note> Worſhippeth, and whoſe <hi>Image fell down from</hi> Jupiter.</p>
            <p>Touching the former of which, Univerſality, as it is obſervable, that were the matter of Fact true, as to both Churches, as 'tis certainly falſe, it would conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for either, ſince Error is many times more ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than Truth; ſo is it likewiſe, that the Heathens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to Univerſality are much better grounded, than the Romaniſts, it being well nigh litterally true what <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Diana, that all</hi> Aſia, <hi>and the World Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd her.</hi> But for the Romiſh Church to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Catholick Church, when there are ſo many Churches beſides themſelves, is juſt ſuch a piece of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, or rather contradiction, as to ſay the half is the whole; an Error which as it is of the greateſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſo has it been particularly deriv'd to them from Tranſubſtantiation, or at leaſt hugely ſtrengthen'd by it, which aſſures us when once the Bread is Conſecrated, every Crum is as large as the whole Loaf, every part being the whole Body of Chriſt, and the whole can be no more; and if this be true, by the ſame reaſoning, why may not a handful of Chriſtians be as numerous, and diffuſive as the whole Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Antiquity of <hi>Diana's</hi> Worſhip, 'tis prov'd by the Town-Clerk by this Argument, that her Image fell down from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> i. e. time out of mind; for we muſt know, that the Scene of all the Actions of the Heathen Gods, and Goddeſſes, were laid at a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, ſo that there was nothing of yeſterday in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100308:8"/>
that Religion; as we ſee moſt of the Miracles of the Romiſh Church as ſuch, are wiſely laid in ſuch Times, and Places, as no one can enquire into them. Now touching theſe Pretences to Antiquity, theſe Four things are obſervable,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> That the Heathen, and Romiſh Church do both pretend to them alike.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> That both their Pretences are Ill Grounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> That the Heathen Church bids fairer for it than the Romiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> That both the one Church, and the other, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unjuſtly Charge their Adverſaries with Novelty; the Heathens the Chriſtians, the Papiſts the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly,</hi> That the very ſame Anſwer which the Primitive Chriſtians return'd to the Heathens, when charg'd with Novelty, I ſay the very ſame Anſwer we Proteſtants return to the Romaniſts now. All which, do beyond meaſure ſhew the exact agreement betwixt the Heathen, and the Romiſh Religion. To inſiſt on the latter only, which vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually comprehends the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Jews and Chriſtians were by the Heathens call'd Up-ſtarts, and Muſhrooms, the growth of a ſingle Night, and in conſequent thereto, 'twas ſaid their Religion was falſe. The Subſtance of the Chriſtians Reply to which heavy Charge was, That thô ſome Errors are ancienter than ſome Truths, yet the firſt Truth, was ancienter than the firſt Error. That God is the Fountain of Truth, and before all Error. That the firſt Religion in the World was that which <hi>Adam</hi> profeſs'd in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Innocence was prior to his fall, upon which, God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Inſtituted the Chriſtian Religion; <hi>The Seed of the</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100308:9"/>
               <hi>Woman ſhall break the Serpent's head;</hi> That the Heathen Religion, whoſe diſtinctive Character was Idolatry, and multiplicity of Gods (neither of which were heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall) grew up by little, and little, after Mankind had departed from God; That thô all men fell, yet ſome part of Mankind did Worſhip God in a purer, and more natural manner than another; That the whole of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Religion was but a Schiſmatical, Heretical Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Wickeder part of Mankind, from the purer and more uncorrupted Religion, which was profeſs'd by God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Seth,</hi> and the Antediluvian Patriarchs which ſprang from his Line; That as <hi>Adams</hi> Religion before the Fall was the firſt pure natural, ſo, the Chriſtian Religion was the firſt Inſtituted Religion in the World, in the deſign of God, as being virtually contain'd in that firſt Propheſy, <hi>The Seed of the, &amp;c.</hi> which is not look'd upon as a different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from <hi>Adam</hi>'s, inaſmuch as Chriſtianity is no other than a Wonderful Wiſe Means, or Diſpenſation of God's Providence, to bring Humane Nature back again from whence it fell.</p>
            <p>And do not we now, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> make the very ſame reply, when we are Recriminated in point of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Romaniſts? <hi>viz.</hi> That the Religion we profeſs is the True Apoſtolick Religion, That we have added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new to it, That they are the Innovators, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only caſt off the Corruptions they ſuper-induc'd; And that the Deſign of the Proteſtant Religion, is but to bring them back from whence they have departed. The Inference from all which is, That the Arguments, as well as Errors of both Churches, being the ſame in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Formation, one and the ſame Anſwer ſerves them both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Agreement is great, and very exact, as to the ſame Ends for the Promotion of which both Religions were contriv'd, and afterwards maintain'd. That is, <hi>Sirs,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100308:9"/>
               <hi>ye know that by this Craft we have our wealth,</hi> which now (by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching) <hi>is in danger to be ſet at naught.</hi> And certainly, if ever there were any exquiſite Silver Smiths, with a Crafty <hi>Demetrius</hi> at the head of them, beſides theſe mention'd in the Text, they are the Pope and Clergy of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> moſt of their Doctrines, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices conſequent thereto, which are truly theirs, having no other tendency than to Enrich, and Aggrandiſe the Prieſt. To Enrich him; of which nature are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purgatory,</hi> that Inexhauſtible Fund of Riches, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies the Daughter of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as Rich as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and their Prayers and Maſſes for the Dead. The Worſhip of Images and Relicts of Saints, with Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges undertaken to their Shrines, Counterfeit Miracles wrought at them, and huge Oblations made to the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar Saints, Works of Supererogation, and Diſpenſations with Vows, Oaths, and Matrimonial Contracts. For all which they have the pretences of Univerſality and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, to blind the Vulgar; thô all Ancient Authors are as profoundly ſilent touching them, as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, which are undoubtedly the moſt Ancient Books in the World; whilſt to the Romiſh Clergy, the true Stream that turns the Mill is, <hi>Sirs ye know that by this Craft we have our wealth.</hi> So that it was not ill ſaid of a certain Pope, That <hi>that Pope was a Fool that was poor, whilſt he could hold a Pen in his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we diſmiſs this Argument, I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you, with what Elaborate Art the reſt of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Doctrines</hi> are contriv'd to ſupport this one of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and render it a Doctrine prodigiouſly Gainful to the Romiſh Church. For by their Doctrine of Attrition, Confeſſion, and Sacerdotal Abſolution; no man can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in his Way to Heaven, that can but ſecure himſelf one ſingle Senſible hour before death. By their diſtinction
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100308:10"/>
of the Temporal puniſhment remaining, after the Eternal is remitted, they ſend the beſt as well as the worſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> all to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> unleſs the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſome few very Eminent Saints, and Martyrs. And by making the Flames of <hi>Purgatory</hi> as intollerable as the Flames of Hell, ſave in Duration, they make that Place too hot for any one to continue in it. So that the ſum of all is this; They Damn none, neither do they Save any immediately (otherwiſe than has been ſaid) but all Mankind paſſing through the Flames of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> pay their Tributes to the Romiſh Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, before they can be deliver'd thence.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Thriving Arts of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but there are other Doctrines, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, tending to Aggrandiſe the Prieſt's perſon, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a neceſſary dependance of the people on him, and ſubjection to him, in all they ſay, know, or do, as gives him a Deſpotick Power over their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is the main point they deſign to gain by moſt, if not all of them; to Inſtance only in a very few.</p>
            <p>The Intention of the Prieſt, as to the validity of the Sacraments, which leaves them wholly at the Prieſt's mercy; locking up the Scriptures from their Laity, by which he Governs them in all they know; Praying in an Unknown Tongue, by which they are not permitted to think what they ſay; and Auricular Confeſſion, by which he becomes Maſter of all they know, think, ſay, or do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They exactly agree as to the Methods by which both have been propagated; Artifices of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to prevail over the weak, and ſimple; Blood and Cruelty, over the more underſtanding and reſolute.</p>
            <p>Artifices of Impoſture. The only one mention'd in this Chapter, is, That this Image of <hi>Diana, fell down from</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100308:10"/>
               <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which was a Grand Impoſture, this Image ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving<note place="margin">Suidas in Voce.</note> been made, as other Images were, but being very old, or the Artificers that wrought it, to prevent diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, being made out of the way, (as at ſome times<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> they were,) the Prieſts perſwaded the credulous Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that the Image fell down from Heaven.</p>
            <p>And this was a frequent Practice, not only amongſt the Greeks, thoſe Architects of Fraud, but the Trojans, and Romans likewiſe. Thus the <hi>Palladium,</hi> or Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> was Kept and Worſhip'd with great Veneration, firſt by the Trojans, afterward by the Romans, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to have fall'n down from Heaven, and by them kept in the Temple of <hi>Veſta;</hi> where, if we have a Faith ſtrong enough to believe them, the Woodden Goddeſs frequently ſhook her Spear, and roul'd her Eyes in her Head; which the Romaniſts have much out-done; the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> not only moving her Eyes, but Weeping likewiſe upon Solemn Occaſions. And thus the Roman <hi>Ancile</hi> or Buckler, is reported to have fall'n from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with a <hi>Voice,</hi> that <hi>whilſt it was preſerv'd the City of Rome ſhould Flouriſh;</hi> which was therefore kept by the Prieſts with great Religion. But to give one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for all, <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the Roman Lawgiver, as to what appertain'd to the Worſhip of their Gods, and Goddeſſes, to gain the more credit to his Law, gave it confidently out, that he had receiv'd it from the Goddeſs <hi>Aegeria,</hi> in perſonal Converſation he had with her.</p>
            <p>And now, who can forbear obſerving that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts have with great exactneſs written after this Copy? Many of whoſe Superſtitious Doctrines, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Purgatory</hi> (which is taken out of <hi>Plato</hi>) have been obtruded upon the people, from Voices, and Viſions of Saints, and Angels in Heaven, of tormented Souls from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> Conferences with the Bleſſed Virgin, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100308:11"/>
wrought by her; ſo like Chriſtian is to Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> that 'tis difficult ſometimes to diſtinguiſh one, from the other.</p>
            <p>The agreement which hitherto has been manifeſted, has been made only at the coſt of Mens Souls, and thoſe, of their own Communion; but not content with this, and ſince God in his Wonderful, and never often enough to be remembred Mercy to theſe Kingdoms, Infinitely exceeding the Mercies of this Day, has hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them from deſtroying our Souls, they have been reſolutely bent to deſtroy our Bodies, which brings us to the laſt Branch of this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their agreement as to the Practices of Blood and Cruelty. A ſingle Inſtance of which as to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, we have in this Chapter (and many in after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it) the <hi>Epheſians</hi> having decreed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be thrown to Wild Beaſts to be devour'd by them, as is more than probable, nay, well nigh evident from ſome places of Scripture compar'd together, had we but time to inſiſt on them. And to this it is he relates, when he tells us, he <hi>fought with Beaſts at Epheſus; i. e.</hi> was condemn'd to it, and had certainly done it, had not God wonderfully deliver'd him.</p>
            <p>And this their Barbarous uſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who came in the Endearments of Love to ſhew them the way to Life, and Immortality, gives an occaſion a while to Reflect on, and compare the Cruelties of the Romiſh Church with theirs, which they have been pleas'd to exerciſe us with, for no other Crime ſave that the ſame Doctrine which he publiſh'd to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> we preach amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Which whilſt we do, Good God what Numbers, (Numbers which well nigh ſurpaſs every thing but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100308:11"/>
Thought and Figures) do we ſee of Souls <hi>under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> that were ſlain <hi>for the Word of God, and for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which they held, Crying aloud, how long O Lord holy and true, doſt thou not judge, and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth!</hi> Blood ſpilt by Inquiſitions, Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes, Burnings, and Maſſacres! Amongſt which the Maſſacres of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the horrid <hi>Gun-powder Treaſon,</hi> as black and helliſh in the Contrivance, and deſign'd to be as bloody in the Execution as the reſt, are yet reeking and freſh in our Memories.</p>
            <p>So that if in other things, there has been ſound ſuch an exact Harmony betwixt the Heathen, and the Romiſh Church, that they may in ſome ſenſe rather be ſaid to be the ſame, than to agree; in this of Blood and Cruelty, it is to be fear'd the Romiſh Church will be found to have much ſurpaſt it. In proof of which, if all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and Records of Time were Cancel'd, all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Papal Cruelty defac'd, ſave the Memory of this day, this ſingle day were ſufficient to convince all Mankind, that have not abjur'd their Senſe, and Reaſon, how much the One has out-done the Other.</p>
            <p>A Day, the ſorrowful Relation of which, may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by ſeveral here whoſe Eyes are now intent upon me, in the ſame Doleful Strains, wherewith <hi>Aeneas</hi> is ſaid to preface the ſad Story of his <hi>Ruin'd Country.</hi>

            <p>A Day which ſhall appear in Bloody, and Frightful Characters in all Calendars of Time, a Day which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the World has yet ſeen, can equal, nothing that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100308:12"/>
is yet in the Womb of Time, we hope, ſhall go beyond, a Day which ſhall give Reputation to Jews, Heathens, and Turks, and the Religion they profeſs; but fix a laſting Reproach upon the Son of God, the Meek, and the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and his Peaceful Doctrine, amongſt them who judge of Chriſtian Principles, by Roman Practices; and laſtly, a Day which all Good Men of that Communion ſhall ſilently in ſecret lament for ever, all Bad Men deny it, whilſt they only who have quite degenerated into Wolves, and Tygers, ſhall glory and triumph in it.</p>
            <p>This is the Cruelty, which nothing that we know of either in Jewiſh, or Heathen Story (abating the Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Bleſſed Lord, with which 'twere impious to compare any thing, as being beyond compare) has yet equal'd; but that which ſeems to bid faireſt for it, is, the Murder of the Innocents by Bloody <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Ten Bloody Perſecutions by the Roman Emperors. But how far both theſe have fall'n ſhort of this Day, as to the Aggravating Circumſtances of each, will appear.</p>
            <p>In that <hi>Herod</hi>'s Cruelty extended it ſelf (as 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Deſign of that Maſſacre) to Males only, and thoſe but of Two Years of Age, or under, and within the Confines only of a little Village, and the Territories. of it, which could not but exceedingly leſſen the Numbers, and abate the Horror of the Fact, whilſt the Cruelty of this Day was confin'd within no bounds, but ravaging over a whole Spacious Kingdom, ſpar'd neither Age, nor Sex; againſt which neither Piety, Innocence of Infants to invite Compaſſion, nor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of Age to beg it, no nor the Strength of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Men, gave the leaſt Security, as being unarm'd, and aſleep, but all were alike involv'd in the ſame miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100308:12"/>Again, that which muſt be acknowledg'd to turn the Scale exceedingly in favour of <hi>Herod,</hi> was, that what he did was purely upon principles of State, to ſecure the Crown to himſelf, and the Succeſſion of it to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. And truly no wonder ſuch a petty precarious Prince as <hi>Herod,</hi> was jealous of his Crown, ſince the great Lords of the Univerſe, the Roman Emperors, were not free from Jealouſie, that they who ſhould Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World, were to come out of <hi>Judea,</hi> of which they had been admoniſh't by a Prophetick Oracle, <hi>Ex Judea profecti rerum potirentur,</hi> Recorded by <hi>Tacitus, Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and other Heathen Authors, which became matter to them of great Apprehenſion. Whilſt we were Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd purely to ſhew us the way to Heaven, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; tho' he himſelf dy'd to ſave the Blood of this day from being ſpilt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to plant the Doctrine of Peace and Charity, but the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> have Defeated his Paſſion of that end.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Heathen Cruelties, the greateſt were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by Chriſtians, in Ten Bloody Proſecutions, under the Roman Emperors, and are handed down to us in the Martyrologies of the Church; but even theſe as to many circumſtances of aggravation, fell ſhort of what this miſerable Nation ſuffer'd.</p>
            <p>For what the Primitive Chriſtians ſuffer'd, was by force of an Eſtabliſht Law of the Empire, which tho' unjuſt, yet they had a fair Tryal, and many times great and effectual Arts were us'd not only to ſave them upon their Tryals, but to hinder them likewiſe from being Try'd; as may appear by <hi>Trajans</hi> Reſcript to <hi>Pliny,</hi> in favour of them. But we ſuffer'd not only without, but againſt the force of all the Muncipal Laws of the Land, which were in favour of us, and not only againſt them, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of Friendſhip, of Mutual Obligations, and Hoſpitality, which us'd to be ſo Sacred in this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100308:13"/>The Primitive Chriſtians had time given them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for Death; had their Friends about them to miniſter Comfort to them, were Executed in the Face of the Sun, were permitted to call upon their God, and allow'd a decent Burial; whilſt we fell Sacrifices to the inſatiable rage of our profeſt Friends, in the dead ſilence of Night, had not time to prepare for Death, nor to cry to God for mercy, but were hurried before the Tribunal of another World, before we well knew we were leaving this, and our mangl'd Carcaſſes expoſs'd to the Birds of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Field.</p>
            <p>To conclude, what the Primitive Chriſtians ſuffer'd, was from the profeſt Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, not inlighten'd by the Goſpel, but under ſtrong, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate prejudices againſt it; whilſt our Blood was ſpilt by Chriſtian Hands, and Offer'd up upon Chriſtian Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; and what carries the aggravation yet higher, that very Order of men, which beyond all other Chriſtians, profeſs themſelves to be of the Society of Jeſus, were the contrivers of all theſe miſchieſs; they Decreed us to Death, nay, were the Superviſors in many places, to put the Sentence in Execution.</p>
            <p>To add the laſt finiſhing and maſter ſtroke to all which, all theſe Barbarities are laid upon the moſt Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, the Meekeſt, the Mildeſt, and beſt of Princes; a Prince who (abating the inſeparable Infirmities of mankind) had no Crime beyond good Nature and Modeſt; a man who by Nature was ſo inclin'd to Forgive, and by his Enemies ſo us'd to it, that he had quite forgotten that Reſentment, which is ſo inſeparable from other Princes, and ſo neceſſary in all; one who was ever jealous of his own abilities, tho' wonderfully great; had no defect in Wiſdom, but that he was willing to Learn, where he was able to Dictate. It is of this Prince, they ſay (tho'
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100308:13"/>
with a far different intention from that of <hi>Pilate's</hi>)<note place="margin">John 19. ver. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> that they might at once Murder his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and his Perſon. But it is the peculiar of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, to attempt nothing but what is Great and Monſtrous in its kind, horrid and affrightful, againſt Senſe, againſt Reaſon, againſt Experience, and againſt Humanity.</p>
            <p>But the higheſt Aggravation remains yet untouch'd; the Romiſh Church is not yet glutted, no not ſo much as ſatiated with Blood; but like the Grave and Barren Womb (thoſe only Hieroglyphicks of it) cry Give, Give. The Babyloniſh Furnaces do yet rage, and we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect they will be permitted to go out, whilſt the Hoſt, the golden Image of the Pope, is every where Erected, and there be any Children of the Captivity found who refuſe to bow down to it. And of ſuch, we hope (if ever a ſad occaſion ſhall be offer'd) there will always be great numbers amongſt us, who for <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and <hi>the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience,</hi> will not only patiently, but chearſullay ſuffer, whatever the rage and fury of our Enemies, ſhall think fit to expoſe us to, or lay us under.</p>
            <p>And now we proceed to the Third and Laſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The wonderful force of a miſguided, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Zeal, which uſually is fiercer, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous than a true one: Of which much need not be ſaid (were there time for it) ſince what has been already offer'd, is a full proof of it; and of which we have two more very plain ones in this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, compar'd with himſelf afterwards; and the Behaviour of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> with that of the Town-Clerk's. Of St. <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, we have this, and a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100308:14"/>
much larger account of the ſame Nature: That he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtian men and women to Priſon, breathing out threatnings, and ſlaughter againſt them, conſenting to their Death, and ſometimes aſſiſting at it. None of which we hear of him after his Converſion, when he had a better Cauſe and a well grounded Zeal; and I Judge no one will ſay St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a leſs zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, than he had been a Jew. He with the reſt of the Apoſtles could peaceably lay down their Lives in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and Proof of what they ſaid; but they knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of taking away the Lives of other men, becauſe they would not believe them. They told their Hearers, that Chriſt was a Heavenly-born Perſon, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to convince them by Reaſon, Scripture, (where it was proper,) and Miracles that they ſpake truth; but we never find them ſharpning their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor driving them in with Fire and Sword; no nor ſo much as crying out for two hours; <hi>Great is Jeſus of Nazareth, great is Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame difference is moſt Remarkable in <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s, and the Town-Clerk's conduct of themſelves; the former of whom, had all the marks of an intemperate, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Zeal; a ſalſe Worſhip to advance, and a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous one to oppoſe, an evil intention to promote gain, and an unlawful means, a riotous Aſſembly; and the want of a lawful call, neither the Law of the Empire, nor of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (nor as I believe of any well Govern'd Common-wealth under Heaven) permitting Mechanicks to Aſſemble the Emperors Subjects at pleaſure, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue to them about Religion.</p>
            <p>Whilſt on the other hand the Recorder, an honeſt judicious perſon, and a moſt Excellent Orator, who was more zealous for his Religion, and argued better for it than <hi>Demetrius</hi> had done, kept himſelf with in the bounds of his lawful calling, was a Friend to St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100308:14"/>
ſav'd his Companions from being torn in pieces, and by a pithy conciſe, and moſt ſwaſive Speech (than which I think there is not a better any where extant) appeaſing the multitude, did more real Service to the Empire, than all the Mechanicks of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Silver-ſmiths and others put together; Evil being the reſult of weak minds, but Good the effect of ſtrength.</p>
            <p>And now my Chriſtian Brethren (to draw near a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod) what can better become us as Diſciples of the Holy<note place="margin">Mat. 5. ver. 44.</note> Jeſus, <hi>Who when he was reviled, reviled not again, who has taught us by precept, and example to bleſs them that curſe us, and to love them that hate us, to do good to them who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us, and deſpightfully uſe us;</hi> or as grateful Votaries to God, for the great Deliverance of this day; what can better become us as Loyal Subjects to a tender, and moſt magnanimous Prince, who has ſo generouſly expos'd his Perſon, to Reſeue us from the Cruelty we lately ſuffer'd, or as grave Senators Aſſembled to conſult the publick ſafety of the Nation, than by all means imaginable (except Perſecution) to endeavour the Converſion of this miſerable Nation? A Nation which after the endeavours of above Fourteen hundred years Preahing to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Five hundred years to reduce them to Civility, and upwards of a Century of years, to bring them back to pure Chriſtianity from whence they had departed, are at this day well nigh as Heatheniſh, as Barbarous, and as Popiſh as ever.</p>
            <p>And this, with what is gone before, I thought ſitter to lay before you, than a tedious Hiſtory of the wonderful Diſcovery, the ſuddain breaking forth, and particular Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of this Horrid Rebellion with the evident proofs of the whole; which in effect would be no more than to tell you the Sun ſhines; I could acquaint you with nothing, which you know not as well, moſt of you, much better than my ſelf; the Cruelties of this day are recent in your Memories, your Wounds freſh, and bleeding, and all proofs of theſe matters as to Proteſtants are needleſs, and to Papiſts who deny them, none are ſufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100308:15"/>Since therefore the profound Wiſdom of his Majeſty, in Conjunction with that of both Houſes, has already made ſuch large, and noble ſteps, towards that Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious End, the Converſion of this poor Nation: Give me leave therefore, Moſt Noble Lords, to follow tho' with trembling ſteps, the great and good Example you have ſet me, and in all Humility to lay before you ſome few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients tending thereto; not to make you wiſer, but to Re-mind you of your own Power, and Intellectual abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for ſo great an undertaking. Amongſt which 'tis hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer'd to be determin'd by your Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether to Increaſe the number of the Proteſtant Clergy, and to Decreaſe the Popiſh, or at leaſt to prevent a ſuperfetation of them for the time to come, may not mainly conduce to this end. This in a great meaſure has receiv'd the Sanction of your Wiſdom already, in Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Regular Clergy from this Kingdom, and it muſt be left to you to follow the Blow, and to finiſh what you have begun. For otherwiſe, ſince the Regular Clergy have ever been hated by the Secular, it is to be fear'd, that the abſence of the former, will invite the latter, who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether of ſo Male an Influence as the other, they will ſupply the Defect, by doubling their numbers; and ſo the Superfetation will be more dangerous, than the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Birth. The Clergy are Mortal, but become Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by Succeſſion; and if no care be taken as they dye, to ſupply their places, by perſons approv'd on by the State, nor to limit their numbers, but both theſe main points, be left to be determin'd at their Election; they may if they pleaſe become Infinite, as well as Mortal, and as miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous as they will.</p>
            <p>The Romiſh Clergy, what by reaſon of the active Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of their Principles to do miſchief, and their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, have acquir'd in moſt Countries a ſort of Artificial U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biquity; and ſince our Religion will not permit our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to equal them in their Principles to do hurt, we ought to be much ſuperior to them, in our Numbers to do good.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be ſaid, this were to hinder them from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100308:15"/>
the Spiritual neceſſities of their Church; ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the little, or no pains they take with their people, half the Romiſh Clergy of this Kingdom, is ſufficient to perform the Cure of it. So that by decreaſing their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, we hinder them not from performing their Cures, but only from doing miſchief, which certainly ought to be no part of their Spiritual Cure.</p>
            <p>That is, when any deſperate deſign has been a brooding, we hinder them from hatching it; when any ſecret Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion has been contriv'd, we hinder them from ſetting fire to every corner of the Kingdom at once. In which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices how Succeſsful they have been of late, how little the Authority of an Unfortunate Prince did ſignifie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them, in ſuch matters as he was willing, and it was their Intereſt they ſhould be reſtrain'd; what Diſpotick Power they had over their People, what Incendiaries they were not only in their Oratories, or place of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not only in great Towns, ſmaller Villages, and private Houſes, but in the Camp, at the head of Armed men, and in a word how the whole affair was contriv'd, manag'd, and in a manner Executed by their Heads and Hands, our own late bleeding Experience, to well nigh the utter Ruine of this Nation, has inform'd us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To reduce from time, to time, as much as may be, the Iriſh Nation into Towns and Villages. If this point be not ſecur'd, 'tis to be fear'd all other means whatever, will tend but little, and opperate very ſlowly towards their Reformation. 'Tis manifeſt to a conſidering perſon, that moſt of their Barbarous Uſages and Cuſtoms, their Depredations and Outrages, their profound Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, groſs Superſtition, and foul Idolatry, are all owing if not as to their Original, yet as to their long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance amongſt them, to their wild ſavage way of Living in ſingle Cottages, and diſmal Unhabitable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at great diſtances one from another.</p>
            <p>And no wonder it is ſo, ſince this is an unnatural State, Nature inviting to Conjugation, and Society: And what can be expected from a Nation who have ſpent ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100308:16"/>
many Ages in an Unnatural State, but that they ſhould be guilty of Unnatural Crimes.</p>
            <p>And this, in a great meaſure, may be brought about, by Encouraging Agriculture, and Diſcouraging every thing, that diſcourages it. Of what infinite Advantage to the State in point of Riches, and Civil Emolument this would be, how much it would tend to the Improvement of a Country, at this day as little Improv'd, and as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, as moſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſhall be ſilent; not deſiring to thruſt my Sickle into another Man's Harveſt, but to keep my ſelf within the bounds of Converſion and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To Erect Schools, and to Oblige the Natives thus reduc'd into Colonies, under heavy Mulcts to ſend their Children to learn to Read, and be otherways Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them, at the Publick Charge where it is neceſſary. I ſay thus Reduc'd, for otherwiſe the greateſt Care in Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Schools, and filling them with Able Induſtrious Maſters, will avail little; inaſmuch as without this, the Natives can neither be Inſtructed if they would, neither would they if they could. For what do the Labours of the moſt Induſtrious, Conſcientious Miniſter, or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter ſignify towards the Converſion of the Natives, if his Pariſhioners live ſeveral miles from the Church, or ſeveral miles from one another: Or if being reduc'd into Colonies, he have all or moſt of his people together in a heap, they be not compell'd by ſeverity of Law, to ſend their Children to be Inſtructed by him.</p>
            <p>There was a Deſign ſet on foot many Years agoe, and lately renew'd, by perſons Eminent to the higheſt degree for Piety and Learning, now with God, of Inſtructing the Iriſh Nation by Preaching to them in their own Tongue, and the Deſign was ſo far advanc'd, as to cauſe the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the Common-Prayer Book to be Tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But certainly this Expedient is as little fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Converſion of the Iriſh, as the Piety of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is highly laudable; for it will not only not anſwer the end, but, as it is to be fear'd, produce an effect quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100308:16"/>
to it, and be a means of continuing them in their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> To furniſh the Nation with Iriſh Teſtaments, as in ſome meaſure it has lately been, will not anſwer the end, becauſe there are not perhaps five hundred perſons in the whole Kingdom who can read, and write the Iriſh Tongue, nor is it fit they ſhould be taught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> If they could, their Religion will not permit them to read the Bible, and the ſame Authority which hinders them now from reading it in the Engliſh Tongue they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, will certainly hinder them from reading it in the Iriſh.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>2dly,</hi> It is to be fear'd it will produce the quite contrary effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For ſuppoſing in favour of this Pious Deſign, that the Natives were willing to learn to read the Iriſh Tongue, and that their Spiritual Guides would permit them to read the Scriptures in it, both which are very unreaſonable; this would cauſe a Corrupt Tranſlation of the Scripture to be made in it, which would be of more evil conſequence, than if they had none.</p>
            <p>And this I think cannot be queſtioned by any who know any thing of the Corrupt Principles, and Practices of the Romiſh Church, in relation to Tranſlations of the Bible. A moſt notorious Inſtance of which, we have lately had from this very Pulpit, when the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Deſolation (I mean the Worſhip of the Hoſt) was ſeen ſtanding in this very place, where a Romiſh Prieſt in the preſence of the late King before whom he Preach'd, and to whom he was Confeſſor, and of a numerous Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Great Perſons, taking for his Text theſe Words; <hi>But now God commands all men every where to repent, becauſe he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World,</hi> had the Confidence to read them <hi>thus,</hi> and likewiſe to Print them <hi>ſo,</hi> before his Sermon; <q>But now God commands all men every where to repent, and to do penance, becauſe he hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>  And this to no other end, than to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Doctrine of Sacramental Penance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100308:17"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such a Tranſlation by encouraging two Tongues in the ſame Kingdom, will retard the Converſion of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. It is readily granted that to unite us in Religion, is a good Expedient to unite us in Speech; but then this muſt be done by uniting them to us, not us to them; by ſetting up one Tongue, not encouraging two. And this is the method our wiſe Law-givers have govern'd themſelves by, in endeavouring to make the Natives in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our Cuſtoms and Uſages, and forſake their own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To prohibit the Importation of ſuch Books, as do manifeſtly tend to nothing but Superſtition, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Of ſuch, to mention but one, <hi>The Lives of Saints,</hi> a Book which is the very Goſpel of the Iriſh Nation, and Calculated for the Meridian of their Superſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; a Book which is of far greater Authority amongſt them than the Bible, which in compariſon to it, is but as a Legend with them, and upon theſe accounts may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be preſum'd, to have done more miſchief, than any other Book whatever, unleſs that of the Maſs.</p>
            <p>This is the Nobleſt end we can propoſe to our ſelves, the moſt acceptable to God, to our ſelves the moſt advantageous; which if by your Zeal for God's Glory, and Wiſdom in compaſſing things Great, and Difficult, we ſhall obtain, we ſhall make our ſelves, and our Enemies happy; but if we heartily endeavour it only, God will bleſs us, and we ſhall Intitle our ſelves to the Divine Protection; and when ever theſe Bloody Spirits ſhall be again Conjur'd up, and let looſe upon us, as (unleſs by Gods Bleſſing upon your Pious Endeavours, the Nation be Converted to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Faith) we muſt expect, then every day ſhall be to them as this Day, or worſe; for thô ye <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves O ye people, ye ſhall be broken in pieces; give ear all ye of far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: Gird your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces: Gird</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. v. 9. 10.</note> 
               <hi>your ſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces: Take counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and it ſhall come to naught; ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand. For God is with us.</hi>
