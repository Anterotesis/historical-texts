            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny great men and potentates
of the worlde, when thei haue
by their vnlauful and vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous
attemtes, brought themsel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues
into extreme miseries, haue at laste
much blamed their vnfortunable estate,
for that they in due time lacked coun<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>el
to haue withdrawen them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises.
So it is saide in the common
Prouerbe. That the riche and mightye
haue seldome good councell, excepte
they get it of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. For riches and
hye dignitie causeth them to be more in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solent, so that they can abide any thing
better, then to be tolde of theyr faultes,
and the rewarde of hym that shoulde
franckely tell them the truth: may soner
be a brokehead then otherwyse. Thys
prudent men perceyuing, rather wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
them selues from them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
wearying them selues in vayne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> procure
to them selues displeasure. And flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
seyng a redy pray at theyr handes,
dayly folowe vpon them, wyth vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
theyr dedes and woordes good or
bad Al is excellently deuised, prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

Thus wyth their owne pride climbyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and with flattery pricked forward, thei
runne headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in their imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, til
they tomble downe into the pyt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And then thei lay the blame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:3002:2"/>
them selues to other. wher indede they
wold neuer heare other, but snch as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
yea rather deceyued theyr affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wyth flatteries. But agaynst sutche
headstro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hastynes we are admonished
by the holy Gost saying: Be not wise in
thine owne conceit. Fear God, &amp; depart
from euil. Thys we wysh that al menne
wold well consider in their enterprises.
First that ther is a God, not a blynd and
deafe god, as the godles Heithen pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Iupiter at Create, but an euerliuyng
God that seeth all the wayes of Adams
children, that knoweth the oppress our

all thynges into iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
and wyl render to euerye one his iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
vpon hys head. Hym oughte
men to fear. For whatsoeuer thei atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
yet at last, that he determineth must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e
to passe, and his wyl in all thynges shall
be accomplished. This I pray you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
now in dew time, least if you now
forget it, it may hereafter chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to you
as it hathe done to other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in theyr
wealth lyttle studyed on these matters.
God hath maruelously saued you from
the handes of sutche as hated you, and
set you in hye dignitie, more then euer
you had in your lyfe. And doutles it is to
do good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not euill, to correct and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
thinges amisse, not to destroy and
<pb facs="tcp:3002:3"/>
breake downe thynges that are in good
case and order. Your procedinges begin
strangelye, in that you at the fyrst go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to deface the holy woord of God,
to set asyde Christes institution, and to
cal al this realme to blindenesse and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
For if you take away the lyghte of
Gods woord from the worlde: what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
men loke for at your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, but destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

we knowe that you haue in tymes past
nothing fauored the Scriptures to be in
English, but haue euer winsed and kyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
against them, but our hope was that
once you wold ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, considering how
Gods goodnes called you to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance.
You were wont to alledge you dyd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng

you obtested by God, that when menne
were burned for the truthes sake, you
nothyng procured to it, but dyd all that
you might to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trari. we wer glad to
read this in your writi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, but we besech
you let the same nowe appeare in your
dedes, so shal we the better beleue your
writinges. But if now you rayse a newe

it shal be manifest to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ye were

feare of his iudgement, cal these things
to your minde, and somewhat mitigate
these hasty and rashe doinges, whiche
are against god &amp; his word.<note place="margin">Eccl. xv. psalm. v.</note> For though
the lord hath called you to be a scourge

you to do nothing vnrighteouselye, for
he is a god that willeth none vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousenes:

dwell with him, sutch as be cruell, may
not stand in his sight. He is enemy vnto
al wicked doers. he destroieth the lyars
and abhorieth the bloode thirstye and

to scourge others: so if you vexe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,

downe, and rayse vppe them that shall
scourge you againe, and fulfill Christes
worde:<note place="margin">Mat. vii. Luk. vi.</note> with what measure ye meate to

withdrawe his hande from you) be the
first that shal reioyse at your fall. God
wil withdraw his hand from you, if you
repugne against his word, if you seeke
to deface his truth, to cast aside Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
supper, to condempne mariage, to
set vp againe idolatrie, superstition and
errour, to bring in againe that sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

done with princes and potentates, that

els to abuse it to their owne priuate lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
seing you haue not onely read, but
sene before your eyes. Onelye we praye
god you may remember what was said
to S. Paule. Saule Saule why persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
thou me? He saide: Lorde who art
thou? The lord saide: I am Iesus whom
thou persecutest,<note place="margin">Act. ix.</note> it shal be hard for the
to kicke against the pricke. It is the lord
Iesus that in his members suffereth, it
is his worde that is hated and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it is he that mercifullye calleth you
to repentaunce, and he is able inoughe
to represse all violence done agaynste

him, but as he came from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to saue

But when al thinges shal declar you
impenitent, &amp; manifest rebellour against
