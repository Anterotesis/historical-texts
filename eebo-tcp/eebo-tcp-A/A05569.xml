            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>A long time ≈øince, there was in <hi>China</hi> a great &amp; mightie familie, which together with all their friends and acquaintance ≈øecretly con≈øpired and agr√©ed to ry≈øe vp again≈øt the King of <hi>China,</hi> to driue him out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and to kill him, and hauing ≈øo done, to place them≈øelues therein: but it could not ≈øo ≈øecretly be contriued and wrought, but in the end it was knowne: whereupon the king pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed them mo≈øt gr√©euou≈øly, and cau≈øed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the principall con≈øpirators to be put to death, and all others he found to be con≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therunto ≈øhould haue felt the like paine, which gr√©eued the Coun≈øell and other Noble men of the countrie, for that diuers of their n√©ere≈øt kin≈ømen were of that con≈øpiracie, ≈øo that with humble and long petition to the King, they be≈øought him to let them liue, and to puni≈øh them with ≈øome ea≈øier puni≈øhment then death: but that which they ≈øought &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired at the king, all things con≈øidered, was little better then death, which was that he would bani≈øh them and all their po≈øteritie for euer out of the countrie, into the Ilands of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi> which as then were not inhabited, and this as they de≈øired was done: whereby there is ≈øo great enuie and hatred betw√©ene them and the men of <hi>China,</hi> that they hate each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the death, and doe all the mi≈øchief one vnto the other that they can imagine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øe, euen vntill this time.

our clokes when we meane to goe abroad into the towne or countrie, they put them off when they goe forth, putting on great wyde br√©eches, and coming home they put them off again, and ca≈øt their clokes vpon their ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: and as among other nations it is a good ≈øight to ≈øee men with white and yealow hayre and white teeth, with them it is e≈øt√©emed the filthie≈øt thing in the world, and ≈ø√©eke by all meanes they may to make their hayre and t√©eth blacke, for that the white cau≈øeth their grief, and the blacke maketh them glad.

The ryuer runneth euen vnto the Towne, and is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent broade, there are betw√©ene the firme land and the Iland, certaine ≈ømall Ilandes that are all inhabited by the naturall borne countrimen, and on the other ≈øide of the town the ryuer is there ≈øo ≈ømall, that in Summer time, by wading to the kn√©es in water, a man may pa≈ø≈øe it ouer on foote.

There are in <hi>India</hi> many Battes, and ≈øome of them ≈øo great, that it is incredible to tell. They doe great mi≈øchiefe to tr√©es, fruites and hearbes, whereby the <hi>Canariins</hi> are con≈øtrained to ≈øet men to watch in their tr√©es, and yet they can hardly ridde them away. The Indians eate them, and ≈øay they are as good meat as a Partridge. There is a mo≈øt wonderfull number of black Crows, which do much hurt, and are ≈øo bold, that oftentimes they come flying in at their windowes, and take the meat out of the di≈øh, as it ≈øtandeth vpon the table, before them that are ≈øet downe to eate: and as I my ≈øelfe ≈øate writing aboue in a chamber of the hou≈øe, the windowes being open, one of tho≈øe Crowes flew in at the window, and picked the cotton one of mine Inke horne, and blotted all the paper that lay on my table, do what I could to let him. They ≈øitte commonly vppon the Buffles backes, and pecke off their haire, ≈øo that you ≈øhal find very few Buffles that haue any haire vpon their backes, and therefore to auoide the Crowes they get them≈øelues into mari≈øhes, and watrie places, where they ≈øtand in the water vppe to the neckes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe they could neuer be rid of them. There are likewi≈øe great numbers of Rattes, and ≈øome as bigge as young Pigges, ≈øo that the Cattes dare not touch them. Sometimes they digge downe the hou≈øes, for that they vndermine the walles &amp; foundations through and through, wherby many times the hou≈øes fall downe and are ≈øpoyled. There is another ≈øort of Rattes, that are little and reddi≈øh of haire: They are called ≈øweet ≈ømelling Rattes, for they haue a ≈ømell as if they were full of Mu≈øke.

In the tr√©e there is no wood, but it may rather be called a r√©ed then a tr√©e. The bodie of the tr√©e (I meane that which couereth the outwardpart when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth ≈øomewhat to grow) is in a manner verie like the inner part of a ≈øyue made of hayre, but in ≈øhew ≈øomewhat thicker, and is (as it were) the barke of it: but when you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, it is ful of leaues, clo≈øed and rouled vp together, of the hight of half a mans length, and ≈øomewhat higher.

It is in compa≈ø≈øe ≈øixe miles, little more or le≈ø≈øe, and lyeth vnder ≈øixt√©ene degr√©es and a quarter, on the South ≈øide of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctall <hi>550.</hi> Spani≈øh miles from the Cape <hi>de Bona Speranza,</hi> and from the coa≈øt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Angola</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia 350.</hi> miles, &amp; from <hi>Bra≈øilia 510.</hi> miles. The≈øe are the two n√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt lands adioyning to it. It is a verie high and hillie countrie, ≈øo that it commonly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto the cloudes: the countrie of it ≈øelfe is verie a≈øhie and drie: al≈øo all the trees that are therein, whereof there are great ≈øtore, &amp; grow of them≈øelues in the woodes, are little worth but only to burne: for it hath no ≈øpecial ≈øub≈øtance, but ≈øheweth as if it were halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed, ≈øo that it ≈øhould ≈øeeme that ≈øome mines of Brim≈øtone, hath in times pa≈øt b√©ene in that Iland, as commonly all the Ilands are all much ≈øubiect to the ≈øame: for that in ≈øome places thereof they find Sulphur and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone. When the Portingales fir≈øt di≈øcouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, there was not any bea≈øts, nor fruite, at all within the Iland, but onely great ≈øtore of fre≈øh water, which is excellent good, and falleth downe from the mountaines, and ≈øo runneth in great abundance into the Valley, where the Church ≈øtandeth, and from thence by ≈ømall chanels into the Sea, where the Portingales fill their ve≈ø≈øels full of fre≈øh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and wa≈øh their clothes: ≈øo that it is a great benefit for them, and a plea≈øant ≈øight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how cleare &amp; in how many ≈øtreames the water runneth downe into the valley, which may bee thought a myracle, con≈øidering the drine≈ø≈øe of the country, together with the ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Rockes and hilles therein. The Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales haue by little and little brought many bea≈øtes into it, and in the valleyes planted al ≈øorts of fruites: which haue growne there in ≈øo great abundance, that it is almo≈øt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For it is ≈øo full of Goates, Buckes, wild Hogges, Hennes, Partridges, and Doues, by thou≈øands, ≈øo that any man that will, may hunt and take them: &amp; ther is alwaies plentie and ≈øufficient, although there came as many ≈øhippes more into the Iland as there doe: and they may kill them with ≈øtones and ≈øtaues by rea≈øon of the gret numbers of them. Now for fruites, as Portingall Figges, Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and ≈øuch like fruites, there are ≈øo many, that growe without planting or ≈øetting, that all the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes are full of them, which is a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure to beholde, ≈øo that it ≈ø√©emeth to bee an earthly Paradi≈øe. It hath fruite all the yeare long, becau≈øe it raineth there by ≈øhowers at the lea≈øt fiue or ≈øix times euerie day, and then againe the Sunne ≈øhineth ≈øo, that what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is planted, there it groweth verie well: but becau≈øe the Portingales are not ouer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of new things, there groweth not of al ≈øorts of fruites of Portingall and <hi>India</hi> in that Iland: for a≈ø≈øuredly without any doubt

In one of tho≈øe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølandes called <hi>Hierro,</hi> or of Iron, there is a wonderfull and ≈øtrange thing to be ≈ø√©ene, and I verely thinke it is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øtrange≈øt things in the world. This I≈øland is on of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt of all the ≈øeuen: but it is an vnfruitful and barren land, and ≈øo drie, that in all the I≈øland there is not one droppe of fre≈øh water to bee found, but onely in ≈øome places vppon the ≈øea ≈øide, which is farre from hand, ≈øo that it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the inhabitants but very little. But God of his mercie hath prouided for the want of water both for men and bea≈øtes, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for there is a great tr√©e, which no man knoweth, (for the like is not found in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) the leaues whereof are ≈ømall and long, and alwaies gr√©ene without chaunging colour: this tr√©e is couered and compa≈ø≈øed about with a ≈ømall cloud, which alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in one forme, and neuer altereth nor dimini≈øheth: and this cloud ca≈øteth dew vpon the leaues of the tr√©e, which hang down, and drop continually (without cea≈øing) a mo≈øt cleare, thinne and fine water, which falleth into certaine Ce≈øternes, that by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the I≈øland are made round about &amp; vnder the tr√©e, therein to k√©epe and pre≈øerue the water.</p>

                     <p>On the right ≈øide of this I≈øland about an hundred miles di≈øtant: there is yet an other wonder to be noted, which is, that oftentimes there is an I≈ølande ≈ø√©ene thereaboutes, called <hi>San Borondon,</hi> where diuers men haue been on lande, being onely ≈øuch as fell vppon it on the ≈øodaine, and not looking for it<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to bee a very fayre, plea≈øant, and gr√©ene Countrey full of tr√©es, and all kinds of victuaile, and that it is inhabited by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are Chri≈øtians: but no man knowes of what nation they are, neyther what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they ≈øpeake. The Spaniards of the I≈ølandes of <hi>Canaria</hi> haue many times ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towardes it to view it, but they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find it: whereupon there goeth diuers opinions of it: for ≈øome think it to be inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that it may not bee ≈øeene but vppon certaine dayes: ≈øome thinke it to bee very ≈ømall, and alwaies couered with cloudes, and that therefore it can not bee ≈ø√©ene nor founde out: and al≈øo the great ≈øtormes and ≈øtrength of the water driueth the ≈øhippes from it: but to conclude, it is holden for a truth, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande lyeth thereaboutes, as all tho≈øe that come from thence doe certainly affirme. The Ilandes of <hi>Canaria</hi> are very fruitfull, and plentifull of all thinges, both victuailes and other nece≈ø≈øaries. They haue of all kinds of corne, ≈øpecially excellent good Wine, which from thence is caried into all places.

per≈øwade them≈øelues of that which is not true, it may be an≈øwered them (as they may reade in our de≈øcription) that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans were openly and certainely tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by wicked ≈øpirits, whereby it may ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appeare, that ≈øuch torments are no fle≈øhly effects, which torment the ≈øtronge≈øt of them in that maner.

                     <p>And comming vnder thirty degr√©es, they found a very good Hauen, wherein they entred, and ankered at ≈øixe fadome deepe, the ≈øhotte of a great P√©ece from the Lande, which was right ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt a Riuer, where they tooke in ≈øixe Pipes of fre≈øh water, and to defend them that fetched the water, they ≈øet twelue men vpon the Land, and being bu≈øied in filling of their water, they e≈øpied a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men comming towards them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of halfe of them were Spaniards, being about two hundred and fifty hor≈øeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and as many footemen, but they had no ≈øooner e≈øpied them, but they pre≈øently entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Boat, and e≈øcaped away, loo≈øing but one man.</p>

                     <p>Hauing ≈øayled thirt√©ene daies, they came to an I≈øland lying about the ≈øhot of a Ba≈øe from the Lande, where they ankered, and there they found foure <hi>Indian</hi> Fi≈øhermen in two <hi>Canaos,</hi> who tolde them that on the Firme Lande they might haue fre≈øh water, but they vnder≈øtanding that there was not much, and that it was ≈øomewhat within the Lande, they would not ≈øpend any time about it, but ≈øet ≈øayle againe, leauing the Fi≈øhermen with their <hi>Canaos,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on their cour≈øe along by the ≈øhore.</p>

                     <p>The next day in the morning they burnt the ≈øhippe, that was laden with the Spani≈øh wares, and tooke the other with them, pa≈ø≈øing forward with it on their cour≈øe, the Captaine ≈øayling along the ≈øhore with his Pinnace, and the Shippe keeping about a myle from him to Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to ≈ø√©eke for a ≈øhippe whereof they had intelligence, and hauing in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ≈øailed about fiue and forty myles, they found the ≈øhippe that lay at anker in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, who about two houres before had beene aduerti≈øed of an Engli≈øh Pirate or Sea-rouer, and had di≈øcharged eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Bharres of ≈øiluer out of her, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it on the Land, which ≈øiluer belonged to the King of Spaine, of the which ≈øiluer the Engli≈øhmen had receiued ≈øome intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but they dur≈øt not goe on land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there were many <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> that ≈øtood to guard it, and they found nothing in the ≈øhip but thr√©e Pipes of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ≈øhippe they tooke with them, and being about a mile in the Sea, they hoi≈øed vp all her ≈øailes &amp; let her driue, doing the like with the Shippe that they had taken in <hi>Azijcka,</hi> as al≈øo the other of <hi>Saint Iago,</hi> which likewi≈øe they let driue, following on their cour≈øe with their owne ≈øhip, and the Pinnace.</p>
                     <p>Being ≈øeuen or eight myles from the Hauen of <hi>Callan de Lyma,</hi> they e≈øpied thr√©e Shippes, and boording one of them, they tooke thr√©e men out of her, and ≈øo helde on their cour≈øe towards <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan de Lyma,</hi> where they entred, being about two or thr√©e houres within night, ≈øayling in betw√©ene all the ≈øhippes that lay there, being ≈øeuent√©ene in number, and being among the ≈øhips, they a≈øked for the ≈øhip that had laden the ≈øiluer, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> an≈øwere was made them, that the ≈øiluer was laid on land, they cut the cables of the ≈øhips, and the ma≈øts of two of the greate≈øt ≈øhips, and ≈øo left them.

                     <p>Two dayes after they came to the Hauen called <hi>Payta,</hi> where they found a Shippe laden with Spani≈øh wares, which the Pinnace boorded, and tooke it without any re≈øi≈øtance<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> for as ≈øoone as the Spaniards perceaued the Engli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they pre≈øently made to Land with their Boat, and two of them leapt into the Sea, none ≈øtaying in the ≈øhippe, but the Mai≈øter, Pilote, and ≈øome Moores, out of the which ≈øhippe the Engli≈øhmen tooke the Pilote, and all the Bread, Hens, and a Hogge, and ≈øo ≈øayled forward with the Shippe: but being about two Harquebu≈øh ≈øhotte to Seaward, they let it goe againe, not taking any thing out of it, and a≈øking after the ≈øhippe which they ≈øought for, they told them that about two daies before ≈øhee departed from that place, wherewith they followed on their cour≈øe, and before night they met with a Shippe of <hi>Panama,</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently boorded, but tooke nothing from her but onely a Moore, and ≈øo left it, holding on their cour≈øe.</p>
