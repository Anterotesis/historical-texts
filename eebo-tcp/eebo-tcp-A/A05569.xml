            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Peguans haue a cuſtome, that when any ſtranger commeth into their land to deale and traffique with them,<note place="margin">Strange cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Peguans.</note> of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoeuer he bee: they aſke him how long he meaneth to ſtay there, and hauing tolde them, they bring him many maides, that of them he may take his choice, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and agrée with the parentes of the maid that liketh him beſt, for the vſe of her during his continuance there: which done he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her to his lodging, and ſhe ſcrueth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all his affaires, both by day &amp; by night, like his ſlaue or his wife, but hee muſt take heede that in the meane time hee keepeth not company with other women, for thereby hee may incurre great daunger, and ſtand in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of his life. When the time of his reſidence is ended, he payeth the friendes or parents of the maid as much as he agreed for with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which done he departeth quietly away, and the maid returneth with credite home againe vnto her friendes, and is as well eſtéemed of as euer ſhe was before: and if after that the ſame maide chance to marrie, were it with the principalleſt of the Countrey, and that the aforeſaid ſtranger ſhold come to traffique in the ſame place againe, hee may againe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his woman, and he ſhall haue her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance of her huſband, or any ſhame vnto him, and ſhe remaineth by the ſtranger as long as he abideth there, and he trauelling from thence, ſhe goeth home againe vnto her huſband, which among them is holden for a moſt ſure and inuiolable law. Likewiſe when any gentleman or noble man will marrie with a maide, hee goeth to ſéeke one of his friendes, or a ſtraunger, and intreateth him to lie with his bride the firſt night of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and to take her maydenhead from her, which he eſteemeth as a great pleaſure &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done vnto him, that another man wold take vpon him to eaſe him of ſo much payne: This cuſtome is not onely vſed among the Gentlemen and chiefe nobilitie of the lande, but by the King himſelfe. Alſo diuers of the Peguans weare a bell vpon their yarde, and ſome two, as bigge as an Acorne, which is made faſt betweene the fleſh and the skinne. Of the like Belles <hi>Paludanus</hi> can ſhew you one, which I brought out of <hi>India,</hi> and gaue it him; which bels haue a very ſweet ſounde: This cuſtome of wearing Belles was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them, becauſe the Peguans in time paſt were great Sodomites, and vſing this cuſtome of belles, it would be a meane to let them from the ſame. The women go altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naked, onely with a cloth before their priuie members, which (as they go) openeth &amp; vncouereth, ſhewing all they haue, which is by them ordayned, to the ende that by ſuch meanes it ſhould tempt men to luſt after wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to auoid that moſt abhominable &amp; accurſed ſinne of Sodomie. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome among them that doe ſowe vp the priuie member of their female children as ſoone as they are borne, leauing them but a little hole to auoid their water; and when ſhe marrieth the huſband cutteth it open, and maketh it as great or as little as hee will, which they with a certaine oyntment or ſalue can quickly heale. I ſaw one of thoſe women in <hi>Goa</hi> whom the Surgeon of my Mayſter the Archbiſhops houſe did cut open: men would iudge all theſe thinges to be fables, yet they are moſt true, for I doe not onely knowe it by the dayly trafficking of the Portingalles out of <hi>India</hi> thether, but alſo by the Pegu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelues, whereof many dwell in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> ſome of them being Chriſtians, which tell it and confeſſe it for a truth, as alſo the neereneſſe of place and neighbourhood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it ſufficiently knowne.

The <hi>Iapens</hi> are not ſo curious nor ſo cleanly as the men of <hi>China,</hi> but are contente with a meane, yet for the moſt part they goe verie well apparelled in Silke, almoſt like the <hi>Chinos.</hi> The countrie hath ſome mines of ſiluer, which from thence is by the Portingals yearely brought vnto <hi>China,</hi> and there bartered for Silke, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chiniſh wares, which the Iapeans haue néede of. The countriemen are verie ſkilfull to ſearch for Siluer, and to ſell their wares. They haue among them verie good handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts men, and cunning workemen in all kind of handie workes, they are ſharpe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and quickly learne any thing they ſée, as by experience it is found in thoſe parts which the Portingales haue diſcouered. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of the lande are much different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other nations, for that they haue among them as great curteſie and good policie, as if they had liued continually in the Court, they are verie expert in their weapons as néed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, although they haue little cauſe to vſe them, for that if anye of them beginneth to brawle or to drawe his ſworde, hee is put to death, they haue not any priſons, for that who ſoeuer deſerueth to be impriſoned, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently puniſhed, or baniſhed the countrie. When they meane to lay holde vpon a man, they muſt doe it by ſtealth and by deceipt, for otherwiſe he would reſiſt and doe much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. If it bee any Gentleman or man of great authoritie, they beſet his houſe about with men, and whether hee chaunce to ſlay himſelfe or not, they enter the houſe by force, and kill al they find therin. Which to auoid, he ſuffereth himſelf often times to be killed by his ſeruantes. And it is often ſéene that they rip their own bellies open, which often times is likewiſe done by their ſeruants for the loue of their Maſters, therein to ſhew their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the loue they beare vnto them, ſo little eſtéeming their owne liues, to pleaſure and ſerue them. The like doe young Boyes in preſence of their parents, onely for griefe or ſome ſmall anger. They are in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons very patient and humble, for that in their youthes they learne to indure hunger, colde, and all manner of labour, to goe bare headed, with few cloathes, as well in Winter as in Summer, and not onely the common people, but the principall Gentlemen and Nobles of the countrie. They account it for great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to haue no haire, which with great care they doe plucke out, onely keepe a bunch of haire on the crowne of their heades, which they tie together. Touching their traffique, manners, ſpeach, and all their ceremonies, concerning life and curteſie, they are cleane contrarie vnto all other nations, ſpeciallie from thoſe of <hi>China,</hi> and till this day obſerue the ſame as an infallible law, which groweth vpon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>A long time ſince, there was in <hi>China</hi> a great &amp; mightie familie, which together with all their friends and acquaintance ſecretly conſpired and agréed to ryſe vp againſt the King of <hi>China,</hi> to driue him out of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and to kill him, and hauing ſo done, to place themſelues therein: but it could not ſo ſecretly be contriued and wrought, but in the end it was knowne: whereupon the king pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them moſt gréeuouſly, and cauſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the principall conſpirators to be put to death, and all others he found to be conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therunto ſhould haue felt the like paine, which gréeued the Counſell and other Noble men of the countrie, for that diuers of their néereſt kinſmen were of that conſpiracie, ſo that with humble and long petition to the King, they beſought him to let them liue, and to puniſh them with ſome eaſier puniſhment then death: but that which they ſought &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired at the king, all things conſidered, was little better then death, which was that he would baniſh them and all their poſteritie for euer out of the countrie, into the Ilands of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi> which as then were not inhabited, and this as they deſired was done: whereby there is ſo great enuie and hatred betwéene them and the men of <hi>China,</hi> that they hate each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the death, and doe all the miſchief one vnto the other that they can imagine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, euen vntill this time. The men of <hi>Iapen</hi> haue done much miſchief vnto the men of <hi>China,</hi> and many times fallen vpon their coaſts, and put all to fire and ſword, and now at this preſent haue not any conuerſation with them, but onely they trafficke with the Portingales, and to ſhewe themſelues whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie their deadlie enemies, in all their actions they are cleane contrary vnto the men of <hi>China,</hi> and to the ſame end haue changed all their cuſtomes, ceremonies and manners of curteſie from the men of <hi>China.</hi> To recite the particulars would be ouer long, yet I will in briefe ſet down ſome fewe examples of the cuſtomes and manners therein. One is where the <hi>China</hi> vſeth the curteſie of ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to a man with the head and hand, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they méet together: the <hi>Iapens</hi> to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie put off their ſhoes, whereby they ſhewe them reuerence, and as the <hi>Chinaes</hi> ſtand vp when they minde to receyue any man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to doe him reuerence, they to the contrarie ſet themſelues down, accounting it a verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéemely thing to receyue or bid a man wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtanding on their féet: and as we put on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:12101:39"/>
our clokes when we meane to goe abroad into the towne or countrie, they put them off when they goe forth, putting on great wyde bréeches, and coming home they put them off again, and caſt their clokes vpon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: and as among other nations it is a good ſight to ſee men with white and yealow hayre and white teeth, with them it is eſtéemed the filthieſt thing in the world, and ſéeke by all meanes they may to make their hayre and téeth blacke, for that the white cauſeth their grief, and the blacke maketh them glad. The like cuſtome is among the women, for as they goe abroad they haue their daughters &amp; maydes before them, and their men ſeruants come behind, which in <hi>Spaigne</hi> is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and when they are great with childe, they tye their girdles ſo hard about them, that men would thinke they ſhuld burſt, and when they are not with Childe, they weare their girdles ſo ſlacke, that you would thinke they would fall from their bodies, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by experience they do finde, if they ſhould not doe ſo, they ſhould haue euill lucke with their fruict, and preſently as ſoone as they are deliuered of their children, in ſtéed of cheriſhing both the mother and the child with ſome comfortable meat, they preſently waſh the childe in cold water, and for a time giue the mother very little to eate, and that of no great ſubſtance. Their manner of eating and drinking is: Euerie man hath a table alone, without table clothes or napkins, and eateth with two peeces of wood, like the men of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> they drinke wine of Rice, wherewith they drink themſelues drunke, and after their meat they vſe a certaine drinke, which is a pot with hote water, which they drinke as hote as euer they may indure, whether it be Winter or Summer.</p>

                     <p>The manner of dreſſing their meat is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contrarie vnto other nations: the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid warme water is made with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a certaine hearbe called <hi>Chaa,</hi> which is much eſtéemed, and is well accounted of among them, and al ſuch as are of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or habilitie haue the ſaid water kept for them in a ſecret place, and the gentlemen make it themſelues, and when they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine any of their friends, they giue him ſome of that warme water to drinke: for the pots wherein they ſieth it, and wherein the hearbe is kept, with the earthen cups which they drinke it in, they eſteeme as much of them, as we doe of Diamants, Rubies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious ſtones, and they are not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for their newnes, but for their oldnes, and for that they were made by a good work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and to know and kéepe ſuch by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they take great and ſpeciall care, as alſo of ſuch as are the valewers of them, and are ſkilfull in them, as with vs the goldſmith priſeth and valueth ſiluer and gold, and the Iewellers all kindes of precious ſtones: ſo if their pots &amp; cuppes be of an old &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s making, they are worth <hi>4</hi> or <hi>5</hi> thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ducats or more the peece. The King of <hi>Bungo</hi> did giue for ſuch a pot, hauing thrée feet, <hi>14</hi> thouſand ducats, and a <hi>Iapan</hi> being a Chriſtian in the town of <hi>Sacay,</hi> gaue for ſuch a pot <hi>1400</hi> ducats, and yet it had <hi>3</hi> peeces vpon it. They doe likewiſe eſtéeme much of any picture or table, wherein is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a blacke trée, or a blacke bird, and when they knowe it is made of wood, and by an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning maiſter, they giue whatſoeuer you will aſke for it. It happeneth ſome times that ſuch a picture is ſold for <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> thouſand ducats and more. They alſo eſtéeme much of a good rapier, made by an old and cunning maiſter, ſuch a one many times coſteth <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> thouſand Crowns the péece. Theſe things doe they kéeepe and eſtéeme for their Iewels, as we eſtéeme our Iewels &amp; precious ſtones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when we aſke them why they eſtéeme them ſo much, they aſke vs againe, why we eſtéeme ſo well of our precious ſtones &amp; iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, whereby there is not any profite to be had, and ſerue to no other vſe, then only for a ſhewe, &amp; that their things ſerue to ſome end.</p>
                     <p>Their Iuſtice and gouernment is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: Their kings are called <hi>Iacatay,</hi> and are abſolutely Lords of the land, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they kéepe for themſelues as much as is neceſſary for them and their eſtate, and the reſt of their land they deuyde among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which are called <hi>Cunixus,</hi> which are like our Earles and Dukes: theſe are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King, and he cauſeth them to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne &amp; rule the land as it pleaſeth him: they are bound to ſerue the King as well in peace, as in warres, at their owne coſt &amp; charges, according to their eſtate, and the auncient lawes of <hi>Iapan.</hi> Theſe <hi>Cunixus</hi> haue others vnder them called <hi>Touis,</hi> which are like our

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12101:40"/>
as if they were Saints. They had obtained ſo much fauour of the Pope, that hee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them a Biſhoppe of their order, (which is contrarie to their profeſſion) who came out of Portingale to be Biſhop in <hi>Iapon,</hi> but dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way, betwéene Portingale and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>: Since that they haue procured an other, ſo that to conclude, they haue all the praye vnder their clawes.

The Iland is both win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer all alike gréene, and hath alwaies ſome kinde of fruite in ſeaſon, which is a great pleaſure, the towne lyeth vppon ſome hils and dales like <hi>Lisbone,</hi> it hath in times paſt béene verie ſmall, and walled, with a drie Ditch round about it, wherein there is no water, but when it rayneth, the walles are yet ſtanding, but no Gates remaining, and the towne is now built round about with houſes, ſo that it is, at the leaſt twice as big without the walles, as it is within, and lyeth open without walles or cloſures, ſauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Iland hath a wal on the Eaſt ſide, which beginneth ouer againſt the land of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſette,</hi> and ſo runneth along vntill you come at <hi>Bardes,</hi> and is onely to defend them from the firme land, where the Portingales haue no commaundement. The whole Iland hath no other defence, but onely vpon the corner of the land of <hi>Bardes,</hi> at the mouth of the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, where there ſtandeth an olde ruinous Caſtle, wherein lyeth two or thrée Iron pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and one man that in the night time kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the watch, the Iland on the Sea ſide is verie high, full of ſtonie Cliffes, but the land of <hi>Bardes</hi> hath on the Sea ſide a verie faire white Sand, about halfe a mile long, and ſomewhat more: the defence of the Ilande conſiſteth herein, that on the Eaſt ſide there are thrée or foure paſſages or Gates, that ſtand vpon the water ſide, on the vttermoſt part of the Iland, right againſt the firme land, <hi>Salſette</hi> and <hi>Bardes,</hi> euerie gate or paſſage hath a Captaine and a clarke, which kéepe watch, that no man may paſſe into the other ſide, but by their licence. And the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Decanijus,</hi> and other Moores and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that are reſident in <hi>Goa,</hi> and therein haue their habitation, when they goe into the firme land to fetch their neceſſarie proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, comming to thoſe places which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paſſos,</hi> they muſt euerye man haue a marke, which is Printed on their naked armes, and ſo they paſſe ouer to the other ſide, and at their returne againe they muſt ſhew the ſame marke, whereby they may fréely enter, for the which they pay two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarukes, which is as much as a Hollanders Doit, and this is the profit that the Captain and Clarke of the ſaid <hi>Paſſos</hi> doe make. In the night they haue a Boy, that kéepeth watch, and hath a ſmall Bell, which hangeth ouer the gate, which Boylyeth downe, and tieth the ſtring of the Bell at his foote and ſo ringeth it often times, to ſhew that hee wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, which is all the watch they hold tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the whole Iland. There are fiue of theſe <hi>Paſſos,</hi> one vpon the South ſide of the Iland, where men paſſe to the firme lande, and to the land of <hi>Salſette,</hi> and is called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſterijn,</hi> commonly named <hi>Paſſo de Saint Iago,</hi> becauſe the Pariſh of Saint <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſtandeth ther: The <hi>Tebe de Paſſo</hi> is on the Eaſt ſide of the Iland, where men doe onely paſſe into. The firme land called <hi>O Paſſo Secco,</hi> which is the drie paſſage, for in that place the ryuer is at the narroweſt and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt.

Theſe ſlaues for money doe labour for ſuch as haue néede of their helpe, ſome fetch freſh water, and ſell it for money about the ſtréetes: the women ſlaues make all ſorts of confectures and conſerues of Indian fruites, much fyne néedle worke, both cut and wrought workes, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their maiſter ſend the faireſt and the youngeſt of them well dreſt vp with their wares about the ſtréetes to ſell the ſame, that by the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; bewtie of the ſaid women ſlaues, men might be moued to buy, which happeneth more for the affection they haue to the ſlaues &amp; to fulfill their pleaſure with them, then for any deſire to the conſerues or néedle workes: for theſe ſlaues doe neuer refuſe them, but make their daylie liuing thereby, and with the gaines that they by that meanes bring home, their maiſters may well kéepe and maintaine them. There are others that vſe exchanging of moneyes, and to buy money when it cometh, as tyme ſerueth to fell it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for they buy the Rials of eight, when the ſhippes come from <hi>Portingale,</hi> whereof ſome buy at the leaſt <hi>10</hi> or <hi>12</hi> hundreth, and kéepe them till the Moneth of April, which is the time when the ſhippes ſayle to <hi>China,</hi> for then are the Rials of eight ſought for to carry thether, and are commonly worth <hi>25</hi> or <hi>30</hi> in the hundreth profite, and then they receiue for them a certain money, which at the ſame time is brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Ormus,</hi> called <hi>Larriins,</hi> that come out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which they buy for <hi>8</hi> or <hi>10</hi> in the hundreth profite, &amp; kéepe them til the <hi>Portingales</hi> on the moneth of <hi>Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

There are yet other ſorts of money called <hi>Pagodes, Venetianers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Santhones,</hi> which are gold, al which they doe likewiſe buy &amp; ſel, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are manie that doe nothing els, &amp; become rich, ſpeciallie he that hath a good ſtocke. This exchange cometh moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from the Spiritualtie, who do ſecretly vſe it, by other mens meanes, without any let or hinderance. Some there are that liue vpon their rents which they haue by their palme trées, whereon the Indian nut called <hi>Cocus</hi> doth grow, whereof they may very well liue and haue well to maintaine themſelues, for that it is the principall commoditie of that Iland.</p>

                     <p>There are among them but two manner of people, that is, married men and ſoldiers, for that all young men vnmarried are named ſoldiers, which is the beſt name that a man can haue, not that the ſoldiers are any waies bound or vnder the commandement and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any Captain, which throughout <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> is not vſed but when the Portingalles come into <hi>India</hi> out of <hi>Portingall,</hi> and are ariued there, euery man goeth where hee thinketh beſt, although in <hi>Portingall</hi> euery mans name that goeth in the ſhippe is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and regiſtred, which is done in this ſorte: euery man is written vp, both his name and ſirname, with a note what pay they receyue of the King, whereof ſome beare the tytle of <hi>Fidalgo da Caza del Rey noſſas Senor,</hi> that is, a Gentleman of the Kinges houſe, which is the chiefeſt title: there are others named <hi>Mozos Fidalgos,</hi> which is alſo an honorable title, and they are commonly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens ſonnes, or by the kinges fauour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced therevnto: There are yet others that are named <hi>Caualhiero Fidalgo,</hi> which is not ſo much as the other two, yet it is an honorable title, and is the title of a knight, who for ſome valiant act by him done is made knight, which they do for a ſmall matter: for that if he do any act to be accounted of, or bee in a manner at ſuch an action doing, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is of a Captaine or a Gentleman made a knight, whereof they much boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and it is nowe growne ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that very Cookes boyes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as meane as they, are made knightes: there are others alſo that are named <hi>Moſos da Camara, do Numero, e do Seruiço,</hi> which is ſeruantes to the King, ſome of his chamber, ſome of his accounts, and ſome for his ſeruice, this is the firſt title or degrée of credite, whereby through their good ſeruice they attaine vnto better, and are more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their titles, then of all the riches in the world. There are alſo that are named <hi>Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deros Fidalgos,</hi> that is Eſquires, which is likewiſe a degrée of credit: Others are named <hi>Hommes honorados,</hi> which is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of honor, and the pooreſt among them (which are not named by any title) are ſet downe for ſoldiers, which are the common and raſcall ſort: theſe are euery man paide their wages according to their titles, and may each man in his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie (by long ſeruice, or ſome good action, but moſt by fauour) riſe to higher degrée; for that according to their tytles their ſeruice is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. The Portingalles which ſaile for <hi>India,</hi> being thus regiſtred &amp; written downe, the ſaid Regiſter at their arriuall there, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to be kept by one of the kinges Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers therevnto appointed, which euery three yeares is likewiſe changed, as other offices are, and is called the chiefe Clearke of the <hi>Matricola</hi> Generall, and hath thrée or foure vnder Clearks at his commandement. Now in <hi>India</hi> when ſummer time commeth, and that it is néedefull or neceſſary to ſend out an armie for ſome expedition to be done, or for to kéepe the coaſt, to conuoy and ſafe-conduct the trauelling Marchants that dayly ſayle to and from <hi>India,</hi> thereby to defend them and to let the <hi>Malabares</hi> their enemies from iſſuing forth to hurt them (as notwithſtanding they yearly doe:) then againſt September (which is the beginning of their Sommer) the drum is ſtricken vp, and it is proclaimed, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer will ſerue the king in his fléete by ſea, let him come to the <hi>Matricola</hi> Generall to receyue his money, and then by the Viceroy there is ordained a chiefe Captaine, and other vnder Captains for euery Fuſte and Galley: and in euery galley there is about a hundreth men, and in euery Fuſte thirtie men, little more or leſſe. Theſe are all paide by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricola,</hi> according to their tytles euery man as they are regiſtred, when they come out of <hi>Portingal</hi>: and this pay is made euery quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, each quarter contayning thrée monthes, that is, the common ſoldier ſeuen Pardawen, called <hi>Xeraffins</hi> (euery Pardawe thrée te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones <hi>Portingall</hi> money) and a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor nine Pardawen. The <hi>Moſo da Camara</hi> or ſeruant of the chamber eleuen Pardawen, &amp; ſo by degrées: which done the Captaines bidde their ſoldiers to a banket, and of their own purſes giue them ſomething beſide their pay, for that euery Captaine ſéeketh to haue the beſt ſoldiers, and buy much victuailes and other thinges at their owne charges, thereby to haue their ſoldiers good willes, and to vſe them wel. They ſit altogether at one table in the Fuſtes or Gallies, where the Captaine vſeth the ſoldiers with great fauour and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, for otherwiſe they woulde not much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme

The fléet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, it ſayleth backewarde and forwards along the coaſt, and ſometimes into ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens till the Month of Aprill, and about the laſt of that Month they enter againe into the riuer of <hi>Goa,</hi> where they winter, and then the ſoldiers are frée, and euery man goeth his way, without any further pay of the king. Then the Viceroy maketh a certificate for the Generall of the fléete, wherein he teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſuch a Captaine by his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath béene ſo many Monthes in the kings ſeruice at ſea, &amp; hauing done any matter of importance, it is therein ſet down at large, and how that hee out of his owne purſe hath ſpent and laid out much money for the ſeruice of his Maieſtie, and according to this certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Captaine Generall maketh certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for euery one of his vnder Captaines and ſoldiers, in the ſame ſort. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome Gentlemen that in winter time keepe open houſhold for all ſoldiers that will come thether to meate, whereof alſo they haue certificates, and for all things that they doe, which certificates they kéepe till they be ſome ten, twelue, or twentie, and with the Viceroyes licence go therewith to <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> aſking ſome recompence for their ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to their certificates: withall they muſt bring a certificate from the <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> General of that their reſidence in <hi>India,</hi> and that there hath not any deuiſe or ſubtilty béene vſed about ſetting downe their titles. The like muſt they haue from all other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, receiuers and accountants both for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and armour wherewith they ſerued in warre, for victuails alſo and ſuch like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many times the captaines and ſoldiers doe make but badde accounts, and many of them are aforehande with the king, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently regiſtred vnder the title of him that hath committed the fault: from theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers alſo they muſt haue certificates, that there is no ſuch thing committed by them: with theſe certificates they ſayle to <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> where there is an office of remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to aſke their rewardes by, as their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and ſeruices are or ſhalbe rewarded: but if they haue any friend in the court to ſpeake for them, &amp; by greaſing their hands to procure diſpatch: then doe they obtaine thoſe offices for thrée yeares as Captaynes, Factors, Clearkes, Iudges, &amp;c. and all other offices and places in <hi>India,</hi> but they muſt ſerue the place themſelues in perſon. Some of them by fauour get licences to paſſe them away, to ſell them, or to giue them with their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in mariage, and then the patent for ſuch offices are regiſtred in the Kings Chancery, and ſent into <hi>India</hi> where they muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Viceroy. Theſe offices are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies giuen in reuerſion after him that hath it promiſed before them, and then the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is ſearched, to ſée how many are before him that aſketh the ſaid places, &amp; when their time is out, or that they chaunce to die before they come to it, or be abſent (as many times it happeneth) then he which is next in reuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the place, and is ready to receyue it. And this in briefe is the manner of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and policie for martiall affaires: their other gouernment for iuſtice and equitie is as they vſe it in <hi>Portingall.</hi> By the table hereafter following you may ſée the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtrait ſtreete in <hi>Goa,</hi> with the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly méeting therein, which they call <hi>Leylon,</hi> liuely portrayed.</p>

Their meate is Rice ſodden in water, with ſome ſalt fiſh, or ſome other thing of ſmall value (without breade) and cleare fountaine water for their drinke, wherewith they are well pleaſed. They haue amongſt them all one or two good ſutes of apparell, all of ſilke as the manner is there, and when one goeth abroad, the other ſtay at home, for in the houſe they haue no néede of clothes, (but ſit whoſoeuer they bee) in their ſhirts &amp; a paire of linnen bréeches, and ſo as it were naked by reaſon of the great heate, for if ſome of them haue occaſion to goe out twenty times in one day, they muſt ſo often lend him their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and hee muſt likewiſe put off his clothes, as often as he commeth home againe. Some ſouldiers haue a Gentleman or Captaine to their friendes which lendeth them monie to apparell themſelues withall, to the end when ſummer time commeth, they may be ready to goe with them in Fléet to ſea, as alſo to haue their friendſhip, by night and at other times to beare them company, or to helpe them to bee reuenged of any iniury by them receiued, as I ſaid before: for that he which in <hi>India</hi> hath moſt ſouldiers to his friends, is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and feared. So that to bee ſhort, in this manner they doe maintaine themſelues in common, whereby they are able to come in preſence of the beſt of the countrie. Manie and moſt of them haue their chiefe mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the Portingales and Meſticos wiues, as alſo the <hi>Indian</hi> Chriſtians wiues, which doe alwaies beſtow liberall rewardes and giftes vppon them to ſatiſfie and fulfill their vnchaſte and filthie deſires, which they know very well how to accompliſh, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly bring to paſſe.

Alſo they giue themſelues to reſt and pleaſure: wherefore if they can deuiſe any meanes for it, they had rather trauaile &amp; deale in trade of Marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and to marie and be quiet, in reſpect that the common ſouldiers in theſe dayes are but ſlackely paide: for that when they haue at the leaſt ten or twenty certificates to ſhew

Againe the long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and great voyage maketh many to ſtay in <hi>India,</hi> and to employ their time to other trades, as they can beſt prouide themſelues. By theſe meanes the wars in <hi>India</hi> are not ſo hot, nor ſo throughly looked into, neyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other countries ſought into or founde out, as at firſt they vſed to doe.

Their is the common vſe for two houres after noone, where like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they take an afternoones ſléepe, and euer as they haue thirſt, they bring him a diſh of conſerues, or other comfets, that the water ſhoulde not worke too much in his bodie, but taſte the better. With ſuch and the like exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes they do paſſe the day til night comes on, ſo that commonly they haue all ſwollen bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies like <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whereby the ſoldiers and other Indians call them <hi>Barrigois,</hi> that is, bellies, or great bellies.</p>

So that in the ende it became a cuſtome among them, and ſo continueth: whereby at this day they obſerue it for a part of their law and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of their diueliſh Idoles, &amp; now they do it willingly, being hartened and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereunto by their friendes.

are brought to ſell in <hi>India,</hi> is, becauſe that euerie ten or twelue miles, or rather in euery Village and towne, there is a ſeuerall King, and ruler of the people, one of them not like an other, neither in law, ſpéech nor manners, whereby moſt part of them are in warres, one againſt the other, and thoſe that on both ſides are taken priſoners, they kéepe for ſlaues, and ſo fell each other like beaſtes: hee whoſe euill fortune is ſuch, that hee is one of the captiues, muſt be patient, wherein they ſhew not much diſlike, for when they are aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how they can content themſelues with that yoke of bondage, they anſwere that they can beare it well enough, ſéeing their Planet will haue it ſo, and for that their friends and neighbours ſhall reuenge their cauſe againſt thoſe that haue done it. Alſo in time of pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or dearth the fathers may ſell their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as it happened in my time, that there was ſuch a dearth, and ſcarſitie of victualls in the firme lande, and countries bordering vppon <hi>Goa,</hi> that the men of <hi>India</hi> came to <hi>Goa</hi> (and other places where the Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales are reſident) to ſell their children, in great numbers, and for ſmall prices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to buy them victuals. I haue ſéene Boyes of eight, or ten yeares, giuen in exchange for fiue or ſixe meaſures of Rice, and ſome for thrée or foure Ducats the péece, and ſome came with their wiues and children to offer themſelues to bee ſlaues, ſo that they might haue meate and drinke to nouriſh their bodies. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Portingales haue traffique in all places, (as we haue béene in many) it is the cauſe why ſo many are brought out of all countries to be ſolde, for the Portingales doe make a liuing by buying and ſelling of them, as they doe with other wares.

In their houſes and apparell they follow the manner of the land wherein they are reſident: amongſt the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans they haue their Churches, Synagogues and Meſquitas, wherein they vſe all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies according to their law: but in the places where the Portingales inhabite and gouern, it is not permitted vnto them to vſe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, neither to any Indian, although they haue their families and dwelling houſes, and get their liuings, and deal one with the other: but ſecretly in their houſes they may doe what they will, ſo that no man take offence thereat: without the townes and where the Portingales haue no commandement, they may fréely vſe and exerciſe their ceremonies and ſuperſtitions, euery one as liketh him beſt, without any man to let or deny them: but if they be founde openlie doing it in the Portingales townes and iuriſdictions, or that they haue any point of Chriſtian ceremonies mingled among theirs, both men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> die for it, vnleſſe they turne vnto the chriſtian faith, as it oftentimes happeneth without the towne of <hi>Cochin,</hi> where the King kéepeth his Court: there the Iewes and Moores haue frée libertie to vſe their ſects and ceremonies openlie, for there the Iewes haue made and built very fair ſtone houſes, and are rich mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and of the king of <hi>Cochins</hi> néereſt Counſellers: there they haue their ſynagogue with their hebrue Bible, and <hi>Moſes</hi> Lawe, which I haue had in my hand: they are moſt white of colour, like men of <hi>Europa,</hi> &amp; haue many faire women. There are manie of them that came out of the country of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> thether, and ſpeake ouer all the Exchange verie perfect and good <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh:</hi> they obſerue the Saboth day, and other iudiciall ceremonies, and hope for the <hi>Meſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> to come.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Moores</hi> like wiſe haue their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitos,</hi> wherein they pray, and aboue the Church they haue manie ſellers and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, where they learne their children their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12101:86"/>
principles of Religion before they goe to Church: they waſh their féet, for the which purpoſe they haue alwaies a ceſterne with water ſtanding without the Church, &amp; leaue their <hi>Alparcos</hi> (which are their ſhoes) ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Church dore before they goe in, and being in the Church they fall flat on the ground vpon their faces, and ſo with their armes &amp; handes lifted vp, make manie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait faces. They are alſo circumciſed like the Iewes, &amp; eate no hogges fleſh, and when they are dead they are buried. In their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they haue not any Images, but onelie ſome ſtones or round pillers ſtanding vpright with certaine Chaldean letters (out of their <hi>Alcaron</hi>) grauen vpon them. As I and a friend of myne cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to go out of the town, we were deſirous to ſée their Mahometicall Church, and their manner of ſeruice, which was denyed vs by the kéeper of the dore, that bad vs put off our ſhoes, but becauſe wee would not, he ſaid it was not lawfull for vs to enter in that ſort into the Church: but to let vs ſée it, he ſuffered vs to ſtand within the dore, and opened ſome of the windowes, that we might ſée what was within it: then the Portingale aſked him for their God &amp; their Saintes which they vſed to pray vnto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſawe the Church emptie, as I ſayd before: then the Moore anſwered him, that they vſed not to pray to ſtockes and ſtones, but to the liuing God, which is in Heauen, and ſaid that the proude Portingale Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the Heathens were all of one Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for that they prayed to Images made of wood and ſtones, and giue them the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which onely appertaineth to the liuing God: with the which anſwere the Portingal was ſo angrie, that he began to chide &amp; make a great noyſe, and to giue him manie hard words, wherewith manie Iewes &amp; Moores aſſembled about them, ſo that there had growne a great quarrell, had it not bene for me, that got him to hold his peace, and ſo brought him away, and let the matter reſt in that ſort. Theſe Moores traffique much with ſpices to the red ſea, and other places, both by water and by land.

And there among other ſtrange deuiſes that we ſaw, wee came into ſome Villages, and places inhabited by the Indians where in the way, and at euerie hil, ſtonie Rocke or hole, almoſt within a Pater noſter length, wee found a Carued <hi>Pagode,</hi> or rather Deuils, and monſters in helliſh ſhapes. At the laſt wee came into a Village, where ſtoode a great Church of ſtone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee entered, and found nothing in it but a great Table that hung in the middle of the Church, with the Image of a <hi>Pagode,</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein ſo miſhaped and deformed, that more monſterous was neuer ſéene, for it had many hornes, and long téeth that hung out of his mouth down to the knées, and beneath his Nauel and belly, it had an other ſuch like face, with many hornes and tuſkes. Vppon the head thereof ſtoode a triple Crowned My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not much vnlike the Popes triple crown, ſo that in effect it ſéemed to be a monſter, ſuch as are deſcribed in the Apocalips. It hung before a Wall, which made a partition from an other Chamber, in manner of a Quier, yet was it cloſe made vp without windowes, or any place for light, in the middle whereof was a little narrow cloſe doore, and on both ſides of the doore, ſtoode a ſmall Furnace made within the wall, wherein were certaine holes or Lattiſſes, thereby to let the ſmoke or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of the fire to enter into that place, when any offering ſhould bee made. Whereof wee found ſome there, as Rice, Corne. Fruites, Hennes, and ſuch like things, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians dayly offered, but there came ſo filthie a ſmoke and ſtincke out of the place, that whoſoeuer went néere it, was almoſt readie to choke, the ſaid place being all black, ſmerie and foule there with Before this doore being ſhut, in the middle of the Church, there ſtoode a Calfe of ſtone, whereon one of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie leaped, and laughing, began to crie out, which the <hi>Bramene</hi> that kept the Church, perceiuing, began to call and crie for helpe, ſo that preſently many of the neighbours ranne thether, to ſée what the cauſe might bee, but before the thrung of people came, we dealt ſo well with the <hi>Bramene</hi> (acknowledging our fault, &amp; ſaying it was vnaduiſedly done) that he was well content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the people went home againe. Then wee deſired the <hi>Bramene</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vs the doore that ſtoode ſhut, which after much intreatie he yeelded vnto, offering firſt to throw certaine Aſhes vpon our foreheads, which we refuſed, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> before hee would open vs the doore, wee were forced to promiſe him that we would not enter further in, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the doore.

From thence we went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtill as we went, in euery place wee found <hi>Pagodes</hi> hewed out of hard ſtones, &amp; ſtanding in their holes, of ſuch liuely ſhapes and figures as wee tolde you before.

A man may buy the beſt Cow in <hi>Goa,</hi> for fiue or ſixe <hi>Pardawes.</hi> Oxen are there little killed to eate, but are moſt kept to til the land, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things as hogges, ſhéepe and goates, are ſold after the rate.

Ther are ſhéepe in that countrie of fiue quarters in quantity, for that the tayle is as great, &amp; hath as much fleſh vpon it, as any of the quarters, there are many Buffles, but nothing good to be eaten, vnles it be by poore people, but their Milke is very good, and is very well ſolde and ordinarily eaten, for you ſhall ſée the ſlaues &amp; <hi>Canarijns</hi> in great numbers, all day going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtréetes to ſell the Milke of Buffles,

and Goates, and excellent ſwéete Creame, and freſh butter in ſmall péeces. They make likewiſe ſome ſmall white Cheeſes, but they are very ſalte and drie: wilde Bores, ſome Hares, Conies, Harts and Hindes are there alſo to be found, but not many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cockes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Pheaſantes and Doues are there in great abundance and good cheape. In the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of <hi>Goa</hi> and there about are Sparrows, and ſome other ſmall birdes, yet not many: but on the coaſt of <hi>Cochin</hi> and <hi>Malabar</hi> there are very few Sparrows, nor any ſuch like ſmall birdes. There are in <hi>India</hi> many Battes, and ſome of them ſo great, that it is incredible to tell. They doe great miſchiefe to trées, fruites and hearbes, whereby the <hi>Canariins</hi> are conſtrained to ſet men to watch in their trées, and yet they can hardly ridde them away. The Indians eate them, and ſay they are as good meat as a Partridge. There is a moſt wonderfull number of black Crows, which do much hurt, and are ſo bold, that oftentimes they come flying in at their windowes, and take the meat out of the diſh, as it ſtandeth vpon the table, before them that are ſet downe to eate: and as I my ſelfe ſate writing aboue in a chamber of the houſe, the windowes being open, one of thoſe Crowes flew in at the window, and picked the cotton one of mine Inke horne, and blotted all the paper that lay on my table, do what I could to let him. They ſitte commonly vppon the Buffles backes, and pecke off their haire, ſo that you ſhal find very few Buffles that haue any haire vpon their backes, and therefore to auoide the Crowes they get themſelues into mariſhes, and watrie places, where they ſtand in the water vppe to the neckes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could neuer be rid of them. There are likewiſe great numbers of Rattes, and ſome as bigge as young Pigges, ſo that the Cattes dare not touch them. Sometimes they digge downe the houſes, for that they vndermine the walles &amp; foundations through and through, wherby many times the houſes fall downe and are ſpoyled. There is another ſort of Rattes, that are little and reddiſh of haire: They are called ſweet ſmelling Rattes, for they haue a ſmell as if they were full of Muſke. Of Ants or Piſmires there is ſo great aboundance throughout al <hi>India,</hi> and ſo noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, that it is incredible to ſuch as haue not ſeene it: for that men may ſet nothing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to be eaten, or fattie, nor yet their clothes nor linnen, but you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently find at the leaſt a thouſand vpon it, and in the twinckling of an eye they wil preſently conſume a loafe of bread: wherefore it is the manner throughout <hi>India,</hi> to make all the Cubbords wherein they kéep their victualls, and cheſts, where their linnen and apparrell lyeth, with foure féete or pillers, and vnder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery foot or piller a ſtone or woodden Ceſtern full of water, and place the Cubbord or cheſt in the middle of the roome, not néete the wall, whereby they cannot come at it, otherwiſe it would be ſpoyled, and if they do neuer ſo little forget to powre water into the Ceſternes, if it be but a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> while, preſently ther will be ſo many Piſmires crawling all ouer it, that it is wonderfull: ſo that it ſéemeth to bee a curſe or plague of God ſent vppon that countrey. There are ſome likewiſe that vſe ſuch Ceſternes of water vnder their bedſtéed, becauſe they wold not be troubled with them as they lie in their beds, and alſo vnder their tables. Some men which kéep <hi>Canary</hi> birds, or ſuch ſmall fowles (that are brought thither from <hi>Portingall,</hi> or out of <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> for their pleaſures) are forced to ſet them on a ſticke or pearch made for the purpoſe, with a Ceſterne of water vnder it, otherwiſe it would preſently be killed by the Piſmires: and though it hangeth in the top of the houſe, yet they will come at it, if it haue a ſtring, to hold it by.

There is another ſorte of Piſmires which are almoſt a finger long, and reddiſh of colour: they runne into the fields &amp; do great hurt to the herbes, fruites and plants. Moathes &amp; wormes which créepe and eate through mens cloathes, are there in great aboundance, whereby men muſt vſe no more cloathes nor linnen in thoſe countries then that he neceſſarily and dayly weareth on his back, otherwiſe they are preſently moath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten and ſpoyled.

The firſt Elephant, perceiuing that with his head and teeth thruſt the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant away, and would haue no more helpe, but drew it out himſelfe: whereby it may bee conſidered, that they are in vnderſtanding, and deſire of commendation like vnto men.</p>
                     <p>They are likewiſe very thankefull and mindfull of any good done vnto them.

They vſe as they paſſe by ſuch houſes, to bow their heads at the dores, as alſo when they paſſe by the Church doores, and by Croſſes, which their Maſters teach them. They haue a cuſtome that they goe often into the market where herbes are ſold, as Reddiſh, Lettice, Colworts, and ſuch like ſtuffe, and thoſe that are liberall to the Elephant, doe vſe to throw ſomething before him. Among the reſt there was one Hearb wife which alwaies vſed to throw ſomething of her wares before the Elephant.

Among them was this woman, that alwaies vſed to giue the Elephant ſome thing to eat, which had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle childe in the market lying by her in a baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and by the haſtie riſing vp and throng of the people, the woman ran into a houſe, not hauing time to ſnatch vp her Child, and take it with her, and when the Elephant was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the market place, where he roared vp and downe, ouerthrowing all thinges that were before him, hee came by the child (that as I ſaid) lay ſtill in the market, and as euery man looked, ſpecially the mother, which cried out, &amp; verily thought that the Elephant had taken it and caſt it on his ſhoulder and ſpoiled it as he did all other thinges. Hee on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie notwithſtanding all his madneſſe, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mindfull of the good will and liberalitie of the childes mother dayly vſed vnto him, tooke vp the child handſomlie and tenderly with his ſnout, and layde it ſoftly vpon a ſtall by a ſhop ſide, which done, hee began againe to vſe the ſame order of ſtamping, crying, and clapping as he had done at the firſt, to the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of al that beheld it, ſpecially to the eaſe and ioy of the mother, that had recouered her child ſound and well againe.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ndian Figges there are manie &amp; of diuers ſorts, one better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, ſome ſmall, ſome great, ſome thicke, ſome thin, &amp;c. but in generall they are all of one forme and colour, little more or leſſe, but the trées are all one, and of the height of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the leaues are of a fadome long, and about <hi>3</hi> ſpannes broad, which the Turkes vſe in ſtéed of browne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to put pepper in. In the trée there is no wood, but it may rather be called a réed then a trée. The bodie of the trée (I meane that which couereth the outwardpart when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth ſomewhat to grow) is in a manner verie like the inner part of a ſyue made of hayre, but in ſhew ſomewhat thicker, and is (as it were) the barke of it: but when you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it, it is ful of leaues, cloſed and rouled vp together, of the hight of half a mans length, and ſomewhat higher. Theſe leaues do open and ſpread abroad on the top of the trée, and when thoſe that are within the bodie doe in their time thruſt themſelues forth vpwardes out of the innermoſt part of the trée, then doe the outmoſt leaues begin to drie, and fall off, vntill the trée be come to his full growth, and the fruite to their perfect ripeneſſe. The bodie of the trée may be a ſpan thicke at the moſt. The leaues haue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middle of them a very thick &amp; gray vein which ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth clean through them, and deuideth them out of the middeſt of the leaues, which are in the innermoſt part of the trée at their ſpringing vp, there cometh forth a flower, as big as an Eſtrige egge, of colour ruſſet, which in time groweth to be long, with a long ſtalke, and it is no wood, but rather like a Coleworte ſtalk: This ſtalke groweth full of figges, cloſe one by the other, which at the firſt are in faſhion like gréene beanes, when they are yet in the huſkes, but after growe to half a ſpan in length, and <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> inches broad, as thicke as Cucumbers, which ſtalke beareth at the leaſt, ſome two hundreth figges, little more or leſſe, and grow as cloſe together as grapes: the cluſters are ſo great as two men can ſcarcely beare vpon a ſtaffe, they are cut off when they are but half ripe, that is to ſay, when they are as yet half gréene, and half yealow, and hanged vp in their houſes vpon beames, and ſo within <hi>4</hi> or <hi>5</hi> dayes they will be fullie ripe and al yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The trée or plant yéeldeth but one bunch at a time, which being ripe, they cut the whole trée down to the ground, leauing only the roote, out of the which preſently groweth an other, and within a Moneth after beareth fruite, and ſo continueth all the yeare long, and neuer leaueth bearing: they are in all places in ſo great abundance, and ſo common throughout all <hi>India,</hi> that it is wonderfull, being the greateſt meat and ſuſtenance of the countrie: they are of a maruellous good taſte: when they eate them, they pul off the ſhelles, for that they haue ſhelles ſomewhat like the coddes of beanes, but thynner and ſofter, within whitiſh, and ſoft in byting, as if it were meale and butter mixed together, and ſwéetiſh, ſo that in bréef, they are very good and pleaſant of taſte: they may ſerue both for bread &amp; butter, and a man may verie wel liue thereon, without other meate, if néed were, as manie in <hi>India</hi> doe liue therewith, &amp; haue but little other things to eate. The moſt and commoneſt ſort are by the Portingals called <hi>Figos dorta,</hi> that is, garden figges, thoſe are ſomewhat thicke, there are others which are ſmaller, and thyn without, and are called <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noriins,</hi> which are of the beſt ſort: they ſmell well, and are very good of taſte. There is an other ſort called <hi>Cadoliins,</hi> which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well eſteemed, but the beſt of all are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chincapoloyns,</hi> and are moſt in the countrie of <hi>Malabar</hi>: theſe are but a little yealow, but they continue commonlie on the outſide gréene, and are ſmall and long, with a ſpeciall ſwéet ſmell, as if they were full of roſe water. There are yet manie other ſorts, ſome that are verie great, about a ſpan long, and in thicknes correſpondent: theſe grow much in <hi>Cananor,</hi> and in the coaſt of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> and are by the Portingales called figges of <hi>Cananor</hi>: and by reaſon of the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie thereof are dried, their ſhelles being taken off, and ſo being drie are caryed ouer all <hi>India</hi> to be ſold. Theſe when they are ripe are moſt roaſted, for they are but ſeldome eaten raw, as other figges are, they are ſome what harſh in ſwallowing, and inwardly red of colour, and being roaſted they are ſhalled or pille like the others, and ſo cut in ſlices, which done, they caſt ſome beaten Sinamon vpon them, ſtéeping them in wine, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they taſte better then roaſted Quinces, they are cut vp in the middle, as all the other kynde of figges vſe to be, and then boyled or fryed in Suger, which is a very daintie meat, and very common in <hi>India:</hi> to conclude, it is one of the beſt and neceſſaryeſt fruites in all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and one of the principalleſt ſuſtenances of the common people, they are found in all places of the Indies &amp; Oriental countries, as alſo in <hi>Moſambique, Ormus,</hi> on the coaſt of <hi>Abex, Malabar, Malacca, Bengala, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Guſurates, Decanijns, Canarijns,</hi>

The tree wareth very high and ſtraight, of the thicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a ſmall ſpanne little more or leſſe, it hath no branches but in the vppermoſt part thereof, &amp; in the top grow the leaues, which ſpread like vnto Date trées, and vnder the leaues cloſe to the tree grow the <hi>Coquos</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, commonly ten or twelue one cloſe by another, but you ſhall ſeldome finde one of them growing alone by it ſelf. The bloſſome of this fruite is very like the bloſſome of a Cheſtnut. The wood of the tree is very ſappy like a ſpunge, and is not firme, they doe not grow but on the ſea ſides, or bankes of riuers cloſe by the ſtrand, and in ſandie grounds, for there groweth none within the land. They haue no great rootes, ſo that a man would thinke it were impoſſible for them to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faſt hold within the earth, and yet they ſtand ſo faſt and grow ſo high, that it maketh men ſcare to ſee men clime vppon them, leaſt they ſhould fall downe.

They firſt plant the <hi>Coquos</hi> or Nuts whereof the trees doe ſpring, and when they are about the height of a man, in winter time they plant them againe, and dung them with aſhes, and in ſummer time water them. They growe well about houſes, becauſe commonlie there they haue good earth, and beeing well looked vnto and huſbanded, they yeeld fruit in fewe yeares, which is the <hi>Canarijns</hi> liuinges that dwell here and there among thoſe trees, and haue no other occupation but onely to dreſſe thoſe trees, which they farme of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, and by the fruite thereof doe get their liuinges. Thoſe trees are more aboundant with them then Oliue trées in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low trées in the Low countries. The profits they reape thereby are theſe.

The fruit when it is almoſt ripe is called <hi>Lanha,</hi> and within is full of water, and then it is white of colour, thin and ſoft, and the longer the <hi>Cocus</hi> is on the tree, the more the water groweth and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth into white, which is the meat of the nut within, and taſteth much like a haſel nut, but ſomewhat ſweeter. The <hi>Lanhos</hi> haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them a good draught of water, which is very cleare, ſweet, and coole to drink. It is at the leaſt halfe a Can full, &amp; when men walke abroad and are thirſtie they go vnto the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narijns,</hi> who preſently with a great knife in their handes come vp the tree, and cut off as many <hi>Lanhos</hi> as a man deſireth, ſelling them for a <hi>Baſaruco</hi> or a two peece, which they make very ready and cleare to be drunke, the firſt ſhell that is ouer the inward fruit (which as the nut is come to his full ripenes, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth almoſt to bee wood, is then but thin and ſoft, and very pleaſant to eate with ſalt, and do taſte almoſt like Artichokes, a man may drinke as much of this water as hee will for it will not hurt him, but is a verie pleaſant drinke, when the fruit is ripe, there is not ſo much water in it, and is white within, and ſomewhat thicker of ſubſtance, and then the water is not ſo good as it was before beeing <hi>Lanhos,</hi> for then it becommeth ſomewhat ſower. Theſe <hi>Cocus</hi> being yet in their huſks, may be carried ouer the whole world, and not once hurt or bruſed, and it happeneth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that by continuance of time, the water within the <hi>Cocus</hi> doth conuert, and congeale into a certaine kinde of yellow apple, which is verie ſauorie and ſweet. The huſke beeing taken off, the ſhel ſerueth for many vſes, as to make ladles with woodden handles, and alſo certaine little pots, which beeing faſtned to a ſticke, they doe therewith take and lade wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of their great pots, they make thereof alſo ſmall veſſels to beare wine in when they walke into the fieldes, and a thouſand other thinges. Theſe ſhelles are likewiſe burnt, &amp; ſerue for coales for Goldſmithes, which are very good and excellent. Of the white of theſe nuts in <hi>India</hi> they make porrage, and dreſſe meate withall, ſtrayning and preſſing out the milke, wherin with many other mixtures they ſeeth their rice, &amp; to bee ſhort, they neuer dreſſe any rice, which they cal <hi>Carrijl,</hi> &amp; is the ſauce to their meate thereunto, but they put ſome of their <hi>Cocus</hi> milk into it, els the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> is but little eaten, for there it is not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, but ſerueth for meate for the ſlaues, and poore people.

In the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two leaues there groweth a little ſtalke, whereon are fiue ſmall heads, &amp; out of them foure little rough leaues, out of the middeſt wherof there doe ſpring fiue ſmall white bloſſomes, of the greatneſſe and forme of Orange bloſſomes, but ſomewhat ſmaller, fairer, and ſweeter. The ſtalke ſeemeth more red than yellow, wherewith the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans colour their meate, as wee doe with Saffron. The greene fruite is of the greatnes of a Lupyne, and in faſhion like a little hart, ſomwhat long and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in the middle, hauing two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein the ſeed doth lie, which is alſo like a hart, and as bigge as the ſeeds of Saint Iohns bread, couered with a greene Skin, and ſomewhat bitter. Of all other Trees theſe are the pleaſanteſt of ſmell, ſo that they bee not handled, for if they be, they doe preſently looſe their ſweetnes and ſmell. The Indians are of opinion, that theſe flowers doe quicken and comfort the heart, but they are ſomewhat bitter, the Heathens likewiſe doe account the ſeede among their medicines that ſtrengthen the hart.

The flower or bloſſome of this Plant is verie like vnto the bloſſome of Roſe-marie in colour: and out of this bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome groweth a bud, much like the bud of Popie, wherein are certaine ſmall kernels like the kernels of <hi>Melons,</hi> which being ſtamped, and put into any meate, wine, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or any other drinke or compoſition, and eaten or drunke therewith, maketh a man, in ſuch caſe as if hee were fooliſh or out of his wittes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that he doth nothing elſe but laugh, without any vnderſtanding or ſence once to perceiue any thing that is done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

The Cloues grow verie thicke together and in great numbers, they are gathered and then dried, their right colour, when they are drie, is a darke yelow, and to giue them a blacke colour, they are commonly ſmoked. The Cloues that ſtay on the trée vngathered are thicke, and ſtay on till the next yeare, which are thoſe that are called the mother of the Cloues. And in the place where the trées ſtand, there groweth not any graſſe or gréene Hearbe at all, but it is wholly drie, for that thoſe trees draw all the moyſture vnto them.

The ſame nature is in the vnſpunne Silke of <hi>China,</hi> ſo that whenſoeuer the Silke lyeth any where in a houſe vpon the flowre, that is to ſay, vppon boordes, a foote or two aboue the ground, and that the flowre is ſprinkled and couered with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12101:115"/>
water, although it toucheth not the Silke, in the Morning all that water will bee in the Silke, for that it draweth it all vnto it. And this tricke the Indians often times vſe to make their Silke weigh heauie, when they ſel it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it can neither be ſéen nor found in the Silke. But returning to our matter, the Cloues grow about the length of a great ſhot from the Sea ſide, and are neither planted nor ſet, and nothing elſe is done vnto them, but only when they plucke and gather them, they make the place vnder the trées verie cleane. The trée will not grow verie cloſe to the Sea ſide, nor farre from it, for theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands are altogether compaſſed about with the Sea. When it is a fruitfull yeare, then the Cloues are in greater abundance then the leaues. When they gather them, they do not pluck them with their hands, but with ropes which they faſten about the branches, and by force they ſhake them off, and by that meanes the trées are ſo ſpoyled, that the next yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they yeelde but little fruite: but the ſecond yeare then after enſuing, there grow vp trées of the Cloues that fell vpon the ground, when they gathered them two yeares before, like Cheſnut trées, and they growe verie ſound, becauſe of the great rayne that falleth in thoſe places: for thoſe Ilandes lye vnder the Equinoctiall line, and yéelde fruite within eight yeares, and ſo continue aboue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares. The time when they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and dried, is from September to Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie. When the Cloues are gréene, they make good conſerues in Sugar, and are likewiſe ſalted in Vineger &amp; ſo kept in pots, and made of <hi>Achar,</hi> in which manner they are carried into <hi>Malacca</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> They likewiſe diſtill water out of the gréen Cloues which is verie cordiall and vſed in many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines. The <hi>Indian</hi> women vſe much to chawe Cloues, thereby to haue a ſwéete breath, which the Portingales wiues that dwell there, doe now begin to vſe, the leaues of the Cloue-trees, are altogether like Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues.</p>

This beaſt hath a very ſtrange nature, and great vnderſtanding, for when it is chaſed, and perceiueth it ſelfe not able anie longer to continue in breath, it taketh the ſtones betwéene the téeth and biteth them off, and ſo caſteth them away, as if it would ſay, if you come for them there they are, &amp; while the huntſman is buſie to looke for them, ſhee oftentimes eſcapeth away and ſaueth her life.

When the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeliat</hi> beginneth to decay and looſeth the ſmel, they take it out of the purſe and beate it verie ſmall in a morter, and that done being moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the vrine of a childe, and ſo put into an earthen pot that is leaded and cloaſe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it will preſently be good againe, if there were any goodnes or ſtrength left within it.</p>

There are ſome Diamantes that are thinne, and yet ſhew very cleare, which are more worth then they weygh, and leſſe then their clearnes ſheweth: for a Diamant hauing a very thinne table and hollow, yet on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper ſide hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfection in ſquare, as I ſaid, ſhould be in a thick diamant, which is of ſo good perefection both in ſides &amp; hookes: ſuch a Diamant ſheweth to be of two <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> and weygheth but one: wherefore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your Diamant is of what greatnes ſoeuer it may be, being perfect in the vpper parte, and thinne vnderneath, you muſt alwaies make your account, that being thinne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, it is of leſſe wayght then it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for, and if it be not altogether thinne vnderneath, then it weygheth more, yet the waight profiteth it nothing at all: and hauing the vpper table ſmaller, and the ſides greater, it will alſo weigh more, but the wayght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth it not: but you muſt alwaies eſteeme it to weygh but the halfe of that it ſheweth for: and not being wholly thin vnderneath, it will weygh more, but to no end: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the table ſmal, and the ſides and corners great, it weigheth more, but the weight auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, but you muſt eſtéeme it to weigh but halfe ſo much as it ſheweth for: for that before it bee made ready it will loſe much of the waight.

meanes of contrarie friends, they imployed their money in precious ſtones, which the better to effect, one of them was a Ieweller, and for the ſame purpoſe came with them. Which being concluded among them, they durſt not make knowne to any man, neither did they credite vs ſo much, as to ſhewe vs their minds therein, although they tolde vs all whatſoeuer they knew.

And becauſe they ſhould not be ſuſpected, they left their houſe and ſhop, with ſome wares therein vnſolde, in cuſtodie of a Dutch Boy, by vs prouided for them, that looked vnto it. This Boye was in the houſe not knowing their intent, and being in <hi>Bardes,</hi> they had with them a Patamar, which is one of the Indian poſtes, which in winter times cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth letters from one place to the other, whom they had hyred to guide them: &amp; becauſe that betwéene <hi>Bardes</hi> and the Firm land there is but a little ryuer, in manner halfe drie, they paſſed ouer it on foote, and ſo trauelled by land, being neuer heard of againe: but it is thought they arriued in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> as ſome ſay, but they knew not certainely. Their greateſt hope was, that <hi>Iohn Newbery</hi> could ſpeake the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, which is vſed in al thoſe countries, or at the leaſt vnderſtoode, for it is very common in all places there abouts, as French with vs. Newes being come to <hi>Goa,</hi> there was a great ſtirre and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the people, and we much wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at it: for many were of opinion, that wée had giuen them counſel ſo to doe, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ſuertie ſeaſed vpon the goods remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which might amount vnto aboue <hi>200.</hi> Pardawes, and with that and the money he had receiued of the Engliſh men, he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Viceroye, and deliuered it vnto him, which the Viceroy hauing receiued, forgaue him the reſt. This flight of the Engliſh men grieued the Ieſuites moſt, becauſe they had loſt ſuch a pray, which they made ſure account of, whereupon the Dutch Ieſuite came to vs to aſke vs if we knew thereof, ſaying, that if he had ſuſpected ſo much, he would haue dealt otherwiſe, for that he ſaid, hee once had in his hands of theirs a bagge wherein was fortie thouſand Veneſeanders (each Veneſeander being two Pardawes) which was when they were in priſon.

Thoſe ſhallowes are moſt of cleare Corrale, verie ſharpe both of blacke, white, and gréene co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is verie dangerous: therefore it is good reaſon they ſhould ſhunne them, and ſurely the Pilots ought to haue great care, ſpecially ſuch as are in the Indian ſhips, for that the whole ſhip and ſafetie thereof lyeth in their hands, and is onely ruled by them, and that by expreſſe commaundement from the King, ſo that no man may contrary them.

The Admirall called <hi>Fernando de Mendoſa,</hi> the Maiſter, the Pylot, and ten or twelue more, preſentlie entred into the ſmall boate, keeping it with naked Rapiers, that no more ſhould enter, ſaying they would goe ſee, if there were anie drie place in the ſhallowes, whereon they might worke, to make a Boate of the peeces of the broken ſhippe, therein to ſayle vnto the ſhore, and ſo to ſaue their liues, wherewith they put them that were behind in ſome ſmall comfort, but not much. But when they had rowed about, and finding no drie place, they durſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne again vnto the Shippe, leaſt the boate would haue beene ouerladen, and ſo drowned, and in the Shippe they looked for no helpe, wherefore in fyne they concluded to row to land, hauing about <hi>12</hi> boxes of Marmalade, with a pipe of wine, and ſome Biſket, which in haſt they had thrown into the boat, which they dealt among them, as néed required, and ſo commending themſelues to God, they rowed forwardes towards the coaſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had béene <hi>17</hi> daies vpon the ſea, they fell with great hunger, thirſt and labor on the land, where they ſaued themſelues.

At the laſt one ſide of the vpper part of the ſhip, betwéene both the vpper Oar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops, where the great boat lay, burſt out, and the Boate being halfe burſt, began to come forth: but becauſe there was ſmall hope to be had, and fewe of them had little will to proue maſteryes, no man layd hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but euerie man ſate looking one vpon an other.

Which done they ſet forwards, committing themſelues to God, with the greateſt cry and pitifulleſt noyſe that euer was heard, as though heauen and earth had gone together, when they tooke their leaue of ſuch as ſtayed in the Shippe. In which manner hauing rowed certaine dayes, and hauing but ſmall ſtore of victuals, for that they were ſo manie in the boate, that it was readie to ſinke, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe verie leake, and not able to hold out: in the ende they agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to chuſe a Captaine, to whome they would obey, and doe as he commanded: and among the reſt they choſe a gentle man, a <hi>Meſtico</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and ſwore to obey him: hee preſentlie commanded to throwe ſome of them ouer bord, ſuch as at that tyme had leaſt meanes or ſtrength to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: among the which there was a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, that had not long before, holpen to dreſſe the Boate, whoe ſeeing that the Lot fell vpon him, deſired them to giue him a peece of Marmalade and a Cuppe of wine, which when they had done, he willingly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelfe to bee throwne ouer bord into the Sea, and ſo was drowned.

                     <p>In the ſame month of Auguſt there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a foule and wonderfull murther with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the towne of <hi>Goa,</hi> and becauſe it was done vpon a Netherlander, I thought good to ſet it downe at large, that hereby men may the better perceyue the boldneſſe and filthie lecherous mindes of the Indian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are commonly all of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition. The thing was thus, a young man borne in <hi>Antwarpe</hi> called <hi>Frauncis King,</hi> by his trade a ſtone cutter, was deſirous (as many young men are) to ſée ſtrange countries, &amp; for the ſame cauſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled vnto <hi>Venice,</hi> where he had an vncle dwelling, who being deſirous to preferre his coſin, ſent him in the company of other Marchantes to <hi>Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Suria,</hi> where the Venetians haue great trafficke, as I ſaide before, there to learne the trade of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and ſpecially to deale in ſtones, to the which ende he deliuered him a great ſumme of money. This young youth being in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> fell into company in ſuch ſort, that in ſteede of increaſing his ſtocke, as his vncle meant he ſhould doe, he made it leſſe by the one halfe, ſo that when the other Marchants had diſpatched their buſineſſe, and were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to depart for <hi>Venice, Frauncis King</hi> perceyuing that hee had dealt in ſuch ſorte, that halfe his ſtocke was conſumed, and ſpent in good fellowſhippe, knew not what to doe, as ſearing his vncles diſpleaſure, not daring to returne againe to <hi>Venice,</hi> vnleſſe hee caried as much with him as hee brought from thence: in the end hee tooke counſell of ſome Venetians, with whome hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, that willed him to goe with the <hi>Caffila</hi> or <hi>Caruana,</hi> that as then was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go vnto <hi>Baſſora,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ormus</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> aſſuring him, ſeeing hee had knowledge in ſtones, that hee might doe great good and winne much profite in thoſe Countries, and thereby eaſily recouer the loſſe that by his folly hee had receyued: which would turne to his great benefite, and likewiſe no hurt vnto his vncle. Which counſell hee followed, determining not to returne backe againe before hee had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his loſſe, and to the ſame ende and purpoſe hee ioyned himſelfe with certain Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, who at the ſame inſtant trauelled thether, and ſo went with the <hi>Caffila</hi> till they came vnto <hi>Baſſora,</hi> the beſt Towne in all thoſe Countries, lying vppon the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte of <hi>Sinus Perſicus,</hi> that goeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Ormus,</hi> and from thence by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till they arriued in <hi>Ormus,</hi> where eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſet vppe his ſhoppe, and began to ſell his wares: but <hi>Francis King</hi> being young and without gouernment, ſéeing himſelfe ſo far diſtant from his vncle, made his account, that the money he had in hie hands was then
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12101:136"/>
his owne, and began againe without anie foreſight, to leade his accuſtomed life, taking no other care, but onlie to be merie and make good cheare ſo long, till in the end the whole ſtock was almoſt clean ſpent and conſumed, and beginning to remember himſelf, and to call to mind his follies paſt, hee knewe not what courſe to take: for that to goe home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he thought it not the beſt way, as wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meanes, and again he durſt not ſhew himſelf in the ſight of his Vncle. At the laſt he determined to trauell vnto <hi>Goa,</hi> where he vnderſtood he might well get his liuing, by ſetting vp his trade, til it pleaſed god, to work otherwiſe for him, and ſo he came to <hi>Goa,</hi> and being there, preſently ſet vp ſhoppe to vſe his occupation. But becauſe he found there good company, that is to ſay, Netherlanders and other Dutchmen, that ſerued there ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily for Trumpetters and Gunners to the Viceroy, who did daylie reſort vnto him: he could not ſo well ply his worke, but that he fell into his wonted courſe: which he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, in the end determined to make his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſidence in <hi>Goa,</hi> and for the ſame purpoſe ſet downe his reſt, to ſeeke ſome meanes there to abide as long as he liued, ſeeing all other hope was cleane loſt for euer, returning againe vnto his Vncle, or into his owne countrie. At the ſame time, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrangers, there was one <hi>Iohn de Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> a French man, borne in <hi>Deepe,</hi> that in former times was come into <hi>India,</hi> for drum vnto one of the Viceroyes, and hauing beene long in the countrie, was maryed to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Ballagate,</hi> a Chriſtian, but by birth a More. This French man kept a ſhoppe in <hi>Goa,</hi> where he made Drummes and other Ioyners worke, and withall was the Kings Oare maker for the Galleyes, whereby he liued in reaſonable good ſort. He had by his foreſaid wyfe two ſonnes and a daughter: and as ſtrangers, of what nation ſoeuer they be, vſe to take acquaintance one of the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their owne countries (ſpeciallie in <hi>India,</hi> where there are very few) and do hold together as brethren, which to them is a great comfort: ſo this <hi>Frauncis King</hi> vſed much to this French mans houſe, by whome he was verie much made of, and very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as thinking thereby to bring him to match with his daughter, becauſe of his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, which is of great account in <hi>India:</hi> becauſe of the great number of Diamants &amp; other ſtones that are ſold in thoſe countries: and to conclude, as the manner of <hi>India</hi> is, that when they haue gotten a man in once, they will neuer leaue him: he ceaſſed not with many promiſes and other wonderful matters to draw <hi>Frauncis</hi> ſo farre, that he gaue his conſent thereunto, which afterwardes coſt him his lyfe, as in the hiſtorie following you ſhall heare the true diſcourſe. To make ſhort, they were maried according to their manner, the Bryde being but <hi>11</hi> yeares old, very fair and comelie of bodie and limme, but in villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the worſt that walked vppon the earth: yet did her huſband account himſelfe a moſt happie man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that had found ſuch a wyfe, as he often times ſaid vnto me: although he was ſo ielous of her, that he truſted not any man, were they neuer ſo néere friends vnto him: but he in whome he put his greateſt truſt, &amp; leaſt ſuſpected, was the onelie worker of his woe. When he was betroathed to his wife, the father promiſed him a certain péece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and vntill it were payde, he and his wyfe ſhould continue at meat and meale in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lawes houſe, and ſhould haue a ſhop adioyning to the ſame, and whatſoeuer he earned ſhould be for himſelf. When all this was done, and the matter had remained thus a long while, by reaſon that the father in law could not performe the promiſed ſumme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their houſhold increaſed, it came to paſſe that the old man fel into a ſickneſſe and died, and then <hi>Frauncis King</hi> muſt of force pay his part towards the houſe kéeping, which he liked not of: &amp; thereupon fel out with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law: and on a certaine time made his complaint to me, aſking my counſel therein, I anſwered him and ſaid, I would be loath to make debate betwéene Parents &amp; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but if it were my caſe, ſéeing I could not obteyne my dowrie, I would ſtay no longer there, but rather hyre a houſe by my ſelf, and kéep better houſe alone with my wife, then continue among ſo manie, wher I could not be maſter. In the end he reſolued ſo to doe, &amp; with much adoe tooke his wife &amp; Child w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſlaues, and parted houſhold, hyred himſelfe a houſe, ſet vp his ſhoppe, and vſed his trade ſo handſomely, that hauing good ſtore of worke, he became reaſonable wealthie. But his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, that could not conceale her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh nature, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were for ſpight ſhe bare to her ſonne in law, or for a pleaſure ſhe tooke therein, counſelled her daughter to fall in loue with a young Portingal Soldier, whom the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did not much miſlike: which ſoldier was verie great in the houſe, and ordinarilie came thether to meat and drinke, and <hi>Frauncis</hi> truſted him as well as if he had bene his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſo much that he would doe nothing without his counſell. This Soldier called <hi>An honio Fragoſo</hi> continued this beaſtlie courſe with <hi>Frauncis</hi> his wyfe, with the helpe of her mother, all the while that they dwelt with the mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is ſayd, that he

vſed her company before ſhee was maried, although ſhee was but young, which is no wonder in <hi>India</hi>: for it is their common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in thoſe countries to doe it, when they are but eight yeres old, and haue the ſlight to hide it ſo well, that when they are maried, their huſbands take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for very good maides. This order of life they continued in that ſorte for the ſpace of foure yeares, and alſo after that they had taken a houſe, and dwelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by themſelues (for <hi>Antonio Fragoſo</hi> kept his old haunt) and although <hi>Francis</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed continually to ſhut his chamber dore, yet was this Portingall oftentimes hidden, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he not knowing thereof, where hee tooke his pleaſure of his wife.</p>
                     <p>At the laſt, one <hi>Diricke Gerritſon</hi> of <hi>Enchuſon</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> béeing Godfather vnto <hi>Francis Kinges</hi> wife, comming newly from <hi>China,</hi> deſired the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> and his wife to come and dine with him at his houſe without the towne, where as then he dwelt, and among the reſt bad mee, minding to bee merrie and made vs good cheare: but becauſe the honeſt Damſell <hi>Francis Kinges</hi> wife, made her excuſe, that ſhe might not with her credit come where Batchelers were, for that they had no ſuch vſe in <hi>India,</hi> he deſired mée to hold him excuſed till another time. They being there at this feaſt, with the mother in law, and her ſonne, &amp; their houſhold of ſlaues that waited vpon them, as the maner of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> is. After dinner was ended, and they well in drinke, they went to walke in the fieldes, where not far from thence there ſtood a houſe of pleaſure, that had neyther dore nor win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but almoſt fallen downe for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, hauing on the backe ſide therof a faire garden full of <hi>Indian</hi> trées and fruites: the houſe and garden <hi>Francis Kinges</hi> father in law had bought in his life time for a ſmall peece of mony, for as I ſay, it was not much worth: thether they went, and cauſed their pots and their pans with meat and drinke to be brought with them, being minded all that day to make merrie therein, as indéede they did. In the meane time it was my fortune with a friend of mine to walke in the fieldes, and to paſſe by the houſe, wherein they were, not thinking any company had bin there, &amp; going by, <hi>Francis King</hi> being all drunken, came forth and ſaw me, wherewith he ranne and caught me by the cloke, &amp; perforce would haue me in, &amp; made me leaue my companion, &amp; ſo brought me into the garden, where their wiues and his mother in law, with their ſlaues ſate playing vpon certaine Indian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, being verie merrie: but I was no ſooner eſpied by them, but the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man preſently went away to hide herſelfe for her credits ſake, according to their manner, as their manner is when any ſtranger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the houſe.

The meate being brought in, euery man ſate downe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Francis Kinges</hi> wife excuſed her ſelfe, that I had ſhamed her, and deſired that ſhe might not come in, ſaying for that time ſhee would eate there with the ſlaues, and although her huſband would gladly haue had her come in among vs, thereby to ſhew that he was not iealous of her, yet ſhee would not, ſo that ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her excuſe he let her reſt, ſaying it were beſt to let her ſtay there, becauſe thee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed.

Wherevpon the Viceroy cauſed the farmers of the ſhips to be called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; ſignified vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what the requeſt of the farmers of pepper was, that is to ſay, that the ſhippe ſhould be bought according to the Kings ordinance, for as much as neceſſity did ſo require it, &amp; they had refuſed to vſe it, &amp; ſaid that it was not fit for them, &amp; ſo deſired y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in reſpect of the Kings intereſt in the pepper, the ſhippe might be bought accordingly.

And although we ſayled before the winde, yet wée had danger inough: for that the Sea came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde and ouer our ſhippe, and filled all the Hatches, whereby wee were compelled to binde our Maſtes, Cables, and all the ſhippe round about with Ropes, that with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great force of the Sea it might not ſtirre, and flye in péeces. And forced wee were to Pumpe night and day, hauing at each ende of the Fouke-yarde, a rope that reached to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and at each rope there ſtoode fifteene or ſixteene men, the Pilot ſitting in his ſeate, and the vnder Pilot behinde vpon the ſterne of the ſhippe, to marke the courſe of the Sea, and ſo to aduertiſe the other Pilot. At the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there ſtoode ten or twelue men, and the other Saylers vpon the Hatches to rule the ſayles, &amp; as the waues came and couered the ſhippe, the vnder Pilot called, and then the chiefe Pilot ſpake to them at the Ruther to hold ſtiffe, and commaunded the ropes that were at the Fouke yarde to bee pulled ſtiffe: the Saylers likewiſe and the chiefe Bote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaine ſtanding on the Hatches, to keepe the ſhip right in the waues, for if the waues had once gotten vs about, that they had entred on the ſides of the ſhippe, it had certainly beene ſaid of vs, <hi>Requieſcant in pace.</hi> And it was there almoſt as cold as it is here with vs in winter, when it freeſeth not: whereby wee were all ſore toyled, and in a manner out of hart, ſo that wee eſteemed our ſelues cleane caſt away: for we were forced by turnes to go to the ruther &amp; from thence to the pumpe, (not one excepted) ſo that we had no time to ſleepe, reſt, eate, nor cloath our ſelues: and to help vs the better the ſtaffe of our Ruther brake in péeces, and had almoſt ſlaine two or three of our men. But God had pittie on vs, ſo that there happened no other hurt but that ſome of them were a litle amazed. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the fourteenth of April, without any change, whereupon all the Officers of the ſhippe aſſembled together with others of the companie, taking counſell what was beſt to be done, and perceiuing the ſhippe not to bee ſtrong enough to paſſe the Cape, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by proteſtation (whereunto they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed their hands) to ſayle with the ſhip to <hi>Moſambique,</hi> and there to winter and to repaire the ſhippe, and prouide all neceſſaries for it, which greatly greeued the common ſort becauſe they did find as great danger in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backe againe to <hi>Moſambique,</hi> as to paſſe the Cape, for that they were to ſayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by the land <hi>Donatal,</hi> which they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as much as the Cape: and alſo though they did arriue at <hi>Moſambique,</hi> yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it as much as a loſt Viage.

                     <p>The 18 of Aprill we fell againe into the wind, with as great ſtormes and foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as euer we had before, ſo that we thought verily we ſhould haue bene caſt away: for that at euerie minute the ſea couered our ſhip with water, &amp; to lighten her, we caſt diuers cheſtes, and much Cinamon, with other thinges, that came firſt to hand, ouer bord, wherewith euerie man made account to die, and began to confeſſe themſelues, and to aſke each other forgiuenes, thinking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more hope, that our laſt day was come. This ſtorme continued in this ſort, at the leaſt, for the ſpace of 24 houres: in the mean time great almes were giuen in our ſhippe to many <hi>Virgin Maries,</hi> and other Saints, with great deuotion &amp; promiſe of other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things when they came to land: at the laſt God comforted vs, and ſent vs better weather for that the <hi>19</hi> of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

and were in great hope to paſſe the Cape, ſo that the men began to be in better comfort, by reaſon of the ſignes we haue ſeene. All that day we ſaw greene water, till the 22 of Apr. vpon which day twice, and in the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, we caſt out the Lead, and found no ground, which is a good ſigne that wee had paſſed the Cape called <hi>das Agulhas,</hi> or the cape of needles, which lieth vnder 35 degrees, and is about <hi>20</hi> miles from the Cape <hi>de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Speranza,</hi> which lieth vnder <hi>34</hi> degrées &amp; a half. And becauſe that about this cape <hi>Das Agulhas,</hi> there is ground found, at the leaſt <hi>30</hi> or <hi>40</hi> miles from the land, we knew wee were paſt it: as alſo by the colour of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the birds, which are alwaies found in thoſe countries: and the better to aſſure vs thereof, the great &amp; high ſea left vs, that had ſo long tormented vs, and then we found a ſmoother water, much differing from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: ſo that as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſeemed to be come out of hell into Paradice, with ſo great ioy, that we thought we were within the ſight of ſome hauen, and withall had a good winde, though ſomewhat cold.</p>
                     <p>The 23 of Aprill we paſſed the Cape <hi>de Bona Speranza,</hi> with a great and generall gladnes, it being as then 3 months and three dayes after we ſet ſayle from <hi>Cochiin,</hi> not once ſeeing any land or ſand at all, but onelie theſe aſſured tokens of the ſaid Cape, which happened very ſeldome: for that the pilots doe alwaies vſe what meanes they can to ſee the cape, and to know the land, thereby to know certainlie that they are paſt it: for then their degrees muſt leſſen, and there they may as ſoone make towards <hi>Moſambique,</hi> as to the Iland of S. <hi>Helena</hi>: for although they can well perceiue it by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, yet is it neceſſary for them to ſee the land, the better to ſet their courſe vnto S. <hi>Helena,</hi> wherein they muſt alwaies kéepe on the left hand: otherwiſe it were impoſſible for them to come at it, if they leaue that courſe: for if they once paſſe it, they can not come to it again, becauſe there blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth continually but one kind of wind, which is South eaſt: and thus hauing paſſed the Cape, we got before the wind.</p>
                     <p>The 24 of Aprill the Pilot willed vs to giue the <hi>Bona viagen</hi> vnto the Cape <hi>de Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Speranza,</hi> according to the cuſtome, with great ioy and gladnes of all that were in the ſhippe: for that as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they aſſure themſelues that they ſayl to <hi>Portingal,</hi> and not to turne againe into <hi>India</hi> (for ſo long as they are not paſt the Cape they are alwaies in doubt) and as then we were about 50. miles beyond the Cape.

About thrée Monthes before our arriuall at S. <hi>Helena,</hi> there had béene a ſhip which the yere before ſet out of <hi>Ormus,</hi> with the goods &amp; men that remained in the S. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uador,</hi> that had béene ſaued by the Portingal armie, vpon the coaſt of <hi>Abex,</hi> and brought vnto <hi>Ormus,</hi> as in an other place I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.

Out of that ſhip of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> they tooke a Portingall Pilot, &amp; ſo paſſed the Cape <hi>de Bona Speranza,</hi> and came to the Iland of Saint <hi>Helena,</hi> where they tooke in freſh water and other neceſſaries, and beate downe the Alter and the Croſſe that ſtoode in the Church, and left behind them a Ketle and a Sword, which the Portingales at our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riual found there, yet could they not conceiue or thinke what that might meane. Some thought it was left there for a ſigne to ſome other ſhips of his companie, but euerie man may thinke what he will thereof. In the ſhip of <hi>Malacca</hi> came for Factor of the Pepper, one <hi>Gerrit van Afhuyſen,</hi> borne in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warpe,</hi> and dwelling in <hi>Lisbone,</hi> who had ſayled in the ſame ſhip from <hi>Lisbone</hi> about two yeares before, for that they ſtaied in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca</hi> at the leaſt fourtéene Monthes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the warres and troubles that were in that countrie, vntill <hi>Malacca</hi> was relieued, as I ſaide before: whereby they had paſſed great miſerie, and béene at great charges.

It is in compaſſe ſixe miles, little more or leſſe, and lyeth vnder ſixtéene degrées and a quarter, on the South ſide of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctall <hi>550.</hi> Spaniſh miles from the Cape <hi>de Bona Speranza,</hi> and from the coaſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Angola</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia 350.</hi> miles, &amp; from <hi>Braſilia 510.</hi> miles. Theſe are the two née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt lands adioyning to it. It is a verie high and hillie countrie, ſo that it commonly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto the cloudes: the countrie of it ſelfe is verie aſhie and drie: alſo all the trees that are therein, whereof there are great ſtore, &amp; grow of themſelues in the woodes, are little worth but only to burne: for it hath no ſpecial ſubſtance, but ſheweth as if it were halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, ſo that it ſhould ſeeme that ſome mines of Brimſtone, hath in times paſt béene in that Iland, as commonly all the Ilands are all much ſubiect to the ſame: for that in ſome places thereof they find Sulphur and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. When the Portingales firſt diſcouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, there was not any beaſts, nor fruite, at all within the Iland, but onely great ſtore of freſh water, which is excellent good, and falleth downe from the mountaines, and ſo runneth in great abundance into the Valley, where the Church ſtandeth, and from thence by ſmall chanels into the Sea, where the Portingales fill their veſſels full of freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and waſh their clothes: ſo that it is a great benefit for them, and a pleaſant ſight to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how cleare &amp; in how many ſtreames the water runneth downe into the valley, which may bee thought a myracle, conſidering the drineſſe of the country, together with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Rockes and hilles therein. The Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales haue by little and little brought many beaſtes into it, and in the valleyes planted al ſorts of fruites: which haue growne there in ſo great abundance, that it is almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For it is ſo full of Goates, Buckes, wild Hogges, Hennes, Partridges, and Doues, by thouſands, ſo that any man that will, may hunt and take them: &amp; ther is alwaies plentie and ſufficient, although there came as many ſhippes more into the Iland as there doe: and they may kill them with ſtones and ſtaues by reaſon of the gret numbers of them. Now for fruites, as Portingall Figges, Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and ſuch like fruites, there are ſo many, that growe without planting or ſetting, that all the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes are full of them, which is a great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to beholde, ſo that it ſéemeth to bee an earthly Paradiſe. It hath fruite all the yeare long, becauſe it raineth there by ſhowers at the leaſt fiue or ſix times euerie day, and then againe the Sunne ſhineth ſo, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is planted, there it groweth verie well: but becauſe the Portingales are not ouer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of new things, there groweth not of al ſorts of fruites of Portingall and <hi>India</hi> in that Iland: for aſſuredly without any doubt
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12101:145"/>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Iſlandes of <hi>Canaria</hi> are ſeuen, which in times paſt were called the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunadas,</hi> and at this day by the Spaniards are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Canaries,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great numbers of dogges which they founde in them, when they were firſt diſcouered. The names of the Iſlands are, great <hi>Canarie, Teneriffe, La Palma, La Gomera, El'Hierro, Lanſarotte,</hi> and <hi>Fuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Ventura.</hi> In the Iſland of <hi>Teneriffe</hi> there is a hil called <hi>Pico de Terraira,</hi> which is thought to bee the higheſt hill that euer was found, for it may eaſily bee ſéene at the leaſt threeſcore miles into the ſea, before they come at it. It cannot be climed but in the monthes of Iuly and Auguſt: for all the other
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:12101:149"/>
monthes it lyeth full of ſnowe, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Iſland, and in other Iſlands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, they ſée no ſnow. It is thrée dayes iourney to clime vp into it, and on the toppe therof it is flat, and when it is clear and faire weather, a man may from thence ſée all the Iſlandes round about it, although ſome of them are at the leaſt <hi>50.</hi> miles diſtant, and as much in compaſſe. The two monthes in which they vſe to clime vp vpon the hill, they bring downe certaine peeces of brimſtone, from whence it is much caried into <hi>Spaine</hi>: and at my being in the Iſland of <hi>Tercera,</hi> a ſhipper one of my acquaintance that came from <hi>Teneriffe,</hi> gaue me a péece thereof, for a remembrance of him. In one of thoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlandes called <hi>Hierro,</hi> or of Iron, there is a wonderfull and ſtrange thing to be ſéene, and I verely thinke it is one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrangeſt things in the world. This Iſland is on of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all the ſeuen: but it is an vnfruitful and barren land, and ſo drie, that in all the Iſland there is not one droppe of freſh water to bee found, but onely in ſome places vppon the ſea ſide, which is farre from hand, ſo that it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the inhabitants but very little. But God of his mercie hath prouided for the want of water both for men and beaſtes, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for there is a great trée, which no man knoweth, (for the like is not found in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) the leaues whereof are ſmall and long, and alwaies gréene without chaunging colour: this trée is couered and compaſſed about with a ſmall cloud, which alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in one forme, and neuer altereth nor diminiſheth: and this cloud caſteth dew vpon the leaues of the trée, which hang down, and drop continually (without ceaſing) a moſt cleare, thinne and fine water, which falleth into certaine Ceſternes, that by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Iſland are made round about &amp; vnder the trée, therein to kéepe and preſerue the water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Iſland of <hi>Aſcention,</hi> ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was diſcouered vppon the day of Chriſts aſcention into heauen, is not inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited becauſe of the vnfruitfulnes therof, &amp; becauſe it wanteth freſh water: which is alſo the cauſe that it is not viſited by the ſhips, for that they hope for no refreſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in the ſame. The hilles of this Iland are redde like Bolus. About this Iland are many birds, becauſe of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of fiſhes that are about it, ſpecially ſmall flying fiſhes, which in <hi>Portingall</hi> are called <hi>Piſce Bolodor.</hi> Reade more hereof in the booke, in Folio 175.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this water is in ſo great abundance, that it ſerueth all the Iſland for their neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vſes, not onely for the people, but alſo for their cattle throughout all the Iſle, and no man can remember when that wonder firſt began.</p>
                     <p>On the right ſide of this Iſland about an hundred miles diſtant: there is yet an other wonder to be noted, which is, that oftentimes there is an Iſlande ſéene thereaboutes, called <hi>San Borondon,</hi> where diuers men haue been on lande, being onely ſuch as fell vppon it on the ſodaine, and not looking for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to bee a very fayre, pleaſant, and gréene Countrey full of trées, and all kinds of victuaile, and that it is inhabited by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are Chriſtians: but no man knowes of what nation they are, neyther what lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they ſpeake. The Spaniards of the Iſlandes of <hi>Canaria</hi> haue many times ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towardes it to view it, but they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find it: whereupon there goeth diuers opinions of it: for ſome think it to be inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that it may not bee ſeene but vppon certaine dayes: ſome thinke it to bee very ſmall, and alwaies couered with cloudes, and that therefore it can not bee ſéene nor founde out: and alſo the great ſtormes and ſtrength of the water driueth the ſhippes from it: but to conclude, it is holden for a truth, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande lyeth thereaboutes, as all thoſe that come from thence doe certainly affirme. The Ilandes of <hi>Canaria</hi> are very fruitfull, and plentifull of all thinges, both victuailes and other neceſſaries. They haue of all kinds of corne, ſpecially excellent good Wine, which from thence is caried into all places. There is likewiſe great ſtore of Sugar, which is much eſteemed, and alſo caryed into all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Chriſtendome, which cauſeth great trafficke vnto thoſe Ilands, as well by Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes and Portingalles, as other nations, and is the common ſtaple for the ſhippes that ſayle out of <hi>Spayne</hi> into the Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> and refreſhe themſelues there, and alſo take in ſuch Wyne as they commonly vſe to carry with them to the Weſt <hi>Indies.</hi> They haue alſo great abundance of Cattle and Cammelles, and are now inhabited by Spanyardes, hauing yet therein many of the naturall borne inhabitantes, which they doe call <hi>Guanchas,</hi> who by reaſon of their long conuerſation with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, doe wholly vſe their cuſtomes, and manner of apparell. The chiefe of theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands is great <hi>Canaria,</hi> where there is a Biſhop, and the inquiſition with the tribunal Royall, and it hath the gouernment ouer all the other Iſlandes, that are called the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>

There we lay in great daunger, and much feare, for that when the month of Auguſt, commeth it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous lying before that Iland, for as then it beginneth to ſtorme. The ſhippes are there ſafe from all windes, ſauing onely from the South and Southeaſt windes: for when they blow, they lie in a thouſand dangers, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the eaſt India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhips, which are very heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laden, and ſo full, that they are almoſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſinke, ſo that they can hardly be ſtéered.</p>
                     <p>The fourth of Auguſt in the night we had a South winde out of the ſea, wherewith it began ſo to ſtorme, that all the ſhips were in great danger to be caſt away, and to run vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhore: ſo that they were in great feare and ſhot off their péeces, to call for help. The officers and moſt of the ſailers were on land, none but pugs and ſlaues being in the ſhips: for it is a common cuſtome with the Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales, that whereſoeuer they anker, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they goe all on land, and let the ſhippe lie with a boy or two in it. All the bels in the Towne were hereupon rung, and there was ſuch a noyſe and crie in euerie place, that one could not heare the other ſpeak: for thoſe that were on land by reaſon of the foule weather, could not get aboard, and they in the Shippe could not come to land. Our Shippe the <hi>Santa Crus</hi> was in great danger, thinking verily that it ſhuld haue run vpon the ſands, but God holy them. The ſhip that came from <hi>Malacca</hi> brake her Cables, and had not men enough aboard the ſhippe, nor any that could tell how to caſt forth another anker: ſo that in the end they cut their maſtes, &amp; droue vpon the Cliffes, where it ſtayed, and brake in péeces, and preſently ſunke vnder the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the vpper Dorlope, and with that the winde came North Weſt, wherewith the ſtorme ceaſed, and the water became calme. If that had not béene, al the ſhips had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame courſe: for that ſome of them were at the point to cut their Maſts, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to ſaue their liues, but God would not haue it ſo.

Fiſh is very plentifull, and of diuers kindes, and very good: in Summer there is great ſtore taken, for in Winter they can hardly brooke the ſeas. The chiefe monthes of winter weather for raine and ſtormes are, Ianuarie, Februarie, March and Aprill, and alſo the month of September is commonly very ſtormie: all the other monthes it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly good weather.

This act was of all the Spaniardes much diſliked and verie ill taken, ſo that they caryed the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard priſoner vnto <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where béeing ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> willed he ſhould bee ſent into <hi>England,</hi> that the Queene of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> might vſe him as ſhee thought good: which ſentence his friends by intreaty got to be reuerſed, notwithſtanding he commanded he ſhould without all fauor be beheaded: but vpon a good Fryday, the Cardinall going to Maſſe, all the Captaines and Commanders made ſo great intreaty for him that in the end they got his pardon. This I thought good to note, that men might vnderſtand the bloodie and honeſt mindes of the Spaniardes, when they haue men vnder their ſubiection.</p>
                     <p>The ſame two Engliſh ſhippes, which followed the Spaniſh Admirall, till he had got vnder the Fort of <hi>Tercera,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, put into the ſea, where they met with an other Spaniſh ſhip, béeing of the ſame Fléet, that had likewiſe bene ſcatered by the ſtorme and was onlie miſſing, for the reſt lay in the road: this ſmall ſhippe the Engliſhmen tooke, and ſent all the men on ſhore, not hurting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: but if they had knowne, what had beene done vnto the foreſaid Engliſh cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, I beleeue they would ſoone haue reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelues, as afterwards manie an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſoule payed for it.

called <hi>Luco.</hi> which is holden and eſteemed for the beſt and principall kinde of graine, as our wheat, but ſmaller like muſtardſeed, and ſomewhat greater, which they grinde in handmilles, whereof they make a verie white flower, making bread that is both wholeſome and of a good ſauour, and not much vnlike our bread made of wheate: of this grain they haue great ſtore in <hi>Congo,</hi> which not long ſince was firſt brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the riuer <hi>Nylus,</hi> ſpecially from that place where <hi>Nilus</hi> fills the ſecond lake.

                  <p>Of the ſame oyle brought from thence, together with the wine and vineger of the ſame palme trees, I can ſhew you: the wine they draw out of the top of the tree, which being bored, there iſſueth a certaine iuyce like milke, being colde and freſh to drincke: the firſt that commeth foorth is ſweete and very pleaſant, next iſſueth ſowre, and the laſt is vineger, which may be vſed in ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, but beeing drinke when it is freſh and newe, it maketh the water to auoyde, whereby in thoſe countries men are little troubled with the ſtone, and drincking much, it maketh them drunke, and faſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth well.

                  <p>In the mouth of this riuer <hi>Cuama,</hi> the Portingales haue a fort, where there is much traffike for golde, iuorie and amber, which is found by the ſlaues vpon the coaſt, bartering the ſame for linnen made of cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and for ſilke, brought from <hi>Cambaia.</hi> The people as nowe inhabiting therein, were not borne in that country, but before the Portingales diſcouered the land, they came out of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> with ſmall barkes to traffike there: and being once brought in ſubiection by the Portingales, doe nowe inhabite and dwell there, being neither Turkes nor heathens.</p>
                  <p>In the inward parte of the countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe two riuers beginneth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> wherein are manie golde mines, which is carried into all the places round about, as well to <hi>Sofala,</hi> as throughout <hi>Affrica,</hi> ſome being of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that out of this country <hi>Solomon</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed golde and iuorie to be brought into Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, which ſeemeth not vnlikely, for that in this Kingdome of <hi>Monomotapa,</hi> were found many olde and princely build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, very coſtly, both for timber, ſtone, chalke, and wood, which in the countries about it are not found. The gouernement of <hi>Monomotapa</hi> is very great, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer many warrelike people, all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Pagans, blacke, of a middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and very ſwift: in the which gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are many kings that are ſubiect to the ſame, and doe often rebell: their weapons are dartes and light targets. This Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour holdeth many armies in ſeuerall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, diuided into legions, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Romanes, thereby to defend hys great countrey, and to maintaine his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: amongſt his men of warre the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of women is the beſt, which are greatly eſteemed of by the King, wherein conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his greateſt power. Theſe women do burne theyr breaſtes, becauſe they ſhoulde not hinder them in ſhooting, like the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons,</hi> whereof the auncient Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers make mention: theſe women are very ſwift, expert, and cunning in ſhooting out of their bowes. In theyr fight they vſe a certayne ſubtiltie, which is, that ſeeming to runne away and flee from their ennemies, as being ſcattered, vpon the ſodayne returne agayne, and do their ennemy great miſchiefe, eſpecially when they thinke to haue gotten the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and by that ſubtiltie are ouerthrowne. Theſe women haue places appointed them to dwell in by themſelues, and at certayne times haue the company of men, that they may haue children, which if they be boyes, they ſend vnto their fathers, if daughters, they keepe them.</p>

The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are heathens, and ſome of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets ſect, of a fayre colour, much giuen to war, and to their weapons, ſpecially bowes and woodden holberts.

The women are white, and dreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues after the manner of <hi>Arabia,</hi> very prowdly, and in great pompe, al in ſilkes, wearing about their neckes, armes, and legges, iewels, rings, and bracelets of gold, going with their faces couered, like the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian women, not being ſeene or known, but when it pleaſeth them: in this towne there is a good hauen for ſhips to lie in, and for the moſt parte, the people are friendly, vpright in worde and déede, holding good friendſhippe with ſtrangers, ſpecially with the Portingales, giuing them much credit, and neuer hurting them.

                  <p>Hauing ſailed about this Cape <hi>de Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da Fuy,</hi> and ſetting your courſe towardes the redde Sea, there are other townes and hauens, inhabited by the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, the firſt called <hi>Meth,</hi> the other being ſomewhat further <hi>Barbora,</hi> and there are the laſt white people: from thence you finde al blacke people, and beyond that you come to <hi>Ceila, Dalaca, Malaca,</hi> &amp; <hi>Carachin,</hi> which coaſt in their ſpéech is called <hi>Baragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> being al Moores, and expert in armes, their apparrell from the middle vpwarde being of cotten linnen.

The noblemen and gentlemen of the countrey, apparrel themſelues in ſilke, Imbrodered with gold and other ſuch like. In this countrey they obſerue lawes for wearing of apparrel by degrées, as they do in <hi>Portingale,</hi> for that ſome are not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to weare any other apparrel but Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the people are Chriſtians, but hold cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ceremonies of the Iewiſh lawe, and vpon the day of the conception of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> al the kings and Princes vnder his obedience, do come vnto the ſaide towne of <hi>Belmalechi,</hi> there to celebrate the feaſt, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man bringing with him ſuch treaſor or yearely tribute as he is bound to pay, and at the ſame feaſt the people come thither in pilgrimage to honour it, wherevppon that day there is a great proceſſion, and out of the church from whence they come, they bring an Image of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in form like a man, of Maſſie gold, and where the eyes ſhould be, it hath two great rubies, the reſt of the whole Image beeing wrought with excellent workmanſhip, and ſet with many precious ſtones, laying it on a beere of gold very cunningly wrought. At this proceſſion <hi>Preſter Iohn</hi> himſelfe is perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally preſent, either ſitting in a Chariot of golde, or riding on an Elephant, moſt rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trapped, himſelfe apparrelled in moſt

                  <p>This Emperour <hi>Preſtor Iohn</hi> is not rightly named, for that his name is <hi>Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Bel</hi> ſignifying the higheſt, perfecteſt, and excellenteſt of all things, and <hi>Gian</hi> Lorde, or Prince, which is proper to all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund or gouerne ouer others: ſo then <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> ſignifieth the chiefe or higheſt Prince, which name being ſo ioyned, is proper to none but to the king, hauing alſo a ſurname of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as our Emperours the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>

True it is that there are yet two other lakes, but they lie clean contrary to thoſe whereof <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> writeth, for hee (as I ſaide before) placeth his lakes right in the middle betweene eaſt and weaſt, and thoſe whereof I ſpeake, lie right by direct line betweene north and ſouth, diſtant about foure hundred miles. Some men in thoſe countries are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Nilus</hi> ſpringeth out of the firſt lake, and then againe hideth it ſelfe vnder the earth, and iſſue out againe in another place, which ſome men deny, and <hi>Odoardus</hi> ſaith that right the opinion therein is, that <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> paſſeth not vnder the earth, but that it runneth through certayne fearefull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart valleis, where no man commeth or inhabiteth, (without anye certaine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell) and ſo it is ſayd that it runneth vnder the earth.</p>

The middle of the Iſland lieth in longitude <hi>19.</hi> degrees, and in latitude or height twentie degrees. It was long time accounted for firme land, becauſe of the greatneſſe, which is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, for the inhabitants themſelues knew no other, but that it had no ende (and alſo long after the Spaniards comming thither) becauſe the people are poore and naked, contented with a little, and with their own, not ſeeking any further, neither caring what their neighbours did, and therefore knew not if there were any other lande vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heauens, then that wherein they dwelt. The ground is high, rough, and ſharpe of hils, the ſea in many places being white, and the riuers ſmall, and good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, rich of golde and good copper, the aire temperate, yet ſomewhat colde: therein is found much Mather, ſeruing to die wooll, cloath, and leather: it is alſo ful of thicke woods, fiſhponds, and faire Riuers of freſh water, alſo of ponds that naturally are ſalt water: In the woods are many hogges and oxen, the riuers do oftentimes caſt foorth gold: in this Iſland are ſixe townes inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Spaniards, whereof the firſt &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal is Saint <hi>Iacobs,</hi> the reſidence and ſea of the Biſhop, but <hi>Hauana</hi> is the cheefe towne of marchandize, and where all their Shippes are made.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:12101:176"/>
is vſed by the inhabitants and Spaniards, to pitch their ſhippes. The people of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are like thoſe of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in ſpeech: both men and women go naked, and kéepe their bridalles in verie ſtrange manner: for that he which is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried lieth not the firſt night with his wife, be if it be a Lord, he biddeth all the Lordes, and one of them doth it for him, and if it be a Marchant, then Marchants take the paines to helpe him, but if it be a countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, either one of the Lordes or the prieſt doth eaſe him of a labour.

his owne men, that when he was aſleepe, killed him, and gaue him fiue woundes in his body. The people of this country are ſo cruell and fierce, that they haue oftentimes driuen the Spaniards from their countrey, not caring for the ſhippes, but running into the ſea, till the water mounted as high as their breaſts, ſhooting with thouſandes of poyſoned arrowes, and neuer would giue ouer, were it not by meanes of the great ſhot, together with the cries of ſuch as were afraid, and ran away, thinking them to be thunder claps, which oft times happen in thoſe countries, by reaſon of the euenneſſe of the countrey, with the height of the hills. The compaſſe of this hauen is three Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh miles, and ſo cleere that they may ſee ſtones lying on the ground within the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, although it is at the leaſt twentie elles deepe: into this hauen there floweth twoo running waters, but not fit for great ſhips, but onely for little boates, cut out of peeces of wood: it is a great pleaſure to heare what they report of the great numbers, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the fiſhes that are taken thereabouts both in freſh and ſalt water, for the which cauſe they found many Fiſhermen therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, with many nettes made of packe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threede, hanging on cotten ropes, which was their greateſt liuing, for that for fiſh they had whatſoeuer they deſired of their neighbours.

The people of this countrey went naked, onely that they couered their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, eyther in a gorde, or Snakes ſhels, or elſe with bandes of reedes or cotton wooll: in wars they weare mantles, and decke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with feathers: at feaſts and bankets they paint themſelues, or elſe ſtroke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer with certaine gum, and ſalues that be clammy, wherein they ſticke fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of all colours, which is no ill ſight: they cut their haire aboue their eares, and if any haire grow vpon their knees, or on their faces, they pul them out, and will haue no haire vpon any place of their body, although they are by nature moſt of them without beards or haire, and ſuch as let their haire grow after the Spaniſh manner, they call them beaſts: theſe people make great meanes to make their teeth blacke, and ſuch as haue them white, they eſteeme them to be women, becauſe they take no paines to make them blacke, which they do with the powder or ſap of a certaine hearbe, by them called <hi>Hay,</hi> or <hi>Gay,</hi> which leaues are very ſoft like turpentine leaues, and in faſhion like <hi>Mortella,</hi> being of the age of <hi>15.</hi> yeers, and that their courages began to riſe: they begin to beare thoſe leaues in their mouths, and to chaw them, vntil their teeth become as blacke as coles, which blackneſſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth vntill they die, which likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth the teeth from rotting, ſpoyling, or any paine, they mire the powder of that leafe with another ſort of powder of a kinde of wood, and with chalk of white ſhells bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in which ſort thoſe of the Eaſt Indies vſe their betele and <hi>Arrecca,</hi> with chalke of oyſters, which is already declared in the deſcription of the Eaſt Indies: the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of theſe leaues, woodde and chalke they beare continually in their mouthes, ſtill chawing it, which they keepe in baſketts and boxes made of reedes, to ſel and barter the ſame in the markets round about them, for gold, ſlaues, and cotten, and for other wares: al the maides goe naked, only they weare certaine bandes about their knees, which they binde very hard, that their hips and thighes may ſeeme thicke, which they eſtéeme for a beauty: the married women weare ſhooes, and liue very honeſtly: and if they commit adultery, they are forſaken by their huſbands, &amp; puniſhed. The lords and rich men of the country haue as many wiues as they liſt: and if any man come to their houſes to lodge, they giue them one of the faireſt to lie by them: the reſt haue but one, and ſome none: the women till the land, and looke to the houſe, and the men not being in the warres, doe fiſh and hunt: they are highminded, reuengeatiue, and haſtie: their chiefe weapons are poyſoned arrowes, which they prepare in diuers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as with the blood of ſnakes, the iuice of hearbes, and mixtures of many other things, whereby there is no means to heale ſuch as are once wounded therewith. The children, women, and men from their youth vpwards learne to ſhoote in bowes: their meate is horſleaches, battes, graſhoppers, creuiſhes, ſpiders, bees, and rawe, ſodden,

and roſted lice, they ſpare no liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoeuer, but they eat it, which is to be wondered at conſidering their country is ſo wel repleniſhed with good bread, wine, fruite, fiſh, and all kinde of fleſh in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance whereby it commeth that theſe people haue alwaies ſpots in their eyes, or elſe are dimme of ſight, which ſome notwithſtanding impute to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the water in the riuer of <hi>Cumana:</hi> they cloſe their gardens or lands with cotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yarne, by them called <hi>Bexuco,</hi> placing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the height of a man, and among them it is accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for a great offence, if any man ſhould venter either to climbe ouer, or creep vnder that cotten, holding for certaine that whoſoeuer doth teare it, ſhal die preſently after it. The men of <hi>Cumana,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are much giuen to hunting, wherein they are verie ſkilful. They hunt and kil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tigers, Goates, Ileren, Hogs, and al other kinde of foure footed beaſts, which they kil with bowes, or take with nettes. There are likewiſe in theſe prouinces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny verie ſtrange beaſts, part whereof are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie deſcribed, and part not: he therefore that deſireth further inſtruction heerein, let him reade the Spaniſh hiſtoriografers, that write larger. The women as I ſaid, til the ground, ſow Maiz, and all kinde of corne, plant Batates, and other trees, watering them, ſpecially the <hi>Hay,</hi> wherewith they make their teeth blacke: they plant trées, which being cutte, there iſſueth a white li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour like milke, which changeth into a ſweete gumme, verie good to ſmell vnto.

They haue another kind of high and ſweete ſmelling trée, which ſeemeth to be Cedar, whereof the wood is verie good to make cheſts &amp; caſes, &amp; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſweetneſſe of the wood, good to keep things in: but putting bread into them, it becommeth ſo bitter, that it is not to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: the wood is likewiſe good to make ſhips, for that it neuer conſumeth in the water, by wormes, or any other meanes. There are other trees from whence they haue lime, wherewith they gette birdes, and annoint their bodyes therewith, wherein they ſtick feathers. The land of it ſelfe bringeth forth <hi>Caſsia,</hi> but they eate it not, neither knowe how to vſe it. There are ſo many Roſes and ſweete flowers in that countrey, that the ſmel thereof maketh mens heades to ake, in ſmel exceeding muſke: wormes, as graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Caterpillers, and ſuch like, there are verie manie, which deſtroy the ſeed. There are likewiſe vains of ſea coles burning like pitch, whereof they make great profite. Thus much concerning the fruitfulneſſe of the countrey, their manners and cuſtomes in planting, hunting, &amp;c. Beſides this, theſe people take great pleaſure in twoo things, that is, dancing and drinking, often times ſpending eight dayes together in banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, dancing, and drinking themſelues drunke: beſides their ordinarie dancings and meeting together, at the feaſts and coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their Kings and Lordes, or in common aſſemblies and publike bankets: many of them meete together, euerie one dreſt in a ſeueral maner, ſome with crowns of feathers, others with ſhelles or fruits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their legges, like Iuglers heere in our countrey, vſing al kinds of toyes and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſome ſtraight, others crooked, ſome back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſome forwards, grinning, laughing, counterfetting the deafe, blind, and lame man: fiſhing, weauing, and doing al kinde of workes, and that for the ſpace of fiue or ſixe howres together, for that hee which continueth longeſt in that manner is the beſt man, and he that drinketh wel is a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie fellow: hauing danced, they ſitte down croſſe legged like a Taylor, and make good cheare, drinking themſelues drunke at the kings charges, of which their dancing I haue ſpoken in another place, ſo that to ſpeake any more thereof it were needleſſe. They are great Idolaters, praying to the Sunne and the Moone, thinking them to bee man and wife, and to be great Gods: They feare the Sunne verie much when it thundereth or lightneth, ſaying that it is angry with them: they faſt when there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eclipſe of the Moone, ſpecially the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the married women plucke theyr haires, and ſcratch their faces with theyr nailes, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is likewiſe another beaſt called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigoy,</hi> which becauſe it ſtinketh, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wil not eate, yet it is good &amp; ſauory fleſh, ſpecially when the fat of the kidnies (wherin the ſtinke lieth) is taken away. There are alſo <hi>Tatous</hi> or <hi>Armadillen,</hi> wherof in other places I haue ſpoken, which are of very white, good, and ſauorie fleſh: alſo there are certaine Crocadiles, which they cal <hi>Iacare,</hi> as big as a mans leg, and indifferent long, not hurtfull, they come into their houſes, where the children play with them without any danger. The Crocadiles in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries haue a wider mouth, high feet, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taile neither round nor ſharp, but very thin at the end: ther are likewiſe diuers kinds of Eaſts ſpeckled like our little ones, &amp; of foure or fiue foot long, in thicknes correſpondent, feareful to behold, but keepe in riuers &amp; moores like frogs, doing no hurt, they cal them <hi>Touous:</hi> being ſleyed &amp; ſodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſurpaſſe al meates for taſte &amp; goodnes, their fleſh being as white as a capons fleſh, ſweet, ſhort, &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good. They haue great toades, which the <hi>Toupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambauiltu</hi> eate whole being roſted, ſo that they are not poyſon like our toades, they eat likewiſe ſnakes of the bigneſſe of a mans arme, &amp; fiue foote long, but of no great taſte, ther are alſo many other ſnakes, ſpecially in the riuers, that are as gréen as graſſe, long &amp; thin, whoſe ſting is very dangerous: there are alſo in ſome meeres of woods, diuers great and dangerous Eaſts. <hi>Iohanes Lerus</hi> writeth, that paſſing through a wood, he met an Eaſt, as bigge as a mans bodye, &amp; of fiue or ſix foot long, al couered with white ſcales like oyſter ſhels, which lifted vp one of her forefeete, and caſting vp her head, looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with ſtaring eyes, breathing at the mouth moſt feareful to beholde, and after he and his companie had ſtayed a quarter of an houre to behold it, it clome vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hil with ſuch a noiſe ouer and through the trées, that not any Hart running through the wood, could make a greater noyſe. There is yet in this countrey another kind of ſtrange beaſt caled <hi>Ian-ouare,</hi> feeding only vpon the pray: this beaſt for length of legs and ſwiftnes, is like the Grayhound, but vnder the chinne it hath a beard or certain long haire, &amp; a ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſkin, like a Linx, and in other parts not vnlike the Linx: this beaſt is much feared by the Braſilians, for that whatſoeuer it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, it teareth it in peeces, and ſpoyleth it like a Lion, feeding therof: the Indians take this beaſt in pits, &amp; to reuenge themſelues, they cauſe her therin to pine to death, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they double her paine. Méerecats are there in great aboundance, that are ſmall &amp; blacke, by them called <hi>Cay,</hi> and among the reſt, one kind of Méerecat called <hi>Sagouin.</hi> of a verie fayre coloured haire, as big, and of haire as an Ekehorne, but as touching the forme of the chaps, breaſt, and necke &amp; other parts, altogither like a lion, being one of the aireſt little beaſtes in al that country, but for the tendernes therof it cannot be brought ouer ſea. There is yet another very ſtrange beaſt, by the Indians caled <hi>Hay.</hi> as big as a dog, with a face like a Méerecat, &amp; a hanging belly like a ſow that hath new farrowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of haire dark white, al black, with a long taile, with rough feet like a beare, long clawes, when it lieth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woods, it is very wild, but if they take it, it will be tamed, the naked <hi>Tououpinambaultiers</hi> play not willingly with it, becauſe it hath verie ſharpe clawes: no man (as the Indians ſay) did euer ſée this beaſt wild or tame, to eate any thing, but as they think, it liueth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire, wherof I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in other places. Laſtly there is yet another ſtrange beaſt called <hi>Coaty,</hi> as high as a Hare, with ſhort &amp; ſpeckled haire, ſmal ſharpe eies, a head very ſmal, &amp; downe

There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many ſpeckled hens, of three ſorts, all blacke, with white ſpots, verie pleaſant of taſt, like pheaſants: there are alſo two kinds of faire cocks called <hi>Moutor,</hi> as great as pecockes, ſpeckled with white ſpots, and black feathers. <hi>Macocaua</hi> &amp; <hi>Yamboun-O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſlou.</hi> are two kindes of partriges, as big as ducks, and of taſte like pheaſants, wood Doues, Turtledoues, and yet another kind of partriges, al of one taſt: of foules that are not eaten, there are many, as diuers kindes of parrats, wherof ſome are ſo faire, that fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer cannot be found, ſpecially <hi>2.</hi> ſorts, called <hi>Aras</hi> &amp; <hi>Canide,</hi> the feathers wherof they vſe for their apparell, hats, &amp; arme bands.

There is one among the reſt which the Indians do much regard, not ſuffering it to be hurt, or to be taken, as thinking it a bird of ſome ſecret diuination, it is as great as a pigeon, of a gray colour, crying verie heauily, which is heard more by night the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by day: the <hi>Touepinambaultii</hi> are of opinion, that thoſe birdes are ſent vnto them by theyr friendes that are dead, to bring them good newes, and prouoke and ſtirre them to bee of good courage againſt theyr enemies in the fielde, they thinke alſo, ſo they take good regard vnto this Birds ſong, and fortune to bee ſlaine in the warres, that after they are dead, they ſhal goe vnto theyr forefathers, beyond the hilles there for euer to be merry, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to dance: They certainely perſwade themſelues that thoſe birdes bring newes

from their friendes, and that thereby they ſhould be merrie, and of better courage, ſo that they take great regard vnto their cries. There are likewiſe in this countrey many battes as big as crowes, which by night en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the houſes, and finding any man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked, they ſucke the bloud out of their toes in great aboundance, whereof in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place I wil ſay more. Their Bees are leſſe then ours, like blacke flies, and make theyr honey in hollow Trées: the Indians haue good knowledge howe to gette theyr ware and theyr honey: they vſe not the wax to burne, but onely to ſtoppe their reedes, wherein they keepe their feathers from the wormes. Touching ſmal wormes like flies or Mytes, as alſo ſcorpions and earth creui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, which are hurtful vnto men, it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to write: they haue diuers fiſhes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are common here with vs, as twoo ſorts of Barbels, the one called <hi>Rurema.</hi> the other <hi>Parati,</hi> both beeing ſodden or roſted, are of a verie good taſte, which becauſe they ſwimme in companicars, e by them killed with dartes, ſometimes two or thrée toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Secondly, although ſuch vngodly men are altogether vnworthy to heare that which the holy ſcripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth concerning the reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet this ſecond poynt of the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may well be propounded againſt thoſe which beléeue the immortalitie of the ſoule, as alſo the <hi>Peruuians</hi> that beléeue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie both of ſoule and body, whereby they may bee aſhamed, and learne of ſuch wilde men: and although thoſe people knew how to bee quit of all their torments and gréefes aforeſaide, yet are they in great feare of thunder, as fearing a certain power, which they cannot reſiſt or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, yet will they not knowe it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel in the Acts of the Apoſtles, fourtéenth Chapter and ſeuentéenth verſe, moſt truely ſaith, that God in time paſt ſuffered the heathens to walke in their own wayes, although hee ceaſed not continually to make his power knowne, by doing vs good, ſending vs raine from heauen, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs fruitfull times and ſeaſons, filling our hearts with ioy, and our bodyes with meate, ſo that it is the onely wickedneſſe of man that will not acknowledge the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall God and maker of all things. And in another place, in the firſt to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and twentieth verſe, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth (for that which is inuiſible vnto man, which is his eternitie and Godhead) is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted vnto vs by the creation of the world. Therefore although thoſe men wil not confeſſe God with their mouthes, yet are they by their own actions ouerthrowne, and made to knowe there is a God, and that ſo they are not ignorant, or may once pretend the ſame, conſidering their beléefe of the immortalitie of the ſoule, the feare they haue of the thunder clappes, and the wicked ſpirits that torment them. They haue likewiſe Prophets or Prieſtes, which they call <hi>Caraibes,</hi> that goe from village to village, making the poore people beleeue that they are conuerſant with ſpirites, and that they can make ſtrong whom it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, and giue them power to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the enemie, alſo that by theyr helpe the fruites and great trées do grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe vpon the earth.</p>

                        <p>This prouince of <hi>Panama,</hi> in time paſt was much inhabited, and haunted by the Indians, and al the riuers yeelded gold, but now by the Spaniards are moſt fiſhed drie.

a notable and worthy man (which they call <hi>Con</hi>) in times paſt came out of the north, into their countries, with moſt ſwift paſe, that had no bones nor ioynts in his body, neyther was it knit together by any kinde of ſubſtance, that in one day could throwe downe, or raiſe hilles, and fill deep vallies, and paſſe through a place where no wayes nor meanes to paſſe was found, and that this man had made their predeceſſors, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them hearbs and wilde fruits to liue vpon, and that he being offended with the <hi>Peruuians</hi> inhabiting the plaine countrey, conuerted their fruitfull land into ſandie grounds, and cauſed raine not to fall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet being moued with pittie, becauſe of the beaſts, and to water the drie fieldes hee opened diuers fountaines and riuers, whereby the people might moiſten theyr groundes.

Likewiſe there are in thoſe Churches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Images of great Serpents, which they pray vnto, but this is only about the line in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Cuſco,</hi> and not where they haue the <hi>Guacas,</hi> which are ſtones, about the which no man may come, but onely the Prieſtes, that are apparrelled al in white: and comming to them, they take in theyr handes certaine white cloathes, and fal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground, ſpeaking to the Image in a ſtrange ſpeech, becauſe the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not vnderſtand it. Thoſe Prieſtes receiue all the offerings that are giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Idol, burying the tenth part thereof in the Church, and keepe the reſt for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and you muſt vnderſtand that all the offerings muſt be wrought with golde and ſiluer, and of ſuch forme and faſhion as the thing is which they deſire to haue of their <hi>Guaca.</hi> They offer alſo liuing men, and all kindes of beaſtes, looking in the hearts and intrailes of the men or beaſtes which they did offer, for certaine ſecret tokens, which if they founde not vpon the offerings, they ſtill offered newe men or beaſts, vntil they founde the tokens, thinking the Idoll not to be pleaſed with ſuch offrings as had them not. When the prieſts ſhould offer ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then they abſtaine from the company of their wiues, and ceaſed not all night to doo nothing but crie out, and pray to the diuell, running into the fieldes, and to the places where the <hi>Guacas</hi> ſtande, whereof there were ſo many, that euerie man hadde

When the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes ſpoyled their Temples, they founde therein many pottes full of the dried bones and fleſh of dead children, that had bin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to their Idolles: they offer likewiſe birdes and other beaſtes, and with the bloud of their offerings they annoint the mouthes of their Idolles, and the dores of their churches. There was likewiſe among the golde that lay by their idolles certaine ſtaues and myters for Biſhops, ſuch as our Biſhops vſe when they are in their robes, or as the Painters vſe to ſet foorth Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi>

This is the Créeke called <hi>Enſeada dos Camarouis,</hi> the Rode thereof is vnder the harbour of the Northeaſt point afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, for it is good for the time of the windes of the Monſon of <hi>China,</hi> for ſuch ſhippes as come from <hi>Liampon</hi> &amp; <hi>Iapon,</hi> to put in there: you muſt goe néere the land before you come at the point, and runne along by it till you haue gotten about the point, and are ankered within it, there it is verie good muddie ground by this Northeaſt point, ſo that the Riffe will be Southweſtward from you: therefore you ſhall put neare the point of the lande, not to fall vpon the Riffe, from this Créeke forward to the point of <hi>Sumbor,</hi> lying vnder <hi>28</hi> degrées and <hi>¼.</hi> you runne along the coaſt Northeaſt, and North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt and by North, without the aforeſaid Iſland, and the point of the ſaide Créeke, and from the créeke twelue and thirtéene miles, the land hath a point, and from thence it runneth inwards North North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, and ſomewhat further Northeaſt, and Northeaſt and by North out againe. Two myles from thence lyeth thrée I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands by each other, two great and high, and one ſmall, béeing all faire ground round about, but wholly without any Rode or ſuccour to defend the ſhippes in foule weather.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Iſlands are called <hi>Canton Sion,</hi> all this coaſt of <hi>Enſeada dos camarouis</hi> to theſe Iſlands and Hooke aforeſaide, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither lowe land with houels and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes with euen buſhes: and along by it, it is both faire and calme Sea, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ground.</p>

                     <p>From the Iſlandes of <hi>Canton Sion</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Lande and Coaſt reacheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, &amp; ten miles from thence, that is to ſay, two miles from the land, lyeth <hi>2.</hi> high and great Iſlands nigh adioyning each to other, without Trees or buſhes, reaching as the coaſt doth: whereof the firſt lying on the Southweſt ſide, is very long, and that on the North ſide is in manner of a triangle, and the Channell ſeparating them is little more in breadth than a man can caſt a ſtone, but déepe and faire, for I haue paſſed through it: and harde by the Northeaſt point of the firſt long Iſland, which commeth out by the other, there is a ſandie Bay, cloſe by the which there is a verie good Rode, for this Sandie baye hath defence for all windes: and becauſe it is like a Hauen, it is by the <hi>Chinars</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pudeon,</hi> that is, a Sacke.</p>
                     <p>From this Sandie Bay about the ſhot of a great Peece Northweſt, lyeth a well of verie great depth, therefore you muſt be carefull in entring the Créeke, where you haue verie good ground at fiue and ſixe fadome déepe. In this Créeke or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Bay there is very good freſh water, as alſo right ouer againſt it on the other ſide of the Iſland, there is a great place of freſh water. The channell betwéene theſe Iſlandes and the Firme land, is all faire and deepe, as alſo to Seaward from thence on the Northweſt part of the land of this Hauen aforeſaid, there is another Hauen called <hi>Fuychon,</hi> which is a riuer, but with a ſmall entry, béeing in breadth about halfe the length of the ſhotte of a great peece, with cleare and déep ground: from the mouth inwardes there is good water, running a great way into the land, and all faire. If you deſire to goe in there and to anker, you muſt gouerne your courſe by the Lead and the depthes. This Baye hath many townes and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages lying along by the riuer. From the aforeſaid firſt Iſland fiue or ſixe myles Southward to Seaward, lieth two ſmall Iſlandes, halfe a myle diſtant each from other, they are both without trées or any buſhes: the Iſland on the Land ſide is flat, and that to Sea-ward is very high, and hath a Créeke, but verie ſmall, and onely with a Northweſt wind it is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourleſſe: the entrie is verie ſtraight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round within, with good and pleaſant ground.</p>
                     <p>This Iſland in forme is like a Horſe ſhooe, for from the inner ſide of the Creeke towards the outſide to Seaward, it may be the length of a bow ſhot, in the breadth of the Iſland both theſe Iſlands are ſmall.</p>
                     <p>From this Hauen of <hi>Pudeon</hi> fiue miles along the coaſt, there lyeth two I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, whereof the firſt is long, reaching like the coaſt: the other reacheth from off the land towards the Sea, for betwéen it and the land you can not paſſe. The point of this Iſland reacheth beyond the Northeaſt point of the aforeſaid long I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that lyeth to Sea-ward: betwéene them both is a ſmall Channell, but faire and déepe all along and round about this Iland, as well inward as outward.</p>
                     <p>From this Iſland to the land it is good muddie ground, at foure fadome, and is a good Hauen for the Monſon of <hi>China,</hi> but wholly open for a Southweſt wind, with the which wind I there loſt two <hi>Iuncos,</hi> which are <hi>Chiniſh</hi> ſhippes: This Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is called <hi>Guotimony.</hi> Before you come within two myles of this Hauen, vpon the coaſt there lyeth two Créekes cloſe togither, which runne about a myle into the land, and are aboue the ſhot of a great Péece in breadth, but are not fit for our ſhips. The ground therabout is faire, and inward it hath a village.</p>
                     <p>From this Hauen of <hi>Guotimony</hi> ſeuen or eight myles Eaſtward, lieth a verie great and high Iſland, on the South ſide hauing thrée or foure ſmal Ilands cloſe to it: it lieth about ſeuen or eight miles from the land, and a good way from the other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands on the Northweſt ſide, it hath two Créekes hard by each other, whereof that in the Northeaſt is the ſafeſt, with good and faire ground, reaching about halfe a mile inwards, within it hauing good freſh water, with a Sandie Bay, where they draw vp their ſhips to mend and dreſſe them when néed requireth: it is all faire round about, onely you muſt not run betwéene the ſmall Iſlands &amp; the Iſland: This Iſland is called <hi>Lanquyn.</hi>

                     <p>From this Iſland <hi>Lanquyn</hi> fiue miles North, and North and by Eaſt, there are many Ilandes lying togither both great and ſmall, with ſome Trées, but thinne and lowe, reaching along the coaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten myles forward: the firſt lie cloſe by each other to Seaward vpon a row. The channels betwéene theſe ilands are thrée fadome deepe, ſome leſſe, muddie

ground, if you haue occaſion to ſéeke for ſuccour in that place, with the windes of the monſon of <hi>China,</hi> you may anker in the mouthes of thoſe Channels, where you may lie ſafe, but in thoſe Monſons or coniunctions of times there is no foule weather, in the courſe of the generall windes, you ſhall not paſſe (from this firſt rowe of Iſlands lying to Seaward) to the land, for it is all bankie ground full of Sandie places, for the déepeſt place is but two fadome.</p>
                     <p>On the Northeaſt ſide inward from theſe Iſlands, there are two other Iſlands lying along by the Lande, which reach Northeaſt and Southweſt, whereof the Southweſt Iſland is greater and higher then that to Landward. The Channell betweene them is déepe and faire muddie ground: The ground of the iſſue on the Northeaſt ſide of this Channell is all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Keſell ſtone, hauing many I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and ſtonie cliffes. Here the ſtreams runne ſtrongeſt with the Monſons of the winde.</p>
                     <p>A mile or more Eaſtward from theſe two Iſlands, there is a good and faire ſea, and ground: it is verie dangerous to paſſe with great ſhips betwéene theſe Ilands, for you can not paſſe.</p>
                     <p>On the Lande right againſt theſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, there is a Hauen called <hi>Hunchon,</hi> and the Iſlandes are called <hi>Lyon</hi>: From this firſt Iſland of <hi>Lyon</hi> to the point of <hi>Sumbor</hi> are about thirtéene miles, and you runne as aforeſaid Northeaſt and Southweſt. Theſe iſlands reach within three miles of the point of <hi>Sumbor,</hi> but in the middle way they are leſſe, and more diſtant from each other: and before you come néere the point of <hi>Sumbor</hi> by ſixe miles, there is an Iſland of Reddiſh earth, with two hilles like two men, and in the middle there is a valley, which reacheth Northweſt and Southeaſt.

                     <p>The point of <hi>Sumbor</hi> reacheth a great way into the ſea, it is a thicke land with a high riſing backe: it hath on the end of the Southweſt point, cloſe by, a long and high Iſland, and from the Northeaſt point of this Iſland, lyeth an Iſland or Cliffe making betwéene this Iſland, and the aforeſaid point a verie narrow chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, where the countrey ſhippes do paſſe through, inwardes from the Southweſt ſide, and from the Iſland the land maketh a great Créeke, which in compaſſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout foure great miles: two miles from the point Southweſtward, there lieth two or thrée ſmall Iſlands. As you come outward to theſe Iſlands, there is déepe and faire ground, but from thence to the point and all ouer the Créeke it is all ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, ſo that at lowe water it is drie, and you may ſée the muddie ground, vpon the plaine of the aforeſaid point, on the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt ſide, there is a great towne, where they haue many great Barkes, that are made with Orloopes and nayled, wherof ſome are <hi>200.

                     <p>On the Northeaſt ſide of this point, there is a Créeke running inward to the Land: at this point of <hi>Sumbor</hi> the Land maketh an end or Hooke that lieth vnder <hi>28.</hi> degrées and <hi>¼.</hi>

This Iſland which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Eaſt and Weſt, on the Eaſt end hath a point ſticking out towardes the North, in the which point there is a ſmall Créeke of fiue or ſixe fadome déepe faire ground, where you may harbour in all weathers, except it be with a Northweſt wind. The North Iſland on the Weſt point hath two Iſlands lying on a rowe, whereof the one is great, the other ſmall and ſome what long, betwéene the which and the Iſland you may paſſe with ſmall ſhippes, and round about theſe Iſlands it is faire ground.</p>
                     <p>In this Iſland you haue verie good freſh water, and they are called <hi>Timba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam.</hi>

                     <p>From theſe Iſlands a mile and a halfe or two miles Northward, there lieth two other ſmall Iſlandes which reach Eaſt ſoutheaſt &amp; Weſt Northweſt, wherof the one is greater and longer than the other, they lie cloſe togither, &amp; the channell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them is faire &amp; déepe, with harbor againſt North Northeaſt, &amp; Southweſt windes, for I haue laine there at anker with a great ſtorme: From this point of

The knowledge and right tokens of this Hauen are, that when you are hard by <hi>Chapoſy,</hi> the Sea hath ſome reddiſh leaues or Flagges driuing on the water, and ſome péeces of réedes, like <hi>Caſsia Fiſtola,</hi> or Spaniſh Réedes, which come out of this Riuer. Two miles Eaſt Southeaſt from this hauen to Seaward, there lyeth two ſmall and high Iſlands cloſe by each other, wholly without trées or buſhes, round about them it is twentie fadome déepe muddy ground, and from the mouth of the Riuer halfe a mile from the land Southward lyeth a long Iſland, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching like the coaſt, betweene this and the land it is faire muddy ground of thrée fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome déepe, whereof the entry on the South ſide is the déepeſt, and along by the land it is ſhallow. From <hi>Chapoſy</hi> eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene myles forward lyeth the Iſland of <hi>Liampo,</hi> where the Portingales vſed to Trafficke. Theſe Iſlands were called <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogicam,</hi> &amp; the Firme land <hi>Liampo,</hi> which along by the ſea ſide is a high land. The Portingales ſhips doe not paſſe along by it, but betwéene the Iſlands. At the firſt you haue but few and ſmall Iſlands, but being paſt them, then vpon the rowe of Iſlands, lying furtheſt out into the ſea, you haue a very great Iſland with high Trées and Creekes along by the Sea coaſt, and it is there all ouer faire and good ground, and on the Weſt ſide it hath a Créeke, in the middle whereof, there is a great and high Iſland, betwéene the which and the land you haue a Roade againſt the Monſons of the South and Southweſt windes. This entry is of fiue fadome déepe, but it is too narrow for a Shippe to wind in it, therfore you muſt bind it faſt, or caſt out ankers both before and behind. From this Iſland two miles Weſt Northweſt lyeth another great Iſland with very high Trées, and from the South Southweſt ſide of the ſame I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland there is a good hauen for the Monſon of the North and Northeaſt winds, on the which ſide it hath very good aire and freſh water, and the other Iſland afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid for the Monſon of Southweſt winds is vnwholſome. The channell betweene them both is <hi>35</hi> fadome déepe, but in the Road you haue ſuch depths as you would deſire. From this north Iſland to the land are about thrée miles, hauing ſome ſmall Iſlands in the way.

From the Iſlands of <hi>Sinogicam</hi> forwards there alſo the tides runne verie ſtrong, about a third part of the Water at an Ebbe, and a third part at a flood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt haue good regard to the croſſe ſtreames that come from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny channels and droughts, which runne verie ſtrong, and with ſo great force, that oftentimes they driue a man vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point and Hookes of the Iſland, when hée would paſſe by it.

at the foot whereof it is <hi>20</hi> fadome déepe, it is diſtant from the great Iſland about the ſhot of a great péece.

This Iſland reacheth North and South, beeing long and lowe ground, hauing white ſandie ſtrandes, with a verie gréene countrey of valleyes, it hath many Pine trees, but they ſtand ſcattering from each other, and verie open: it is about ſeuen or eight myles long, hauing in the middle way on the Eaſt ſide cloſe by the land, an Iſland or ſtonie Cliffe, which farre off ſheweth like a Foiſt vnder Saile.

Eaſtward from this Iſland the land hath a high houell, and on the South ſide of the ſaid houell, there lyeth a great opening, which on the other ſide hath a point of low land and white ſand ſtrands with trées.

Within theſe Ilands and Stones lyeth the Hauen of <hi>Tanora,</hi> and to put into this Hauen you muſt run to the point and the end of theſe Iſlands and Stones that reach into the Sea, and béeing paſt them, then on the Northeaſt ſide to Seaward there will lie a ſtonie Cliffe with an Iſland without buſhes or trées, béeing ſtéepe land, reaching North and South: betwéene this Iſland and the land there is a great Créeke where you may anker, for right ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, it is <hi>25</hi> fadome déepe, but there is not the right Hauen: but when you are about the point and the end of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Iſlands and Stones that ſticke outward to Sea, then you ſhall preſently paſſe along thereby inward towards the land, which you may freely doe without danger, for it is faire and cléere, holding your courſe Weſtward, and a point of land will be vpon your right hand: and béeing paſt this point, you ſhall paſſe cloſe by, ſhunning the land on the Weſt ſide, and being there you are within the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which is a long Créeke or Bay rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching North till you be in: you may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre in the middle thereof at foure fadome déepe, and then you are incloſed with a round bowe, it is there altogither muddy ground.

And becauſe in this deſcription there is oftentimes mention made of ſome Hauens, Creekes, Riuers, Bayes and Iſlands, where you haue good harbor for the Monſon of the North and South Windes when they blowe, which is to bée vnderſtoode, (that if they bée againſt you in the way you ſhould hold) you ſhould know which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is good to ſtay in for that time, or to winter in: for in the Eaſt Countries you muſt Winter when the winde is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, ſo that you cannot holde on your voyage, and of force you muſt ſtay for the wind and weather, that is, the Monſon which ſerueth you, and where you haue a good harbour to ſtay for the Monſon that you muſt haue, and then to follow on your voyage. Wherefore I thought it neceſſary to ſet this downe, that you might the better vnderſtand the meaning of the Portingall and Indian Pilotes, that firſt ſet downe, noted, and obſerued theſe courſes and Nauigations, vſing here the ſame manner and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the countrey, not chaunging the word of Monſon, although that in ſome places before, I haue ſaied ſome thing thereof.</p>

If you chance to fall within the Iſland, finding your ſelfe by the coaſt of <hi>Iapon,</hi> whereby you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſſe without the Iſland, then take your courſe inward betwéene the Land and the Iſland, without all the Iſlands and Stones, about the length of the ſhotte of a great Peece from it, but goe not neare the coaſt, for that from the North Land there is a Point that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to the other ſide. Being paſt the length of the Iſland along by the Iſlands and ſtony Cliffes, as I ſaid before, you ſhall preſentlie put along by the Iſland, outward to Sea-ward, whereby North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you ſhall ſée the Point of Lande aforeſaid, which hath ſome Cliffes and Riffes: within the which, Northward lyeth the Hauen of <hi>Amacuſa.</hi> This point
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:12101:254"/>
of land lieth right ouer againſt another point of lande that ſticketh out from the Iſland, lying North and South with each other: and when you haue paſt beyond this point of lande, then you ſhall hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the coaſt about a mile from it.</p>
                     <p>You runne along by this coaſt from the one point of lande to the other North Northweſt and South Southeaſt, and if you paſſe without the Iſland of <hi>Coiaquin,</hi> you ſhall take the ſame way (béeing paſt and about it) to come vnto the coaſt, and ſo runne along by it as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p>From the aforeſaid point of <hi>Amacuſa</hi> that hath the Cliffes and Riffes, thrée or foure miles forward, there is another great and high point of lande in the ſame coaſt, and beeing paſt it, you ſhall ſée a great opening or entrie of a Channell, which is called <hi>O eſtrechio d'Arima,</hi> that is, the Straight of <hi>Arima</hi>: within this ſtraight lyeth two good Hauens, the firſt called <hi>Xiquij,</hi> which is one of the beſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of <hi>Iapon</hi>: This Hauen lyeth about halfe a mile from the entrie inwarde on the South ſide and the right hand Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the end of a great Créeke, which hath a harbour for all windes, with foure or fiue fadome déepe muddie ground, but in this Hauen three or foure Portingales were ſlaine: I thinke it happened by their filthie pride and preſumptuouſneſſe, for in all places they will be Lordes and maſters, to the contempt and embaſing of the inhabitants, which in all places will not be endured, namely in <hi>Iapon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtubborne and obſtinate people. But to to the matter. On the North ſide of this créeke, on the land lying on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, there lieth a high round Iſland, and hitherto it is all ouer faire and cléere ſea and ground.</p>
                     <p>To put into <hi>Arima</hi> you ſhall goe tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the North Lande, for on the South ſide (as ſoone as you are paſt the Creeke of <hi>Xiquij</hi>) you haue two ſtones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts it is all ouer full of riffes and other filth. This ſtraight aforeſaid (as you firſt enter into it) reacheth Eaſtward, and then turneth Northwarde, and along by the point (where it turneth northward) there runneth ſtrong ſtreames, and ſo ſtiffe, that if you be not carefull, it will turne the ſhippe about, and put it backe againe, if you haue not a ſtiffe forewind to breake the force of the ſtreames.</p>
                     <p>Being about this point aforeſaid, on the ſame land there lieth a very good Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen called <hi>Cochinochy,</hi> or <hi>Cochin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From this Straight to the Iſland of <hi>Firando,</hi> along the coaſt there are many Iſlands and Cliffes, and a great Créeke. At the iſſue of the Straight of <hi>Arima</hi> ſixe miles forward, lyeth an Iſland cloſe by the coaſt called <hi>Cambexima,</hi> which is a great high land, hauing on the Sea ſide cloſe by it foure or fiue Iſlands or cliffes: and betwéene this Iſland and the Firme land, there is a good harbour, and in the ſame Iſland there is a village with many people, with a good ſmall Créeke or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where many Fiſher boats &amp; Foiſts doe lie: from thence begin the Iſlands of <hi>Firando.</hi>

                     <p>From this Iſland <hi>Cambexima</hi> fiue or ſixe miles forward, there is a point of land ſticking out with many Iſlands and cliffes that reach from the land into the ſea: you muſt run to the ſame point north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtward. This way from <hi>Cambexima</hi> to the aforeſaide point of land, is all one créeke, becauſe the land windeth inward, and becauſe that on this coaſt of <hi>Iapon</hi> (commonly at ſuch time as you goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) it is cloudie &amp; miſtie weather: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can hardly diſcerne the ſcituation of the land, but if it be cléere weather you ſhall preſently ſee the point ſticking out (that hath the Iſland and Cliffes at the end thereof) but if it be cloudie and miſtie weather, then you muſt not ſaile along the coaſt, but hold your courſe half a ſtrike from the Northweſt as aforeſaid, &amp; when you are hard by it, you ſhall preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer all the Iſlands and cliffes.

Right againſt <hi>Cochino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> lyeth another very good Hauen, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Oxy,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> where you may freely trafficke.</p>
                     <p>You need not feare the entry of <hi>Arima</hi> for that beſides the hauens aforſaid wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may lye ſafely, there will many Foyſtes and Barkes come and boord you Shippe, that will bring you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will, and helpe you to your deſire.</p>
                     <p>You muſt likewiſe vnderſtand, that along by the coaſt of <hi>China</hi> you need not feare any thing, for it is all faire and good ground, keeping without all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands, for if you goe betwéene them, you ſhould hardly get out againe to your deſire: therefore it is beſt for you to keepe without them, running along by them, and ſo there is no feare: for it is all faire way, as well to the Iſland <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando</hi> as to the Hauen of <hi>Vmbra,</hi> onely that <hi>Firando</hi> lyeth ſeuen or eight myles North-ward from the Hooke or Point of Trées, and being there, you ſhall preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſée <hi>Firando,</hi> and in putting forward to it, you find a <hi>Varella,</hi> that is a marke of a ſharpe ſtony hill: &amp; then you ſhall gouern your ſelfe as aforeſaid, for then you may preſently perceaue it, being a very high land, which ſtretcheth Eaſt Northeaſt, &amp; Weſt Southweſt, in the middle way ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many ſmall Iſlands, with channels betwéene them, thereby to runne from the one ſide to the other: but if you wil go from the Iſland of <hi>Cabexuma</hi> to <hi>Vmbra,</hi> you muſt alwaies kéepe cloſe to the land, for in the Iſland of Diamonds, or poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iſland, there is another very good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where (as ſoone as you are in ſight thereof) many Barkes and Foiſts will boord you, and ſo bring in your Shippe. The Hauens in thoſe countries, are theſe that follow as well in the Land of <hi>Iapon,</hi> as the Iſlandes lying about it: whereof in this deſcription I haue alreadie made mention. Firſt in the Iſland of <hi>Cabexu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> there is a very good Hauen, alſo <hi>Cochinochy</hi> lying in the Kingdome of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rima</hi> is a better Hauen. The Hauen of <hi>Oxy</hi> right againſt <hi>Cochinochy,</hi> is alſo a better Hauen. In the Iſland called <hi>O Ilha do Diamon,</hi> that is, the Iſland of the Diamond, becauſe of the ſharpe pointed Rocke, there is likewiſe a very good Hauen, which is part of the Lande of <hi>Vmbra,</hi> alſo the Hauen of <hi>Vmbra</hi> is a good Hauen.</p>

                     <p>From this Iſland <hi>De Pinos,</hi> to <hi>Cabo de Corrientes,</hi> you muſt runne Weſt North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, by the which courſe you ſhall ſée it, This point on the ſea ſide is a Lande run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning downeward, vpon it hauing ſome palme Trées, and on the Weſt ſide a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtrand, where there is a Roade where you may lye.

                     <p>From the Iſland <hi>De Pinos,</hi> to <hi>Cabo de S.
