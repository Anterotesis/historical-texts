            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(ſo ſlily doth the Devill ſuggeſt that for
Divinity, which will prove very Machiavilianiſme
in fitting thoſe ſcruples for firebrands of future diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
It will therefore be moſt requiſite to conſider,

            <p>And herein I would not be miſtaken for partiall, or

to whom God ſeales not his remarkable evidences

have done) ſhall turne ſuch an excellent grace of God
into wantonneſſe, when our ſlaviſh inſinuating flattery
ſhall cry <hi>non vox hominum ſonat,</hi> to the deſtructive dictates
of a Prince, forced by our wretched acclamations to
overſwell with ambition above the bounds of paternall
duty to his People, well may that King be tooke away

(in reſpect of Oath or Covenant made or taken)
in caſe of ſuch urgent neceſsity, where God ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
demonſtrateth and effecteth his owne Will in

            <p>In relation whereunto, this Quaere will requiſitely
be reſolved, Whether Kings, as being Gods annoynted,
have not a perpetuall priviledge by their originall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,

cleeres it, that properly for their good of generall

it that this Royall Ordinance was ſo ſpeedily changed
in the time of the ſame Peoples Government by Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
None dares affirme without blaſphemy but that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98952:4"/>
their Government by Judges was approved and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the ſame God that before gave them a King.
And if ſo, how inconſiſtent with the good of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will it prove, to urge for that as Supreme, which
God hath and will put under their feet: <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
were after this elected Kings, (at the Peoples impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
for that Government) by God himſelfe, but
how diſpleaſing the manner of their deſires were the
Story evidences. And you may reade how ſhort a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion
of totall Government in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was aſsigned both
to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> Poſterity; might not <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their
revolt from <hi>Reboboam</hi> have ſcruplized as much to have
diſcerted him, and change (though not their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
their Governors; but we finde the Spirit records
it to have been the will of God, which if <hi>Reboboam</hi> had
reſiſted, even himſelfe had periſhed. Nor from hence
it cannot be ſuppoſed that <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their act of Revolt
proved oppoſers of, but operating Inſtruments for the
then effecting of the revealed will of God, whether to
judgement upon themſelves for former tranſgreſsions
or not, is not here neceſſarily diſputable; but moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
God intended, and did thus mightily manifeſt
his owne liberty to alter the Government of his people,
even by ſubordinate inſtruments, which evidence both
himſelf and <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſobliged from an irrevocable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of that originall inſtitution of <hi>Davids</hi> Houſe
to be Kings over all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> And if ſo, queſtionleſſe a
people ſo experienced in Gods powerfull workings for
a change over and amongſt us, as we are, and wherein
his will by his works (and our continued offences ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
ſo manifeſtly for it,) need not (when we are thus
forcibly by the power of God in man, diſ-ingaged of
all bonds to what is of preſent exiſtence) though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
according to his will, ſtartle to become obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

whoſe violent motions ſtill ſpeake their implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

            <p>But you will ſay, all this proves not the neceſsity of

we mnſt conſider that ſuch Oathes oblige ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

And although conſcience, from the tenure of ſuch
Oathes, may juſtly urge obedience to be given to an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
remaining power; yet they binde not any to
obey what really is not, nor to reſiſt what inevitably
muſt be; and as the power that is extinct was ordained
of God, ſo that power that will be confirmed by him,
upon ſafe and in certaine powers, will prove it ſelfe to
be immediately by the ſame will from the ſame God,
whether in mercy or judgement towards us, the event
according to our faith or diffidence in him will
evidence.</p>

the proceedings of the preſent Authoritie, that as none
under it muſt neceſſarily leade us to examine whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
mentall or active in this caſe will not prove it ſelfe
to be againſt the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us indefinitely, That the Powers that are
are ordained of God; then if an overweening affection
to the paſt power (though admitted it ſelfe to be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
the beſt) ſhall not onely hinder our conformity to
a preſent Ordinance of God, but move us to reſolve upon
mentall reſervations for reſiſtance thereof, it being ſo
cleerely evidenced that is is the will of God ſo to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
ſuch a power as we are in all likelihood to fall under,
without doubt ſuch oppoſition will be verily and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

precipitate the reſiſters into that conſequent gulphe of

of the peacefully minded amongſt us, for your
Chriſtian correſpondence and conjunction with them in
unanimous obedience; our innumerable diviſions alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

the God of peace, even yet for a long ſeaſon to ſuſpend us
that heavenly bleſsing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it may be juſtly feared, that
our refuſall of it upon tearmes ſo apparently conſonant

            <p>We are not unmindfull that the Silver Smithes of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>

may urgently and politiquely argue for the worſhip of

yet doubtleſſe God will in his good providence by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments

thoſe whoſe obſtinacy towards, and diffidence in them,
are not the juſt occaſions of their puniſhment by want
and beggery) that even the extreameſt downcaſt amongſt
us by that meanes may at leaſt have abundance in content.</p>
            <p>If we would reflect upon our Saviours example (who
was obedient even to an uſurper, and yet knew himſelfe
to be the abſolute King of <hi>Judi</hi> ſucceſsively legitimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
