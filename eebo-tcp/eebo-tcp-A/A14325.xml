            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE BATHS OF BATHE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Athe, so called from the Baths in it, is a little well-compacted Cittie, and beautified with very faire and goodly buildings for receit of strangers. Although the site thereof, by reason of the vicinity of Hills, seeme not pleasant, being almost inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them; yet for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of ayre, neerenes of a sweet and delectable Riuer, and fertilitie of soyle, it is pleasant and happy enough; but for the hot waters that boyle vp euen in the middest thereof, it is more delectable and happier, then any other of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>There are in it foure publike Baths, so fairely built, and fitted with such conueniencie for bathing, as the like (I suppose) is not else-where to be found; besides a little Bath for Lepers, called The Lepers Bath.</p>
            <p>They all haue the originall of their heate from one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely, Sulphur, burning in the cauities of the earth, thorow which the waters flowing receiue their heate. They partake of no other minerall that I can finde: what may lye hid <hi>in visceribus terrae,</hi> I know not: of this I am sure, that such diseases as cannot receiue cure else-where, here doe.</p>
            <p>These Baths as they differ in their heate,<note place="margin">Kings Bath.</note> so in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and effects. The Kings Bath is the hottest, and it is for beautie, largenesse, and efficacy of heate, a Kingly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1905:5"/>
Bath indeed, being so hot as can be well suffered. This Bath is of strong-heating, opening, resoluing, attracting, and exiccating facultie, and therefore onely conuenient for cold and moist bodies, and for cold and moist diseases.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hot Bath.</note> Next to the Kings Bath for efficacy of heate, is the Hot Bath, and the difference in their heate is so little, that it is scarcely to be discerned. This Bath is good for the same infirmities that the Kings Bath is, and for the effects which it worketh, I cannot finde it to be inferiour vnto it. They are two excellent Baths for cold and moist diseases, and for very cold and moist bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Queenes Bath.</note> The Queenes Bath is a member of the Kings Bath, a wall onely going betweene them, with a passage therein to goe from one to the other. This Bath is not altogether so hot as that, and therefore the vse of it is conuenient for them that cannot well endure the heate of the Kings Bath.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Crosse Bath.</note> The Crosse Bath is for heate the mildest, being very temperately warme: it is a dainty Bath for young, weake, and tender bodies, that cannot endure the heate of the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baths, or for whom the hotter Baths may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. It is an excellent Bath for temperate bodies, by way of preseruation, because such the hotter Baths may soone distemper, and occasion hurt: Neither is this Bath good onely for such as are of a temperate state and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of body by way of preseruation; but for them and others also by way of curation, in some cases, where the hotter Baths are not fit to bee vsed. This Bath, by reason of the mildnesse of its heate, is of a notable mollifying and relaxing facultie: good therefore in contractions of any member, in obstructions of the brest, spleene, liuer, and kidneys; and effectuall also for Aches, when it is in its prime and vigour of heate, especially for such, whose temper or habit of body shall prohibit the vse of the hotter Baths. This Bath attaines not to its perfection of heate, till the weather grow to be constantly hot, and when the other Baths, by reason of the feruor thereof, cannot be vsed, but by such whose diseases, and state of body are impensiuely cold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1905:5"/>I cannot, in regard of the diuersity of bodies, insist vpon euery particular in the vse of these Baths: wherefore I will onely for your better instruction and direction herein, giue you some speciall aduertisements, and thereupon leaue you to some Learned Physician, that can accordingly guide you in the vse of them.</p>
            <p>These famous hot Waters are of singular force,<note place="margin">The vertue of the Baths in generall.</note> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against diseases gotten by cold, or proceeding from a cold and moist cause, but also bring, in time of health, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort and profit to all cold, moist, and corpulent bodies: for they open the pores, resolue, attenuate, digest, consume, and draw forth superfluities, and withall strongly heale and drie the whole habit of the body.</p>
            <p>They are of excellent efficacy against all diseases of the head and sinewes, proceeding of a cold and moist cause, as Rheumes, Palsies, Epilepsies, Lethargies, Apoplexies, Cramps, Deafenesse, Forgetfulnesse, Trembling, or weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of any member, Aches, and swellings of the ioynts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They also greatly profit windie and hydropicke bodies, the paine and swelling of any part of the bodie, so that it proceed not from an hot cause, the sluggish and lumpish heauinesse of the body, numnesse of any member, paine in the loynes, the gout, especially the Sciatica, cold tumors of the Milt and Liuer, the Yellow Iaundies in a body ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoricke or phlegmaticke.</p>
            <p>They are also very profitable for them that haue their lungs annoyed with much moisture; and to make slender such bodies as are too grosse, there is nothing more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, then the often vse of these waters. Wherefore let those that feare obesitie, that is, would not waxe grosse; bee carefull to come often to our Baths: for by the vse of them, according as the learned Physician shall direct; they may not onely preserue their health, but also keepe their bodies from being vnseemingly corpulent.</p>
            <p>They are also singularly profitable to women; for they helpe them of barrennesse, and of all diseases and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Matrix, proceeding of a cold and moist
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1905:6"/>
They also cure all diseases of the skin, as Scabs, Itch, old Sores, &amp;c. All which to bee true, wee daily find with admiration, to the exceeding great comfort of many, who with deplored diseases, and most miserable bodies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to these Baths, and are there, by the helpe of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Physicke, and vertue of the Baths, through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Almighty God, recouered to their former health.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Hot Baths hurtfull to hot and drie bodies.</note> But Baths naturally hot (as these our Baths are) to bodies naturally hot and drie, are generally hurtfull; and so much the more, as the body is drier, and the Bath hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it distempereth and consumeth the very habit of the body, and maketh it carrion-like leane.</p>
            <p>Wherfore seeing that these our Baths are not indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to euery constitution and state of body, I doe aduise, that not any one goe into them rashly, or vpon a preposterous iudgement; but that he bee first aduised by some faithfull, iudicious, and expert Physician; and to him expose the state of his body, whereby he may vnderstand, whether or no it may be expedient for him to attempt the same. And whereas there are in Bathe diuers Baths, as I haue shewed; and they differing in their heate, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in their effects, he must also from the learned Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian be directed in which to bathe: neither must he only vnderstand which Bath to vse, as most conuenient for his state of body; but also when and how often to vse the same, and how long to abide therein at a time. Besides this, he must take speciall care, not to goe into the Bath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fit preparation, (which is a grosse error of many) but must be first purged, as his state of body shall require; and be also directed in other things how to order himselfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goe into the Bath,<note place="margin">As not to goe thereinto vpon a full stomake, &amp;c.</note> while he is in the Bath, and after that he is come out of the Bath, and when hee leaueth the Bath: and must also with his bathings and sweating vse such physick-helpes, as may worke with the Baths, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as his disease and present state of body shall require; not relying wholly vpon the vse of the water for his cure, as many ignorantly, and some basely doe, to saue their purse. The neglect of all these, or of some of them, either
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1905:6"/>
through ignorance, or voluntarie wilfulnes, is the cause, that some that take great paines to come to the Baths, are not by them healed of their infirmities, but oftentimes neuer returne to their homes againe; or if they doe, it is most commonly with new diseases, and the old worse then euer they were: whereas of a generous and religious vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, vsing the true helpes of physick with the Baths, are of their diseases perfectly cured.</p>
            <p>Here I may not omit a special reason, why many receiue little benefit by the Baths, but oftentimes much hurt; and that is, because they take not the aide and directions of a Physician present, in the vse of the Bath; but bring their physicke and directions with them from some Physician in the Countrey where they abode; perhaps, one that well vnderstands not their state of body, much lesse the nature and true vse of the Baths. But admit that they haue their directions from an vnderstanding Physician, yet I must tell them, that many accidences fall out oftentimes in bathing, that require the helpe of a present Physician.</p>
            <p>Another speciall reason why many find little good by the Baths, is, because they make not such stay at them, as in regard of their infirmities, or state of body, is meete: for some goe away before the Bath (in regard of a dense habit of body) hath wrought any manner of effect at all on them: others euen then when the Bath begins to shew its force and efficacie on their bodies: and some too soone vpon much benefit receiued: by meanes whereof they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily incurre a relapse. Wherefore my counsell herein vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you is this, that you limit not your stay at the Baths, before you depart from your homes; but in that bee adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and ruled by your Physician, when you are at the Baths, according as hee shall find to bee meete for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and state of body: and thinke not to receiue in foure, fiue, or sixe weekes an absolute cure for an infirmity, which perhaps you haue borne two or three yeeres, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the helpes and meanes you haue vsed for the same in your owne Countrey. Wherefore let your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at the Baths bee, as it shall bee requisite for your state
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1905:7"/>
of body, and limit not the time, no, not to a Spring, or a Fall; for it may bee needfull for you to reside there the whole yeere, it may bee more: for otherwise by your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely departure, you may lose the good that you haue gotten by the Bath, before the time come that you shall thinke to be fit for the vse of the Baths againe.</p>
            <p>But here I know you will obiect against me, saying, Is it good to make vse of your Baths in the Summer and Winter? Are not those times by all learned and iudicious Physicians prohibited for bathing in hot Baths? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon grew the custome of frequenting them in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate seasons of the yeere, namely, in the Spring and Fall?</p>
            <p>Whereunto I answer, and first, that bathing in our Baths in Summer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> taking the coole of the morning for it, if the season shall bee hot and Summer-like, brings much more benefit to the body, the disease being of a cold na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and proceeding from a cold and moist cause (for so you must conceiue me) then in the Spring or Fall, when oftentimes the coldnesse and variablenes of the aire takes away the benefit of your bathing: for cold, or vaporous aire entring into your body after bathing, the pores being open, doth not onely very greatly annoy the spirits, and principall parts, occasion winde and tortures in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but also induce oftentimes irrecouerable effects to the sinewes and ioynts. But if seasons that are constantly warme, be best for bathing in our Baths, and cold times hurtfull, why should any reside at them in the Winter? I answer, That it is good for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are in the way of cure, by reason of their former bathings; and that the waters are in their nature as effectually hot in the winter, as in any other time of the yeere; onely the superficies, or vpper part of the Bath is cooled by the windes. But in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there are some calme dayes, in which the diseased body lying neere to the Baths, may well and safely bathe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any offence or danger in taking of cold after: for hee may keepe himselfe in a warme chamber, hauing nothing else to doe, or take care for, but for his health.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1905:7"/>And heere I cannot but reprehend the error of most people, that at the end of May depart from our Baths, and after that moneth, I know not out of what preiudicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, altogether refraine to come to them, till the Fall: perhaps they doe this, supposing, that after the Spring, till the Fall come againe, the Baths lose their vertue. I must tell them, if this bee their conceit, that they are in a great error; for the waters lose not their vertue at any time, only the disposition of the ambientaire may make them lesse fit to be vsed at one time then at another. But I would haue you to know, and as I haue afore-shewed, that our Baths, may as profitably be vsed in Summer, as in the Spring, and most commonly with farre better successe in the whole moneth of Iune, then in any of the former moneths, and that in regard of the constant temperature of this moneth, and the variable disposition of the moneths preceding. I am perswaded, that this vntimely going from the Baths at the very approach of Summer, hurts many, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes the good they haue receiued by them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my aduertisement herein is this, that they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to the Baths for preuention of sicknesse, or such here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditarie diseases, as they feare will befall them, depart from the Baths about the end of the Spring: but such as goe to them for diseases already fixed, abide there the whole Summer, and longer too, if there shall be occasion.</p>
            <p>And admit that after the moneth of Iune the weather be too feruently hot to bathe in the hotter Baths; yet the Crosse bath, which for heat is the mildest, being, as I haue said, in its nature temperately hot, attaines not to its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and perfection, till the weather be constantly warme, which for the most part happens not till towards the end of May, or the beginning of Iune. The vse of which Bath is of excellent efficacie, not onely in the moneth of Iune, but after also, yea, all the Summer, according as the state of the body, and disposition of the season shal permit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I leaue you to the counsell and direction of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physician resident at the Baths.</p>
            <p>And now also I must aduertise such, as in the declining,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1905:8"/>
or Fall of the yeere, which we call the Autumne, shall for the health of their bodies repaire to our Baths, that they deferre not their comming till the middle of September, or after, as many ignorantly doe; but that they rather bee there shortly after the middle of August, that they may haue time sufficient for bathing, before the aire grow to be too cold, as commonly it is in October, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end thereof. But, perhaps, some out of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant timorousnes will obiect; That to come to the Baths before the Dogge-dayes are gone, or too soone vpon them, is hurtfull? Herein they are more scrupulous, then iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but to yeeld them some satisfaction, I answer; Besides the alteration of seasons from their ancient temperature, in this decrepit age of the world, that though the middle part of the day in the latter part of August shall be hot, yet the mornings and euenings (which are the times for bathing) begin then to be cold, and decline to a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the heate of the day growing on vpon the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, is that which we specially respect for the health of our patients, for whom we approue the vse of the Baths. Wherefore such as for the health of their bodies repaire to our Baths, shall (if they be there in the latter part of August) receiue a double commodity: for first, they shall haue the whole moneth of September very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for bathing, and Physicke also, as shall bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; yea, and part of October, as the disposition of the season shall permit: next, sufficient time for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their homes, before the aire grow too cold, or the weather distempered: for to take cold betwixt the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, or to expose the body to trauell in foule and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate weather, vpon the vse of the Baths, induceth (the pores being open) besides Feuerous distemperatures and ventosities, oftentimes very great and dolorous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Braine, Brest, Sinewes and Ioynts.</p>
            <p>I may not let passe how certaine accidences now and then befall some in their bathing; as weakenes and subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the stomake, faintnes, and sometimes swounings; and these the Physician must take speciall care to preuent,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1905:8"/>
which maybe occasioned by meanes of the Sulphurous vapours of the Bath: yet I must tell you, that these, or the like accidences our Baths doe seldome occasion, especially the crosse Bath, but in them that are weake by Nature, that are subiect to swouning, or goe into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preposterous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without fit preparation and direction. And the reason is, because our Baths being large, &amp; hauing not sulphur in them, not in the cauities neere adioyning, the vapours are the lesse noysome, not so grosse and adusted; and therefore not quickly offensiue, but to them that are very weake by nature, or as I haue said, goe into them without fit prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or make longer stay in them then is meete.</p>
            <p>And heere I cannot but lay open Baths Technologie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baths Technolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie with them that resort to those Baths.</hi>
               </note> with such as for the health of their bodies resort to those Baths, wherein I am sure to gaine little thanke. But I passe not for it, my purpose being to discharge a good conscience, and to doe my Countrie good. The thing therefore that I would haue you to take notice of, is, how the people of that place that keep houses of receit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bathe being a place, in regard of the Baths, that many resort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for cure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that cannot receiue helpe elsewhere; it were to bee wished, that Empericks, and all other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they be, being not Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Physick, were vtterly prohibited to practise in the City, or neere to the consines thereof,</hi> idque sub poena gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uissima.</note> and their Agents (for such they haue in euery corner of the streets, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come to the Gates) presse vpon you, importuning you to take your lodging at such &amp; such an house, neere to such and such a Bath, extolling the Baths neere which they dwell, aboue the rest, respecting altogether their owne gaine, not your good or welfare. And when they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you into their houses, they will be ready to fit you with a Physician (perhaps an Emprick or vpstart Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, magnifying him for the best Physician in the Towne) that wil not crosse them in remouing you to another Bath, though the Bath neere which you are placed, be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to your infirmities and state of body, or at least, not so conuenient as some other. And this is also a special reason, why many oftentimes receiue rather hurt then good by the vse of the Baths.</p>
            <p>My counsell therefore to the learned Physicians shall be this, that they so tender the good of their Patients, and their owne worth and reputation, as that for base gaine they subiect not themselues to these kind of people, in hope
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1905:9"/>
to get Patients by their means; and to the Patients, that they fall not by any meanes into the hands of Empericks, who, by their ill qualified Physicke, will spoile their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and by reason of their pragmaticall nature, perswade and put them to vnnecessary and preposterous courses, which cannot but produce disastrous effects.</p>
            <p>But seeing that no calling is more disgraced, then by the men of the same calling, I wish all professors of Physicke to carrie themselues worthy of their calling, to be faithfull and honest in their courses, not to insinuate with any, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of our Bath-guides, presse vpon them to be retained. If an Empericke or Mountibanke seeke about for work, I blame them not; let them deceiue those who wil be deceiued; but for such as are graduated in the noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Physicke to doe so, it is Fiddler-like: a note, if not of some vnworthines in them, I am sure, of a base mind. Let those therefore that are Physicians indeed, striue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the reputation of their Art, and not by a base insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting carriage, or Mountibank-like tricks, to get a note and repute, vilifie their owne worth, or disgrace so noble a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.</p>
            <p>But to draw to an end, when you shal for your health re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the Baths, be cautelous, and suffer not your selfe to be taken vp by such as will presse vpon you; but rest your selfe at your Inne, and be well aduised by a Physician that knowes the nature and vse of the Baths, and can well iudge of your infirmities and state of body, what Bath shall be fitting for your vse, and then vp your lodging accordingly: which course if it were obserued, and the Physician carefully and learnedly performe his part, I am perswaded that many mo then now doe, would, for their infirmities, finde remedie at the Baths, to the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the place, and that scarcely any would depart thence, but much eased and bettered in their state of body.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fitting to aduise and publish, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature and vse of our Baths, and the rather, that such as preposterously vse them, as the greater part, I suppose, doe, that resort vnto them, may not erroniously
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1905:9"/>
detract from the admirable vertues of them: for vnto vs it doth yeerely appeare, by the miraculous effects they worke, of what excellent efficacie they are, if they be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and iudiciously vsed. And seeing that in the true vse of them, there are many things to be considered; I doe therefore againe aduise all such as are respectiue of their health, that they enterprize not the vse of them, without the counsell and direction of some honest and learned Physician resident at the Baths: which if they doe, the <hi>incommodum</hi> may be <hi>maius commodo.</hi> And so I conclude this Treatise.</p>

            <head>AN ADVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISEMENT OF THE GREAT VTILITIE THAT COMMETH to mans body, by the taking of Physick in the Spring, inferred vpon the insuing Question.</head>
            <p>The Spring being the most reuiuing, flourishing, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate season of the yeere; whence is it, that sicknesses are more frequent in the same, and people sooner dye therein, then in any other season?</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here may bee two reasons yeelded for the same: the one taken from the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preceding, which, by reason of its moisture, filleth the body with crude and excrementall humors, and by its coldnesse, thickning, and compacting the same, quieteth them from fluxion. But the heate of the Spring approaching, and working on those humors, rarifieth and dissolueth them; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fluctuating and putrifying in the body, are the cause of sicknesse, vnlesse they are expulsed by the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or timely helpe of Physicke.</p>
            <p>The other reason may be taken from the inconstancie of the Spring it selfe, which sometimes is cold, sometimes hot, sometimes moist, and sometimes drie: which sudden alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations cannot but produce feuerous distemperatures, and other infirmities, according to the disposition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter congested in the body, the Winter preceding. From which it may be concluded, that the sicknesses and death
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1905:10"/>
of people, which happen more frequently in the Spring, then in any other season of the yeere, are not so much to be attributed to the Spring, as to the Winter which hath filled the body with superfluities, and prepared it for sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Wherefore whosoeuer will bee so prouident,<note place="margin">The vtilitie of Physick taken in the Spring.</note> as by the timely helpe of Physicke, to free his body, as his state and constitution shall require, of the superfluities congested in it by meanes of the winter going before, he shall be sure to be farre more liuely, healthy, and free from sicknesse in the Spring, then in any other season of the yeere, so as he erre not ouermuch in other things. And this purging of the body, and purifying of the bloud in the Spring, will not onely preserue from sicknesses that commonly raigne in the Spring; but also be a meanes to keepe the body in a perfect integrity the whole yeere after: and therefore I commend the taking of Physicke in the Spring to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, to them that leade a geniall sedentary kinde of life, especially to such as are subiect to obstructions or any yeerely disease.</p>
            <p>You may here demand of me,<note place="margin">What time of the Springbest for Physicke.</note> what time of the Spring is fittest for Physicke by way of preuention? I answer, that for them that are wont to bee affected with sickenesse in the Spring, and whose humors are too cholericke and thinne, and consequently subiect to fluxion, it is best to take Physicke at the very beginning thereof; but for others, about the middle, or after, especially if the precedent time shall be cold, and not Spring-like.</p>
            <p>You may also here demand of me,<note place="margin">Whether it be so requisit to take Physicke in the Fall, as in the Spring.</note> whether it be not so necessary to take Physick in the Autumne, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call the Fall, as in the Spring? Whereunto, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of a generality, I must answer no: because the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer prepareth not the body for sicknesse, filling it with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, as doth the Winter; yet for some bodies it is, as for them that naturally abound with crude and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke humors, that are subiect to obstructions, to cold winterly diseases, or any melancholicke affects, as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1905:11"/>
to take Physicke by way of preuention in the Fall, as in the Spring; and that for auoiding the superfluities before the Winter, for opening the obstructions, and freeing the body of superfluous melancholy, which then, by reason of the season encreaseth. And the fittest time for the doing thereof, for such as are subiect to melancholy and Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diseases, is soone after the beginning of the Fall; but for others, towards the middle thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Aduertisement to beware of Empericks.</note>But here I must aduertise you that you expose not your body to the vnlearned Empericke, that can neither finde out the peccant humors, nor parts affected; but to such as are learned in that Art, that can well iudge of your state of body, and accordingly prescribe you remedies, as your constitution and affected parts shall require. Many men thinke, yea some of a generous note, wherein they bewray their carelesnesse, if not their stupiditie to, that whilst they are in health, they may for preuention, take Physicke from any one, it matters not from whom it bee, nor what Physicke it bee, so it worke with them. I must tell you that many ouerthrow their bodies hereby, and that there is no lesse art and iudgement required for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the body in health, then for curing of it being sicke, if they did but know how the foure humors are or ought to be proportioned in their bodies, for enioying according to their constitutions a sound and healthy state, they would, I am perswaded, be more cautelous then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues into the hands of the vnlearned, who, by their inconsiderate courses, take humors from them at an aduenture, so well those which are not offensiue, as those which are, to the vtter subuersion of the Oeconomie of the body: whereof though, perhaps, in regard of their strengths, they are not by and by sensible, which is that which onely cloaketh the errors of Empericks, and as a vaile, masketh many mens eies and vnderstanding herein: yet they will, as I haue in diuers obserued to their perill, by little and little incurre a lapsed state of body.</p>
            <p>It is strange to see the ignorance of most people, how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1905:11"/>
backward they are to giue to the learned Professors of Physicke their due, ready to lay scandals vpon them; but forward to magnifie Empericks, their Physicke, their honesty, their care, willing to excuse and passe ouer their grosse slips and absurdities. <hi>O mira hominum stupiditas!</hi> But proceeds this altogether out of ignorance? I suppose no: for doubtlesse many seeke vnto them, and magnifie their Physicke, because it is cheape: but such are fooles and Gulles indeed, for they wrong, and euen poyson their bodies with grosse and ill-qualified Physicke, to saue their purse.</p>
            <p>But to answer the reasons, or rather the words which they produce and alledge in the fauour and behalfe of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericks: To what purpose is the working of that Physicke which respecteth not the peccant humors nor parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but to the ouerthrow of the body? What is a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed honesty in a Physicion without learning, but a snare wherein the ignorant doe voluntarily entrap themselues? I say supposed: for I cannot thinke that man to be honest, that vsurps a calling, which with a good conscience he is not able to discharge. Or to what purpose is the care that Empericks take about their preposterous and ill-composed medicines, but to the vtter ruine of the patients body, as it too too vnluckely happened of late to a Gentleman of good worth and note, who taking Physicke by way of preuention of a Pil-boasting Surgeon, in a short space, by his ill-qualified and preposterous Physicke, incurred an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable and mortall lapse of his stomacke and Liuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his constant age and perfect strength of body. Vaine therefore and very absurd is that conceit, which many haue in fauour of Empericks, <hi>viz. If they doe no good, they will doe no harme.</hi> Admit that sometimes by their triuiall pettie medicines, they doe no harme; yet neuerthelesse for that, I must tell you that they doe much harme: for the sicke body relying vpon their skill, and they being not able to direct and execute such courses as shall be fitting and effectuall to impugne the disease, while there is time
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1905:12"/>
fitting for the same, the sicknesse gets the masterie, and then (perhaps) when the strengths are too much weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the disease become incureable, they seeke helpe of the learned Physician. So basely verily are most of our people affected to their health, that vntill some practicall Minister, Parish Clarke, Apothecary, Chirurgeon or the like, haue done their vtmost hurt, they seeke not to the Physician.</p>
            <p>And here to vindicate our Art from calumnie, I cannot but taxe the most sort of people, that being affected with any great or difficult disease, which by reason of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, or contumacy of the peccant humors, will haue such progresse, as that it cannot in a short time, by the medicines and best endeuors of the learned Physician, how forceable so euer, be euicted, will reiect their Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and betake themselues, which is an absurdity, <hi>super omnem absurditatem,</hi> to some ignorant sottish Empericke, and euery good wiues medicine, to their great hurt, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes vtter ouerthrow. But if it happen, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer thereupon, they lay an imputation vpon the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and grace their Emperick with the cure; whereas in very deede the matter of their disease was wholy, or at least the greatest part therof, eradicated by such fit and powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as the learned Physician had formerly administred vnto them: wherevpon the residue of the cure was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the force of Nature, not by the weake endeuors of the Empericke, or triuiall medicines of any other whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>I haue of purpose enlarged this Aduertisement, and doe leaue it for a memoriall and Caueat to all posteritie, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Gentlemen of this our age, who, for the most part of them, very greatly wrong their iudgements and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, in taking Physicke of the vnlearned; and wherein they doe not only wrong themselues, but also giue occasion of hurt vnto others: for the meaner sort of people following their example, do the like, whereby it comes to passe, that in all likely-hood, more vntimely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1905:12"/>

is, because it can hardly, or not at all in the taste bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, but by a curious and skilfull pallate for the purpose, I suppose that this water partakes of other good minerals: but I leaue that for a farther search, or to such, as shall hereafter liue more conueniently for that purpose, then I doe. But whatsoeuer minerals shall lie hid in the passages of this water, it is sufficient, that it partakes of two so good as Sulphur and Niter, and that in such a mixture, as it makes it to be of an excellent temper, and medicinable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in potable vses for diuers cases, as shall be hereafter shewed. It were to be wished, that the water issued forth in a more conuenient place, aswell for accesse vnto it, as for conseruing the heate thereof.</p>
            <p>This water is frequented for no other vse, but for the drinking of it against the Stone: it hath also other excellent faculties; but I suppose (such is the vanity of our time) that the fame thereof wil not long hold, but wil in a short time haue an end, as some other waters of good force and efficacy against sundry infirmities, in diuers places of this kingdome haue had, and that by reason of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdand preposterous vse of it: for vpon notice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that this water hath done some good against the Stone, people of all sorts repaire vnto it, so wel such as haue not the stone, as those that haue, or stand in feare thereof, and abundantly glut and fill themselues therewith, till they vomit and strout againe, scarcely one of fifty, I dare say, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the opinion of a iudicious Physician for the taking of the same, or preparing their bodies for it as is meete; which cannot but bring a disgrace to the water: for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that a few chance to receiue benefit thereby, some will not,<note place="margin">The hurst that are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by the vnaduised vse of the Water.</note> but many much hurt. Neither can the water be good for all bodies that are troubled with the Stone, or subiect thereunto: and therefore I would haue you to know, that the ill and preposterous vse thereof will weaken the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, subuert the liuer, annoy the head and brest, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cramps, paine in the ioynts, breed crudities, rheumes, Coughs, Cachexies, the Dropsie it selfe and Consumption.</p>
            <p>But I will proceed to shew you the faculties and true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1905:14"/>
vse of the water. It notably cooleth the inflammations of all the inward parts, and yet, as I haue said, not quickly offending the stomacke, as other Waters doe; and it is withall of a gentle mundifying facultie.<note place="margin">The Vertue and Faculties of the Water.</note> It is therefore very effectuall against the burning heate of the stomacke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the liuer and reines, and adustion of the humors, being taken with fine Sugar in this proportion, as halfe an ounce of Sugar or thereabout to a pinte of the Water. In such as haue had hot liuers, red pimpling faces, and adusted humors, I haue caused a Tincture of Roses and Violets to be taken therewith, and that with singular suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. It may be giuen with other good conuenient Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts, which will not onely make it the more gratefull to the stomacke, but also more effectuall for the cases afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, which I leaue to the Physician to finde out, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect as shall be best fitting for his patients body. In inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and siccity of the intestines, it is good to giue with this Water, syrrup or <hi>mel Viol. Sol.</hi> In inflammation of the kidneys with obstruction also in them, I haue giuen it to such as had withall hot liuers, with <hi>Chrystallo minerali,</hi> with wished effect: for the distemper of the kidneys was not onely quickly allayed therewith, but also abundance of sand and other drossie matter stopping in them purged forth.</p>
            <p>That this Water is good against the Stone, Strangury, and purulent vlcers of the kidneys and bladder, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by reason of its mundifying and clensing faculty, to be taken with Sugar as aforesaid, or with some good and effectuall Adiunct, for the speedier carriage of it to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected places, &amp;c. which by reason of the diuersity of bodies, I cannot here describe, but must leaue you therein to the aduice and counsell, not of a vulgar, but of some learned iudicious expert Physician, and that with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if you bee not sure of the accurate iudgement and skill of your Physician, that you take the Water onely with Sugar, without any other mixture with it. This Water is also good in the vlcerations of the intestines, with this Prouiso, that it be taken with some conuenient Adiunct, as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1905:14"/>
               <hi>Mel Rosat.</hi> &amp;c. to occasion the passage thereof thorow the belly, diuerting it from the veines.</p>
            <p>As concerning the vse of this Water,<note place="margin">The vse of the Water for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</note> and first, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inflamations: The time of the yeere best for taking thereof by way of cure or preuention, is in the moneths of April, May, and Iune, and that in the morning fasting, the body being first prepared thereunto, that is, gently purged, according as the constitution thereof shall require; but in case of necessity, it may be taken at any other time, respect being had of the season, age, and present state of the body. As for the quantity that is to be taken euery morning, and how long to be continued, in that, because of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity of bodies, I must leaue you to the discretion and iudgement of your Physician.</p>
            <p>As for the taking of this Water against the Stone,<note place="margin">Tenne Rules to be obserued in taking of the Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Stone.</note> tenne Rules are to be obserued in the vse thereof. The first is the preparation of the body, that is, that it be exquisitely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, before you attempt the vse thereof: for the passages being cleared, and the ill matter diuerted by Stoole, the Water will the more freely, and with greater force pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate vnto the reines. The second is, that it be taken in the morning fasting, the excrements of the belly being first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and that at diuers draughts, allowing betwixt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry draught or two draughts taken the one after the other, the space of a quarter of an houre, or some what more, till you haue taken the whole portion of Water that is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be taken each morning, walking and stirring gently your body betweene euery taking: for that will cause the Water to be the sooner distributed thorow your body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining to goe abroad in the aire betweene and vpon the takings thereof, if the weather shall be any thing cold; for cold will hinder the distribution of the Water.</p>
            <p>The third is, the quantity of the Water that is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken euery morning, which must be directed by your Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician that knowes your age and state of body. The fourth is, how many mornings together it is to be taken, as eight or tenne more or lesse, according to the abilitie of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, strenghts and state of body, wherein you must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1905:15"/>
be directed by your Physician.</p>
            <p>The fift thing to be obserued in the taking of the Water, is, to take it so neere as you can, in the same temper of heate as it issueth forth, or else so hot as you shall be well able to drinke it: and herein euery one may gratifie his owne stomacke. But seeing that the place is vnfit for the taking of it, and that the Water seems, by reason of the rawishnesse of the place, to be colder at its issuing forth then it is otherwise: for being taken into a stone Iugge, it warmeth the same; I aduise that the water bee taken into stone Iugges, or other conuenient bottles, and the Iugges or bottles to bee immediately stopped, to keepe in the vapours, and so the water to be taken while it reserueth its heate; but if the water shall waxe cold before you take it, you may heate the Iugge in a ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of hot water, till it shall bee so hot as you shall like to take it, keeping the Iugge close stopped all the while: and so you may doe such mornings when you cannot haue the water, it being all ouercouered by that part of the Seuerne that floweth to the Cittie. If you demand of me, whether the water loseth any thing of its vertue, being so kept? I must answer you, that it is likely that it loseth somewhat, of its sulphurous, but not any thing of its introus qualitie, and therefore it may be well referued, and vsed in manner as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>The sixth is the time of the yeere that is best for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Water, and that is, in a season that is not cold, or rainy; but hot, or inclining therevnto, as from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of May, to the middle of September; but after that, in regard of the alterations of the aire, and Winter approaching, this Water is not good to be taken, because it will weaken the stomacke and liuer, annoy the brest, breede crudities, Coughs, &amp;c, as I haue already shewed.</p>
            <p>The seuenth is the diet, that is to be obserued all the time of the taking of the Water, which is, that it must bee but slender, and that of meats of good iuice, and easie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, the dinner not to be taken, till the greater part of the Water be auoided, and the supper must be alwaies
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1905:15"/>
lesse then the dinner, that the Stomacke may be the next morning emptie for receiuing of the Water againe.</p>
            <p>The eight is, that the body be purged immediately after the taking of the Water, that is, when an end is made of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, for auoiding some reliques thereof, which perhaps may abide in the body after the vse of it, which the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian must be carefull to do with a fit medicine. Afterwards a moderation in diet and all other things is to be obserued.</p>
            <p>The ninth is, that it be not giuen to children that are subiect to the Stone, vnder twelue yeeres of age, vnlesse they shall be naturally of a very hot constitution, and that, to them in quantities proportionable to their age. Neither is it to be admitted to them, that are entered within the limits of old age, because it will abbreuiate their life, <hi>calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem innatum extinguendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth and last thing to be considered in the vse of this Water,<note place="margin">For what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies the vse of the Water not conuenient, but hurtfull.</note> is, that it be not giuen to such, as by reason of the smalnesse and streightnesse of their veines, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate and passe it away by vrine, though the infirmities of the Stone, Stranguries, &amp;c. may otherwise require the vse thereof. Neither is to be giuen to such, as haue cold sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, weake liuers, feeble braines, and subiect vnto Rheumes; in a word, not to phlegmaticke, not to any that abound with crudities, or haue a cold and moist habit of body: for in all such it will soone infringe the naturall heate, breed Rheumes, annoy the brest, occasion Cramps, and diuers other infirmities, as I haue afore shewed.</p>
            <p>The same obseruations must be kept in taking of this Water against the Strangurie and vlcerations of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and kidneys, as is directed in taking thereof against the Stone. In which affects it is good to giue therewith some lubrifying, cleansing extract, or the like. And heere note, that if the Water in all the aforesaid cases be giuen with a fit and conuenient Adiunct, it will not onely be the more effectuall, and sooner conueied to the affected parts, but lesse quantities also may serue to be taken; and then the stomacke will not be so ouerprest and charged therewith, as it is in the common manner of taking it. But if it bee at
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1905:16"/>
any time fit to ouercharge and presse the stomacke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it is in cases of the Strangurie and purulent-vlcers of the bladder and kidneys.</p>
            <p>I may not omit to giue you notice, that diuers symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes or perillous accidences may happen oftentimes in the vse of this Water, which, because they cannot be well rectified or preuented without the presence of a Physician, I here omit to nominate or treat of, and in stead thereof, as also for diuers reasons afore nominated, doe aduise you not to aduenture the drinking thereof, without the aduice and presence of a iudicious Physician; which if you doe, you may haply in stead of the good you expect thereby, receiue much hurt. As for outward vses, this Water may sometime asswage the Itch, mundifie and palliat old Sores; but no matter of moment is to be expected from it this way. And thus much concerning the nature and vse of this Water, whose Vertues will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne, if people make a right and good vse thereof.</p>
