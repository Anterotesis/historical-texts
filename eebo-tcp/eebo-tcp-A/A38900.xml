            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Goods and Riches of the World are in our eye, but alſo when one luſteth after diſhoneſt and unchaſt Delights: This Corruption it is that bringeth forth UUhoredoms, Adultries, Thefts, Cheats, and many other Sins, whereout ſprings forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times Floods of Miſchiefs, as may more fully appear in the Relation of a moſt notorious woman, which here followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January the 16th. 1672. Mary Carlton the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princeſſe,</hi> was brought from the <hi>Marſhallſes</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> to take her Tryal in the <hi>Old-Bailey,</hi> in Mr. <hi>John Lowmans</hi> Coach, where at her firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; The Iudge examined her if ſhe were the ſame woman that went by the name of <hi>Mary Carlton,</hi> that was not long ſince Baniſhed this Kingdom: To which ſhe anſwered, ſhe was the ſame perſon; the Iudge demanded the reaſon of her Return: To which ſhe anſwered that ſhe had ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that troubled her Conſcince about Treachery which ſhe had a great deſire to diſcover, and till ſhe had made it known to the Government, ſhe could not be at quiet; and upon that account ſhe thus tranſgreſſed the Law of her being Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, only to make thoſe things known which lay ſo much upon her, till ſhe had made a diſcovery of it: The Iudge demanded of her to declare thoſe things to the Court: To which ſhe anſwered it was not convenient to diſcover what ſhe had to ſay in ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a place, and therefore ſhe deſired time; the which was granted betwixt that and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make her Diſcovery; the which was to be the 17 day, which being come, ſhe was brought from New-gate to the Seſſions-Houſe in the <hi>Old-Bailey;</hi> and there called to appear at the Bar, where was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62603:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Indictment exhibited againſt her by a Taylor in <hi>Chancery Lane;</hi> for ſtealing a Silver Tankerd and ſome other pieces of Plate, to the which ſhe pleaded ſhe never Lodged in the houſe in all her life; but after ſpeaking with the Miſtriſs and others, that loſt thoſe things, ſhe ſaid you may proſecute the Law againſt me, and you will loſe all, which if you do not proſecute, you may have your Plate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Another in <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet,</hi> brought an Indictement againſt her likewiſe for ſtealing Plate and ſeveral other Indictements brought againſt her, for many Robberies, and other Cheats ſhe hath committed ſince ſhe came over; but all theſe did her no harm y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Iudge inſiſted only upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her coming over, notwithſtanding her Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for which ſhe is Condemned to be Hang'd: Before Sentence ſhe Pleaded her Belly; upon which twelve Gentlewomen were pickt out to find whether ſhe was with Child or not; they brought in their Uerdict that ſhe was not with Child.</p>
            <p>One thing I had like to have omitted, which is this, on <hi>Fryday January</hi> 17. 'twas ordered by the Court at the Seſſions Houſe, that two or three of that Honourable Court ſhould go to New-gate, to enquire of the Princeſs what that Trechery was that ſhe was not willing to diſcover before the whole Court, withal telling her, that if ſhe impeatch any oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, it would make the better for her ſelf; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to diſcover any others, but the Tretchery ſhe told them was thus, When ſhe was baniſhed, there was 25. others baniſhed with her, and when they came out at Sea, theſe 25. agréed altogether with her to murther the Maſter and all that were in the Ship, and to have the Ship and Goods to what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62603:4"/>
Countrey they pleaſed; and they had further agréed that notwithſtanding there were 25. of them, ſhe ſhould have the third ſhare of what the Ship and Goods were worth; this ſhe ſaid ſhe diſcovered to the Maſter, upon which he made to the next Port, and when he came there he got ſome help, and put them all in Irons; ſometime after they all arrived in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> when they were there, ſhe was ſo much in favour with the Maſter of the Ship and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> for the Tretchery ſhe had diſcovered, that ſhe was ſet at liberty to go where ſhe pleaſed, but while ſhe was there, the Countrey not agréeing with her, ſhe had a fit of Sickneſs, all which time ſhe had two Doctors ordered to wait upon her, when ſhe was a little recovered, ſhe, as ſhe ſaid, truſted ſo much to the Kings Mercy for the good ſhe had done in ſaving t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e whole Ships Company alive, that ſhe ventured to came over again in that very Ship that carried her.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now acquaint you with one ſtory more of this infamous Princeſs, which was the laſt of her pranks, juſt before her laſt taking; the ſtory is thus, ſhe took a Lodging in St. <hi>James</hi> at Mr. <hi>Aſpinals,</hi> one of the Kings Watchmakers, ſhe told him that the raſt of her Family was in few days to follow, which were ſixtéen more, for all which ſhe had Lodging pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, after ſhe had béen there a night or two, ſhe complained to Mr. <hi>Aſpinal</hi> that the knocking about his Trad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> did ſomewhat diſturb her, he gave her a Complement, telling her that he ſhould avoid giving her any diſturbance as much as might be; then ſhe began to commend the ingenuity of his trade, which ſhe did very highly, withal telling him what a rare Watch her Father had made triangular ways (but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62603:4"/>
ſhe did not ſay a word of his being a poor Fidler in <hi>Canterbury)</hi> and how that ſhe deſired to have ſuch a one us that, he told her that was an old faſhion and he had none of them, but any ſorts that were now in faſhion he had, upon which ſhe deſired to ſée what rare Watches he had, then he had her into his Shop and into his Chamber where his Watches were, and let her take her view, ſhe was very well pleaſed with what ſhe had ſéen, and beſpoke a Watch for her ſelf; a day or two after this ſhe invites her Land-Lord and Land-Lady to ſée a rare Play, which was to be Acted that day at the Dukes Play-houſe, which after ſome intreaty they excepted of, when they had ſéen the Play the Princeſs invited them to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, telling them that ſhe would give them a treat there, for that now ſhe was at liberty, but after her Family came to Town, ſhe muſt keep more at home to look after them: to be brief; ſhe got them to the Tavern, and there called for Wine and Oyſters plenty, when ſhe had kept them there ſo long that they were not willing to ſtay any longer; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs her Maid comes in and ſpeaks to her, after which the Princeſs tells her Landlord and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady that Oyſters were not enough to ſatisfie her, ſhe muſt have a Neats Tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, or ſome other thing that was good to eat after Oyſters, and that ſhe would go down to the People of the Houſe and ſee what they had, her Landlady deſired her not to give herſelf that trouble, but rather to ſend for the Man of the Houſe and ſpeak to him, ſhe anſwered that would not do ſo well, for there were thirty perſons that were to dine with her there the next day, and ſhe muſt give order to the Miſtreſs of the Houſe what to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, ſo down ſhe went, but coming up nomore; when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62603:5"/>
ſhe had been a prity while, her Landlord called to the people of the Houſe, to know what was become of her, they told him that they knew her not, nor where ſhe was gone, ſo in ſhort, her Landlord was leſt to pay the long Reckoning, and to go home to ſeek his Tenant, when he came at home ſhe was not there nor her Maid, he had left at home only his maid and the Princeſs her maid, he inquired who had been there, his maid told him only two Gentlewomen to inquire for his Lodger, and that ſhe told them that ſhe was gone to ſee a Play, how long ſince, ſaid the Gentlewomen, about an hour replyed the maid, when do you think ſhe will be back, ſaid they, about two hours. UUell ſaid the Gentlewomen, we muſt ſpeak with her this night, ſhow us into her Chamber and we will ſtay there till ſhe comes, the maid ſhowed them into her Chamber; then they deſired a Bottle of Wine to be fetched, which the maid did, but ſhe ſtayed not long enough as it ſeems for them to finiſh their works, ſo they taſted the Wine, and ſaid it was ſo bad they could not drink it, then they ſent the maid to another Tavern further off, where they ſaid they were ſure was that which was good, the maid went, and before ſhe came back again they had ſo far finiſhed their work, that as it appeared preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; when Mr. <hi>Aſpinal</hi> came to look for his Watches they had taken away twenty five, ſix of which were gold, and ſome money, in all to the value of near 700 pound; Note that when this work was done the Princeſs maid went to the Tavern to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which made her ſteal away from her Landlord and Landlady.</p>
