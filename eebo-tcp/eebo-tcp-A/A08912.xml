            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is said also that the Bay tree is neuer strooke with Thunder,<note place="margin">What things are preserued from the force of Thunder.</note> and therefore in times past, and is at this day taken for a victorie. Wherefore the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> fearing Thunder exceedingly aboue all other things, caused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be crowned with a wreath of Bayes, at the least sound he heared in the Ayre.<note place="margin">

For the Thunder may be dissipated by the ringing of Bels,<note place="margin">Artillery dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth away Thunder.</note> the sound of Basons, or by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of Ordinance: For the concussion of the clouds meeting together violently, causeth the Thunder: and by the aforesaid agitation of the Ayre; they are discipated and dispersed.

For in Winter the Aire is very thicke, as also the cloudes; and therefore those exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the earth are easily dispersed and distinguished, being of themselues but cold and glaciall. From thence it commeth to passe that the country of Scithia, and other cold countries thereabouts, as Tartary, Liuonia, Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia, Russia, &amp; other neighbor countries are exempt from Thunder, as to the contrary, Egypt is seldom endamaged by Thunder, by reason of the great heat in those part. For the exhalations and vapours of the earth, which are hot and drie: are conuerted through their vehement heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to small cloudes, which haue no force, as saith <hi>Pliny.</hi> But as the inuention,<note place="margin">

Thunder for the most part hath but one blow, but one bolt, and neuer killeth but one man at a time. But Artillery at one blow will massacre an hundred men. The Thunderbolt oftentimes, as being a naturall thing, falleth as it happeneth, sometimes on a rocke, sometimes on a mountaine, sometimes on a Tower, seldome on a man. But the Artillery,<note place="margin">Designe and end of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> being guided by the wicked dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie of man, coueteth nothing but man, hath quarrell to none but man, him alone hee slayeth, him alone hee chooseth among a thousand other things.

To this castle my Lord the <hi>Constable</hi> drew his forces, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would make his way cleere before him. It is situate vpon a little Mountaine, which giueth great assurance to those within, that there can bee no Ordinance planted against it to batter it down.

Their answere being vnderstoode, the same night there was mounted two great Cannons, by the force of armes with ropes and cordes, by the Switzers, where (as mis-fortune would) those can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons being planted, a Gunner by indiscretion fired a barrell of Gun-pouder, wherewith hee himselfe was extreamely burned, together with tenne or twelue souldiers.

            <p>The morrow after, very early we began the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and in few houres after the breach was made; which those of the castle perceiuing, desired a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, but it was too late; for in the mean time some of our footmen perceiuing them to be astonished,

mounted the Breach, and entred the castle, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euery man to the sword, except onely a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beautifull <hi>Piedmontese,</hi> which a great Lorde entertained into his seruice. The Captaine and Ancient were taken aliue, but were presently after hanged on the gate of the Towne, to terrifie the rest of the Emperors souldiers, not to be so foole-hardy to hold such places against so great an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Now the soldiers of the castle seeing our men rushing in vpon them in such great furie, made all the resistance they could to defend themselues, in killing and wounding a great number of our soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with their Pikes and Muskets; where the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians had a great deale of work cut out to their hands.</p>
            <p>I was at that time but a yong Chirurgian,<note place="margin">The Author entereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and but little experienced in the Art, because I neuer (as yet) had seene the curation of any Woundes made by Gunne-shot.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:968:11"/>
Oyle as hot as possibly they could suffer it, vvith Tents and Setons: wherefore, I became embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do as they did.

            <p>When we entred <hi>Thurin,</hi> I was told of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgian who was exceeding famous, especially for his curing wounds made by Gun-shot, with whom I found the meanes to acquaint my selfe: yet it was neere two yeeres and a halfe before hee would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with his Medicine which hee called his Balme.

He sent me to fetch him two yong whelpes, one pound of earth-wormes, two pounds of the oyle of Lillies, six ounces of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebinth of Venice, and one ounce of Aqua-vitae: and in my presence he boiled the whelpes aliue in the saide Oyle, vntill the flesh departed from the bones.

And I did protest moreouer to the said <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius,</hi> that I haue found those woundes as easie to cure (being in fleshy parts) as all other great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tused wounds are.

other instruments, yea, though they were but in fleshy parts.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the aforesaide accidents doe not proeeede from the venenosity which is in the powder, or by the combustion or burning of the Bullet. For proofe whereof,<note place="margin">History.</note> I will alledge this obseruation which I haue experimented not long since on the person of the Earle of <hi>Courdon,</hi> Lord of <hi>Achindon,</hi> a Scottishman, whome I cured by the commandement of the Queene-mother, who was hurt with the shot of a Pistoll cleane through both the Thighes, without fracture of the bones; he standing so neere the mouth of the Pistoll, that the fire tooke hold of his breeches; neuerthelesse, hee was perfectly cured in two and thirty dayes, without a Feauer or any other euill accident.

Also of a Thatcht house set on fire with a Musket shot. Moreouer, because that such woundes which are made by Gun-shot, we commonly beholde their Orifices and other circumiacent parts so black, as if an actuall Cauter had passed thereon. As also the fall of a certaine escarre, as they say. Al which arguments are so ill framed, that they deserue no authority being built on so slender a foundation: much lesse that the resolution of your demaund
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:968:16"/>
should be taken from them, as I trust to giue you plainely to vnderstand in the disputation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The which (after I had seene a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those woundes, and diligently obserued them, handling them according to the Method) I haue collected from the ancient Philosophers, Physitians,<note place="margin">The prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now to enter into the matter proposed, and to answer the arguments before alledged, we are first to examine whether there be any poison inclosed in the powder, or no: And if there be, whether it may infect by meanes of the pretended poyson thereof. Which that it may appeare plainly, wee must search into the composition of the said pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; considering that it is not of substance simple, but compound: and so by examining the nature of such Simple which enter into the composition thereof; I meane their qualities, effects, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, wee shall the sooner attaine to the scope and intention pretended.</p>
            <p>As for the Simples, it is a most assured thing that there are but three in al which make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position thereof,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the powder.</note> that is to say, Coales of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or Birch, Sulphure, and Salt-peter, &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Aqua-vitae: the which ingredients seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, are altogether exempt &amp; free from poison, or any venomous quality. And first for the coales, there is not any thing considerable in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:968:16"/>
them, vnlesse it be a drying quality, of subtle sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by meanes whereof it is apt to take fire, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as a Linnen cloth burnt into Tinder doth the sparkes that fall from a Flint stone. Sulphure is hot and dry, neuerthelesse not excessiue, and of a more oyly and viscuous substance, yet not so easie to inflame as coales, although it doth retaine the fire more forcibly when it is once inflamed, &amp; is very hardly extinguished. As for the Salt-peter, it is such,<note place="margin">Salt-peter is salt of stones.</note> that many make vse thereof insteede of salt. Now let vs examine whether there be any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenosity in the nature of these Simples, namely, in that of Sulphure, which is the most suspected. <hi>Dioscorides</hi> in his fift Booke, chap. 37. prescribeth it to be taken in an Egge, in the astmaticke passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, coughes, and to such which spit matter, and those that haue the Iaundise. And <hi>Galen</hi> in the 9. Book of his Simples, <hi>Cap.</hi> 36. ordaineth it as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall remedy, vnto such who are bitten with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous beasts; and in all malignant practises or itchings; as for the Aquavitae, it is a thing so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that it will euaporate if it be set in the aire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it is vsed by most Chirurgians inwardlie in drinkes, and outwardly in embrocations as a most singular Medicines. These thinges considered, makes me to affirme, that the whole composition of pouder is altogether free from venome or poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, seeing that the ingredients are altogether cleere from the least touch in that kinde. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I haue obserued it to bee the practise of the Hollanders being wounded by Gun-shot, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:968:17"/>
two charges of pouder in wine, and to drink it off, hoping by that meanes to be freed from all future accidents which might happen vnto theyr wounds (although I do not approue thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a most insufficient remedy.) Also, such Vlcers which are made through the combustion of powder, are of no other nature then those that are made by fire, or scalding water. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should I alledge any forraigne example? Do we not see among our owne souldiers, I doe not know on what occasion, but onely to shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues braue fellowes, to emptie their charges of powder into their cups, and drinke it without any inconuenience at all; and others likewise beeing hurt on any part of their bodies, will apply of the same on their Vlcers to dry them, and finde much profit by it.<note place="margin">Refutation of those that affirme the Bullet to be impoisoned.</note> As for those which do affirme that it is not in the powder, but the Bullet, which being subtilly pierced in many places, or filled vp with venome, or steeped, rubbed, or mixed with anie poyson, causeth the aforesaide dangerous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents? To such I answer without further trouble, that the fire set to the powder, is sufficient to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the poyson of the Bullet, if any there were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be done by impoysoned swords, Pikes, Arrowes, and such like, because they passe not through the action of the fire.

to be altogether free from poison. Neuerthelesse, the besiedged Townesmen affirmed, that all those Bullets were poysoned. Also the Souldiours of your Maiesties Campe had the same opinion of such Bullets which were shot at them out of the Towne, that they were all impoysoned by them; rather beleeuing and iudging of the quality of the wounds by their ill successe; then by the Causes whereby they were made.</p>
            <p>True it is, that as in Physicke according to the sentence of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the <hi>Epidemies</hi>; as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Book, all diseases are cald Pestilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and venomous, being excited from common and generall causes of what kinde soeuer they be, and such kill many persons: so in the like manner, we may cal such wounds which are made by gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot venomous, which are more difficult to heale then others; not because they do participate of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny venonosity, but from some generall cause de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending either from the Cacochimie of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, putrification of the aire, or the corruption of the victuals, whereby those Vlcers are brought to be more malignant <hi>Cacoëthes,</hi> and rebellious to al Medicines.</p>
            <p>To affirme that it is only the combustion of the Bullet which causeth the aforesaide danger,<note place="margin">Refutation of those that affirme that the Bullet causeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

see to passe through a coate Armour, and to penetrate the body through and through, and yet to remaine whole. Moreouer, we doe obserue, that if a Bullet be shot against a stone, or against any solid matter, it may in the same instant bee handled of vs in our hands, without feeling anie notable heate, although the violent striking and colli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This I dare bee bolde to say and affirme moreouer, that if a quantity of powder should take fire being kepte in a Tower, or any other place, by the meanes of a Bullet shot, it was not the heate of the Bullet, but rather the violent striking of the Bullet against the stones of the saide Tower, which might cause sparkes of fire to fall among the powder, euen as the smiting of a steele against a flint stone. The like we may iudge of such Thatcht houses which haue bene set on fire by a Musket shot, to haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeded from some wad either of Tow or Paper, ram'd in with the powder, and so fired with it.

From the which similitude they would infer and conclude, that there is both fire, and a venomous quality in the Bullet, as it proceedeth out of the mouth of the Cannon.

The second kinde, by reason of the violence thereof, breaketh and dissipateth the same thinges because that the matter thereof is more violent, and compact as a Tempest.

In shedding the wine out of a vessell, without burning or breaking of the caske. According to the aforesaid testimony I can assure you, and that without any preiudice, that those Thunders which onely breake and dissipate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any burning; and such which leaue effects ful of great admiration, not to be much vnlike in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to the Cannon shot, and not those which carry immediately with them the action of fire. To proue my saying, this one example shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.<note place="margin">Example.</note> A certaine souldier receiued a wound in his Thigh with a Musket shot, from when I extracted a bullet; the which being wrapped in the Taffatie of his breeches, made a very deepe wound.

            <p>And which is more, I haue seene many men, who not being shot, nor any thing touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, vnlesse it were in their apparrell onely, haue receiued such an astonishment by a Cannon shot that onely past neere them, that their members thereby haue become blacke and liuid; and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after haue falne into a Gangrene and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof in the end they haue died.</p>
            <p>These effects are like vnto those of the thunder before spoken of.

            <p>Those which haue consumed their age and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the secrets of naturall Philosophie, haue left vs this among other things for authentick and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of all times.

The which we may dayly behold and proue it by those bellowes of Copper which the Dutchman brings vs, being composed in the form of a Boll, the which being filled with water, and hauing but one hole in the midst of the Sphericall forme thereof, receiueth the transmutation of the water within it into aire through the action of the Fire, neere vnto the which the Boll must be placed; and so thrusteth the aire forth of it with violence, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a continuall noise or sound vntill all the ayre be gone forth of it. The like may bee knowne by Egges or Chestnuts: for either of them being put into the fire before they are crackt, or the Rindes broken, presently the watery humidity contained in them doth conuert it selfe into ayre, thorough the action of the fire: and the aire in making his passage bursteth the shell, beecause it occupyeth more place being in the forme of aire, into the which it was chaunged by rarification caused by the fire, then it did vnder the forme of water; and not finding passage is constrained to make one by violence, according to the proposition helde for most certaine among all Physitians; that is to say, of that one part of Earth is made tenne of water: and of one part of water is made ten of aire, as of one part of aire ten of fire. I do say and affirme so

But the bullet driueth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it such a subtle winde, and so swiftly agitated that sometimes the very wind it selfe without the action of the bullet causeth strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects.

All these things wer wanting in the times of these last warres: and therefore it is not to be wondred at, if the wounds which were then receiued (althogh they were but small and of little consequence in the noble or ignoble partes) haue brought with them so many tedious accidents, and in the end death; because that the air<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This vnguent when and as often as it shall be needfull may bee applyed with Tents or Setons, beeing first dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a little wine or Aqua-vitae: The which tents ought to be both great and long for the first dressing, thereby to inlarge and dilate the wound that the Medicines may therby the better be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in. But afterwards they ought not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed so long or great. Also that the Medicine may the better be conueyed into the bottome of the wounds, it may bee incited in with a Syringe. Moreouer the vertue and strength thereof shalbe diminished according to the temperature of the body, and sensibility of the hurt. As if the wound be in the neruous parts, it shall be mixed with the Oyles of Terebinth, or of <hi>Hypericon,</hi> in such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

as the expert Chirurgian shall know to bee needfull. But the Egyptiacum is not to bee vsed at all, vnlesse it bee in such times which are Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall and dangerous for those saide wounds, &amp; that they do decline to putrifaction. After the vse of Egyptiacum you may separate &amp; make the escharre fall, with remollitiue and lenitiue things, as the following Oyle in vsing thereof a litle hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then luke-warme.</p>

to suppuration as soone as may bee: For by this meanes the wound shall bee the lesse mollested with Phlegmon (or inflammation.) Also it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that the contused flesh be putrified, lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and conuerted into <hi>pus,</hi> that new flesh may afterwards be regenerated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioubertus</hi> doth very much approoue this reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which I neuer yet did experiment, and it this.

Experience doeth shew that this remedy is excellent, and reason doth also confirm it. For the powder of Mercury accompanyed with vnctious and moistning things, causeth the contused flesh to suppurate easily, &amp; in short time without induring any great paine. As for the Camphire, whether it bee hot or cold, it serueth greatly because of the excellent tenuitie of the parts thereof.

               <p>Moreouer, Indication is to bee taken from the custome or manner of liuing of the Patient; as whether hee hath beene accustomed to eate and drink much, and at all houres: for then you ought not to ordaine him such an exquisite dyet as vnto him that is accustomed to eate and drinke but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and at certaine houres: and therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of <hi>Panades</hi> are not so proper vnto vs as vnto the Italians, because our bodies require more leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue things: which effect it woorketh with them, because of Custome, which is a second Nature. Vnder this accustomed manner of liuing, ought to be vnderstood the condition of the life, and the

exercise of the Patient, forasmuch as you ought to vse stronger remedies vnto the robusticke &amp; men of labour, such as haue their flesh hard, then you ought to vse vpon the delicate, and such which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour but little, and exercise lesse. Some there bee that had rather comprehend this Indication vnder that of the temperature. For my part I wil not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of it, but will leaue the resolution thereof wholly to the Doctors.</p>

               <p>Another Indication may bee taken from the Ayre which doth encompasse vs: vnder the which are comprehended the seasons of the yeere, the region, the place of our abiding, and the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time.

then in <hi>Paris</hi>; by reason that in <hi>Paris</hi> the ayre is more cold and moyst then at <hi>Auignon,</hi> which is a contrary thing, especially to all woundes in the head. Contrarywise, in <hi>Auignon,</hi> the heate of the incompassing aire doeth melt and subtillize the humors; whereby such humours more easily and in greater abundance do fall downe into the legs: from whence it commeth that the wounds in the legges are more difficult to cure at <hi>Auignon</hi> then at <hi>Paris.</hi> But if any one doe alledge experience to the contrary, that the woundes in the head, do more often become lethall or mortal in hotte Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions then in colde. To him I answer, that that proceedeth not by reason of the aire, inasmuch as it is hot and dry, but because of some superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humidity or euill vapour communicated with the aire; as in those partes of <hi>Prouence</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which are neere to the Mediterranean sea.</p>
               <p>The Indication of curation may also bee taken from the temperature of the wounded partes:<note place="margin">Indication taken from the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part.</note> for the fleshy parts doe require other remedies then the Bones or the Neruous partes, and so others.

The dignity and action of the wounded parts hath no lesse priuiledge in the act of curation then the former. For, if the wound be in the Braine, or in any other of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

His maner of liuing, ought in the beginning to be very slender, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make revulsion. For when the stomacke is not filled sufficiently, it attracteth from all partes vnto it: by meanes whereof, the externe parts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing affinity therewith, do remaine empty. And this is the reason wherefore the patient ought to keepe a slender dyet in the first dayes of his hurt. <hi>Venus</hi> is altogether contrary vnto them, inasmuch as it enflameth the humors and spirits more then any other motion: and for this cause it maketh the wound to bee much enflamed and subiect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion.

               <p>OFtentimes the aforesaide wounds are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many indispositions, as oedema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus tumors, fracture of the bones, and the like,<note place="margin">Historie.</note> as (for the yong Chirurgians sake) I will relate this historie for an example, of the hurt of the Earle of <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> Gouernour of the Dutchy of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> Knight of the order of the King of Spaine, who was hurt at the battell of <hi>Moncontour,</hi> with a Pistoll shot vpon the ioynt of his right arme or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, which fractured the bones; whereof there were many that were fractured in such small pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as if they had bene broken with a Mallet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he receiued the blow so neere at hand, and through the violence and force of the blow, there hapned vnto him many accidents; as extreme do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, inflammation, feauer, an oedemateous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; a flateous or windy tumor all the arm ouer, yea euen to the ends of the fingers, together with a preparation vnto a Gangrena. Which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, and also the totall mortification therof, M. <hi>Nicholas Lambert,</hi> and M. <hi>Richard Hubert,</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons in ordinary to the King, had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and deepe scarifications. Now by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the King, I was sent for to come vnto the aforesaide patient to dresse him: where being arriued, seeing the aforesaide accidents to be accompanied with a most faetide putrifaction, we were resolued to apply on the saide scarifyed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:968:51"/>
parts, of Aegyptiacum fortified and dissolued in vineger and Aqua-vitae and such remedieswhich are proper for the cure of Gangrenaes. Ouer and besides these accidents, the saide Lord had a flux of the belly, by the which he expelled of the fanie quitture which came from the Vlcers of his arme. This many will not beleeue, forasmuch (as they say) that if it should descend by the belly, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth of necessitie that the saide matter should be mixed with the blood. Also that in passing neere vnto the heart, and through the Liuer, it woulde cause many accidents, yea death it selfe. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I doubt not but that I haue sufficiently answered all these Obiections, how and in what manner it is done in my booke <hi>Of the suppression of the vrine</hi>; wherefore, if any desire to know the reason thereof, he may haue recourse to the saide Booke.</p>

which hapned to him. As for the Oedemateous and flatulent tumor which wholy occupied al the arme, I applied thereon staples wet in Oxycrat, with salt, and a little Aqua-vitae, and other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which shortly shall bee shewed. Then with double clothes I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ewed them vp as strong &amp; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly as I could possible, that is to say, as much as the said Lord could indure it. This compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serueth both to containe the fractured Bones in their places, and also to expell the sanies from the vlcers, and to repel the humors towardes the center of the bodie. And when the binding and rolling of his arme was omitted, the tumour did increase in such manner, that I verie much feared the natural heate of his arme would be suffocated and extinguished. Now for to make anie other manner of Ligature it was altogether impossible, because of the extreame paine that hee felt, if his arme had bene remoued neuer so little. There hapned vnto him also many Apostumes about the ioynt of his elbow, and in other partes of his arme: wherefore to giue issue to the Sanies, I made him manie incisions; all which the saide Lorde indured willingly, telling me that if two would not serue, make three, yea foure; such was the desire that he had to be out of his paine, and to be cured. Then (smiling to my selfe) I told him that he deserued to be hurt, and not these tender and delicate persons, who wil rather suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to rot, yea to indure the paines of death, then to indure anie necessary incision to be made
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:968:52"/>
for the restoring of their healths.</p>
               <p>Now, to shorten his cure, he vsed of a Vulna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie potion, and somtimes there was incerted with a Syringe into his vlcers of Aegyptiacum dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in wine, or else in the saide Potion, or rather <hi>Mel Rosarum</hi> insteed of the <hi>Egyptiacum</hi> to mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie them, and to correct their putrifaction; and other remedies which would be too tedious here to recite: and among others, of the powder of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome combusted, to dry vp and consume the high and spongeous flesh. Also for the mundification of the said vlcers, I vsed a long time nothing but dry Lint, which was as much in quantity euerie dressing, as a Mans fist. And on a day, seeing that he was without paine, and that the flesh began to regenerate, I told him that now he began to bee wel: then he saide to me laughing, I know it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel, for now I see you doe not vse the fourth part of the Lint you did before. In the time of his curation, I protest that I tooke from him more then threescore peeces of bones. Of the which, some were as great as my finger broken in a verie strange figure, yet notwithstanding the said Lord (thankes be to God) was perfectly cured: onely it remaineth that he cannot, nor neuer will, bow or stretch forth his arme.</p>

               <p>After that I had cured the aforesaid Lords, the Earle of Mansfelt, and Bassompierre,<note place="margin">Another hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</note> I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the King to imploy all my diligence in the curation of <hi>Charles Phillippes de Croy,</hi> Lord of <hi>Hauret,</hi> Brother to my Lord the Duke of <hi>Ascot,</hi> nere to <hi>Mons</hi> in <hi>Haynault,</hi> who had alreadie kept his bed seauen months and more, by reason of a wound that he receiued by a Musket-shot, three fingers aboue the knee, whom I found with these accidents following; namely, extreame paynes, a continuall Feauer, cold sweatings, losse of sleep, that part situate vpon <hi>Os Cauda,</hi>

Hee was somtimes surprized in his bed with the fits of the Epilepsie, &amp; had oftentimes a desire to vomit, with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall shaking, insomuch that he could not bring his hand to his mouth without the helpe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he fel oftentimes into a Syncope or fainting of the heart, because of the putrified vapors that were communicated to the stomacke and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts, by the Veines, Arteries, and Nerues: the which we eleuated from his vlcers, and from the corruption of the bones. For the Thigh-bone was fractured and shiuered both long wise and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart, with diuers splinters; whereofsome were already separated, others not. Hee also had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:968:53"/>
an hollow vlcer neere vnto the groine, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the middle of the thigh. Moreouer hee had other sinuous and caniculous Vlcers about the Knee. All the Muscles both of the thigh and legge were extremely tumified and imbued with a flegmaticke, cold, moyst, and flatulent humor, in such sort, that the natural heate was verie neere suffocated and extinguished. Seeing al these accidents, and the strength and vertue of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent greatly decayed and abated, I was stroke with an exceeding sorrow, because that I was sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and seeing little hope of recouery, for I feared greatly that he would die vnder my hands. Neuerthelesse,<note place="margin">God &amp; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture effect meruailous things.</note> considering his youth, I had some small hope, for God and Nature bringeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such things to passe, which seemeth vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the Chirurgian.</p>
               <p>I then demanded of the saide Lord, if hee had a good courage: and told him likewise, that if hee would indure the making of certaine incisions, the which for his curation were very necessary, by that meanes his paines and his other accidents would cease. He answered, that he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indure whatsoeuer I thought conuenient, yea, to the amputation of his legge, if I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. Then I was verie ioyful, and presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I made two Orifices to giue issue to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that lay about the bone, and in the substance of the Muscles, wherby there yssued forth a great quantity. Afterwards, iniection was made with wine, and a little Aqua-vitae, wherein there was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:968:53"/>
dissolued a good quantity of Egyptiacum, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the putrifaction, and to dissicate the loose &amp; spongeous flesh, and to resolue and consume the ordemateous and flatulent tumor, and to ease his paines, to refocillate and fortifie the natural heat which was greatly prepared to be altogether suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated, because the parts could not concoct nor assimilate the nourishment necessary for them, by reason of the great quantity of matter therein contained.

The said fomentations were vsed a long time together, to the end that the resolution may thereby be made the greater. For being applyed long together, it resolued more, by liquifying of the humour which was in the profound partes: whereas otherwise it would haue but rarifyed the skin, or the fleshy parts of the Muscles.</p>
               <p>And for this intention we made him many fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations with hot Kerchiefes in all manners,<note place="margin">Galen in the 6 of the Method.</note> that is, from the higher parts downewards, and from

In like manner euery other day, there was applied all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Thigh and legges, euen to the sole of his foot, of Brickes heated and sprinkled with vineger and white wine, with a little portion of aqua vitae; and through this euaporation, you shoulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue many Aquosities to proceed foorth of the pores of the skin by sweating, whereby the tumor diminished, and the naturall heate was reuoked. Also there was applyed compresses or Boulsters on the tumified parts, dipped and infused in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine made of the ashes of oake; with the which, was boyled Sage, Rosemary, Lauander, Salte, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua vitae and Cloues; and Ligature was made with such dexterity as the patient could well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it: and to so good purpose, that if it had bin but one day omitted, wee might easily perceiue the tumor. Also there was applyed good big Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters on the bottome of the sinus of the vlcers, to depresse and expell away the Sanies. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the better accomplishing thereof, the orifices of the vlcers were kept o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the Author for his Apology</note> a certaine Book written by a Physitian; wherin he very openly contradicteth that which I haue written heretofore, as concerning wounds made by Gunshot and their curations. I protest that if there were no other cause, or that there were no other interest heerein then the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of me and my Book, I would let these things alone, and passe them away vnder silence; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, that all answers and replies whereby we striue to stop the Mouths of euill speakers, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:968:55"/>
rather giue them a further occasion of speaking then otherwise; and that there is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to stay such Controuersies, then by not answering one word. Euen as we see that the fire is extinguished when the combustible matter ceaseth, by taking away the wood. But when I did consider the euident danger that many wold fall into, if they came to follow those rules and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that the saide Physitian setteth downe for the cure of the saide wounds, I therefore thought it my duty to preuent this euill, and to hinder it as much as lieth in mee, in regard of my professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The which beyond that common affection which all men owe to the publike weale, doeth binde me particularly to this, in such manner, that I could not with a good conscience become deaf and dumbe, when both my particular and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties, do binde and constraineime to speake. This therefore was the true cause that did solicite me to make this Apologie, rather then any passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate or boyling desire in me, to haue my reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of him who hath truly assaulted me.</p>
               <p>Now in this booke, he pretendeth to despise &amp; contemne the application of suppuratiue Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as Bassilicon, and others of that nature.<note place="margin">Basilicon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quefied into an oyle, is proper in al woundsthat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For (saith he) such remedies haue beene the cause of the deathes of an infinite number of men, whereunto they haue beene applyed; yea, although that their wounds were but superficiall, and in fleshy parts. And that heerein the counsell

Also that thunder and the violent effect thereof, ought not to bee compared to the reports of Artillery.</p>
               <p>Now seeing that he striueth to contradict all that I haue written before in my book of wounds made by Gunne-shot, Arrowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Dartes, I am constrained for my defence, to repeate somewhat of that which I haue heeretofore divulged, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue all these points (as I hope) one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>First of all, that suppuratiue Medicines are not proper in such wounds, it is against reason, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and experience: for euery one knoweth that the Bullet being round and massiue, cannot make any entrance into our bodies, without great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tusion and bruising; the which cannot bee cured without suppuration, according to the authority not onely of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> but also of <hi>Galen,</hi> and all other Authors both Ancient and Moderne. And what doth it serue him to call such new woundes, to derogate from the saying of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> whom we hold to be the Father, Author, and Founder of the Lawes of sacred Medicine, which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all esteeme and praise aboue all others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not subiect to change, as all others that are established by Kings and Princes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they tied to the prescription of times, nor

the customes of Regions. Therfore if I haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in followed the <hi>Hippocratick</hi> Doctrine, which is alwayes found true and st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, I perswade my self to haue done well. And therein I haue not bene in that conceit alone; for Mounsieur <hi>Botall,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian in ordinary to the King, and Mounsieur <hi>Iou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Physitian to the King also, and his Lecturer in ordinary in the vniuersity of <hi>Mont-pellier,</hi> men well experimented both in Physicke and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, haue lately written of this matter.

               <p>These men, because they haue followed the warres, haue seene more wounded by shot, then our Physitian hath done all his life time. As for experience, there is an infinite number of other good Chirurgians, and greatly experimented, who haue and do vse of these remedies in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to bring those wounds to suppuration, if there be no Indication that doth contradict it. I know moreouer that an Empericall Chirurgean, a neighbour of his called <hi>Doublet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doubles an Empirick.</note> hath many and sundry times done meruailous cures, by applying onely in those woundes a suppuratiue Medicine, composed of melted Bacon, the yolke of an Egge, terebinthinae, with a little Saffron, and this he held for a great secret.</p>
               <p>There was also another at Thurin in the yeere 1538. (I being then in the seruice of the late Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of <hi>Monte-ian,</hi> Lieutenant Generall of the

And for this cause they haue bene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much approued by the saide <hi>Botal</hi> and <hi>Ioubert,</hi> and of all good Chirurgeans; yet neuertheles our Physitian maintaineth that they are venomous, because (saith he) that being applyed in woundes by Gunne shot, they haue beene the cause of the death of many persons; which is a thing so absurd and against reason, that I will leaue the resolution thereof to the Towne-Barbers, who I am sure are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:968:57"/>
of skill sufficient to confute the grossenes of that imputation; or if their want of iudgement be such that they cannot, yet the consideration of euerie one of the ingredients of the sayde Aegyptiacum would suffice to shew, that it is so free from anie venomous quality, that it doth resist, &amp; is directly contrary to all sorts of poisons and putrifactions which may happen in the fleshy partes, by reason of any wound or vlcer.</p>
               <p>He saith moreouer, that the disposition of the aire ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the cause to infect or restore wounds more daungerous at one time then at another. Herein also he is of this opinion alone. But if hee had well read and vnderstood <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> he had not so lightly contemned the constitution of the seasons, and the infection proceeding from the aire not simple and Elementary (for being simple, it neuer acquireth any putrifaction) but by additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and commixtionwith other corrupted vapors, as I haue written in my treatise of the Pestilence: For inasmuch as the aire that doth incompasse &amp; inclose vs, is perpetually necessary vnto our liues; it followeth therefore, that according to the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position thereof, our bodies also altered in manie and sundry manners, because we do draw it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by meanes of the Lungs and other partes, seruing vnto respiration; and also by the pores &amp; euery little inuisible hole throughout the bodye, and by the Arteries dispersed in the skinne. And this is done both for the generation of the spirite of life, and also to refresh and foment our naturall
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:968:58"/>
heate. For this cause, if it be immoderately hotte, cold, moist, or dry, or otherwise distempered, it altereth and changeth the temperature of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies vnto its owne quality. This is cleerely seene: for when it is infected by the putrified and Cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueruous vapors produced from a great multitude of dead bodies that haue not bene buried soone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; as of men, of ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ses, and other beasts. As it happeneth after any battell, or when many men haue perished by shipwracke, and haue bene cast ashore through the violence of the waues. As for example, the memory is yet f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esh, of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aire which proceeded from deade bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at the castle of <hi>Pene,</hi> situate vpon the riuer of <hi>Lot,</hi> in which place, in the yeare 1562. in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of September, whiles the first troubles hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about Religion, there was a great number of dead bodies fell into a pit of an hundred fathome deepe, or thereabouts: from whence, two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after, there was eleuated such a stinking and venomous vapor, which dispersed it selfe ouer all the countries of <hi>Agenois,</hi> and the neighbouring places within the compasse of thirty miles round, that thereby many were infected with the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, whereof we need not wonder; for the wind blowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and driuing the exhalations and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vapors from one countrey to another, doeth infect them with the saide pestilence.</p>
               <p>In like manner, the euill constitution of the aire, whether the cause be manifest or hidden, may make wounds to become putrified, alter the spirits

and the humors, and cause death. This therefore ought not to be attributed vnto the woundes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that they which are hurt, and those that are not, are both equally infected, and fall into the same inconueniences.</p>

Likewise in Auignon, the heare of the aire doe liquefie and subtilize the humors: and therefore, more easilie and in greater abundance do the humors fall into the Legges, whereby the curation of the Vlcers in those partes, is more difficult at Auignon then at Paris. But if any one alledging experience shall say the contrary, that the wounds in the head are for the most part mortall in hot countreyes: To him I answere, that that proceedeth not from the aire, as it is more hot and dry, but rather because of some superfluous humidity and euil vapor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the aire, as in the places about
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:968:59"/>
                  <hi>Prouence,</hi> and of <hi>Italy</hi> neere vnto the <hi>Mediterrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> sea. Now, there is not a Chirurgean of so little vnderstanding, that knoweth not but if the aire be hot and moyst, the wounds doe easily degenerate into a Gangrena and putrifaction. As for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I wil giue him a familiar example. Wee see that in hot and moyst weather, and when the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly winds blow, that flesh doth putrifie in lesse then two houres, though it were neuer so lately killed, in such fort that Butchers in those times do kill no meate but euen as they sell it. Also there is no doubt to be made but that humane bodies doe fall into affections against Nature, when the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the seasons are peruerted through the euil disposition of the aire: as hath bene seene, that in some yeres, wounded persons haue bin most hard to cure, and oftentimes dyed of very smal wounds, what diligence soeuer the Physitians and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians could vse. The which I noted well at the siedge which was planted before <hi>Roan</hi>: for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the aire did alter and corrupt the blood and humors in such sort, by the meanes of inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and transpiration, that the wounds became so putrid and faetide, that they sent forth a Cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerueous smell: and if it hapned that one day had bene omitted wherein they had not beene drest, you shall finde the next day a great companie of wormes in them, with a meruellous stench; from whence were eleuated many putrified vapours, which by their communication with the hart cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a continual F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:968:59"/>
of the generation of good bloode, and with the Braine they produce alienation of the spirits, fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, convulsion, vomitings, and by consequence death: and when their bodies were opened, you should finde Apostumes in many partes of theyr bodies full of a greene stinking Sanies, in such sort that those that were within the Town seeing these things, that their wounded persons coulde not be cured, saide that those without had poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their bullets: and they without saide the like of those within: and then perceyuing that those wounds did rather turne to putrifaction then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any good suppuration, I was constrayned, and with mee the most part of all the Chirurgea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>Moreouer, if the diuers courses of the heauens haue power and force to imprint a pestilence in vs thorough the influence thereof, why is it not possible that the like may be done in a wound, to infect it after many wayes? Experience it self gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs a good and sufficient testimony, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hot weather, but also in winter. For we see that euery patient whether he be wounded, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise disposed against Nature, are tormented more of their greefes when the weather is subiect to raine, then when it is faire weather. And the reason is, because the vapour and moyst aire, and southerne winds, do inwardly mooue and agitate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:968:60"/>
the humors which afterwards do discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon the afflicted parts, &amp; thereby increase their paines.</p>
               <p>Our Physitian hath also written, that in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of Dreux and of S. Denis, which were fought in the winter time, there dyed a great number of men, that I confesse too; but I deny that it was by the application of suppuratiue medicines, or of Corrosiues, but thorough the vehemencie of their wounds, and the disorder that the Bullets made in their members, whereunto the nature of the wounded parts helped greatly, and the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the patient, but aboue all the cold. For the cold causeth wounds to bee of most difficult curation; yea, sometimes it causeth a Gangrena and totall mortification, as witnesseth Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And if he had beene with me at the siedge of Metz, he should haue seen many soldiers hauing their legges eschiomened by reason of the colde, and an infinit company of others that died of the colde, although they were not wounded at all. If he will not beleeue this, I will but send him to the top of the Mount Senis in the winter time, where many haue lost their liues, and were benummed and frozen in a moment; witnesse the chappell of Transis, which from thence had that Name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it.</p>
               <p>He hath in like maner calumnied me, because I compared thunder with Artillery. Truly it may be saide that they haue like effectes: for this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical<note place="margin">1 Similitude</note> gun-powder doth such merueilous things
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:968:60"/>
that it is easie to proue a great similitude the one with the other. And first of all, we may compare the fire that we behold to issue forth of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to the lightning in this, because it is seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Thunder is heard, so is it with the other: and this happeneth, because the eare is not so quicke as the eye to receiue their obiects. Wee may also compare the dreadfulnes of the reports of great Ordinance to that of Thunder.<note place="margin">2 similitude</note> For when there is made any notable battery with great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, their reports are heard sometimes twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leagues off, more or lesse, according as the windes carrieth the eccho of their noise. The first reports are not heard so plaine, as those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and the cause is, for that the multiplication of the reports following and succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that which is nerest doth driue or thrust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is next him, and that in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thrusteth forwards the other, and that other the other, vntill it commeth to our eares. In like manner the Bullets are carried by the force of the powder, with such an inestimable swiftnesse, that they breake and batter all that they meete with;<note place="margin">3 similitude</note> yea, they haue more force against hard and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable things then against soft things: therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they do resemble Thunder, which shiuereth the sword in the scabberd, and yet the scabberd remaining whole, melting Siluer in a purse, the purse vnburnt.

This I haue already manifested by that history which I haue elsewhere written, which was that at Paris; there was seene not long since a sodaine disaster by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the powder in the Arcenall, which taking fire, it caused such a great tempest, that it made the whole Towne to shake, ouer whelming those houses that were neere thereunto,<note place="margin">Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The like acte happened in the Towne of <hi>Malignes,</hi> in the yeere 1546. by the fall of a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, within a great and strong Tower, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was a great quantity of Gunpouder, the which did ouerthrow and reuerse almost the one halfe of the Towne, and killed a great number of persons, whereof I sawe a while since many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable tokens.</p>
               <p>These examples in my opinion are sufficient to content our Physitian, and to shew him that there is a great similitude betweene the effects of Gun-powder and Thunder. Neuerthelesse, I will not for all that confesse that Gunshot is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with poyson and fire as the claps of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for although they do agree the one with the other, as doth appeare by the former similitudes, it is not in the substance and matter, but in theyr manner of breaking, battering, and dissipating of the obiects which they meete, that is to say, the thunder-claps by the meanes of the fire, and the stone engendred therein, and Gunne-shot by the ayre impetuously agitated, which guiding the bullet, causeth the like tempestuous disaster, that the thunder doth. These things considered, may wee not therefore confesse, that those who haue
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:968:64"/>
written that the Cannon shot and Thunder to haue a great similitude together, haue had reason so to do? Finally, this Physitian hath not taken much paines to prooue that Gun-pouder was not venomous, and that the bullets are without anie burning at all. Neither in like manner to inuent and name the Instruments proper for the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all strange bodies, because he hath found them already digested in my booke, with manie other things which he hath written, as euerie one may know by comparing his book with mine. He hath also inriched his Book with many sentences and reasons which he hath collected from an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Author, named <hi>Bartholomaeus Magius,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian of <hi>Bolognia,</hi> who hath written sufficiently thereof in a Treatise called <hi>De Vulnerum sclopeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum curatione,</hi> although he doth not acknowledg him for his guide. But hauing traduced him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most word for word, hath made it neuerthelesse his owne, and of a Translator, would bee called Author.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to his goodly practise and new method to cure wounds made by Gun-shot.<note place="margin">A new kind of suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> First of all, hee would haue applyed suppuratiue Medicines, the which neuerthelesse he doeth not vnderstand to be hot and moist, nor of an empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke substance; but to the contrary, he ordaineth them to be hot and dry, because (saith hee) that this is not of the nature of an Apostume, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is required no other cure but only to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purate them. But heere where the woundes are
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:968:64"/>
with contusion, many and diuers Indications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from thence; for so much as the contusion would be concocted and digested, and the wound desiccated. To answer to this, I would send him to learne the nature and quality of suppuratiues in <hi>Galen</hi> in the 5. of Simples, and to take all in his way, vntill hee come to the tenth of his Method, which will teach him, that in complicated disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he ought to consider the cause, the order, and the vigent.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I would willingly aske of him if hee can heale that wound made by gunshot, vnlesse th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Contusion be first suppurate? I think not: and herein I refer my selfe to the iudgment of al good practitioners; and therefore our <hi>Basi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icon</hi> and <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Catellorum,</hi> and other such suppuratiue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, are proper to suppurate such woundes as are made by Gun-shot. Secondly, he would haue <hi>Oxycratum</hi> put into the wound to stanch the fluxe of blood: and if by that means it cannot be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to apply thereon a medicine made of the white of an Egge, Bole Armoniacke, Rose-vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Salt. I leaue you to consider whither such like remedies haue power to stay the flux of bloud or no, they being put with in the wound. Truely they will rather make it flow more, because that the vinegar is of a gnawing and subtle qualitie, causing paine, defluxion, inflammation, &amp; other euill accidents, as I haue knowne by experience: and I know no Chirurgean that hath beene exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in his Art, will follow such a kinde of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:968:65"/>
least he finde himselfe deceiued in the end. To this purpose I do remember that I had a <hi>Moor</hi> in cure, who belonged to Mounsieur the Earle of <hi>Roissy,</hi> who was hurt before <hi>Bologne</hi> by an English man, who gaue him a wound with a Lance tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the backe: whereuppon, to stay the Fluxe of blood, I put into the wound a restrictiue, wherein there was Vinegar insted of another, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he came to me againe, telling me that he thought he had had fire in his arme, which caused me to dresse him anew, and to change the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of his wound, and to apply the saide restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vppon it. I beleeue that this Physitian knew not so much, otherwise I esteeme him so honest a man that I thinke he would not haue put it in his Booke for a good restrictiue.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, hee commendeth aboue all other things his Balme made of the oile of wax &amp; myrth beaten together with the yolke of an Egge, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the naturall Balsome which is brought from <hi>Peru,</hi> and saith, that they do consume the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humidity of those wounds, whereby they preuent the happening of any perillous accident. Neuerthelesse, he saith, that they do vnite &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidate those kinde of wounds, as they do which are incised. Truly it seemeth very strange to mee, to see that any would go about to dresse and cure contused wounds, as simple woundes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nothing but vnion. Ouer and besides, these Balmes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be proper in wounds made by gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, because that by reason of their siccitie they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:968:65"/>
doe hinder suppuration, without the vvhich they cannot be cured. And if they be needfull at all, it is onely after that the contusion is suppurated, &amp; the wound mundified: and then I know not wher we should finde so many extractors of quintessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to extract and prepare so many Balmes as shal be needfull to dresse those souldiers which shalbe hurt in the assault of a Town,<note place="margin">A pleasant answer, and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</note> or a skirmish in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell? Neither vvhere they shall get mony suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to counteruaile the charge thereof.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the rest. He ordaineth that these Balmes should be instilled into the vvounds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tents, yet afterwards remembring himselfe, he saith, that it would be very good to put within them a little short one, onely to keepe the Orifice of the wound open. How is it possible that these Balmes and Vnguents should bee conueyed into the bottome of the wound without Tents or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, whose vse is principally to carry medicines vnto the bottome of wounds, and to keepe them open to giue issue vnto all strange bodies? All good practisers will neuer agree with him in this point, nor those which know what it is to handle such wounds.</p>
               <p>Now there is yet another thing worthy to bee well noted, and that is this: After that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Vnguent of Egyptiacum, hee neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse forgetting himselfe, commandeth it to be applyed from the beginning vntill the wound bee altogether suppurated, and to be thus vsed. Take (saith he) of Egyptiacum dissolued in a decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

on made of the tops of VVormwood, and of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericon, and of the lesser Centaury and Plantan, and this to be iniected into the wound. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for me I do esteeme them to bee proper to mundifie and clense, and not to suppurate. He finally writeth, that the wound ought not to be dressed but once in foure dayes, and where there shall bee fracture of the bones once in eight dayes. He saith more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer in another place, that it is conuenient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still euery day ten or twelue drops of balme into the wound. Truely this doctrine serueth rather to confound the yong Chirurgean, as not knowing what manner of practise hee should followe:<note place="margin">Euill p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore now we wil bid our Physitian farewell, but first would pray him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and correct his Booke as soone as he could, to the end that the yong Chirurgean bee no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger retained in those errours which they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend by reading therein: for the shortest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioes are the best.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Another Discourse about the question of the veneno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of wounds made by Gunshot.</head>
               <p>NOt many moneths since, I chanced to bee in the company of many learned Physitians and expert Chirurgeans, who by way of discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to put the venenosity of woundes made by Gun-shot; they principally striuing by fiue Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to proue that venenosity may bee conioined with those woundes, not because of the powder, which they confesse with mee to be free from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome or poison both in the composition and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence thereof, but by reason of the bullet, within the which poyson may be infused, mixed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated.</p>
               <p>The first reason is,<note place="margin">1 Reason.</note> because that Leade is verie rare and spongeous, as the facility of the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and softnesse thereof do shew, and therfore by consequence very easie to receiue the imbibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or infusion of any venomous liquor. I answer that that consequence seemeth to me to bee but of small assurance: for in all artificiall mixtions,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:968:67"/>
is that whereof we speake, there are two things to be considered; the matter of the bodies which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the commixtion; and the forme accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter. Such bodies ought eyther to be liquid, or soft, or brittle, and easie to bee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into small portions; to the end, that altogither and on euery part, they may meete, ioy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. According to the forme they ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liable and computible th'one with the other. This is euidently knowne by the water, which though it be easie to mix with an infinit number of other things, yet neuerthelesse they cannot bee mixed together, by the reason of the antipathy of their formes. So Golde and Siluer are so amorous of Lead, that when they are to bee dissolued, they are mingled therewith; but Brasse doth flye from Lead as much as gold and siluer do fly from Tin. If therefore Lead and Brasse be melted together, they can by no meanes be mixed together, thogh both are contained vnder Metallicke kinds. How then can there be incorporated with Lead any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous thing, being different both in forme and kinde?</p>
               <p>Let vs come to the second reason. Iron (they say) which is more hard,<note place="margin">2 Reason.</note> solid and compact, may neuerthelesse receiue a certaine venomous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as we see by impoysoned Arrowes, whereof our Ancestors haue heeretofore vsed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Lead (by more reason) may receiue the like venomous quality.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> To answere to that, I confesse that the poyson may well bee receiued on the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:968:67"/>
of the Iron, but not in the inwarde sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof, by way of commixtion. Now here the question is of incorporation, and not of a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple infusion or Vnction.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare the third reason.<note place="margin">3 Reason</note> Although that Lead (say they) when it is melted, doeth leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it a kinde of grosse excrement: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, it is not therfore made vnapt to receiue the infusion of any straunge substance. For, euen as steele a mettall amongst all others the most solid, doeth receiue in the woorking thereof, a temper which doeth harden it of a cleane contrarie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. For answer (I say) that when the temper is giuen to steele, it is not receiued within the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd substance thereof; for,<note place="margin">Answer</note> if such a thing were necessary for the hardning thereof, it might bee easier done at that time when it is first drawn and melted, then to giue it the Temper, it would bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incorporate therewith then afterwards when it is taken and consolidate into a barre. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer shall likewise serue to confute the fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">4 Reason</note> by the which (say they) that the iuice of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus</hi> and <hi>Rhododendron</hi> of <hi>Apium risus,</hi> and such like, who of their whole substance, do hurt &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ours beeing mingled with Lead, there may thereby be made such a venomous commixtion; that those wounds which it maketh, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssity become venomous. I say to the contrarie,<note place="margin">Answer</note> that the mixture is only of things which may not onely be applyed, but also fixed, incorporated, &amp; vnited the one to the other. Now how can water
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:968:68"/>
or any other liquid iuyce only be made to adhere and cleaue to Lead which is hard &amp; solid, I meane in that fashion that they may be vnited: the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty heereof may bee iudged better by experience, then by reason. Cause Lead to be melted within the iuices heretofore recited, or any other that you will choose (hauing first weighed them seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) and you shall finde the iust measure of the iuices, and the true waight of the Lead, as they were before: a most euident signe, that no part of the Lead is incorporated with the iuyces, nor the iuyces to haue lost any of their substance.</p>
               <p>The first reason is this; The Bullet shot out of a Musket against a stone or any bodye of the like hardnesse,<note place="margin">5 R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ason.</note> is not thereby so much heated, but that it may neuerthelesse be handled in the bare hand though it be taken presently after it was shot: and therefore it is false to affirme, that the poyson in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused in the Bullet, may be consumed by the fire of the flaming powder. I answer, you must note that when I said that although the Bullet may be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neuerthelesse, the fire would consume the force of the poyson; my meaning was, not the fire of the flaming powder,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> when the Musket is shot off, but that fire which is vsed to incorporate the molten Lead with the sayde poyson, the which immediately working vpon the poyson, being not yet wholly enwrapped and couered in any stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hauing time and leysure to worke that effect, and not at an instant and altogither, it may if not consume, yet at the least greatly abate the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:968:68"/>
forces of the said poyson. Those that wil not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselues with these reasons, let them read <hi>Matthiolus</hi> vppon the Preface of his sixt Booke of <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THese wounds which are made by Arrowes, Crosse-bow shot, or such like Instruments, do differ in two things from those which are made by Gunshot and other fierie Engines. For somtimes they are found without Contusion, which neuer hapneth to wounds made by Gunne-shot. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also they are empoysoned, and according to these two differences, their curations ought to be diuersified. Now let vs consider the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Arrowes and Darts, because that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration serueth greatly vnto the knowledge and curation of the said wounds.</p>

               <p>A Rrowes and Dartes doe differ in matter, in forme or figure, in magnitude, in number, in manner, and faculty or vertue. Their differences in matter is, some of them are of Wood, others of Canes or Reeds: some of them haue their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities or heads garnished with Iron, Tinne, Lead, Brasse, Horne, Glasse, or of bone, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not.

As for their magnitude, some of their heads are of three fingers in length; others of a smaller size. Their number causeth a difference herein; because that some are simple, hauing but one point onely; others are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into two or many. Also in them their manner is to be confidered; for some of them haue the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron or head inserted within the woode of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and of others the Arrow is inserted into the head. Some heades are sixed and nayled vnto the shaft, and others not; but haue so little hold, that in drawing them foorth, their heads remayne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde in the wounds, whereby they become more daungerous. Their faculty maketh them also to differ in this, because that some are (as hath bene saide) empoysoned and others not. Such are the speciall and proper differences of Arrowes and Darts: according to the which, the dispositions which they leaue behinde them, doeth diuersifie their curation.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S touching the extraction of Arrowes, you ought to auoyde the incising, dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating, and breaking of the Veines, and Arteries, Nerues and Tendons, if it be possible. For it would be an ignominious thing and against Art, to offend Nature more then the Arrow.</p>
               <p>The manner to draw them foorth is two-fold; the one of them is by extraction, and the other by thrusting it through the member. Therefore, euen at the beginning, and at the first dressing, it is fittest to take foorth all strange bodyes (if anie there be) as the heads of the Arrowes, the shafte or wood, and other such like things, as hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy beene saide of wounds made by Gunne shot, and by the same meanes.

Also it is made greater, to dilate the hollow pipe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to fill the cauity of the Iron head. This other Instrument also is very proper, which dilateth by compressing the two extremities together, being toothed also on the outward part; as you may see by these following Figures on the other side the leafe.</p>

               <p>The second Instrument doeth dilate, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the two ends together.</p>
               <p>The signes whereby you may know where the Iron head is, that if you feele with your hande on that part where it is, you shall perceiue an asperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inequality. Also the flesh wil appeare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tused, liuid, and blacke, and the Patient will feele an heauinesse and continuall paine in the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part.</p>
               <p>The other two Instruments are called Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, with a Vice, together with a Crowes bill: and is very commodious to draw forth the heads of Arrowes, and to extract foorth Maile and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther smaller bodies.</p>
               <p>This Instrument vnderneath, is another small Hooke to draw forth Maile, or any other strange body, that it cannot meete with: which also may serue thy turne for the same effect, in the woundes of Gun-shor.</p>

As for example, in the Thighe or Legge, together with some portion of the wood broken therein, in that case the Chirurgean shall cut away the woode or shaft as close as hee can, with incising or cutting Tenacles. Afterwardes he may draw foorth the head with Tenacles that are toothed, as you may see by the figure before going.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in the fifte of his Epidemies saith, That he hath drawne forth the head of an Arrow sixe yeares after it was shot, it being lodged nere vnto the Groine.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT if it come to passe, that the head is broken, in such sort that it cannot by any meanes bee apprehended by the aforesaide Tenacles, let it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted then (if it be possible) with the Cranes bill, or Crowes bill, or other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that haue beene described heere before: but if the shaft be broken off so neere the heade, that there can bee taken no holde, neyther of the head thereof, nor of the shaft, with the Cranes bill, then let it be drawne foorth with the <hi>Tirefond</hi> of Gun-shot, for if it will insert it selfe into Lead, by a greater reason it may easily enter into wood. In like manner, if the head bee barbed, as most commonly your English mens Arrowes are, then if it be possible, thrust it thorough the member, with an Instrument proper thereunto. For, by that meanes you shall auoyde greater danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in drawing it foorth, the Barbils may rend both the Nerues, Veines, Arteries, and the other parts, the which you ought to auoide care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And therefore it is better to make a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Orifice on the other part, iust oueragainst the wound, and so to thrust it cleane through. For, it may be supposed, that there is but a little thicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to incise; so by this meanes, and with lesse

danger the wounde will haue a double yssue; the one on the former part, and the other on the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part; and will therefore heale sooner, because you may apply your medicines both on the one side, and on the other, and it will also mundifie better. To the contrary, if the barbed head hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vpon a bone, or be inserted therein, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes commeth to passe in the bottome of the Muscles of the Thigh, of the Arme, or Legge, or other parts of great distance, there it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to thrust them through, but rather to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the wound, auoiding the Nerues and great vessels, as the good and expert Anatomical Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgean ought to do, and then gently and orderly to apply therein a Dilatory hollow in the inward part thereof, and so to place it, that it may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the two Barbils of the Iron head: then with the Cranes bill it may be held steddy, and so draw them forth all three together, as this figure follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing sheweth thee.</p>
