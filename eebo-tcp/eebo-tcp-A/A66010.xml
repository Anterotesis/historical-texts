            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>ROws'd from Infernal Caverns void of Light,</l>
               <l>Where Traytors Souls keep an Eternal Night:</l>
               <l>Through the <hi>Earths</hi> friendly Pores at last I come</l>
               <l>To view the Fate of mangled <hi>Christendome.</hi>

               <l>Still to gain more, still to be mounted higher:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Wars, Ianglings, Murders,</hi> and a Thousand more</l>
               <l>Vices like these, you know were heretofore.</l>
               <l>The only grateful Bantlings, which could find,</l>
               <l>A kind Reception in my gloomy Mind—</l>
               <l>—But now alas I'm chang'd—the Pondrous guilt</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Treason,</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Blood</hi> I spilt;</l>
               <l>

Those crouds of <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi> I made groan,</l>
               <l>Under pretence of strickt <hi>Religion,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When I my self, to speak the Truth, had none:</l>
               <l>Too weighty for my strugling Soul did grow,</l>
               <l>And prest it downwards to the Shades below,</l>
               <l>Where it these Twenty Years has Silent lain,</l>
               <l>Tormented with Variety of Pain,</l>
               <l>Too great for fleshly Mortals to sustain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Nor had it budg'd as yet—but that the Fame</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Plots, Conspiracies,</hi> and <hi>Murders</hi> came</l>
               <l>To the Infernal Gates so fast, that I,</l>
               <l>For others Good, forgot my Misery:</l>
               <l>And whilst the busie <hi>Daemons</hi> were imploy'd</l>
               <l>In culling out a Bloody Regicide,</l>
               <l>I bilkt my Keeper, and with wondrous Pain,</l>
               <l>Once more I mount my Native Soyl again;</l>
               <l>Where to my Grief, more Villanies I view,</l>
               <l>Than Heav'n e're Pardon'd, or than Hell e're knew.</l>
               <l>Since <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s like <hi>Rome</hi>'s Destructive Pride,</l>
               <l>Both Damn'd himself, and all his Imps beside:</l>
               <l>Though old in Artful Wickedness I be,</l>
               <l>Yet <hi>Rome,</hi> I now Resign the Wall to thee:</l>
               <l>Thou in this single Plot, hast now done more,</l>
               <l>Than Mankind, helpt by Hell, could do before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What! was thy swell'd Ambition grown so wide,</l>
               <l>That nought but <hi>Kings</hi> could satisfie thy Pride?</l>
               <l>Must <hi>Monarchs,</hi> whom the Heav'n it self do's prize,</l>
               <l>Now become Morsels for thy gaping Vice.</l>
               <l>Methought, though hot with Gluttony thou burn,</l>
               <l>A Pious Justice might have serv'd thy turn;</l>
               <l>Especially when, (to content you more)</l>
               <l>Spitted on's Sword, and Pickled in his Gore;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43877:2"/>
But now your aim we better understand,</l>
               <l>He was the Whet—you gap'd for all the Land.</l>
               <l>Strange Cormorant! that in her Monstrous Breast,</l>
               <l>Could at one Meal three Butcher'd Lands digest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ye <hi>Powers!</hi> I thought my Countries Innocence,</l>
               <l>(When in fierce <hi>Whilwinds</hi> you had born me hence)</l>
               <l>And by the Pow'r of your most just Command,</l>
               <l>Restor'd the Scepter to the Owners hand)</l>
               <l>Would have sufficient bin to Wall you free</l>
               <l>From the Assaults of such an Enemie.</l>
               <l>I little thought, when last I took my leave,</l>
               <l>And sadly entred my unwelcome Grave,</l>
               <l>That e're the Porphry Idol could command</l>
               <l>So great a Friendship in our Native Land;</l>
               <l>As by that means to hope to circumvent,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But yet take heed ye Romish Idiots,</l>
               <l>That have a hand in these most Hellish Plots;</l>
               <l>Who by your base contrivance, hope to bring</l>
               <l>Ruin to Nations, Death unto a King</l>
               <l>Beware, I say, by my Example, do,</l>
               <l>For there's a God above do's all things view:</l>
               <l>Tho wrapt in Clouds amongst the Skies, he dwells,</l>
               <l>Yet he discerns you in your closest Cells;</l>
               <l>See's your Contrivances, and whilst you poor</l>
               <l>Conceipted Traytors think your selves secure,</l>
               <l>He your clandestine Plots does plainly view,</l>
               <l>And will divulge them, and their Actors too.</l>
               <l>Trust my Experience, one, who if you will</l>
               <l>Believe, what all the World says of him still,</l>
               <l>Had no small share of Pride, Ambition, Wit,</l>
               <l>Courage and Conduct too to manage it.</l>

By which I wrought my Curst designs so high,</l>
               <l>I could have match'd my <hi>Brewers Family</hi>
               </l>
               <l>With the best Blood in <hi>Brittain.</hi> Right or wrong,</l>
               <l>Or Life or Death, attended on my Tongue:</l>
               <l>All the three Kingdoms truckled to my Will—</l>
               <l>But what of this?—I was a Traytor still.</l>
               <l>Nay, so intemperate was my folly grown,</l>
               <l>I boldly offer'd at the Sacred Crown;</l>
               <l>Which though I mist,—yet by a holy Cheat,</l>
               <l>At last I gain'd to fill the tott'ring Seat;</l>
               <l>And made Ten thousand Souldiers Arm'd, appear</l>
