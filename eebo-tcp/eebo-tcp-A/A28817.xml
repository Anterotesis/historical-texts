            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Plurality of Worlds in general, being as a Preface to the following Chapters.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE may truly ſay, that Preoccupation is an horrid Monſter, which makes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56411:7"/>
a ſtrange havock in the ſpirits of Men, hinders the progreſs of Sciences, and cauſes Men to droop in a conſtant igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for they who by it are once prepoſſeſſed, can judge of nothing by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cenſure the beſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that are, aſſert thoſe of their Maſters, whether good or bad; and having conceived a diſtaſte of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever checks what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their belief, though groſſe and ignorant, bring forth nothing but contempts and blames againſt thoſe who endeavour to open their eyes, and root them out of the darkneſſe of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to draw them to the enjoyment of the true light
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56411:7"/>
and knowledg of things.</p>
               <p>The which is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly practiſed now in this Age wherein we live, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men live but by imitation, wherein learned Men are deſpiſed, wherein they who have ſome particular and rare notions upon ſubject matters of great moment and concernment to mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are eſteemed extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and ridiculous, wherein no new propoſition can be admitted.</p>
               <p>But alas, what may I hope, ſeeing this evill is like a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and hath taken ſo deep root, that it hath robb'd men of their ſenſes and feeling, who by it are infected, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that thoſe who are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56411:8"/>
moſt poſſeſs'd with it, do not think ſo themſelves to be; What then may I expect, who am going to propoſe ſome Novelties, not of things that are in the Earth, but even in the Heavens; and not onely in the Heavens, but alſo in the bodies of the Stars.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Title of this Diſcourſe ſhall appear to the eyes of Men, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me before they hear me; neither will they ſo much as read my Reaſons, and will rather live in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, then change their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and be as beaſts in the World, than know the ſecrets thereof.</p>
               <p>Moſt men think it a ſhame to confeſſe, that they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56411:8"/>
of ſome thing, and that they are in the wrong; for on the contrary, it's the way to find out the truth, conſidering, that new reaſons are alwayes ſought for what we eſteem our ſelves ignorant of.</p>
               <p>Mens ignorance is ſo great, that the holy Scriptures have declared Mens knowledg to be nothing elſe but vanity; and if we do not flatter our ſelves, we ſhall find, that we know nothing but is or may be controverted. Divinity it ſelf is not exempted from it; and as for the other Sciences and Arts, thoſe great &amp; many Volumes that we have of them, ſufficiently teſtifie the ſame. And this hath moved
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56411:9"/>
the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> and <hi>Scepticks,</hi> to doubt and queſtion all things, and hath brought forth ſeverall Books of the vanity of Sciences, the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, the Medicine, the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, and the naturall Phyſick are daily moved and ſhaken, and ſee their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations totter; <hi>Ramus</hi> did overthrow <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; <hi>Copernicus, Ptolomey</hi>'s Aſtrologie; <hi>Paracelſus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Phyſick; So that every one hath followers and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and all appearing plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. We have much ado whom to believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are conſtrained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that what we know, is much leſſe then what we know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56411:9"/>I greatly eſteem <hi>Michael Mountanus</hi>'s Judgment, who is the honour of our Age upon this point; for it is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon, and my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hereupon is for the moſt part agreeing with his; and eſpecially with that is the ſubject matter of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: Amongſt a thouſand rare thoughts that he hath upon it, he alledges a moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſimilitude, by which he compares learned perſons to the ears of corn, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well fill'd, do bow down their heads; for after they have learned all Sciences, and have conſumed themſelves in them, they are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confeſſe, that they know nothing by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56411:10"/>
of that great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, in theſe words; <hi>Hoc unum ſcio, quòd nihil ſcio,</hi> I know this one thing, that I know nothing.</p>
               <p>If then we be ignorant of all things, may we not yield, that we can be ignorant of heavenly things eſpecially, and that they are praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations and meditations up into Heaven; and having, as it were, looſened their Souls from their bodies, have made it to wander and run through the Vaults and concavities of Heaven, there to obſerve thoſe things which were above our reach? Our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being heavenly, and our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56411:10"/>
Soul full of knowledg &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is not ignorant of theſe things; but the lump &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency of the body, which is its priſon, hinders it freely to perform its functions; it would willingly riſe up, and at every moment lenche it ſelf up towards the place of its original; but the weight of its body keeps it low and under, and the mixture of the Elements wherewith the body is compoſed, makes its agility dull and heavy.</p>
               <p>If, before the Invention of Artillery, of Printing, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect-glaſſes, and of infinite number of other Inventions, that in theſe times are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, their effects had been told to us, we had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56411:11"/>
them; for if it had been aſſerted, That with the powder, without ſtirring, we might kill beaſts diſtant from us; and not onely the beaſts on the earth, but alſo the fowls and birds flying high through the ayr, throw down walls of Cities, and batter and thunder down the ſtrongeſt places; and that in a moment thoſe inſtruments ſhould execute our will: That by printing, and the letters, we might communicate our thoughts to another, and write in a ſhort time a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber infinite of books, and even write a thouſand times faſter then we ſpeak, tranſmit and leave to our poſterity our exquiſite conceptions, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56411:11"/>
get an immortal name; And that by the proſpective glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we might approach to objects far diſtant, ſtrengthen our ſight, and make us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to ſee things ſar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; If theſe things (I ſay) had been propoſed to us in a time, wherein farther ſpeech and enquire had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more been made of it, who had believed them? but rather who had not laughed at them, and derided the firſt motioner of them? and yet experience daily ſheweth the effects of theſe Inventions to be true.</p>
               <p>So the former Ages did condemne as hereticks, thoſe who believed the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes; and this belief was a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56411:12"/>
long time held for a falſe and ridiculous opinion; <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophorus Columbus</hi> was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of divers Kings, when he propoſed to them the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and yet his propoſitions have been found very true, and have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortaliſed their Author.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe do I hope, that time will bring forth the truth of this my opinion, which I do not produce to the light, without many ſtrong Reaſons, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the moſt learned men, the holy Scripture it ſelf is not repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to it, but rather leans much towards my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And as touching thoſe Philoſophers, who grant it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56411:12"/>
not, ſome deny not, but that this may be; others dare not contradict it; and others have ſo ridiculous reaſons, that I cannot imagine weaker can be found; and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all they, no more then I, have aſcended into Heaven, and therefore who ever hath the beſt Reaſons, ought to be believed; which being doubtleſſe on my ſide, my opinion ought not at all to be eſteemed ridiculous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Democritus,</hi> King of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deritanes,</hi> conſtantly ſmiled, becauſe the World could not apprehend the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Worlds; I, like him, have alſo ſufficient occaſion to ſmile, and laugh at thoſe, who are ignorant of the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56411:13"/>

               <p>WEe have here above promiſed to prove, that the Earth moves, becauſe we have hence drawn an argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our Opinion; though moſt men of underſtanding now adayes believe this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth as better clearing the courſe of the Stars, the order of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, yet I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of it.</p>

had cheaten three thouſand years, all the World did ſo believe it; untill that <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> the <hi>Samian,</hi> or, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nicetas</hi> of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</hi> was reſolved, that the Earth moved upon its prop. And in our Age, <hi>Copernicus</hi> hath ſo well grounded this doctrine, that he makes uſe of it for a rule to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Aſtrologie, and freeth our ſpirit from thoſe impoſſibilities, that the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians of old would make us believe; for, according to their judgment, the firſt <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> ſhould run in one minute 706640 miles and a half, and that one and the ſame body had contrary motions; Is it not more probable, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56411:32"/>
the Earth turns round in 24. hours from the Weſt to the Eaſt, as in former Ages, <hi>Timeus Locrenfis, Philolaus, Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Franciſcus Marius,</hi> and others, did believe it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keplerus, Longomonus, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganus, Campanella,</hi> and others of our Age have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this truth; <hi>Galileus</hi> alſo ſeems to be of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when he ſaith, <hi>That if the Earth did not move and turn, the Sea could not have its flux and reflux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are as thoſe who are in floating Iſlands, or in a Ship, who think that they move not, but that, on the contrary, Sea-banks ſeem to flye from them; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive the motion of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56411:33"/>
the Earth, as well becauſe of its bigneſſe, as becauſe that we are not looſed from it.</p>
               <p>But if in oppoſition to this, be alledged thoſe Texts of the Word of God, which ſay, that the Sun is moveable, and the Earth fixt; may it not ſuffice to anſwer, That God ſpeaks according to mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as he hath done upon a thouſand of other ſubject matters; as when he calls the Moon the <hi>great light,</hi> though an infinite number of others are greater. As for the Argument that is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a ſtone caſt down from high far from us, if the Earth turn; I anſwer, That the Ayr roles and turns with the Earth, and that a pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56411:33"/>
body falls down in ſo ſhort a time, that the Earth cannot by its motion in 24. houres be alienated from it.</p>
               <p>It's alſo objected, That the Towers would fall, and that the Clouds and Rivers would all follow the courſe of the Earth. But I anſwer, That the Clowds are agitated by the winds, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not follow the courſe of the earth; and as for the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they cannot fall, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Earth's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not violent, and that the Towers, by reaſon of their ponderoſity, bend ſtill towards the Center of the earth, and are not removed from their ſituation; And as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56411:34"/>
touching the Rivers, the earth being as a gall-nut, a River may run towards the Eaſt, by the bending of its Seats to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the center of the earth, although the Earth tends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt; which may eaſily be apprehended, if we conceive, that a man walking in a Ship, directs his ſteps towards the Eaſt, whileſt that the Ship ſayles to the Weſt.</p>
               <p>Many ſeverall other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are objected, which are but weak; but becauſe there are divers Diſcourſes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth's motion, which reſolve them, and reconcile the places of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon this ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, amongſt whom are <hi>Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carinus,</hi>

               <p>VVHereas <hi>Montanus</hi> hath here above ſpoken of the Soul of the World, It will be meet for our preſent ſubject, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate thoſe Arguments by which this Opinion may be proved, that he may not be judged to have incongruouſly ſpoken of it, it being alſo advantageous for our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>If the World is a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature, as divers Learned Perſons have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, It may not be ſtrange and ridiculous to believe.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56411:44"/>
That the Earth hath a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor conſequently that it is a moving Star or Planet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, and that ſo likewiſe all the others may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited: Now if the Earth turns and moves; is it not alſo needfull to grant, that that whereby it is moved, is as it were, its ſoul moving it, as our ſoul moves our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Some have thought, that God is the ſoul of the World, and that he is in the World, as the ſoul in man's body; that is to ſay, all in all, and all in each part; and that therefore the World might have a ſoul, and be called a living creature, great and round, and as <hi>Montanus</hi> ſaith, Is it not more likely,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56411:44"/>
that this great body by us called the World, is a thing quite contrary then we eſteem? The <hi>Pythagorians, Xenophon, Plato,</hi> and all his Schollers, have taught and believed this opinion; and ſince them <hi>Marſilius Ficinus,</hi> and <hi>Hierome Fracaſter,</hi> moſt renowned Doctors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and in our Age <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,</hi> who alledges <hi>Seneca, Origenes, Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius Nazianzenus,</hi> as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of it.</p>
               <p>But if any one ſhould ſay, That the World cannot be a living creature, ſeeing it hath nor feet, nor eyes, nor hands, nor any ſuch member as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures have; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to conſider, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56411:45"/>
its not requiſite it ſhould have ſome feets, being it treads not upon the other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures; nor eyes, nor ears, becauſe it can neither ſee nor hear any thing out of it ſelf; but the hands of this living Creature, as thoſe that in it are contained, and we have, are its beams and virtues; its eyes, the Stars; its bloud, the Waters; and ſo hath other things beſides, conſonant and correſpondent to our members, without having need of the ſame as we have; Are there not ſtrange and monſtrous beaſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us, and yet live well, and are perfect in their kind, doing well enough without ſuch members as we have,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56411:45"/>
though they have not the ſame ſituation with us. How many Fiſhes is there, that have their mouth in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the eyes and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in extravagant places? Some Creatures have the gall in their head, and ſome in their tail; yea, there are ſome Men, whoſe head is in their boſome; ſome likewiſe may be formed, ſo as we cannot comprehend nor know how. Its motion ſets forth its life; and the flux and reflux of the waters its breath and reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

               <p>WIth the Proſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe we may ſee ſome Clouds flying round about the Sun, which can ariſe but from the Moon, from other Stars, or from the Sun it ſelf, becauſe they be beyond the Region of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56411:52"/>
Now if the Stars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender clouds, they have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within themſelves; but if the Element of water is in them, the Element of earth and the reſt have as great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be in them, as it. Now that there is water in them, the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> proves it clearly, when he ſaith, <hi>Then God ſaid, Let there be a Firmament in the midſt of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters; And God made the Firmament, and divided the waters which were under the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, from the waters which were above the Firmament; &amp; he called the Firmament, Heaven, and the waters under the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Seas. Eſdras</hi> in Chap. 6.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56411:52"/>
of his ſecond Book, ſaith the ſame, in theſe terms, <hi>Thou madeſt the ſpirit of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and commandedſt it to part aſunder, and to make a diviſion betwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the other remain beneath.</hi> Where are theſe waters above, I beſeech you, if they are not in the Stars? For it's a very weak Reaſon to ſay, That they are in the Clouds; becauſe that, beſides that they could not contain the Seas, Its ſaid in the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>God had not cauſed it to rain upon the Earth, but there went up a miſt from the Earth, and watered the whole face of the Earth;</hi> and ſo conſequently there was no vapour raiſed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56411:53"/>
up to form them: and what ſhould have raiſed them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was yet no Sun created to light the World?</p>
               <p>Let us then lift up our eyes to Heaven, and, as the new <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> who daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the Sun, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in them thoſe new Worlds, wherewith it is wonderfully enriched, which are divers and various in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, light, and other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; let us not be as poor ſimple Countrey fellowes, who having ſeen no farther then the corner of their own chimney, cannot apprehend, that there can be any Town or City bigger then their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; but let us raiſe our ſpirits to the contemplation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56411:53"/>
of the remoteſt and higheſt things that are; thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling our ſelves, though it be a very high attempt. O how happy is that man, who when he pleaſeth, can ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually looſen his Soul, and by his exquiſite Meditations riſe up to the meditation and contemplation of theſe Worlds! When once we are well acquainted with it, and freed from all Preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, nothing can be found ſweeter, pleaſanter, and more conſonant to truth.</p>
               <p>What Patents and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priviledges have they, who believe the contrary, that we ſhould adhere to them; and our belief ſhould be ruled by them, as if it were

               <p>WE have here above ſpoken of the Clouds, and thence have drawn an Argument to aſſert this our opinion; we may yet draw this from them, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Clouds and vapours being

light ſhould aſcend without limitation, untill that they were loſt from our ſight, if there were not ſome other terreſtrial Globes in Heaven, nor any other attraction then that of the Center of the Earth; but we may obſerve even in the hotteſt of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that the Clouds do not aſcend above 3. miles, and the ſtrongeſt vapours that are, not above 30 miles; whence we muſt infer, that they aſcend unto the limit of the activity and attraction of the center of the Earth, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to go beyond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be to bend downward, <hi>viz.</hi> towards the Center of ſome other terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall Globe.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56411:56"/>
it, becauſe then they would deſcend towards the Moon, or ſome other Stars, which would be contrary to their nature, which is to riſe upward ſtill; ſo that if a ponderous body as a ſtone being caſt up, could go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Earth's attractive point, it would not fall back upon the Earth, but upon that Star, whoſe attractive Center ſhould reach unto that place whither the ſtone was caſt; therefore hath <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> ſaid in his Book <hi>de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsu Scientiarum,</hi> that <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> did not doubt incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, That the bodies of weight and ponderoſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a far diſtance from the Earth, would by little and

that never the like hath been found; for it hath neither feet nor wings, but is clothed with a skin of feathers, made otherwiſe then that of other birds; it's not found but dead either upon the Earth, or in the Sea, no body ever ſaw its eggs, nor its neſt; and it's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that it lives by the Air; this Bird never being found upon Earth, is it not confonant to Reaſon, that it may come from ſome other Starre, where it lives and breeds, and that having flown higher, and beyond the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Center of that earth or Star where he lived; he dyeth by changing his Ayr, unto that which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural, and dying,

               <p>IF there were not many Worlds in this whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, God could not act ſo powerfully and freely, but that by ſome certain neceſſity and conſtraint; which would be a great impiety and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy even to imagine it: for God could aſſuredly, not onely have made other Worlds, but alſo much more perfect then this; for his power is neither ſhortened, nor exhauſted, neither the

                  <hi>Epicureus</hi> did ſay, That theſe Worlds were ſome of them without Sun or Moon, and ſome had greater then thoſe that lighten us; and that others had divers Suns, and that ſome of them were

                  <p>Containing the Solution of ſome Objections that may be made againſt this Paradox of the World's Plurality.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt ſome may ſay, There cannot be ſuch Men as we, in the Starres; for they could not live there, becauſe men are divers, even after the diverſity of Countreys; and thoſe who aſcend that high Mount <hi>Piracaca</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> dye there by reaſon of the too ſubtile ayr of the place. To which I anſwer, That thoſe men muſt needs be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from us, or indued
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56411:69"/>
with more robuſt and ſtrong bodies then we; or ſo well proportioned in the mixture of the Elements, that that Ayr cannot be obnoxious and hurtful to them; but that God hath ſo formed them, that they may well live where he hath placed them, but no where elſe.</p>
               <p>And if we had never ſeen or heard of the Sea, we could not be perſwaded, that Fiſhes could live in ſalt-water, and that therein they could breed and grow for our food; nor that thoſe Countreys of the burning and frozen Zones, could be inhabited: So muſt we believe, that God hath by prevention of inconvenience,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56411:70"/>
ordered all things for the beſt.</p>
               <p>Here alſo might be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Incommodities and incongruences that might befall the Inhabitants of the Moon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Meteors as the Clouds, and other which would offend them, and would hinder Plants to grow therein.</p>
               <p>We anſwer to this, That thoſe Meteors are far enough from it, and that rather they are leſſe moleſted by them then we; for <hi>Galileus</hi> did ſee with the teleſcope, that it doth not rain upon the Earth of the Moon.</p>
               <p>But it may be replyed, How then do the plants grow?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:56411:70"/>To which I anſwer, That they may grow in it, not only by reaſon of the Moon's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural humidity and moiſture, but alſo by the inundations of its Rivers; as in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where likewiſe no rain is ſeen; I ſay farther, That thoſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Moon have no more ground to alledge theſe Objections, being that when they look upon the Earth, through the miſts and clouds that incompaſs it, they might doubt whether any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures could be contained in it.</p>
               <p>But hitherto we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered none but weake ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. Now come we to that with which our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents do arm themſelves
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56411:71"/>
chiefly, which is that of the Prince of the <hi>Ariſtoteliſts,</hi> who as the <hi>Otthomans</hi> aymed to ſlay all his brothers, that he might reign more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> to beat down and ſuppreſſe all opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his; now this is his argument;</p>
               <p>If there were many worlds, the earth of thoſe worlds would move towards our Earth; or ours towards that of the other Worlds; and ſo the other Elements of the other worlds would reach ours, and ſo there would be nothing but a great tumult and Chaos.</p>
               <p>This Argument is ſo weak, that <hi>Magirus</hi> is conſtrained to ſpeak in theſe terms when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56411:71"/>
he alledges it, not being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able to find others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maintains not the truth; All theſe Reaſons, (ſaith he) and ſuch like Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophick Arguments, cannot perſpicuouſly demonſtrate, that there is but one World; and <hi>Charles Rapineus</hi> ſpeaks thus, That it can but weakly be ſo perſwaded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristoteles</hi> could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what we have above ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That each world hath its center, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto tend thoſe heavy bodies that are in its ſphere; But he arguments upon a falſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, making the Earth to be the Center of all the worlds, and allotting but one center for all; his Argument
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56411:72"/>
would be good, if his ground were good: for what he ſaith was true, it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that all heavy and ponderous things ſhould tend towards our Center; but there being many, they alſo go into divers Centers; for each Star hath its center that upholds it, and though it be of a ponderous nature, yet is it light, in itſelf. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus anſwered, and ſo plainly and fully reſolved the Objection of <hi>Ariſtoteles,</hi> the grand Prince of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, what may they expect who have not ſuch pregnant Objections as his.</p>

                  <p>Continuing the Solution of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Philoſophers Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Plurality of Worlds.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are yet objected; Firſt, That whereas there is but one principle and firſt Mover, or but one God and firſt cauſe, and that the world ought to anſwer in likeneſſe to its Architype, there alſo ought to be but one World. But we have here above ſhewed the contrary, becauſe that God is infinite, ſo alſo
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56411:73"/>
ought the Worlds to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>For a ſecond Argument, it's objected, That if there were more then one World, the Divine Scriptures would have communicated it to us; but ſpeaking but of one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it's not likely there ſhould be any more.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That the holy Scripture ſpeaks clearly of none but of ours; though yet in ſeverall places it agreeth in the plurality of Worlds, as we ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter demonſtrate; and that it ſpeaks after the manner of men, of all heavenly things, condeſcending to our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to the common opinion; as when it ſaith,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56411:73"/>
That the Sun and Moon are the great Lights, and yet the Moon is one of the ſmalleſt Stars; and there are ſome others that are as bigg as the Sun, as <hi>Canopus</hi> Starre, and others, and an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber bigger then the Moon: Likewiſe the Scripture ſaith, That God is angry, and doth repent, though he is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unchangeable; and therefore might the Scripture do the like concerning the motion of the Earth, and the plurality of Worlds.</p>
               <p>For a third Argument, <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaks thus; The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requiſite for the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world is but one, and heaped up together into one lump or body alone, and

the Heaven contains within it ſelf all the ſimple bodies, ſo that no part of the matter can remain, for therewith to compoſe and frame other Worlds.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That it's not neceſſary that all the matter be exhauſted and ſpent in the Creation of this our Earth alone, yea rather in the Creation of the whole Fabrick; but and if it had been all ſpent at the creation alone of this our Earth, God could yet create ſome new: And laſt of all, <hi>concedo totum,</hi> I grant the whole Argument, it proving nothing againſt my aſſertion; for I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the Worlds or Earths to be in Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:56411:74"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith farther againſt this opinion, That the World would be imperfect, if it ſhould not contain all; and ſecondly, would not be like its pattern, if it were not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and onely one, and that it would not be incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if there was any thing out of it.</p>
               <p>But we have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Objection touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unity; where we have diſcovered, That God being infinite, there muſt alſo be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Worlds: for as <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> ſaith, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing one alone of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is numbred in the World. And as for the laſt, <hi>Plutarch</hi> anſwers it, ſaying thus, That it hinders not the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56411:75"/>
World's perfection, that there are other Worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; for man is perfect, and yet contains not every thing. And to this anſwer I adde, That by this word <hi>World, Plato</hi> did underſtand the whole Fabrick of all theſe Earths or Worlds which make up but one whole world; his Arguments cannot at all overthrow my Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timplerus</hi> forms yet this Argument, If there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Worlds, they would have been made in vain, and to no purpoſe, becauſe no uſe of them can be ſhewed. This his Reaſon is ſo weak, that it will ſuffice to ſay, for to confute it, That though we
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56411:75"/>
may not know for what uſe they are made, yet they are not made for nothing; for by this ſame reaſon, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> from whence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great advantage and profit, and the Northern Countreys that yet are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, would alſo have been created in vain.</p>
               <p>Again, there are ſome who object, That if the Stars were inhabited, they would have need of the influence of other Stars and Heavens, <hi>uſque ad infinitum,</hi> without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That I am not much perſwaded, that the Starres are advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to us, the Sun and Moon excepted; it's not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56411:76"/>
that the Stars commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and ſerve one another mutually, and therefore there is no need of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Heavens.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, <hi>Zabarella</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments thus, If there were other Worlds, what in them ſhould be contained, would be either like to what is in this our World, or differing from it; if it were like it, in vain would individuals be multiplyed; if differing, it could not be found out how it's diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>To this Objection I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That men and other things in the <hi>Indies,</hi> would alſo have been created in vain, if his Reaſon was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; and that though we
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56411:76"/>
knew not what was in thoſe new Lands and Countreys, yet it was in them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſo likewiſe though we be ignorant of what is in the other Worlds, yet this our ignorance excludes not their being.</p>

World, ſuch as it is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all, and that all the matter was ſpent in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies out of it; for if there were any, they would be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple, or compoſed; if ſimple, it would be the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or the Elements: But they cannot be the Heaven, conſidering it changes not fully its place, but turns round upon it ſelf: Nor like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can it be an Element, becauſe it would be beyond nature; nor alſo a mixt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe that if there be not ſome ſimple bodies, there can be no mixt ones.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt there may yet ſome ſtand up, and ſay with <hi>Melancthon,</hi> That God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from creating, and reſted himſelf; but <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſpeaks, and meaneth onely the Creation of this our World: and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it's more conſonant, that ſome end, and others be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of new; as <hi>Empedocles</hi> did believe it, together with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56411:78"/>
                  <hi>Democritus;</hi> God hath limited his power, and he is ſtill the ſame for to create again, as he was afore: and as it's ſaid in the Book of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> ch. 11. v. 18. he wanteth not means to create of new unknown wild beaſts: Therefore both this and the other Arguments alledged by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> are weak againſt this our Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he himſelf being forced to confeſſe, he ſaith in his natural Phyſicks, that though his arguments do not fully conclude, yet they muſt be conſidered and weighed, leſt that if we believe that there are other worlds, we alſo ſhould believe other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and other natures of Men.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56411:79"/>
For my part, I ſee no neceſſity, that becauſe there are more Worlds, there muſt alſo be more Religions; the increaſe of this World, through the diſcovery of the <hi>Indies,</hi> hath not cauſed any new Religion; and it's very unlike from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of introducing Hereſie and Atheiſm; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently believe, that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable order of the World, which diſperſes the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and chaos, which by reaſon of mens ignorance do yet reign, will even make the greateſt Atheiſts of this world to confeſſe, That they cannot have their originall but from God alone, who is the Soveraign Creator of all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:56411:79"/>
                  <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſaith farther, That if there were divers Worlds, it would be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſuffer death ſeveral times for to ſave them all: but what do we know, whether thoſe Men in the Stars are better then thoſe that are in this world, whereof Satan is called the Prince, and where he abides; for which cauſe St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in Chap. 12. &amp; v. 12. of the <hi>Revelations, Therefore rejoyce ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them; wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the Sea, for the Devil is come down unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though we ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, that thoſe men in the Starres have need
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56411:80"/>
of ſalvation, God hath ſo many means and wayes, to us unknown, for to ſave them, and to ſatisfie his Juſtice, that we need not inform our ſelves about theſe things, but believe them in faith, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating our underſtandings; as an ancient Father of the Church hath well ſpoken.</p>
               <p>But ſome may object, Who is he that will believe it?</p>
               <p>To whom I ſhall reply with <hi>Plato,</hi> No wicked man ſhall ever know it; but he onely who ſhall be found worthy of it. Let then thoſe who are unworthy of ſo high and ſublime knowledge, withdraw hence, their groſs ſpirit cannot apprehend the

                  <p>Proving the Plurality of Worlds, by a Reaſon drawn from the place of Hell.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme ſcrupulous perſons might ſay, That the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Chapter ſeems in ſomething to contradict the doctrine of the Church: But I ſhall anſwer him, That
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56411:81"/>
if any one ſhould endeavour to prove, that there is no Hell, his Opinion ſhould certainly be eſteemed erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and pernicious; but to do nothing but to eſtabliſh and confirm it, as I do in this Chapter, and to remark the place where it is, being that the Divines cannot certainly point out the place, I find nothing in it repugnant to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Now whereas our bodies are to riſe from the dead, for to be rewarded according to their deſerts good or evill, and that the damned are in greater number then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the place of Hell muſt needs be very ſpatious and great to contain them all,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56411:81"/>
and ſolid and firm to uphold them; but it cannot be any where but in one of the Stars, and ſo conſequently the Stars may have Inhabitants in them; for it's ſaid, That the Center of the Earth, becauſe it is the center of the World, and the fartheſt place from Heaven; but that I cannot find it needful to place it in the Center of the World, conſidering that God is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every where, and that men cannot alienate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from him; and alſo becauſe it's very eaſie to prove the contrary, not only in that it could not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to contain in it ſelf all the damned that have been ſince the Creation, and ſhall
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56411:82"/>
be unto the end, nor can be penetrated through by their lumpiſh bodies; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Earth it ſelf at the day of Judgment muſt be conſumed and done away, as <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſaith in 4th Chapter, and 42 verſe of his ſecond book; but alſo in this, that not the earth, but the Sun is the Center of the worlds; the Sun then by reaſon of its far diſtance from the higheſt Heavens, ſaith <hi>Foſcarinus,</hi> is the true place of Hell, even as its ſiery nature required; for the internall habitations ſeems to perſwade it: but I cannot admit this opinion, though that I hold, that Hell muſt be in one of the Stars; but to ſeat it in ſo beautiful a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56411:82"/>
Star as the Sun is, I cannot conſent to it; ſeeing that the damned Souls cannot merit ſo good and advantagious an habitation.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, It may ſeem more plauſible and conſonant to truth, to ſeat the Paradiſe of God in the Sun, according to that Text in the Pſalms, <hi>In S<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>IT may likewiſe be proved, That Paradiſe is no where elſe but in the Stars: Now it's moſt clear and certain, that it's not this Earth, but a new Earth, wherein is the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which muſt needs be a ſolid place, as well as our Earth, that it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56411:83"/>
may hold us up, wherein all joy and happineſſe ſhall be; and out of which ſhall all miſeries and torments be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; this place is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of old for men, and what do we know but that we ſhall be diſperſed into ſeverall Stars; doth not our Lord Chriſt Jeſus aſſure us, <hi>That in his Fathers houſe are many Manſions:</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> in the 4. chap. &amp; 7. ver. of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, tels us, <hi>How many Springs are above the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which are the out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Paradiſe.</hi> It may be that after we have inhabited this Earth of miſery and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, wherein death and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity are the wages of our ſins, we ſhall be introduced
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56411:84"/>
into thoſe high Globes wherein we ſhall live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in fulneſſe of happineſſe and joy. Is it not ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. ver. 28. <hi>To him that overcomes, will I give the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star?</hi> And <hi>Job,</hi> in the 38. and 7. v. doth ſee through Faith, <hi>the Morning Stars ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and all the Sons of Men ſhouting for joy.</hi> This his Viſion ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, when we ſhall tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon theſe moving won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and if by reaſon of thoſe glorious objects we may remember the things of this Earth, we ſhall from thoſe vaſt habitations of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, look with great contempt and diſdain upon this lump of Earth, ſo highly eſteemed

of men, and by them divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſo many Regions, and Countreys; and upon that drop of water, by them divided into ſo many Seas.</p>
               <p>May it not alſo be that the Earthly Paradiſe, or Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> out of which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was driven, was the ſame place whereunto we ſhall return; he was driven out of it for his ſins, without which he had not taſted death.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56411:85"/>
the Circle of the Moon, and that there are <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> thoſe Antients were not far from my opinion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inconveniencies that would follow, if we did ſeat it in this our World: for if to believe that this Paradiſe was upon this Earth, it's a very hard thing; for it's of no moment to rely upon the names of the Rivers, and Countreys, that are named in the tranſlation of the Holy Scripture, conſidering that the Hebrew names in it are not conforme; and that the Tranſlators do yeild, that they have Interpreted them but by conjecture, and as nigh as they could gueſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56411:85"/>Again, this Paradiſe can no more be found on the Earth; nor thoſe Rivers, that are ſaid to be thoſe whom <hi>Moſes,</hi> doth mention, do not iſſue from one and the ſame Spring, as it's recorded of thoſe of Paradiſe. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would be a ridiculous thing, to believe that God hath driven his people from that place, which he ſuffers the <hi>Turks,</hi> and other Infidels to enjoy, it being that whole Country, apprehended to have been this Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of delight. Before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter, I will here alledge two notable things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that as there is no Book, though never ſo

bad, but there is alſo ſome good in it: Neither is there any Religion but hath ſome good Maxims. The <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> being perſwaded by appearances do not at all doubt but that after death, they go to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the World of the Moon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that there are already divers bodies in Hell, and alſo in Paradiſe. In Hell are thoſe who have yeilded up their bodies to the unclean ſpirits, and Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; but in Paradiſe are <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> which both places to hold up thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, muſt needs be ſolid, which ſolidity cannot be but in ſome Stars, or Star,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56411:86"/>
where God doth manifeſt himſelf more clearly and viſibly, and where are thoſe Rocks of eternity, whereof it's ſpoken by <hi>Moſes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we muſt deſire to go, and there to dwell, exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this Valley of miſery to the great advantage and comfort of our glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

               <p>We may ſay it with better ground then he, ſeeing he onely ſpoke of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and we ſpeak of Worlds diſtinct and ſeparated, and prove it by ſo many Arguments, as if we could not come to an end of them; for it may yet be proved, in that the Earth and the Moon deprive each other mutually of the Sun; which deed doth teſtifie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and that both may ſuffer Eclipſes; alſo by their mutual communications, cold qualities, ſolidity and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that help us to ſee it;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56411:90"/>
for many think, that we ſhould ſcarcc ſee it, were it not for its irregularities, which cauſe its light better to reverberate the beames of the Sun.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add to this, That if God, who could make many Worlds, had not made them, his power might be ſaid, in ſome reſpects, to have been idle, unprofitable, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for though it ayms not ſo much to the works, as to the end of them, yet it being for his greater glory, though he doth not whatſoever he can, we cannot aſſert, That he was not willing to make many Worlds; as we cannot
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56411:90"/>
deny, but he had the power to make them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the common and general opinion grants, the four Elements to be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for it believed, that there is the Empyred Heaven, that is the Heaven of fire, the cryſtal Heaven, that is of a wateriſh nature; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Stars, which is ſolid, and by conſequence of an earthly nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Air is apprehended to be amongſt thoſe Stars: the four Elements then are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and why may not there be alſo mixt and compoſed bodies? and why not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as well as the cauſes,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56411:91"/>
which compoſe them, are in it? and why could they not act as well within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in things far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Creation of the world, or of many worlds, is a thing that wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends from the free Will of God, neither can it be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any natural reaſon; for God acts not outwardly by neceſſity, as to limit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely to this our World; but on the contrary, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth whatſoever implyeth not contradiction: But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worlds do not imply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, neither from God, nor from the thing created;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56411:91"/>
and it ſeems requiſite, that the object be the meaſure of the power; but this World not being infinite as God is, there muſt needs be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of them.</p>

of the Proſpective-glaſſes, what is within the Stars, and chiefly in the Moon; no doubt ſuch a Tower would ſerve much, being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very high Hill.</p>

                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:56411:104"/>
the Sun appears more majeſticall then ordinarily, which cannot proceed but from the heighth of that Mountain. And though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be diſcovered from ſuch a Tower, which I cannot believe, yet it would be a work of immortal name to that Prince who would do it.</p>
               <p>And that it may be out of doubt, that from a high Mountain, or ſome ſuch place high elevated, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be ſeen and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Stars, <hi>Bethancour</hi> in his Travels aſſerts, That from the top of <hi>Teneriſa,</hi> a very high Mountain in the <hi>Canaries,</hi> the Sun may be ſeen

this our Terreſtrial Globe, that upon that he conceived an exceeding great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe, who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their life, did venture it, for to get a famous name (though but vain) in that little corner of the Earth. Both <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> have compoſed Books con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Dream, and have doubted under what ſort of dreams this was to be entred. For my part, I think that it muſt be called a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being he ſaw things that are reall, <hi>viz.</hi> the airy Lands, and the Stary and Planeticall people. Or it may be, that having ſuch a belief, he was deſirous to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56411:107"/>
propoſe it, as many others in ſuch like caſe have done, thereby to ſee how it would be received: And truly, if this was his ſcope, he hath had no bad ſucceſſe; for it hath been embraced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny illuſtrious Perſons, who have found it conſonant to Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, Is it not beyond all reaſon and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that ſo many huge and vaſte bodies as the Stars are, ſhould remain barren and fruitleſſe. I think, that if I ſhould diſcourſe orderly, and gradually with the moſt opinionative man that is, that I ſhould obtain of him,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56411:107"/>
that thoſe bodies, whereof ſome are three hundred times bigger then the Earth, do at leaſt bear ſome plants; and if this were granted, how could theſe plants be there, if they were not for the uſe of ſome living Creatures: and if it could be granted, that there be ſome creatures, may it not alſo be granted, that there are Men for to make uſe of them, being they are made for them? And laſtly, is it not lawfull and equall, that there be men whither ſoever their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion reaches; but Man rules the Stars, as well as the Earth and Sea, the whole World is made for him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56411:108"/>
there muſt needs be ſome Inhabitants in the Stars.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I conclude this Diſcourſe, I think it yet convenient to anſwer them, who think that they have hit right on the head of the nayl, when they ſay, that the Spots in the Moon are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the figure of the Earth's ſhadow, which communicate themſelves in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56411:109"/>
the Moon, as in a Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe; but they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there is no ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy nor reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Spots, and thoſe of our general Mapp; nor that in dark nights this figure can be communicated to the Moon; or could it be ſaid, That thoſe Mountains in the Moon, are nothing but ſome flat and low obſcurities; But I anſwer, That the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of thoſe Mountains ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and turns as the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a Sea-Compaſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably as the Sun in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens them diverſly, which could not be, were they not bodies high elevated; for they would be without ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56411:109"/>
and Monſieur <hi>Gaſsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> did ſometimes ſay, That he had mathematically mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the heighth of ſome Mountains and valleys in the Moon by means of their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; and that he had found the heighth of the Mountains in the Moon to be much more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then of thoſe of the Earth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containing an Argument drawn from thoſe mountains that are in the Moon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE muſt obſerve that the Moon being half full, more or leſſe out of it are ſeen many little ſpots, as drops of Water, or Orient Pearls very bright. Now they are the tops of the Mountains, that are lighted by the ſplendour of the Sun, becauſe they aſcend as high as that part of the Moon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56411:110"/>
which is inlightned; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mountains are broad at the foot, and are dark at the bottome, thoſe drops appear to be ſomewhat ſcattered one from the other, and ſo ſeem looſed from the Moon, though they be not. So likewiſe if one ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template from above the Mount <hi>Pireneus,</hi> or the <hi>Alps,</hi> he would only ſee their top in the form of ſo many Pearls, becauſe the top of them would reverberate the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Sun, and their Snows would encreaſe the light of it.</p>
               <p>Obſerve alſo that <hi>Paul</hi> in his 1. to the <hi>Cor.</hi> c. 15. v. 40.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56411:111"/>
aſſerts that the <hi>Glory of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bodies, is divers from that of the terrestrial, and that there is one glory of the Sun, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory of the Moon, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other glory of the Stars.</hi> But if they differ in glory, they do ſo by reaſon of the variety of creatures that are in them; in the 47. verſe, the Apoſtle ſeems to indicate that there are heavenly men, and alſo earthly men.</p>
               <p>The Courteous Reader is intreated to conſider that this is onely a fragment of the Volume intended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, for to ſet forth the life and Philoſophy of <hi>Democritus,</hi> who aſſerted this opinion: So
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56411:111"/>
that I ſay onely what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his poſition. But if it ſeems in any particulars to oppoſe and contradict the Principles of Religion, and that my Arguments do not give full ſatisfaction, I ſhall freely retract and uncloath my ſelf of this opinion, if it be any wayes noxious to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if it be recited and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ignorant perſons, who are not able, nor ſit to anſwer to the Objections, and cannot or will not weigh them by reaſon, I have what I expect. But if learned and wiſe perſons can ſhew me the contrary with ſound proofs, and ſtrong reaſons, they ſhall
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56411:112"/>
find me ready to yield up this my opinion to their cenſures. Though above fifty Authors of this ſame opinion, going before me, have not yet been contradicted. I hope that I give no more occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte then they.</p>
