            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Shall only thus far endeavour to prepossess the Reader
in Favour of the following Papers, as to assure him,
That the Author is not Conscious to himself of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advanced any Notion that is repugnant to the
Sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Antiquity;</hi> To the <hi>Articles</hi> of
our own <hi>Church,</hi> or the Opinions of its greatest <hi>Divines</hi>
who have treated this Subject. The Authority of the King
over our <hi>Convocations</hi> has indeed been of late disputed by
some; and a Learned <hi>Treatise</hi> that was writ in Defence of
it, has had the Misfortune of meeting with a great many
Enemies, that are very free in thier Censures upon it; what
their Reasons are themselves best know: For they are so
kind as not to let them appear in Publick.</p>
            <p>But these Papers are only designed to give as true a State
and Notion of the Controversie as the Authors Enquiries could
lead him into, and not for a Vindication of others Opinions:
And if they should chance to fall in with any of those deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that forementioned Treatise, it was no other than a
sober and impartial View of the Subject that occasioned it.
And I can't but think that they who assent to the <hi>Articles</hi> of
our Church, can hardly deny joyning in the same Notions.</p>
            <p>It is very common with the Managers of Disputes of
late, to fix Characters of Ignominy upon those who dissent
from them. And some who have engaged in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
for want of other Arguments, have thought I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to carry the Cause by insulting over their Adversaries
as <hi>Latitudinarians</hi> and <hi>Erastians.</hi> And therefore, least they
should fix the same Titles upon the Author of these Thoughts,
he desires they would first answer these two Queries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105505:3"/>
Whether he who advances no other <hi>Doctrin</hi> than what
has always been maintained by the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
and is intirely agreeable to its 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> can justly be
charged by any Member of that Church, as a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi>
in point of <hi>Doctrin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whether he who subscribes to the Government of
the same <hi>Church</hi> as by Law Established, and maintains
no other Notions but what our <hi>Convocations</hi> have agreed
to, and are at this Day the standing Rules delivered to us
in her Ecclesiastical <hi>Canons and Constitutions,</hi> can by any
Member of the <hi>Church of</hi> England be reasonably charged
as an <hi>Erastian</hi> in point of <hi>Church-government?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if he that guides himself by these Methods is in
the wrong, the Church must answer for his Errors, and
not he for being obliged to defend her. And therefore the
Church must be taxt with our false Principles, if they are
such, or it ought to be shewn, wherein we have differed
from her.</p>
            <p>It may probably be one Objection against these Papers,
that a Book of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s is sometimes cited in them, which
lies under the Censure of <hi>Erastian Principles.</hi> It is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to my present Business to engage in its Defence; <hi>Ger.
Vossius</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Epis. 23.</note> gives it the Character of a most Excellent Book,
and offers to defend it against all Opposers. But it is
enough to my purpose, that there is nothing cited from him,
that is disagreeable to the Doctrines of our <hi>Church:</hi> And
it was not his Authority, but the strength of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that occasion'd his being introduced in the Debate.</p>
            <p>But I hope the other Authorities that are here made use
of can have no such Objections against them. Tho' if these
Papers are condemned they can hardly escape, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Characters they have always bore in the World ought
to secure them from such Treatment, since if this Author
is an Error, 'tis they who have led him into it.</p>

            <head>SOME
THOUGHTS
ON A
Convocation, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE stating the Rights and Authority of the
Clergy, must be confest to be a very nice and
tender Point; and in Attempts of this Nature,
it is almost impossible not to offend.</p>
            <p>Let a Man deliver his Opinions with never so much Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and Caution; yet after all, he must expect to find
that some Party or other will be displeased.</p>
            <p>The asserting the Privileges of the Clergy, but even as
far as those Bounds which Religion and the Laws of the
Land have set them, and the Nature of their Function re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
is almost a downright Affront to a sort of Men, who
think the whole Order useless, and their Office only an
Imposition upon the Rights and Liberties of the rest of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>And the not carrying their Authority to a higher pitch,
than the Constitution of the State does or can admit of,
or than the Law of God has allowed; or even to such <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,</hi>
as some Mens mistaken Zeal would challenge to
belong to them, is represented as an Indignity to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and an open Violation of the Rights and Honours of
that Profession.</p>
            <p>I shall not concern my self in determining whose Censure
'tis most safe to fall under.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105505:4"/>
But this seems very apparent, That the pretending to
too unlimited a Power, is as great a Prejudice, and of as
dangerous Consequence to the Clergy, as the parting with
some of their just Rights and Privileges: Either of these
Extreams may be fatal; and therefore the more Caution
is required to avoid them.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a great Weakness in any Clergy, to raise
themselves Enemies in the State, by laying Claim to an
Authority which is none of theirs. The intolerable Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the <hi>See of Rome</hi> on the Rights of Princes, and the
Revolutions occasioned by it, in a great many parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
afford us Instances enough of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Let us, in God's Name, maintain the Honours and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of the Holy Function, as far as of right we may;
but let us not extend them to such a Power and Superiority,
as neither the Laws of God will justifie, nor those of the
Land admit of; and which the first Ages of the Church
(after the State was Christian) never exercised.</p>
            <p>The whole Controversie about a <hi>Convocation</hi> may be, I
think, reduced to this. Either that the time and manner of
its sitting, acting or debating, is to be determined by the
Laws of the Land, and the Prudence of the supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
or that the Clergy have a Power by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
on the State, to assemble themselves, decree and
enact Ecclesiastical Laws, without the Consent of the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Authority.</p>
            <p>If the latter of these Notions be true, 'tis plain, That
all human Laws to the contrary, can be of no force: A
Divine Institution being unalterable by any other Power.
And if any other Power has decreed any thing in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, 'tis a Sin to submit to its Commands.</p>
            <p>But in Cases of this Nature, where such a Right is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
it ought to be made very clear and indisputable
from the express Declaration of Scripture; or at least,
from the Practice of the first Christians, where any Parallel
Instances can be produced: Though I think this latter is an
Argument of far less Authority than the former; and if
there had been Instances of Convocations like ours in the
Apostles Days, yet this would not prove their Divine
Right, unless there could be shew'd a Command of God for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105505:4"/>
it; for a great many Examples have not the force of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
even in Scripture it self, but are of an inferiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and serve for no other Purpose than to direct what
may be most proper to be done in like Cases. As the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Deaconesses</hi> and others, tho' as early as the Apostles
Age, is now wholly laid aside. The end of its Institution
ceasing, which was to instruct the younger Women in the
Faith, when there were stronger Reasons for the abolishing
it. Prudence is to judge how far such Examples are to be
followed.</p>
            <p>Now whether this Notion of <hi>a Divine Right</hi> has any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in Scripture, or can be grounded upon any Examples
in the Primitive Church or not; it is past all Controversie,
that our Kings have an Authority devolved on them by
our Laws, and acknowledg'd as of Right belonging to
them over our <hi>Convocations;</hi> and that the Clergy neither
have, or can pretend to have, by our Constitution, the
Liberty or Power to meet after that manner without their
Assent. This is very evident from the Writs, by which
they are summoned to assemble.</p>
            <p>And as they cannot meet but by the King's Writ, so
neither when met, can they make any Canon, or Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without his Licence and Approbation.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a Convocation always summoned, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a Parliament is called, according to the ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:
And hence some have thought, That they ought
to claim the same Right and Liberty to enact Laws for the
Good of the Church, as the other for the Advantage and
Welfare of the State.</p>
            <p>But the Case is very different; the Reasons of calling
the Clergy anciently, every Parliament, was upon a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Account; because they were then look'd upon as a
Member of the Parliament, and could not be taxt but by
their own Grants: But that Reason is now, in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
out of Doors. And though they are still summoned,
that they may be ready upon all Occasions, to advise and
counsel the King in making Provisions for the Security of
Religion, and the Preservation of the Church; yet as there
is not always the same Necessity for their sitting and acting, as
for the Parliaments, so the King is made the sole Arbiter of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105505:5"/>
But this Particular has lately been so fully and largely
discussed by a very learned Pen, that there is no need of
farther Addition.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Wake.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, if we may stand to the Decision of the Laws
of the Land, this whole Controversie will soon be at an end:
For it is no difficult matter to be resolved about the Power
the King is invested with, by being <hi>Head of the Church;</hi>
and what Privileges are reserved for the Clergy by their
own Suffrage and Decree in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and by Act of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>The King, by his Power, is to call the Convocation, they
are to assemble only by his Writs, they are to debate upon
such Matters as he shall offer, and are to constitute no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or make any Laws without his Consent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is very apparent from the Act of Parliament,</hi> where
the King's humble and obedient Subjects,<note place="margin">Act. Parl. <hi>An. 25. Hen.</hi> VIII. Upon the submission of the Clergy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of Appeals.</note> the Clergy of this
Realm of <hi>England,</hi> have not only acknowledged according to
the Truth, That the Convocations of the same Clergy, is, always
hath been, and ought to be assembled only by the King's Writ,
but also submitting themselves to the King's Majesty, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<hi>in Verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> That they will never from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
presume to attempt, alledge, claim or put in ure, enact,
promulge, or execute, any new Canons, Constitutions, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Provincial, or other, or by whatsoever other Name they shall
be called in the Convocation, unless the King's most Royal Assent
and Licence may to them be had, to make, promulge and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the same; and that His Majesty do give His most Royal
Assent and Authority in that Behalf. And where divers Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
Ordinances, and Canons Provincial, or Synodal, which
heretofore have been enacted, and be thought not only to be much
prejudicial to the King's Prerogative Royal, and repugnant to
the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, but also over-much onerous
to His Highness and His Subjects; the said Clergy hath most
humbly besought the King's Highness, That the said Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Canons may be committed to the Examination and
Iudgment of His Highness, and of two and thirty Persons of the
King's Subjects, whereof sixteen to be of the upper and nether House
of the Parliament of the Temporalty, and other sixteen to be of the
Clergy of this Realm; and all the said two and thirty Persons, to
be chosen and appointed by the King's Majesty. And that such of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105505:5"/>
the said Constitutions and Canons, as shall be thought and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the said two and thirty, or the more part of them, shall
be approved to stand with the Laws of God, and consonant to
the Laws of this Realm, shall stand in their full Strength and
Power; the King's most Royal Assent first had and obtained to the
same. Be it therefore now enacted by Authority of this present
Parliament, according to the said Submission and Petition of the
said Clergy, That they, ne any of them, from henceforth shall
presume to attempt, alledge, claim, or put in ure, any Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
or Ordinances Provincial, or Synodal, or any other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons:
Nor shall enact, promulge, or execute any such Canons,
Constitutions, or Ordinances Provincial, by whatsoever Name
or Names they may be called, in their Convocations in time
coming (which always shall be assembled by Authority of the
King's Writ) unless the same Clergy may have the King's most
Royal Assent and Licence, to make, promulge, and execute such
Canons, Constitutions, and Ordinances Provincial, or Synodal,
upon pain of every one of the said Clergy, doing contrary to this
Act, and being thereof convict, to suffer Imprisonment, and
make Fine at the King's Will.</p>
            <p>They are indeed left at Liberty, to give what Judgment
they think fit, upon such Matters as are offered to them;
and their Determinations and Decisions about them, are
solely in their own Breasts: But they cannot have the Force
of a Law, unless he will be pleased both to approve and
confirm them.</p>
            <p>And this is the Nature of Ecclesiastical Synods, amongst
us by our Constitution. And as this preserves the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Sovereign, so does it not infringe the Liberty
of the Clergy. No Ecclesiastical Canons or Constitutions,
can be made without them: Nothing can be accounted
Heresie, or censured as such, but what by lawful Synods
has been already condemned; decreed to be such, with the
King's Consent by our own <hi>Convocations;</hi> whose Acts have
been ratified and confirmed by Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus, tho' the Clergy can't, by their own Power, meet
in Convocation, nor decree or enact any Ecclesiastical Laws
without the Sovereign Authority; yet neither can any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Canon be made, or any new Heresie be declared,
without their Advice and Approbation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105505:6"/>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> is indeed of Opinion,<note place="margin">De Imperio sum. Potest. circa Sacra. c. 7.</note> That the supream Civil
Authority, has a Right to make Laws, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Clergy for the Government of the Church. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if it could not, it would receive some Right of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
from the Synod, and consequently could not be
supream; whereas the highest Power being subject to God
alone, has under him the sole Right of Governing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
if the supream Power could not enforce the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of that without a Synod, which it might with one,
then it should receive part of its Right and Authority to
govern from thence: And by Consequence some part of
the Government must be lodged in the Synod. Which it
can neither challenge by Human or Divine Right. God
having no-where committed such a Power to the Church;
and therefore not to Synods. And for these Reasons, he is
of Opinion, That the highest Power has a Right to make
Orders for the Government of the Church without a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.
And to confirm it, he adds the Examples of the
<hi>Hebrew Kings,</hi> and some of the <hi>first Christian Emperors,</hi>
that have exercised their Authority about things sacred,
without any such Convention of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>But tho' these Reasons should prove such a Right in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
to belong to the supream Power, yet it cannot be doubted
but that the same Power may so far dispense with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it, as to consent, That no Laws shall be made
relating to Religion, without the Counsel and Approbation
of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>But if it may be thought reasonable to have the Advice of
the Clergy, in all Matters of such Importance, it must be
also absolutely necessary, That the Civil Power which is
to enforce the Observance of the Injunctions, resolved on
by the Spiritual, should have the Right of judging of its
Determinations; especially, where all Mens Consciences,
as well <hi>secular</hi> as <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> are to be concluded by
them.</p>
            <p>This is most certain, That it is a Duty incumbent on
the Prince, whether the Clergy give their Opinions or not,
to reform and correct Abuses in the Church,<note place="margin">See Bp. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s <hi>Duct. Dub.</hi> L. 3. C. 3.</note> and he must
answer for his Neglect to God, if he does not do so. And
if before any Declaration of the Judgment of the Clergy, he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105505:6"/>
has a Right to order what is necessary in sacred Affairs, 'tis
plain, That his Power is superior to theirs; and that it cannot
be less at the meeting of a Synod, than it was before it.
The supream Authority continues the same, whether it acts
by the Counsel of others, or without it. And there can be
no Obligation to comply with it, but that of Reason and
Prudence.</p>
            <p>The Notion of the King's <hi>Supremacy, over all Persons,
and in all Causes, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil,</hi> established
by our Laws, owned and asserted by our Clergy, and very
frequently vindicated with much Strength and Learning
by the greatest Men of our Church, ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
grants all that Right and Power to the King, over
Convocations that we contend for.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This Power,<note place="margin">Eccl. Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. l. 8. <hi>p.</hi> 462.</note> says <hi>the Excellent Mr.</hi> Hooker, being
sometime in the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who by sinister Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
had drawn it into his Hands, was for <hi>Iust Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
by Publick Consent,</hi> annex'd unto the King's
Royal Seat and Crown; <hi>from thence the Authors of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
would translate it into their National Assemblies or
Synods: Which Synods are the only Helps, which they think
lawful to use against such Evils in the Church, as particular
Iurisdictions are not sufficient to redress.</hi> In which Cause,
our Laws have provided, That the King's Super-eminent
Authority and Power shall serve: As namely, when the whole
Ecclesiastical State, or the Principal Persons therein, do
need Visitation and Reformation; when in any part of
the Church, Errors, Schisms, Heresies, Abuses, Offences,
Contempts, Enormities are grown; which Men in their
several Jurisdictions either do not, or cannot help.
Whatsoever any Spiritual Power and Authority, (such
as Legats from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> did sometime exercise)
hath done, or might heretofore have done, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
of those Evils in lawful sort, (that is to say,
without the Violation of the Laws of God, or Nature in
the Deed done) as much in every Degree our Laws have
fully granted, that the King for ever may do, not
only by setting Ecclesiastical Synods on work, that the
thing may be their Act, and the King the Motioner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, <hi>for so much perhaps, the Masters of the Reformation

Account of the Power our King has over his Convocations
by the Law of the Land, but also a Vindication of that
Law, in investing him with such Authority. And I the
rather thought it deserved to be taken notice of, that I
might oppose the Judgment of this great and learned Man
to the Censures of <hi>two late Authors,</hi>

            <p>The Author of the <hi>Municipium Ecclesiasticum,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
insults over <hi>that Convocation,</hi> as under the lash of a

of the <hi>Convocation-Act.</hi> But this is a great Blunder;
for the <hi>Praemunire</hi> was off at least three Years before,<note place="margin">See Rast. Stat. 22. H. VIII.</note> and
released by Act of Parliament, in the 22d of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi>
the <hi>Convocation-Act</hi> being not till the 25th.</p>
            <p>But to let that pass, this whole <hi>Eighth Book of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Polity,</hi> is designed for a Vindication of the Kings Power
in that Particular, as also of our Laws, and the Consent
of the Clergy, by which it was confirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Except therefore, we make the King's Authority over
the Clergy,<note place="margin">Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, p. 469.</note> less in the greatest things, than the Power
of the meanest Governors is in all things over those
which are under them, how should we think it a Matter
decent, that the Clergy should impose Laws, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream

            </p>
            <p>But lest some sort of Men should pretend, that this <hi>8th</hi>
Book is not so much, and truly Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s, as those
which are published by himself, which however is not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
by the last of these Authors mentioned, that quotes
from it, how much to his purpose, I shall consider here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.<note place="margin">Preface p. 44. Ed. Lond. 1682.</note>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:105505:7"/>
I shall add a Passage out of his Preface. There was
(says he, speaking in Reference to some who had a Dislike
to the Constitution of the Church, then established by Law)
in my poor Understanding, no Remedy; but to set down
this as my final resolute Persuasion, <q>Surely the present
Form of Church-Government, which the Laws of this
Land have established, is such as no Law of God, nor
Reason of Man, hath hitherto been alledged of Force
sufficient to prove they do ill; who, to the uttermost
of their Power, withstand the Alteration thereof. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise,
the other, which instead of it, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to accept, is only by Error and Misconceit,
named the Ordinance of Jesus Christ, no one Proof as
yet brought forth, whereby it may clearly appear to be
so in very deed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I have chiefly consider'd what Power the King
has over the Meetings of Ecclesiastical Synods, by our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.
And if, in Opposition to this, any Laws had
been made whilst we were under the Popish Tyranny, and
Usurpation, that had exempted the Clergy from any such
Subjection to the supream Authority, as 'tis certain there
were none,<note place="margin">Vid. Stat. 16. R. 2. against purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Bulls from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> the King's Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
asserted against the Encroachments of the Pope and
Clergy upon it; I think we might justly have deny'd them
to be any Argument in the present Controversie.</p>
            <p>But all that we can urge from our Laws, will prove lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the Case before us, if the Clergy had an Antecedent
Right to meet in Convocation by a Divine Commission; or
are invested with a separate Authority, by the Law of
God, of making Orders for the Government of the Church,
whether the Sovereign Power be Christian or not; and of
obliging all Men in Conscience to observe them, without
any Consent or Licence from thence.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis strange, if there should be any such Divine
Right, that the Clergy not only at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but to
this very time, should be so very ignorant of it, as not
only by a tacit Consent to submit to, but in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
acknowledge and publickly defend this superior
Power in the Prince, either to prevent their meeting, or
forbid their making any Canons, unless they had first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105505:8"/>
his Order and Licence. If this <hi>Divine Right</hi> had
been plainly declared in Scripture, it could not have been
over look'd; and if 'tis not plainly there, it can with no
tolerable shew of Reason be pretended to.</p>
            <p>And that this Notion of a <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Convocations,
is altogether precarious, seems evident upon these two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
<hi>First,</hi> That all the first Synods, where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was <hi>Christian,</hi> were summoned and conven'd by his
Authority; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Power of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's,<note place="margin">G. Voss. Ep. 23.</note>
was never disputed by the Clergy as an Usurpation
upon their <hi>Rights;</hi> but on the contrary, was always appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of by them.</p>
            <p>For the Practice of the Church, in those times, is of
great Moment in the present Controversie: For if there is
such a Divine Right lodg'd in the Clergy, of meeting, either
to decide Disputes, or make Ecclesiastical Laws without
the Consent of the Sovereign Power; it is strange, that
the Clergy in those early Ages of Christianity, should so
quietly part with their Privilege; or that an Emperor, who
was so mighty zealous for Religion, as <hi>Constantine</hi> was,
should violate the Rights of the Church in so notorious a
manner, and overthrow its Constitution even contrary to
a Divine Appointment, by summoning <hi>Councils,</hi> as he did,
by his own Authority.</p>
            <p>If the Clergy had such a Right, as is now pretended, it
could not so soon be forgotten, as in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time;
nor could they have given it up, or the Emperor have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it from them, without sin.</p>
            <p>It must then be confess'd, to be a good Argument against
the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of any thing, where the Scripture is silent,
that the contrary was practised, within three or four Ages
after Christ, even by Men, who are allowed on all sides,
to be of the most Orthodox Principles, who could not but
know the Rights of the Church; and who, if they did know
them, would never suffer them to be violated.</p>
            <p>Now that Christian Princes have pretended to this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of assembling General Councils and National Synods;
and that the Clergy have met, upon their Summons, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable:
And 'tis also evident, That the Clergy, when
the State was first Christian, never thunder'd out any Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105505:8"/>
against it, for this pretended Authority; that they
never censured it as an Usurpation upon their unalienable
Privilege, but always quietly and readily submitted to the
Prince's Summons, without disputing from whence he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
that Power over them.</p>
            <p>Indeed before the supream Authority was Christian, the
Clergy had a Right to convene themselves, to make what
Orders might seem requisite for the Good of the Church.<note place="margin">See Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, 1640. Can. 1.</note>
In this Case, the Church has a Right like that of the State:
In the Vacancy of the Government, the Members of each
may assemble, consult, and make Orders, as the Exigencies
of the Church or State may require.</p>
            <p>Some, I know, have insisted upon this as an Argument, to
prove an independent Authority in the Church from that of
the State; and they are of Opinion, That the same Liberty
which the Clergy then exercised, in meeting upon Affairs of
the Church, is still their Right in Equity, tho' the State be
Christian. For the Church ought not to lose any of these
Rights and Privileges by the Conversion of Princes, which it
enjoyed before.</p>
            <p>But the Case is widely different, and therefore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
cannot be the same. The Church and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
were then two different Societies, very opposite to
each other. But where they profess the same Religion, are
incorporated into the same Society, and are under one
common Governour, they are both subordinate to that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and no Laws can be made to bind either, but what shall
be approved of by him: As for the Right which the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
had, before the State was converted, it was only pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential,
and was theirs no longer, than whilst the supream
Power was Heathen. When the chief Authority had no
Relation to the Church, it could not be under its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the Care of it must belong to the Clergy, who
were then most immediately to be concerned for it. But
this Power was to cease, when the chief Governor became
Christian, who upon that Account, engaged to defend and
protect the Church; and the Reason of the things, and the
Nature of Government, do both require that it should be
lodged there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105505:9"/>
It was the Misfortune of the Church, and the Necessity
of the Clergy's taking care of it in a State of Persecution,
that made them do it: It was no Privilege belonging to
their Function; and therefore, a Christian Ruler coming,
the Power was to return to the right Channel, and the
Clergy lost not a Privilege, but were freed from the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Care they had before.</p>
            <p>For in those things, where there is no Prohibition or
Caution in the Divine Law, the Church is to be subject to
human Government.<note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>'s Sermon before the King at H. C. Canons 1640 Can. 1.</note> What is commanded by God, must
not be omitted by the Church; but in Matters which are
left purely to human Prudence, the supream Governour is
to be obeyed, and there is a Law of God for it.</p>
            <p>Now, I think, the Mistake about the <hi>Divine Right of
Convocations</hi> is grounded upon this, That Christ having
constituted spiritual Governors in his Church, they conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must have the supream Right over it, in all things
that concern Religion, either for making any new Orders
or Offices, that may tend to the Advantage of the Church;
and that no humane Authority, can of Right interfere with,
or hinder it.</p>
            <p>It can't indeed be denied, but that Christ has instituted
and ordained a Succession of Pastors of his Flock, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
certain proper Functions to them, such as the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, the Administration of the Sacraments, the
Power of the Keys, and the like; and that there shall be
such, no Power on Earth has a Right to forbid, so far there
is a Divine Institution. But that the supream Governor,
to whom these Pastors are subject, has not a Power over
them in all those things, which the Scripture mentions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of, and which are not any part of the Ministerial
Office or Function; this we absolutely deny.</p>
            <p>All human Institutions must be subject to human Laws,
and since Convocations are such, because not appointed by
any Divine Law, all the Power they have, must be deriv'd
from that Authority to which they are subject.</p>
            <p>If it be said, That if the Prince has this Power, he
may make a wrong use of it; yet this does not prove
against his Right. Our Abuse of any thing, is not an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that we have no Rightor Title to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105505:9"/>
If indeed the Prince should happen to be of a different
Religion, and disclaim all Right to his Supremacy over the
Church, or abuse it to the Destruction of it; I see no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> Sermon at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
               </note>
but if the Necessities of the Church should require it,
the Clergy now may have the same Privilege, as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, and may assemble of their own accord,
as they might have done, when their Emperors were Heathen.</p>
            <p>Common Prudence will direct what is proper in such
Cases. As Right Reason, and the Laws of Equity would
advise, That the chief Power over Ecclesiastical Affairs,
should be committed to the Sovereign Authority, when
Christian; which is supposed, upon that Account, to be
as much concerned for the Good of the Church as of the State.</p>
            <p>And indeed,<note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi>'s <hi>Duct. Dub.</hi> L. 3. C. 3.</note> where nothing is determined on either side,
this must necessarily be fixt there. Because there is no other
that can either by Divine or human Right, lay claim to the
like Authority.</p>
            <p>There is no other possible way of determining the Bounds
of the supream Power,<note place="margin">Vid. Grot. de Imp. sum. Pot. cir. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra <hi>C.</hi> 3.</note> but by the Law of God or Nature;
Its Right extends over all things, but what are either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or forbidden by them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now then allowing Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Opinion, That as for
supream Power in Ecclesiastical Affairs, the Word of God
doth no-where appoint,<note place="margin">Eccl. Pol. p. 444.</note> that all Kings shall have it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that any should not have it; yet for this very Cause
it seemeth to stand altogether by human Right, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christian Kings there is such Dominion given.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Law of Nature, I think it must be granted, to
be no way concerned in the present Controversie. <hi>Grotius</hi>
does indeed allow,<note place="margin">C. 7. de Synodis.</note> That the Original of <hi>Synods,</hi> is derived
from the Law of Nature: For Man being a sociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
does naturally associate himself with those, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the same Methods and Manner of Life. So Merchants
for the Improvement of Traffick, so Physicians and Lawyers
meet and consult together, for the examining the Mysteries
of their Art, and for the advancing their Profession. But
then to prevent Mistake, he distinguishes between an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Law of Nature, which cannot be changed, as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God, honour our Parents, and to do no Injury to the
Innocent; and that which is natural, after a sort, as being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105505:10"/>
most reasonable, and allowed of by Nature, till human Laws
interpose: Thus every thing by Nature is common, all Men
are free, the nearest Relation is Heir; till by human Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Consent, Propriety, and Subjection were introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and the Inheritance disposed of by Will. In this latter
Sense, he allows it to be natural to hold Synods; but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it to be so in the other, because then, no Bishops would
ever have petitioned the Emperors for leave to meet; and
St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Argument to prove a Synod unlawful, would
be invalid; <hi>Shew me,</hi> saith he, <hi>what Emperor commanded the
meeting of that Council.</hi> Synods therefore are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the number of those things, which being allowed of by
the Law of Nature, are yet subject to human Constitutions;
and may be assembled, or prohibited by them.</p>
            <p>And if in the Reigns, even of the <hi>Pagan Emperors,</hi> any
Laws or Imperial Edicts had been published against holding
Synods, and the Necessities of the Church not evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
their meeting; but especially, had those heathen
Powers allowed them all the Liberty of meeting for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and performing other Duties which Christ had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and were necessary to be done by them, in Obedience
to his Commands; I know no Right the Clergy could have
pretended for their assembling. It is certain, That the
Church might subsist, and be preserved without them. And
thereupon, the Bishops were very careful not to offend or
provoke their Governors, by their Synodical meeting, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Occasions there might be for them. St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as
<hi>Grotius</hi> observes, has shewn in several Places, That when
in times of Persecution, there arose a hot Contest, <hi>about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the lapsed into Communion,</hi> and for the putting an
end to it, nothing seemed more necessary, than for the
Clergy to meet and consult together in common; yet the
Bishops deferred the meeting, till the Storm was blown
over; which certainly they ought not to have done, if <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi>
had been enjoin'd by a positive Law, either <hi>Divine or
Natural;</hi> and could have been no more dispensed with, than
the Duties of worshipping God, and honouring our Parents.</p>
            <p>Since then there appears no Authority from Scripture, or
from the Practice of the Church, after the State was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
or from the Law of Nature, to found this Pretence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105505:10"/>
upon, of the Clergy's having a distinct Right from the
State of assembling themselves in Convocation; it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That the Laws of the Land, and the Suffrage of the
Convocation in <hi>Henry the 8th's Reign,</hi> and of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
that have been held since; which by common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
have invested the King with this Power, and have
submitted to it, were not so rash and irreligious, as some
Men would insinuate. Even the Convocations in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, when that Law was abrogated, yet met and
acted by her Authority.</p>
            <p>But it is to be observed,<note place="margin">See the Defence of the Vind. of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicip. Eccl.</hi>
               </note> That the Arguments which are
now produced to prove the Church Independent on the
State by a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> are the same which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
taxed as the Errors of some in his time, who asserted the
Unlawfulness of the Prince's exercising any Authority in
the Affairs of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Causes of common received Errors, in this point,
seem to be especially two: One, That they who embrace
true Religion, living in such Common-wealths as are
opposite thereunto,<note place="margin">p. 439.</note> in other publick Affairs, retain civil
Communion with them. This was the State of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Church, both in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> the State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches a long time after Christ. And in this
Case, because the proper Affairs and Actions of the
Church, as it is the Church, hath no Dependence on the
Laws, or upon the Government of the civil State, an
Opinion hath thereby grown, That even so it should be
always. This was it which deceived <hi>Allen,</hi> in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Apology; <hi>The Apostles</hi> (saith he) <hi>did govern the
Church in</hi> Rome, <hi>when</hi> Nero <hi>bare Rule, even as at this
Day, in all the Churches Dominions, the Church hath a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Regiment without Dependence, and so ought she to have
amongst Heathens or with Christians.</hi> Another Occasion of
which Mis-conceit, is, That things appertaining to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are both distinguished from other Affairs, and
have always had in the Church, spiritual Persons chosen
to be exercised about them. By which Distinction of
spiritual Affairs, and Persons therein employed from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
the Error of personal Separation always necessary
between the Church and Common-wealth, hath strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it self.</q>

These Notions have been often made use of by the Papists,
in their Disputes against the <hi>King's Supremacy;</hi> and 'tis
strange they should be now revived, when they have been
so learnedly considered and refuted by Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Bramhal</hi> against the <hi>Scotch</hi> Discipline.</note> Dean
<hi>Nowel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> and other great Men of our Church.
And I may add, That some of our present Adversaries Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are much the same, with those of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians
refuted by Bishop <hi>Bramhal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Defence of the Vindication of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
Bishops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 109.</note> hath told us, That Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (for whom he
pretends a very great Respect, tho' for what Reasons I know
not, since they differ in every thing) <hi>is against him, in making
the Church one Body with the believing State.</hi> And therefore, I
suppose, he would have it taken for granted, That his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are more conclusive in making them distinct.</p>
            <p>Indeed it was necessary for this Author's Purpose, That
the Church and State should be separate Societies; for all
the Weight of his Arguments, depends upon it; and if
this should fail, his whole Fabrick must sink of Course. It
was certainly time for him to call a new Cause; and, since
the Practice of the whole Church is against him, to omit
Authorities, and the Sense of Antiquity, and to retire to
downright Reason. But he would have done well, to have
considered and answered Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Arguments, before he
had produced any others on the contrary side.</p>
            <p>For certainly,<note place="margin">Eccl. Pol. 467.</note> 
               <hi>if the Common-wealth be Christian, if the
People which are of it do publickly embrace the true Religion, this
very thing doth make it the Church.</hi> And to make it a separate
and independent Society from the State, where all Mens
Principles are the same, is a Notion neither agreeable to
Scripture or Reason.<note place="margin">p. 440, 441, &amp;c.</note> But I shall not pursue an Argument,
which has been already so fully and learnedly managed by
Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> to whom I shall refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>But I think my self obliged to do Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Justice in a
Passage cited from him by this Author,<note place="margin">Defence of the Vind. of the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, p. 108.</note> as though it made
for him; and which appears to me, to be designed to prove
directly contrary. This Author, it seems, would perswade
us, that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> is of his Opinion, That the <hi>Deprivation
of spiritual Persons, by the Civil Power, is not justifiable by even
our present secular Laws.</hi> And to this end, he cites these
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105505:11"/>
Words;<note place="margin">Eccl. Pol. p. 464.</note> 
               <hi>all Men are not for all things sufficient, and therefore
publick Affairs being divided, such Persons must be authorized
Iudges in each kind, as common Reason may presume to be most
fit. Which cannot of</hi> Kings and Princes, <hi>ordinarily be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
in Causes meerly Ecclesiastical; so that even common Sense
doth rather adjudge this Burthen to other Men.</hi> This, indeed,
looks plausibly, as it is here set down, without its Connexion
with what goes before and follows it. But however, all
that it can prove by its self, is only, That it may be more
proper for spiritual Persons to judge in Causes meerly Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical.
But then it denies not, That if Princes are so
pleased, they may judge themselves; this takes not away
their Right, though it may be Prudence in them to appoint
others to sit in their stead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let us see the full Scope and Extent of Mr.</hi> Hooker'<hi>s
Words.</hi> As, <hi>says he,</hi> the Person of the King may, for just
Considerations, even where the Cause is civil, be notwithstanding
withdrawn from occupying the Seat of Iudgment, and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Authority be fit, he unfit himself to judge; so the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
for which it were haply not convenient for Kings to sit
and give Iudgment in spiritual Courts, where Causes Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
are usually debated, can be no bar to that Force and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
which their Sovereign Power hath over those very Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
And for which we hold, without any Exception, That all
Courts are the King's. <hi>And then follows;</hi> All Men are not
for all things sufficient, <hi>&amp;c. And after that he goes on,</hi> We see
it hereby a thing necessary, to put a difference as well between that
ordinary Iurisdiction which belongs unto the Clergy alone; and that
Commissionary wherein others are for just Considerations appointed
to join with them, as also between both these Iurisdictions, and a
third, whereby the King hath transcendent Authority over both:
Why this may not lawfully be granted unto him, there is no Reason.</p>
            <p>Now take the whole together, and the Argument turns on
the other side; and proves, That the Judgment of the
supream Power is in all manner of Causes to be the highest.</p>
            <p>But hower,<note place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Troubles and Tryal of Arch-Bp. <hi>Laud,</hi> p. 309.</note> were Ecclesiastical Courts alone to judge of
spiritual Matters, and there could be no Appeals from their
Decisions, (which yet the supream Power has a Right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
yet these Courts do not exercise any Power that is
not derived from the Supremacy, either mediately or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105505:12"/>
The Laws by which they act, and exercise their
Jurisdiction, proceed from thence, and the Courts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
by its Authority. So that all that is done there, is
by Virtue of the King's Commission.</p>
            <p>But besides, if the King had no Power at all in spiritual
Cases, yet it does not appear, That the Cause of the deprived
Bishops is purely spiritual; they are as much Ecclesiastical
Persons now, as they were before their <hi>Deprivation.</hi> And
though they may not exercise any part of Episcopal Power
in the King's Dominions, yet they still retain their Office,
and have a Right to perform all the Duties of it, where and
whensoever the Sovereign Power will authorise them to it.</p>
            <p>It was the Opinion of Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">lb. p. 309.</note> That the Use and
Exercise of his Jurisdiction, <hi>in Foro Conscientiae,</hi> might not be
but by the Leave and Power of the King, within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>If his Majesty should forbid a Physician to practise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Dominions, for some Crime committed by him; 'tis
plain, That by this means, he is not degraded from his
Profession; nor will it follow, That his Majesty ought to
be acquainted with that Art, before he pronounces Sentence
against him. If his Offence had been against some of the
Rules of his own Profession, 'twould be more proper for
the College of Physicians to judge of the Nature and Manner
of it: But where the Crime has no Relation to the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
there is required no Skill in Physick to judge of it.</p>
            <p>If a Person be convicted of Heresie, 'tis just he should be
tried by the spiritual Power, and according to what has
been judged by them so to be. But if his Offence be against
the King or the Publick, if he refuse Allegiance to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
or Obedience to his Laws, be he a spiritual Person
or not, there is no doubt, but his Majesty has a Right to
forbid him the Exercise of any Office or Function within
his Territories. The King does not judge herein of his
Qualifications as a Divine, but of his Duty as a Subject.
And as such has a Right to command his Obedience, and to
punish him as he thinks fit for his Disloyalty.</p>
            <p>But if what the Author of the <hi>Defence of the Vindication
of the deprived Bishops,</hi> urges, is of any Force; as, <hi>That the
Church and State, tho' Christian, are two distinct Societies;</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:105505:12"/>
and that <hi>spiritual Persons,</hi> tho' defended and preserved by
the Sovereign Power, <hi>have yet as such, no Dependence upon
it, and are not subject to its Authority.</hi> How advantageous
soever this may prove to the Church, it will be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
and dangerous to the State.</p>
            <p>For if the Prince has no just Power over <hi>spiritual Persons</hi>
as such, it must follow, That in several Cases, he can have
no Authority over them as temporal. As suppose any of
that Body should be guilty of a Crime, which requires such
a Punishment, as can't be inflicted without depriving him
of his Ecclesiastical, as well as his Civil Rights; 'tis plain,
according to that <hi>Author's</hi> way of arguing, That in such a
Case, the State can have no Authority to punish. And if
the Clergy will not pass Sentence against him, he must go
unpunished: For how guilty soever he may be, the King
can pretend no Authority, either to imprison or banish him.
Because, according to this Author, the <hi>supream Power</hi> has
no Right upon any Account whatsoever, to prohibit him
the Exercise of his Ecclesiastical Function; which he must do,
if he punishes him either of the fore-mentioned ways. The
same Reasons will, I think, also forbid the Civil Authority,
from having any Right of sentencing an Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to Death, as well as to perpetual Imprisonment, be his
Offence of what Nature soever. The Consequences of such
Notions, are more than sufficient Confutations of them.</p>
            <p>The great <hi>Grotius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum. Potest. Circa Sacra, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</note> who could have no Interest or Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to mis-guide his Judgment, in Relation to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
is of Opinion, That the Right of removing a
Pastor from the Cure of any certain Place, ought always to
remain in the highest Power. So <hi>Solomon</hi> deposed <hi>Abiathar</hi>
from being Priest. The <hi>Vindicator of the deprived Bishops</hi>
has been at some pains, to prove that <hi>Abiathar</hi> was not
<hi>high Priest.</hi> Which whether true or no, is little to his
Purpose; for if he was a <hi>Priest,</hi> and deprived by a <hi>Lay
Power,</hi> it is sufficient. So the <hi>Bishops of</hi> Rome, were more
than once deposed, by the Imperial Authority, as is owned
by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself. And to prove this, says <hi>Grotius,</hi> is
not difficult: For if the supream Authority hath a Right to
forbid any one <hi>the City</hi> or <hi>Province,</hi> he must of Necessity
have a Right, to prohibit him the <hi>Ministry of that City or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105505:13"/>
Province.</hi> For this is included in the other: <hi>For he who has
a Power over the whole, must have the same, no doubt, over the
part.</hi> And he adds, That if the Sovereign Power had not
this Right, the State could not be able to provide for its
own Security.</p>
            <p>But what seems to me most absurd in the Management of
this Controversie by the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the depriv'd Bishops,
is this, That he condemns all those of <hi>Schism,</hi> who go upon
different Principles, or that conform with these who fill
the Sees of the deprived Bishops. For by this means, he
not only involves the Christians of several Centuries in the
same Guilt, even from <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, till Papal Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
were introduced; who submitted to Bishops put
into the Places of others deprived by the Emperors, as
has been learnedly shewn in a great many Instances,<note place="margin">By Doctor <hi>Hody.</hi>
               </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all Possibility of a Reply: But he also condemns and
contradicts himself. For I believe his Practice has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his present Opinion. Since, if I mistake not, he
held Communion with the <hi>Church of</hi> England, till the late
Revolution. And I believe this Doctrin of the Prince's
Authority over spiritual Persons, was the same then as now.
If not, what can those Words signifie, That the King <hi>is
over all Persons and in all Causes, as well Ecclesiastical as
Civil, Supream?</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> tells us, That the Prince has
by this, the same Power over Ecclesiastical Persons, as the
Pope had usurped before the Reformation. And indeed,
if these Words do not imply,<note place="margin">See Dean <hi>Nowel,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Dorman.</hi>
               </note> That Ecclesiastical Persons
as such, are subject to the King's Authority, they signifie
nothing. And if they carry such a Sense with them, they
must also denote the Sufficiency of the King's Authority,
for depriving Bishops of their Sees upon a just Cause. And
tho' it be granted, there were no Instances of this Nature
in the <hi>late Reigns;</hi> yet the Case is much the same, if such
a Doctrin was then held and maintained by the <hi>Church.</hi>
And if 'tis a Sin to communicate with the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who are
put into the <hi>Sees</hi> of them, who were deprived by the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Power,</hi> 'tis a Sin also not to separate from that <hi>Church,</hi>
which requires all its Members to acknowledge and believe
such a Right to belong to that Power. For the Nature of
the <hi>Church</hi> is the same, whether the <hi>King</hi> exercises that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:105505:13"/>
or not; if it be owned and allowed by the <hi>Church</hi>
to belong to him.</p>
            <p>But this Author pretends that he has the Church and the
Laws on his side,<note place="margin">See the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Clergy on the Lay-Power, by the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the deprived Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</note> since <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Time;</hi> and that he
will agree to the Supremacy as then stated <hi>by her,</hi> and as it
is expressed in the 37th <hi>Article.</hi> If he will put the Cause
upon this Issue, we must also submit to be determined by
it. For we cannot desire to carry the Supremacy farther
than it was in that <hi>Queen's</hi> Time, and as 'tis specified in
that <hi>Article.</hi> But then we demand, That the Words may
be explained according to the most easie and natural Sense
of them, and not understood only as this Author would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
them.<note place="margin">Vid. Bp. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Hist. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Vol. 2, p. 399.</note> The <hi>Queen</hi> lays claim to the same Authority
over <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs and Persons,</hi> that was Exercised <hi>by
all Godly Princes in Scripture, and which at all times belonged
to the Imperial Crown of</hi> England: And this must include
the Power which was given to her Predecessors <hi>Henry</hi> the
8th, and <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. The 37th <hi>Article</hi> allows the
King all that Power which we contend for, and asserts his
<hi>Supremacy over all sorts of Persons as well Spiritual as Temporal
in all Causes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Dean <hi>Nowel,</hi> who was Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut. of the Convocat. when the Articl were made in his Books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </note> And all the Limitations that either the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> or that Article hath set to the
<hi>Regal Power,</hi> is, That Kings have not, or do not pretend to
have, <hi>any Authority to minister Divine Service in the Church,</hi>
which we are not Disputing for. But if this Author will be
concluded by <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s Notion of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> he
must carry it I am afraid something farther than he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of. For she thought her <hi>Supremacy</hi> extended to the
giving Commissions to <hi>Lay-Persons</hi> to proceed by <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Censures.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist. of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Vol. 2. p. 400.</note> And accordingly the <hi>Earls of Shrewsbury, Derby,</hi>
and others, were made <hi>Visitors of Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> and
acted as such. This then we may be positive in asserting,
That the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as it was confirmed and settled in <hi>Queen
Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Reign,</hi> is a sufficient Vindication of our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and directly opposite to his. Upon the whole, that
Author's Censures are either too far stretcht, or too much
confin'd.</p>
            <p>Every Man, I think, ought to be very tender in fixing
the Charge of Schism upon a whole Church; especially
where it has the practice of all Antiquity on its side. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105505:14"/>
certainly would rather oblige a Man to distrust the
strength of his own Arguments, where he has neither the
Authority of Scripture, and the ancient Church to support
them, than pass so severe a Censure from the bare result of
his own Thoughts and Opinions. If we are in the wrong,
we err with the whole Catholick Church for some Ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and I believe I may add with the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
I am sure not against them; and we have moreover
our Canons and Articles for us, the Judgment of some
of the greatest Men of the last Age, who could have no
other Motives to mislead them, but the impartial discovery
of Truth, who were of the same Opinion with us.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I think we ought to pay a great deal of respect
to Men that go upon sincere Principles of Conscience; but
then it were to be wished, That they would not judge too
rashly of other Men; but consider, that they who dissent
from their Notions, may not be less sincere and conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than themselves. It can't be supposed, that Men, who
believe Religion, should be so fond of the little interest of
a short Life, as to forfeit all pretences to a better, for the
sake of it. Surely, Men that know the present value of
things, ought to think <hi>them</hi> very inconsiderate Motives for
the byassing a Man's Conscience one way or other.</p>
            <p>There are a great many who can't comply with us, whom
we must, and do entertain a very high Opinion of, and who
deserve and command our Esteem. The late Service which
one of them has done the <hi>Church and Clergy,</hi> by the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
them from the Contempt and Abuses of the <hi>Stage,</hi>
in his admirable and just Reflections upon the Immorality
and Profaneness of that Place, ought always to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
with the highest returns of Gratitude.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Convocations; if we should grant
that Revelation has not in express Terms determined this
Matter, yet we may venture to lay this down for a certain
Principle; That in a Christian Common-wealth, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ought most to be observed, which is most subservient
to its Peace and Unity; and that such a method of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be lawful, which will necessarily confound and
destroy it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105505:14"/>
Now, if the Clergy should have the sole Power among
themselves of meeting, and Establishing what Laws they
please, for the Government of the whole Church; and of
subjecting all Christians to the observance of them, whether
they will consent to them or no, it will probably occasion
great confusion, and raise perpetual Heats and Jealousies in
the State.</p>
            <p>The State does not challenge such a superiority over the
Clergy in Civil Affairs; no Temporal Laws are made to
bind them, but such as themselves have assented to: The
same Reasons will hold in Christian Discipline; none ought
to be bound to obey any Constitutions, but such as are
made by their own consent; or, which is the same thing,
by that of the Supream Authority, which represents the
whole State.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed,<note place="margin">See Bp. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Duct. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant. l. 3. c. 4.</note> can the Clergy plead such a Priviledge;
their Business being only to deliver their Opinions, and to
declare their own, and the Sense of the Church, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Point in Religion, and no farther than this does
their Authority extend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Vossius</hi> has proved this at large,<note place="margin">Ep. 23.</note> and tells us, That the
Clergy are forbid by the Scripture to Exercise Authority;<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note>
and <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, That they are called in Holy Writ by
the Titles of <hi>Embassadors, Messengers</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
that it is their Part, to declare the Authority and
Power of another, and not to oblige Men by their own.
The Government therefore which is committed to them,
when they are said to <hi>Guide,</hi> to <hi>Rule,</hi> to <hi>Feed,</hi> to be <hi>set over
the Church,</hi> ought to be interpreted of the <hi>declarative kind,</hi>
or of that which consists only in persuasion: When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
are any where said <hi>to have commanded,</hi> it is to be
understood in such a figurative Sense, as they are said to
<hi>remit</hi> and <hi>retain Sins;</hi> that is, to declare them remitted or
retained. He farther proves, That the Church can have no
commanding Power by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> because the <hi>Sword,</hi>
which is the instrument of Power, and denotes Authority,
is not committed to them.</p>
            <p>There can no Power naturally belong to the Pastors of
the Church, because no such thing is included in the nature
of the Function. Under the <hi>Mosaical Law,</hi> when there was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105505:15"/>
neither King nor Judge, the Supream Power in Civil, as
well as Ecclesiastical Affairs, devolved on the <hi>High Priest.</hi>
But during the Regal Dignity,<note place="margin">Vid. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. de Synedriis.</note> the High Priests Jurisdiction
was always under that of the King; so <hi>Aaron</hi> was under
that of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Trust that is committed to the Ministers of the
Church, by the Law of the Gospel, and which comes nearest
to <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> though it is distinct from it, are those Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were either peculiar to the first Christians only,
or are still continued to the Pastors of the Church. Such
was that <hi>Sharpness</hi> which the Apostle threatens the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
with, which denotes according to <hi>Grotius,</hi> a certain
miraculous Vertue of imposing Punishment. Thus <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira</hi> fell down dead; <hi>Elymas</hi> was smitten with <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and others were <hi>delivered to Satan,</hi> which was plainly
an Act of miraculous Power exercised by God himself;
who, at the Denunciation of the Apostles, commanded Men
to be vexed and tormented with <hi>Diseases,</hi> and seized on by
<hi>Divels. Grotius,</hi> upon this observes, That before the Civil
Powers exercised their Authority in the Church, God himself
supplyed by Divine Assistance, what was defective in Human
Laws. But as <hi>Manna</hi> ceased, after the <hi>Israelites</hi> were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the Holy Land; so, after <hi>Emperors</hi> took upon them
to protect the Church, their Office being to punish all that
any way disturbed its Peace, these Divine Executions of
Justice were dis-continued. But however, all those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Punishments were the Acts of God, not of Men, and
the whole Work was his, not the Apostles.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>use of the Keys</hi> which is perpetually annext to
the Pastoral Office, that implies no <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Divine Threats and Punishments, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
restitution of Goods unjustly gotten, are only so
many declarations of the Divine Law: <hi>Excommunication</hi> is
of the same kind. The denying the <hi>Sacraments</hi> to notorious
Offenders, is not Exercising any Dominion over them, but
is only a Suspension of the Pastors own Act, and therefore
is not any part of Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>From the whole it appears, That the Authority which
was committed to the Clergy, does not reach to the making
of Laws, or to oblige any Persons to be subject to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105505:15"/>
by Vertue of their own Power. They may do
both by the consent and permission of the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but of themselves they can pretend no <hi>Right.</hi> They
are only allowed by the Scriptures to declare and deliver
their Opinions about any Religious Matters,<note place="margin">See <hi>Vossius,</hi> Ep. 23. Duct. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant. l. 3. c. 4.</note> but the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power alone can confirm them, and give them the
force of Laws.</p>
            <p>But however, if at any time there may seem to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity for a <hi>Convocation</hi> to meet, for the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Errors and Heresies, which may have crept into, and
have disturbed the Peace of the Church; Though the Prince
in such a Case will not consent to the Assembling the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
they may notwithstanding, as many of them as think
fit, give their Opinions, concerning such false Notions.
And if their Opinions have any weight in them, they may
be perhaps as much regarded, by the judicious part of the
World, as the Judgment of a whole Convocation.</p>
            <p>For when Men Publish their Reasons concerning any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
every Body is at liberty to Discuss and Examine
them, to search into the strength of their Arguments; be
able to discover whether their Thoughts are well weighed,
or whether they are not the effects of a peevish, mis-guided
Zeal, rather than of a serious, deliberate Judgment.</p>
            <p>The World can then judge whether Mens Enquiries into
others Notions, and their Censures of them, are impartial
or not; whether a Man's prejudice, or perhaps his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or both, do not biass or mis-lead his Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>It is not impossible that Men may side with a Party in a
Convocation, only because 'tis the greatest; may judge
against Men and their Opinions, only because they are
theirs; but the World may be best satisfied of the Reasons
and Motives of every Man's Judgment, when they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Publick Examination.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Consent of a <hi>Church</hi> may be known by the
unanimous Writings of all the Great Men of that Church,<note place="margin">Cap. 7. De Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</note>
that have treated of such Subjects. For the Affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
have been more often managed this way, and the
Consent of the Church more frequently signified by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of <hi>Letters,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes, than by Synods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:105505:16"/>
I would not be thought to derogate from the usefulness
of Convocations, and from that Respect and Submission
which is justly due to their Decisions.</p>
            <p>Whenever the King shall be pleased to give them leave to
sit and Act, every Man is obliged to be determined by their
Orders and Decrees, as soon as ever they are legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>But there is not at all times a necessity for their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and there may be often greater Reasons to urge against,
than for it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grotius</hi> assigns these as <hi>two</hi> of the chief <hi>Ends</hi> of having
Synods;<note place="margin">Cap. 7. De Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</note> one is, to counsel and direct the Prince in the
advancement of Truth and Piety; the other, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Church may be Established and made known.
But a <hi>Synod</hi> is not absolutely necessary upon either of these
accounts: <hi>Counsel</hi> is not necessary for a Prince in things
that are sufficiently plain by the Light of Nature, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelation. Who doubts, but he that denies a
<hi>God,</hi> a <hi>Providence,</hi> or a <hi>Iudgment to come;</hi> that calls in
question the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Redemption purchased
by him;</hi> who, I say, can doubt, that a Man so profane may
not be put out of Office, or banished the Common-wealth,
without the advice of others?</p>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Prince</hi> has the Judgment of former <hi>Synods</hi> to
assist and guide him in such Cases, so that he need not be
obliged to call a new one. He hath the perpetual Consent
and Determinations of the most Serious and Learned Men,
who have lived in all other Ages, as well as the present,
so that a Synod cannot be absolutely necessary for this End.</p>
            <p>As for the Consent of a whole Church, there may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Methods, as was already observed, of declaring that
without the Meeting of a Convocation.</p>
            <p>If then the Ends for which Convocations are to be called
are not indispensably necessary, certainly their Right to sit
cannot be Divine. But however it may be, this to me
seems very apparent; that they are guilty of a very great
Sin against <hi>God,</hi> and their <hi>own Consciences,</hi> if any such there
are, that either publickly maintain, or secretly believe the
<hi>Divine Right</hi> of Convocations independent on the Supream
Civil Authority, and yet submit to be Members of such a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105505:16"/>
one, as has no Power to Sit, or Act, but what depends sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Pleasure of the State.</p>
            <p>If they are convinced that the <hi>Clergy</hi> have a <hi>Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
to Assemble themselves, and that the Concessions
made by the Clergy in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth's</hi> Time were unjust
and sinful, why don't they Act agreeably to themselves?
Why don't they protest against the Power of the Prince to
call them; refuse his <hi>Writs,</hi> and disobey his <hi>Summons?</hi> For
the very Meeting by his Appointment, is an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his <hi>Power,</hi> and an actual <hi>Surrendring</hi> of those <hi>Rights,</hi>
which they pretend are only theirs, by Vertue of the Divine
Institution; and consequently are in the very least degree
for ever unalienable.</p>
            <p>If then there are any, (as I would willingly believe
there are not) who plead for such a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and yet
submit to be called to <hi>Convocation</hi> by a <hi>Lay-Authority;</hi> they
must grant at least, that their Practice is very inconsistent
with their Notions. But this I leave to the Consideration
of the Elaborately confused Author of the <hi>Municipium Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticum:</hi>
But yet, in asserting the King's Authority over
Convocations, we don't mean, that he may prescribe, what
himself thinks good to be done in the Service of God:
How the Word shall be taught, how the Sacraments Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred:<note place="margin">Vid. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. p. 461.</note>
That he may by judicial Sentence decide Questions
which may arise about Matters of Faith and Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
that Kings may Excommunicate; Finally, that Kings
may do whatsoever is incident unto the Office and Duty of
an Ecclesiastical Judge. But, to give <hi>Mr. Hooker</hi>'s Words,
we mean, <q>That the King's Royal Power is of so large
compass, that no Man Commanded by him, can plead
himself to be without the limits and bounds of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And that Kings should be in such sort Supream
Commanders over all Men, we hold it requisite, as well
for the ordering of Spiritual as Civil Affairs; in as much
as without universal Authority in this kind, they should
not be able when need is, to do as Vertuous Kings have
done.</q> As <hi>Iosia</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the Old Testament did,
when they Assembled the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> to renew the
House of the Lord, and to Celebrate the <hi>Passover.</hi> The
like before them did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> for removing the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105505:17"/>
               <hi>Ark,</hi> and Dedicating the <hi>Temple.</hi> Such Authority as the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Kings Exercised over Ecclesiastical Affairs and Persons,
the like we claim to belong to our <hi>Kings;</hi> and those that
deny them the same Authority, are to be Excommunicated,
according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But since there is an Argument now again insisted upon
from the New Testament, to prove the Right which belongs
to the Clergy to Assemble, and make Ecclesiastical Laws
without the leave of the Supream Authority, which in
<hi>Mr. Hooker</hi>'s Time was brought for an Objection against
such a Supremacy in the King, I shall take the freedom to
set it down in his Words, with his Answer to it.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It will be <hi>(says that Excellent Author)</hi> perhaps alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That a part of the Unity of Christian Religion is
to hold the Power of making Ecclesiastical Laws a thing
appropriated unto the Clergy in their Synods;<note place="margin">P. 467.</note> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is by their only Voices agreed upon, it needeth
no farther Appropriation to give unto it the strength of
a Law, as may plainly appear by the Canons of that first
most venerable Assembly:<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> Where those things the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
and <hi>Iames</hi> had concluded, were afterwards published,
and imposed upon the Churches of the Gentiles abroad
as Laws; the Records threof remaining still in the Book
of God for a Testimony, that the Power of making Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Laws, belongeth to the Successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
the Bishops and Prelates of the Church of God.</p>
               <p>To this we Answer, That the Council of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is
no Argument for the Power of the Clergy to make Laws;
For first, There has not been since, any Council of like
Authority to that in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Secondly, The Cause,
why that was of such Authority came by a special Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
Thirdly, The Reason why other Councils being
not like unto that in Nature, the Clergy in them should
have no Power to make Laws by themselves alone, is in
Truth so forcible, that except some Commandment of
God, to the contrary can be shewed, it ought notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the aforesaid Example to prevail.</p>
               <p>The Decrees of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were not as
the Canons of other Ecclesiastical-Assemblies, Humane,
but very Divine Ordinances: For which Cause the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105505:17"/>
Churches were far and wide, commanded every where
to see them kept, no otherwise than if Christ himself
had personally on Earth been the Author of them. The
Cause why that Council was of so great Authority and
Credit above all others which have been since, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in those Words of principal Observation, <hi>Vnto the
Holy Ghost, and to us it hath seemed good:</hi> Which form of
Speech, though other Councils have likewise used, yet
neither could they themselves-mean, nor may we so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if both were in equal sort assisted with
the Power of the Holy Ghost. Wherefore, in as much
as the Council of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did consist of Men so enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it had Authority greater than were meet for any
other Council besides to challenge, wherein such kind of
Persons are, as now the State of the Church doth stand;
Kings being not then that which now they are, and the
Clergy not now that which then they were. Till it be
proved that some special Law of Christ, hath for ever
annexed unto the Clergy alone the Power to make Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Laws, we are to hold it a thing most Consonant
with Equity and Reason, that no Ecclesiastical Laws be
made in a Christian Common-wealth, without consent
as well of the Laity as of the Clergy, but least of all
without consent of the highest Power.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>The Opinion of the Learned</hi> Grotius <hi>being more short
and decisive in our present Case,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 7. De Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</note> 
               <hi>upon that forementioned
place of the</hi> Acts, <hi>I shall also give an account of it.</hi> The
Original of Synods, <hi>says he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is usually taken from that History
in the 15th <hi>Chap. of</hi> the Acts. But whether that Assembly may be
properly termed a Synod, as we now understand that Word, may
very well be questioned. There arose a Controversie between
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain Iews of <hi>Antioch,</hi> concerning
the Obligations of the Mosaick Law: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are
sent with some of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to know the Opinion of the Pastors;
but were they those of all <hi>Asia, Syria, Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
together in one place, that were to give their Iudgment?
No certainly; but of the Apostles and Elders of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
the Company of the Apostles, was a College, not a Synod;
and the Elders of one City, could not certainly be called a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.
One Church therefore alone is consulted; or more truly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105505:18"/>
and properly speaking, the Apostles only are consulted, and they
alone give Iudgment; to whose Authority the Elders and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> yield their Consent and Approbation. <hi>Thus,
I think there can't be the least shadow of an Argument
brought from Scripture for a Divine Institution of Synods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return once more to <hi>Mr. Hooker;</hi>
               <q>Were it so,
(adds that judicious Author) that the Clergy alone might
give Laws unto all the rest, is it not easie to see, how
injurious this might prove to Men of other Conditions?
Peace and Justice are maintained by preserving unto every
Order their Right, and by keeping all Estates, as it were in
even ballance, which thing is no way better done, than
if the King their Common Parent, whose Care is presumed
to extend most indifferently over all, do bear the chiefest
sway in making Laws, which all must be ordered by;
wherefore of them which attribute most to the Clergy,
I would demand, what Evidence there is, whereby it
may clearly be shewed, that in ancient Kingdoms Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
any Canon devised alone by the Clergy, in their
Synods, whether Provincial, National or General, hath
by meer force of their agreement, taken place as a Law,
making all Men constrainable to be Obedient thereunto,
without any other approbation from the King, before or
afterwards required in that behalf?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Sense of that Great-Man; and the very
same Opinion and Notions they are, and no other, (as far
I can judge,) which are maintained by them, who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
defend the King's Authority in calling Convocations,
and in other Ecclesiastical Affairs. And I can't yet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
how those who so warmly and furiously oppose them,
can reconcile their Notions with the Doctrines which have
been always received in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may probably be urged, That though the Clergy's
Right to Assemble themselves, and make Laws for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church by their own Power could not be proved
by Revelation, yet in Reason it ought to be allowed to
them; because the security of Religion depends upon it.
For if the Clergy alone may not make any new Orders
which may seem wanting, nor pass a general Censure upon
any false Opinions or Innovations in Religion, by a judicial
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105505:18"/>
Sentence against them in Convocation, without the Pleasure
of the State; The Church will by this means be deprived
of its Liberty, and never be in a Capacity of deciding any
Controversies which may disturb its Peace and Unity. And
if the Prince be Heretical, as 'tis not impossible, and will
not suffer the Meeting of a <hi>Convocation,</hi> our Religion will
then very probably be corrupted by Errors and Heresies, and
the Church unable to relieve it, by being divested of the
Power of summoning its Clergy; by whose united Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Decrees, a timely stop might be put to all false
Doctrines and Divisions.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That the Case is the same wherever
the Power shall be lodged. Let us suppose in a <hi>Metropolitan.</hi>
Now 'tis not impossible, but he also may be a Heretick, and
will not suffer a Convocation of the Clergy. For if the
Authority is in him, the inferior Order must be as much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to his Will, as to that of the Civil Governor, and
may as equally be deprived of their Liberty of Meeting,
by the one as the other; and so it may be, let the Authority
be placed in any other Hands.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it may be thought that the Civil Power is
not a proper Judge of the Necessities of the Church, when
its Faith or Discipline are in danger of being corrupted or
destroyed.</p>
            <p>Let it be granted, That there may be others more fit to
judge of these things, tho' it may happen, that even some
of the Clergy themselves may be mistaken in these Matters,
and may be sometimes very unfit Judges of the most proper
Times for calling a Convocation: Yet I hope the King is
not to be precluded from all Council and Advice in such
Cases. If any of the Clergy had the Power, they would not,
I presume, make use of it, upon their own single Opinion:
They would certainly ask the Advice of the most Wise and
Judicious in such Matters. And why the King may not have
the same Priviledges and Opportunities of Enquiry, I can
see no Reason.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, That the Office of the Clergy is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from that of the Civil Power, and they receive no
Parts of it from thence, and therefore cannot be under its
Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:105505:19"/>
So it was also among the Jews, yet their Kings had the
Supream Power over their Priests. The Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the King is Spiritual, though he is not invested with
the Spiritual Office. The King indeed seems in some Cases
to be subject to the Priestly Office; as he is to receive the
Sacraments, Absolution, and the like from them: So also is
he subject to his Physician as to his Health, he is to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by his Rules and Methods for preserving Life. Yet
this does not diminish his Authority over either. His Right
over them, as Supream Governor still remains the same.</p>
            <p>But 'tis again objected, That the Care of Souls is the
particular and immediate Business of the Clergy: And the
observance of the true Religion being necessary to that end,
'tis undeniable that they ought to have a Power of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to preserve it by such ways as may seem most effectual
and proper for it.</p>
            <p>To this we may answer, That the Supream Governor has
the same Care incumbent upon him;<note place="margin">Voss. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 23.</note> he is obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and defend the true Religion, to see it rightly observed,
and to <hi>punish those that do Evil:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 1. De Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio.</note> For which Reason, <hi>G. Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
as well as <hi>Grotius,</hi> is of Opinion that Princes have the
Supream Authority in Sacred Matters by a Divine Right.
For if they are the <hi>Ministers of God for Good,</hi> they must
have the Supream Command in Religious Matters,<note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Sermon at <hi>Hampton</hi>-Court.</note> whereby
to enforce Obedience to them. And indeed, if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
given by God to <hi>Moses,</hi> and Exercised afterwards by
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the <hi>Iewish</hi> Kings, and never abolished by our
Saviour, does give the same Right and Authority to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kings now, to call Ecclesiastical Assemblies as they did,
it can't be denied that they also Act by a Divine Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And it is one great Business of theirs, that Divine
Things should be rightly ordered, and the Salvation of Men
procured. They are the Defenders and Guardians of the
Divine Law: The Inspectors of the Actions of all Men;
and have accordingly a Power to Reward and Punish.</p>
            <p>'Tis also necessary that Kings should have the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in Religious Matters, because Religion is of mighty
Service to the Civil Government; nothing more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
for the preserving Peace and Unity, Love of our
Country, Justice, Equity, and all other Moral Duties, which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105505:19"/>
'tis a Princes Duty to maintain: And which he has no means
of effecting so well, as by his Sovereign Power in all Sacred
Concerns. And therefore to deprive him of this Power, is
to forbid him the Exercising those Commands which a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
King is obliged to.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then, it can't be denied, That by our
Constitution, the King has the sole Power of calling and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
Convocations, and that they have no Authority to
Act but what is derived from him. And whoever takes the
<hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> grants as much. That this Power is no
other, than what was Exercised by the <hi>Iewish Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Sermon at <hi>Hampt.</hi> Court.</note> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
by the first <hi>Christian Emperors;</hi> and was never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
and protested against by the <hi>Clergy.</hi> That the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Christians before the Conversion of the Supream
Authority, is not concerned in the Dispute; and that the
Scriptures are either for us, or wholly silent in the Matter.
Tho' I think we may fairly urge, That the Examples of the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Kings, and the general Authority given to Princes by
God, do sufficiently prove even from Scripture, that this
Power does belong to them.</p>
            <p>That the Ends of Government require, That where all
profess the same Religion, they should all be subject to the
same <hi>Common Head,</hi> in Spiritual as well as Civil Affairs. And
that <hi>He,</hi> to whom the chief Care of the Church is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and to whom it principally belongs to preserve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Orders and Constitutions of it, should also have the
Principality of Power in Approving and Establishing them.</p>
            <p>But if the Clergy have the sole Power by a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of making Ecclesiastical Laws, it will follow, That
'tis the Prince's Business, to maintain and see them observed,
whether he is willing to consent to them or not. He cannot
refuse to obey them himself, nor to oblige others to submit
to them. Nay, more, if the Clergy have a <hi>Divine Right</hi> to
meet and constitute any Orders without the leave of the
Supream Power, they have a Right also to Decree and Enact
what Laws they may judge beneficial to the Church, how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
soever to the Constitutions of the State. They may
declare what Doctrines they please to be taught in the
Church, provided they be not repugnant to the Law of God.
For if their Right is Divine, their Power is Absolute and
Uncontroulable, where Scripture has not determined the
bounds and measures of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105505:20"/>
Every one sees what Distractions such a Power might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
and therefore we can't pay too great a Veneration
to our Laws, which have wisely provided against them:
That have intrusted this Power with the Prince, whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
it is as much to preserve the Church, as the State.
And I hope we have no Reason to believe, but that he makes
it as truly and sincerely his concern to vindicate the Cause of
Religion, as any amongst us.</p>
            <p>If there are such Dangers threaten the Church, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Convocation can prevent, no doubt but he will
think it a great Obligation upon him to call one: But yet,
it is not at all times necessary; Mens Heats will not always
suffer it. And if it should chance to fire their Tempers
instead of cooling them, it would be then very Prejudicial.</p>
            <p>We confess indeed,<note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> with <hi>Grotius</hi> and Others, That Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
are often times very useful to the Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church; yet we also join with them, that there
may be such a time, when they are far from being conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,<note place="margin">Vid. Bp. <hi>Bramhal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Scotch Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note>
much less necessary. <hi>But our greatest wonder is at the
Boldness of some Men, who maintain, That, even when the
Powers take on them the Protection of the Church, whether they
will or no, Synods may lawfully and rightly be Assembled.</hi> Of
another Mind,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vossius</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 23.</note> says <hi>Vossius,</hi> were all those, who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
defended the Cause of the Protestants against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;
and he cites several Authorities for it.</p>
            <p>As for the Assertors of a Divine Right of Synods, 'tis
something difficult to know their meaning; they seem too
much to distrust their Cause to speak plain enough to be
understood. If they mean no more by that Expression,
than that Christ hath so constituted his Church, as to leave
a Power of Goverment with the Bishops of it, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ordering its Affairs; who accordingly may either by
Consent meet themselves, or by their Authority call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Clergy, and agree on such things as are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for the ordering of it: This is what, in States not
Christian, will never be deny'd by us. But if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a Power from God of Meeting and Acting inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently
on the Sovereign Authority, tho' Christian, and
of Making and Establishing Ecclesiastical Laws and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
without his Consent; this is what we utterly deny.
And I would desire to know of the Author of <hi>The Vindication
of the depriv'd Bishops,</hi> by what Authority, either from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105505:20"/>
Scripture or the Practice of the Church, he will oppose
this, or with what Justice he can so severely reflect on the
Memory of the first Reformers, for being of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But to return, supposing we should allow this <hi>jus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi>
which they contend for; yet after all, it must be left
to human Prudence to determine, when 'tis proper for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
to meet; and then, who is it that must judge of
the proper Seasons for it? Who of the Clergy have a divine
Commission to judge of the Reasons, and fix the time for it?
Or suppose the Clergy should differ in their Judgments, who
is the supream Arbiter that must decide when it is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and accordingly shall have the Power of summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the rest? Superiority in Bishops over each other is
an act of human Authority, since Christ did not appoint a
Head; and therefore any one of those can't have a Power
by Divine Right of summoning all the rest: Where then
must the Power be placed? For they who urge such an Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
against us, ought to assign where they would have
the divine Power of summoning the Convocation to be
lodged.</p>
            <p>After all, 'tis Reason that must direct in these Cases; when
a Convocation ought to be Assembled; of what Number of
the Clergy it ought to consist; where their Power is to be
fixed and limited, and to whom the chief Authority ought to
belong of Calling and Dissolving them, and of giving their
Resolutions, the Force and Sanction of a Law. This the
Wisdom of the Nation, has entrusted with the Sovereign
Power;<note place="margin">Vid. Bp. <hi>Taylor, Ductor Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitamium,</hi> Archbp. <hi>Bramhal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Scots Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> has ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
own'd and acknowledg'd it to be its peculiar Province.</p>
            <p>As for the Author of the <hi>Municipium Ecclesiasticum,</hi> poor
Man, he is rather to be Pitied then Censured, as to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
part of his Book; he writes so much backwards and
forwards, for and against himself, and withal so very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely,
that the most charitable Opinion of him, is, That
he knew nothing of what he writ. He is so strangly bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in his own Notions, and so fond of Ill-nature, that
he is neither to be understood or convinced.</p>
            <p>All he has urged in defence of the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
will as much prove a Divine Right of Constables
and Church-wardens, or any other Officers that may be
useful for punishing Immorality, or for supporting or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105505:21"/>
the Interest of the Church. And for all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I can find in his Book, he might as well have called it
a Criticism upon <hi>Honer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads,</hi> as an Answer to Dr. <hi>Wake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Author is one great Instance, why I think a <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
necessary, that Malice and Uncharitableness may have
their just Reward; that he may be convinced, that he who
writes at all adventures upon every thing he least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands,
must not think to carry a Cause only by abusing and
defaming his Adversary; which is all that I can find he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to, in all his Prints: And lastly, that he may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that his Ill-breeding, which he values himself so
much upon, is but one way Meritorious.</p>
            <p>I should not have digressed into this way of Writing, was
it not to inform this Author, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Railing and Argument: That the one is rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
even when mixt with the other; but without it,
'tis insufferable.</p>
            <p>Thus have I run thro' all the parts of this Dispute, about a
Convocation, which I thought necessary to be considered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed;
I have endeavoured to reduce the Controversie, into as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a compass, and to set it in as clear and true a Light as I could.
And as I have given my Thoughts freely, so I have not been misled
by any Prejudice, or a desire of pleasing any Party. My first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
were to get a clear view of the Controversie; and since there
had been of late some heats about it, I thought it not improper to
expose my Enquires to publick Examination. I consulted the best
and most rational Authors that I could find had writ upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
tho' I thought it unnecessary to fill out a Volume with Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vos.</hi> Ep. 23.</note>
But I shall add what the Learned <hi>Vossinus</hi> as well as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
says upon this occasion; namely, <q>That besides the Divines,
all the Writers of Polity,<note place="margin">De Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio sum. Potest. cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Sacra.</note> that are worth the Reading, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the supreme Authority of Princes, over Ecclesiastical Persons
and Causes, to be one of the principal parts of the Imperial Right.</q>
Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> as well as all the other Writers upon this Subject, is
wholly unknown to me: But I can't but think, upon an impartial
Enquiry into the Controversie, that he has given us a very just and
learned. Account of it; and that he agrees with the most judicious
and eminent Men, that have treated the Subject before him. What
a peice of daring Confidence must it then be, to tax those as merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
designing Writers, that only espouse a Cause, which some of
the greatest and most learned Men in the World, have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
But I shall urge nothing more, but only, That I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
what I judged to be Right, without either Hopes or Fears.</p>
