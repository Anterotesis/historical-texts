         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all the <hi>Muses,</hi> but all the <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
were in her too, whilest
for <hi>matter, words,</hi> &amp; <hi>manner</hi>
she is all that is delightfull
in Conversation; her <hi>matter</hi> not stale
and studied, but resent and occasional;
not stiff, but ductile and pliable to the
company; high not soaring, familiar
not low, profound not obscure; and the
more sublime the more intelligible
and conspicuous. Her <hi>Words</hi> not too
scanty, nor too wide, but just fitted
to her <hi>matter,</hi> not intricately involving,
but clearly unfolding and explicating
the notions of her minde. In <hi>Manner,</hi>
Majestique, not imperious, conversation
thats a <hi>Tyranny,</hi> with others being a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>
with her, where every ones
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52959:6"/>
discourse and opinions are free; she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
contradicting, but when any speak
impertinently, only blushing for them,
and saying no more: (a greater repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
to those, who understand blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than can be exprest in words,) Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
too much reason to call passion to
her ayde, and disdaining to use force
and violence (the ordinary Arms of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood)
to defend the Truth, so if you
yeeld not, she does rather than contend,
leaving you the shame of a <hi>victory,</hi> when
with more honour, you might have yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and been overcome: Nor does she
rashly take up Argument, and abruptly
lay it down again; but handsomely as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it; delightfully continue it, and
like an <hi>Aire</hi> in <hi>musick,</hi> just then, when the
ear expects, it comes unto a close: All in
her being sweet, delightfull and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
even to the very Tone and Accent
of her voice, it being more <hi>musick</hi> to
hear her speak than others sing. Then
shees withall so easie Company, and far
from all constraint, as tis pleasure to be
in it: whilest others like uneasie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52959:6"/>
you cannot stir in without pain;
which renders her conversation far
chearfuller then theirs who laugh more
but smile lesse, spending more spirits
with straining for an houres mirth than
they can recover in a moneth again;
which renders them so unequall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
whilest she is alwayes equall and the
same. True joy being a constant serious
thing; as far different from light and
gigling <hi>mirth,</hi> as <hi>Elementall</hi> fire from

inspire all who converse with
her, with noble flame and spirit, none
ever departing from her company but
wiser and far better than they came. It

He is never dry nor pumping, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

tis pleasure to observe, how handsomely
he acquits himself; mean time he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
scurrulous nor profane, but a good
man as well as a good companion; and
so far a good fellow too, as hee'le take a

most) whilest taking too many, is like

<hi>Saul</hi> persecuting him: He seeming to
your men of businesse to confer but little
to the seriouser part of life; yet he whets
the knife of the serious man, and is to
businesse as <hi>Musick</hi> to <hi>devotion,</hi> apting
and disposing the mind to it afterwards,
tho for the present delightfully, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it. In fine, he ows much of his good
humour to his complexion, but much
more to his company (alwayes the best
and noblest) so he may be poor, but never
want, or if he do, it is the fault of the
times, and none of his, of which when
he meets with a favourable conjunction,
he is most commonly the Artisan of his
own Fortune, making himself (with a
little industry) afar better than others are
born unto, being the darling of all your
great ones, and nobler sort, the favourite
of Kings, and companion for any Prince.</p>

               <p>He's one who as soon as he has quited
his School-boyes <hi>Toyes,</hi> next <hi>Toy</hi> he
gets is a <hi>Mrs</hi> when t'would make you
forswear <hi>Love</hi> to see how ridiculously
he makes it, and to hear him talk of <hi>Gods</hi>
and <hi>Goddesses,</hi> you would take him for
some <hi>Pagan</hi> never converted to <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
There is nothing so <hi>cold</hi> as to hear
him talk of Flames, nor so <hi>dull</hi> as his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of <hi>Cupids</hi> darts, and to hear him
<hi>sigh</hi> like a dry <hi>Pump,</hi> or broken <hi>winded
bellows;</hi> you would neer wonder at <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Witches</hi> affording winds so cheap.
Of all servants he is the necessariest and
easiest to content and feed, for he is his
Mrs. <hi>Squire, Dispenser, Laquey</hi> or <hi>Messenger,</hi>
but above all her <hi>Fool,</hi> to which he is
bound, by the proverb; <hi>Tis impossible to
love and to be wise:</hi> Mean time, you may
feed him cheaper than a <hi>Chamelion,</hi> for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52959:75"/>
a good look serves him a week at least,
and he is prouder of holding his Mrs.
<hi>Busque</hi> or <hi>Fan,</hi> than a <hi>School Boy</hi> with a
Scepter in his hand, playing the <hi>Emperors</hi>
part ith School; to keep him to which,
his Mrs. lets him know that tis with <hi>Love</hi>
as tis with <hi>War,</hi> which once declared you
are to expect nothing but <hi>Hostility;</hi> and
knows her self, that tis with Lovers as tis
with <hi>Anglers,</hi> who feed the Fish ere they
are caught, but caught once feed on
them: Whence she bites not greedily at
the bait, but craftily tolls him on with
<hi>hopes,</hi> &amp; like <hi>Rope makers</hi> gos backwards
still, the better to advance her work, and
draw him on, mean while he follows her
so long, till either he wax weary and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his persuit, or catches her tripping,
and then fals down on her, when fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her in the marriage nooz, he carries
her away, and either turns kind <hi>Cuckold,</hi>
and keeps open house for all, or jealous
<hi>Coxcomb</hi> and shuts his doores against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one.</p>
