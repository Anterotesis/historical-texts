            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Declaration of his Education in the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> we are very well ſatisfied in, and even
his worſt Enemies have that Charity, as to hope he
is received into that Mercy, through thoſe Merits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The many great Arguments relating to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

               </gap>
Themes too long to be handled in this narrow Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and already more learnedly diſcuſt by abler
Pens. I ſhall only ſay in ſhort, if no Incapacities
whatever can break that Lineal Chain; the whole
State of Humanity is of all Creatures moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and whatever Redemption we may have for
our Souls in the other World, we have very little
Titles to that of our Bodies in this: For Chains
Slavery, Oppreſſion, and whatever the unlimited
power or Pleaſure of Tyranny can lay upon us, are
our Inheritance. If Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Church of <hi>England</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
(as he bleſſes God for it) has taught him this,
the other Members of her Communion bleſs God, tha<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhe has given them quite another Leſſon, and taught
them to ſubmit to the preſent Eſtabliſhment, as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53390:5"/>
Ordinance of God, without any Frights of thoſe

the Adminiſtration of our preſent Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <q>
               <p>As for what I am now to die for, I call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
I went not to that Meeting in <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet,</hi>
with any ſuch intention as to Invite King <hi>James</hi> to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
this Nation, nor was I my ſelf provided with either
Horſe or Arms, or engaged for any Number of Men,
or gave particular Conſent for any ſuch Invaſion, as is
moſt falſly Sworn againſt me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Here he acknowledges his going to the meeting in
<hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi> but not with an intention of Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
King <hi>James</hi> to Invade this Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> by
Force. Was King <hi>James</hi> to be Invited over any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way than by Force? As <hi>little</hi> as he acknowledges
his Talent in <hi>Speaking,</hi> and <hi>Writing,</hi> he muſt own it
much <hi>leſs</hi> in <hi>Thinking,</hi> if his Experience and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Engliſh averſion to King <hi>James</hi> could be
ſo clouded, as but to flatter himſelf with the leaſt
dream of King <hi>James</hi> his Return but by Force. This
Zealous Gentleman for his Old Maſter, muſt be
quite of a different Opinion from all the other Friends
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53390:5"/>
of that Unhappy Prince, eſpecially thoſe on the other
ſide of the Water; his good Friend <hi>Lewis</hi> would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
have never given himſelf the unneceſſary
Trouble and Charge of thoſe Forces drawn down for
King <hi>James</hi> his Deſcent upon <hi>England,</hi> if he had had
any ſuch intire confidence, either in the Juſtice of
his Cauſe, or the Smiles of Providence, to have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
him with a bloodleſs Revolution.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the Interpretation of this Paragraph
will bear a fairer Senſe. Sir <hi>John</hi> did not go to this
meeting, <hi>Himſelf</hi> to Invite King <hi>James</hi> over by Force.
No, perhaps there was no occaſion for it, that Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was already made, and ſo Sir <hi>John</hi> only came
to Viſit and Complement the Inviter, not to make
the Invitation. And if the Invitation to a forcible
Invaſion was made by any other Members of that
<hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet</hi> Meeting, however Sir <hi>John</hi> was ſo
Courteous as to come and kiſs of the Cup, and dip
in the Diſh with them, undoubtedly not over-much
diſreliſht either with his Company, or their Buſineſs
before them, eſpecially when (as he told you before)
<hi>his Religion had taught him, in his Station, to the utmoſt
of his Power to ſupport the Crown in its Lineal deſcent;</hi>
and conſequently ſuch a <hi>Forcible Invaſion</hi> on that very
account, ſhould have a hearty Well-wiſher of Sir
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53390:6"/>
               <hi>John,</hi> if not as Vigorous a Champion; though the
laſt of theſe ſeems moſt agreeable, both to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s
Martial Education, and his Religious Loyalty, when
as he tells you, <hi>the utmoſt of his Power was never
wanting in his Station</hi> on ſo good an occaſion; and
'tis very unlikely that he would want a ſtation in
ſuch important Service; and though he tells you, he
gave no particular Conſent for any ſuch Invaſion,
at leaſt, he Confeſſes his general Conſent; and though
he Charges the Evidence as For-ſworn, upon the nice
Diſtinction between <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Conſent;
'tis very much to be preſumed, that that Evidence
that has hitherto had the Confirmation of dying
Acknowledgments and Confeſſions, ſhould not
ſtretch harder upon Sir <hi>John Fenwick</hi> than upon any
other of the Criminals that dyed in the ſame bad
Cauſe before him.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I alſo declare in the preſence of God, that I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of King <hi>James</hi> his Coming to <hi>Callis,</hi> nor of any
Invaſion intended from thence, 'till it was publickly known;
and the only Notion I had, that ſomething might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,

            <p>This Paragraph looks but with an Indifferent Face,

(for in Charity I would not willingly believe
it his own) were mightily miſtaken in their point of
Time; for what he declares in this, utterly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts,
or at leaſt claſhes with the former. For here
in no leſs preſence than Almighty God, 'tis declared
that Sir <hi>John</hi> knew nothing of King <hi>James</hi>'s coming to
<hi>Callis,</hi> nor any Invaſion intended from thence 'till pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lickly

or general conſent to the Invaſion, in concert with
the whole Club at the <hi>Leaden-Hall-ſtreet</hi> meeting, it
matters not; 'tis ſufficient we have the very Dying
Confeſſions of the Criminals themſelves to own the
Meaſures taken towards an Invaſion, at which Sir
<hi>John Fenwick</hi> by his own Confeſſion was preſent, and
conſequently how far more or leſs conſenting, could
be no ſtranger to an intended Invaſion; yet here is
no leſs than God himſelf call'd to witneſs he knew
nothing of an Invaſion intended, 'till publickly
known; nay, that the only notion he had that any
ſuch thing was upon the Anvil, or like to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
was from the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Fleet coming to
<hi>Breſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay ſuppoſe it in the largeſt ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
Fleet <hi>coming</hi> to <hi>Breſt,</hi> which was in the Spring
Ninety Six, to be meant their very ſetting out in
order to <hi>come</hi> hither, <hi>viz.</hi> their firſt ſetting Sail that
way. Yet, as 'tis notoriouſly known, the <hi>Thoulon</hi>
Fleet ſtirred not out 'till ours was upon Sail home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
many a long Month after <hi>June</hi> 95; ſo ſtill
the unhappy Contradiction is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> That
he knew nothing of the matter before <hi>February.</hi> 95-96,
and yet was privy and conſenting to it the <hi>June</hi>
before. Nay, 'tis yet farther to be wonder'd what
unaccountable pretended Ignorance this muſt be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53390:8"/>
of Sir <hi>John</hi>'s knowing nothing of an Invaſion, 'till
publickly known, (an Invaſion which carries the
Face of a kind of honourable Hoſtility) when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of the Paper tells you, that he was made privy
to no leſs than a baſe Deſign form'd againſt the
King's Life, the very <hi>April</hi> before (<hi>viz.</hi> 95.) which
he tells you he prevented; as if the ſculking Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
durſt truſt the Keys of their Cabinet, their
Edge Tools with him, and the more generous Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
durſt not truſt him with theirs.</p>
            <p>Good Heaven! who were the Managers of this
dying Gentlemans Conſcience, that could ſuffer him
to leave ſuch Living Records of Diſingenuity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but look back to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Reflections made by Sir <hi>John</hi> upon the Credit and
Truth of the Evidence againſt him, where he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
denies his <hi>being</hi> provided <hi>with Horſe and Arms,
or Engaged for any number of Men, or that he gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular Conſent to the Invaſion, as faſly Sworn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him,</hi> &amp;c. And muſt ſay this in their behalfs,
That the Pen-men of this Speech are not ſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be credited in their <hi>Veracity</hi> of the Charge
of <hi>Perjury</hi> againſt the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> when they are ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53390:8"/>
looſe in that point even upon Sir <hi>John</hi>
himſelf; and have had the Misfortune ſo
ſhamefully to prevaricate, ev'n with Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
themſelves in the very Declaration of
his Innocence.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I alſo call God to Witneſs, That I received the
Knowledge of what is contain'd in thoſe Papers, that
I gave to a great Man that came to me in the
<hi>Tower,</hi> both from Letters and Meſſages that came
from <hi>France;</hi> and he told me when I read them to
him, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with moſt of thoſe things before.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I cannot ſo well penetrate into the full
depth of this Paragraph, by reaſon it ſeems to
ſtand in a Darker Light, being ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurer
then the other part of his Paper. Yet
thus far it appears that the matters contain'd in
thoſe Papers, we may ſuppoſe to be ſome part
of a Confeſſion, in order to lay hold of the
Royal Mercy, made to the Noble Peer ſent
to the <hi>Tower</hi> to Examin him, and given him
in Writing, to be tranſmitted to the King;
the Authority of which he declares he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53390:9"/>
from <hi>France.</hi> Whether this was any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
Diſcovery, I will not determine; though
it looks like ſuch, by reaſon the Noble Peer
made anſwer, it was no more than the King
knew before.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall make one Remark, <hi>viz,</hi> That
Sir <hi>John</hi> keeps up to his high Profeſſions
for King <hi>James,</hi> when he dares not ſo much
as give King <hi>William</hi> the Title of King,
though in the Words from another Man's
Mouth, when he tells you, that this great
Man ſhould anſwer him, that the <hi>Prince of
Orange</hi> had been acquainted with thoſe things
before.</p>
            <p>What other Confeſſions Sir <hi>John</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> Such, as that of
accuſing ſo many of the Firmeſt and moſt
Eminent Friends of the Crown, as ntended
more for an Amuzement to the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
than an Ingenuous Diſcovery: Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
all that Knowledge might likewiſe come
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53390:9"/>
from a <hi>French</hi> Mint too; for nothing hardly
of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Face would have a Front hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for ſuch a Forgery; however we dare
not ſuppoſe that to be the Contents of thoſe
Papers in the <hi>Tower;</hi> for then the Great
Man would not have anſwered, <hi>That the King
was acquainted with them before.</hi> For that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
look'd more like a <hi>Gorgon</hi> then a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
fo far from any former Acquaintance
of the Kings, that I ſuppoſe it never ſaw Light,
before Sir <hi>John</hi> and his Prompters thruſt its
Dowdy Face into the World.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I might have expected Mercy from that
Prince, becauſe I was Inſtrumental in ſaving
his Life. For when about <hi>April</hi> Ninety five,
an Attempt againſt him came to my Knowledg,
I did partly by Diſſwaſions, and partly by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
prevent that Deſign, which I ſuppoſe was
the Reaſon that the laſt Villanous Project was
concealed from me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In this Paragraph he makes a kind of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>'s
Plea for receiving of mercy from King
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53390:10"/>
               <hi>William;</hi> for here he confeſſes himſelf entruſted
with a Deſign formed againſt King <hi>William,</hi> of
no leſs Villany than ſome Clandeſtine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
upon the King's Life, which he <hi>partly
by diſſwaſions, and partly by delays prevented,</hi>
and thereby (as he tells you) <hi>ſaved the King's
Life.</hi> We muſt here obſerve, that a Perſon
even of that great Honour and Character as
Sir <hi>John Fenwick,</hi> was nevertheleſs judged that
proper Confident and Counſel-keeper to the
Ruffian Party, as to be made privy to ſo
Black a Deſign as <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> it ſelf. Nay it
further appears, that he tacitly confeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be an Actor and a Leader in it;
for otherwiſe without his privity, how could
he <hi>diſſwade,</hi> or without his own actual <hi>Leading</hi>
Hand, or at leaſt <hi>Commanding</hi> Power in it, how
could he <hi>delay</hi> it.</p>
            <p>What Truth or what Merits ſoever there
may be in this Narrative of his ſecret Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the King I will not judge; but
if any ſuch good Service were really done,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53390:10"/>
'tis a ſign that he has had that Tenderneſs
for the Actors in it, (as much Remorſe as he ſays
he has had for the Act it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
it) that from that day to this he has
wholly conceal'd the Plotters, though at laſt
he has declared the Plot. And this Averſion
of his to a baſe Deſign, he ſuppoſes, was the
Reaſon why <hi>the late Villaous Project was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
from him.</hi> Very likely, for that, or
other Reaſons, it might be conceal'd from
him; for I hear not of any thing of the laſt
<hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> laid to his Charge. But all this
clears not his Innocence from the <hi>Invaſion;</hi>
for that by the whole Party in general, even
by the tendereſt Scrupler of Honour amongſt
them, was reputed a more Manly, more He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick,
and more Warrantable Undertaking.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If there be any Perſons whom I have injur'd
in Word or Deed, I heartily pray their Pardon,
and beg of God to pardon thoſe who have injur'd
me, particularly thoſe who with great Zeal have
ſought my Life, and brought the Guilt of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Blood upon the Nation, no Treaſon being
proved upon me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53390:11"/>
His hearty begging <hi>Pardon of all whom he
had injur'd in Word or Deed,</hi> and his <hi>begging
God to pardon thoſe who had any wiſe injur'd
him,</hi> is a very good Chriſtian Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and would be infinitely both to his
own Glory, and his Ghoſtly Guides, if his
whole Paper had been all of a piece with it.
'Tis true, when he more particularly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thoſe who, as he ſays, <hi>with great Zeal
ſought his Life,</hi> there perhaps he might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
miſtaken, for that <hi>Zeal</hi> might poſſibly
ſavour more of a Loyal Warmth for the
King's Preſervation, and publick Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his Enemies, than any great Heat or
Animoſity againſt the Perſon of Sir <hi>John
Fenwick;</hi> and his Judges are ſo well ſatisfied
in the Equity of their Judgment, that the
Cry of <hi>Innocent Blood hanging over the Nation</hi>
is the leaſt part of their Fears.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I return my moſt hearty Thanks to thoſe noble
and worthy Perſons who gave me their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
by oppoſing this Bill of Attainder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it had been impoſſible I could have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53390:11"/>
fallen under the Sentence of Death. God bleſs
them and their Poſterity, though I am fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
they pleaded their own Cauſe while they
defended mine.</p>
            </q>
            <p>His Expreſſions of Gratitude to thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
whoſe peculiar Tenderneſs inclined them
to Mercy towards him, is very worthy from
him; but where he comes to tell them, that
<hi>it had been impoſſible for him to have fallen
under the Sentence of Death without a Bill of
Attainder;</hi> he would have done well to have
told the World, that he ſtood ſo much upon
his own Innocence, that his trifling Motions
towards a Confeſſion were no falſe Mask of
Candor and Ingenuity, only to protract Time
till <hi>Goodman</hi> could be bribed off and ſpirited
away to <hi>France.</hi> And where he tells them,
that <hi>whilſt they defended his Cauſe they pleaded
their own;</hi> there, I am afraid, he has quite
daſh'd his firſt grateful Acknowledgment; for
God forbid that ſo many worthy Gentlemen,
and Men of Honour and Loyalty, ſhould fall
under Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Dilemma's, or be tinctured
with his Blemiſhes, to ſtand in want either of
a <hi>Plea</hi> or <hi>Defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53390:12"/>
I pray <hi>God</hi> to bleſs my true and lawful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
King <hi>James,</hi> the Queen, and Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> and reſtore him and his Poſterity to this
Throne again, for the Peace and Proſperity of
this Nation, which is impoſſible to proſper till
the Government is ſettled upon a right Foot.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Tranſport and Zeal of this laſt Prayer
ſumms all. His Death only wanted this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive
Proteſtation to ſeal it a Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>The Glory and Merit of the Cauſe in
which he dyes ſo ſuperſedes all the Guilt
of the Fact charged againſt him, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Declaration, this Innocence
alone wipes off all Attainder. There can
be no Blot in that Scucheon where every
private Conſcience is the Herauld.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Sir <hi>John</hi> before told you, That
<hi>his Religion taught him his Loyalty to King</hi>
James, his Church of <hi>England</hi> Perſwaſion:
—Methinks 'tis a mad Church that can
be ſo much <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> as to be ſo ſtrangely
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53390:12"/>
active in Reſtoring of that Prince, that
would bring over Daggers to cut its' own
Throat.</p>
            <p>Methinks the whole Malecontent Party,
eſpecially the Church of <hi>England</hi> Members
amongſt them, ſhould not have forgotten
the more particular Ungrateful Treatment
from that Prince, to that very Church
that mounted him into his Throne, and
conſequently what ſlender Hopes they muſt
have of his future Civility to it, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him thus long out of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if after all this Dreadful Proſpect
before them, (upon Suppoſition of his
Return) their over-ſcrupulous ſtraight-lac'd
Conſciences cannot come up to acquieſce
to the Preſent Eſtabliſhment, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
KING <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> that
Prince's Title, not only ſupported by the
National Aſſent, the beſt Foundation of
Allegiance; but likewiſe by the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of almoſt all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
though even of a contrary Church, the
very <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves. Certainly, I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53390:13"/>
ſay, if there can be any ſuch Depraved
Senſes left in that Communion, they are
undoubtedly reſolved to let the whole
World know, that their Religion has ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diveſted them of their Humanity or
Reaſon, (<hi>viz.</hi>) either in wiſhing ſuch a
Scourge both to them and their Poſterity,
or otherwiſe fancying ſuch Golden Dreams
(or rather Airy ones) from ſuch a <hi>Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Sacred, and as Darling as an Unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
Succeſſion may be eſteem'd, and
as much upon a <hi>Right Foot</hi> as King <hi>James</hi>'s
Title ſtood, nevertheleſs we are but too
