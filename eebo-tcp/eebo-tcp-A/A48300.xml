            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis is that we have to say concerning our Deceased Friend, <hi>Clement Lake,</hi> of <hi>Crediton;</hi> He was a Man of an Innocent upright Life &amp; Conversation, very Tender Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and affectionate towards the Truth, and them that walked in it; He at first received Truth in the love of it, and continued to the end Faithful to its Testimony through all the Exercises he met with; for in the time of his Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he met with no small Opposition and Exercise from and by the Wife of his own Bosom, and also suffered Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Friends for the Testimony of Truth, all which he bore with Patience and Meekness, in a humble mind sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited unto God's Will; and in due time it pleased God through the Spirit of the Lamb to give him the Victory and Dominion over that which stood in his way: he was diligent in frequenting Friends Meetings to wait upon God, though outwardly a man attended with much weakness, and infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Body, and many times being filled with a deep sence of the Love of God unto his Soul, and his Heart tendered and broken thereby, his Mouth was opened to Magnifie and Praise the Lord, and tell by experience of the Goodness of God unto his Soul; In short, we are generally well Satisfied concerning him, that he was a man that did truly Fear God, loved Truth and Righteousness, bore a Faithful Testimony until death; his Conversation was a good savour to all in his day; and now being removed from us, we believe its well with him, and he hath his reward, <hi>viz.</hi> The Crown of Life and Peace, and is at rest in the Lord.</p>

            </head>
            <p>A True Testimony and Account concerning the Life and blessed End of that Faithful Servant of the Lord <hi>Clement Lake;</hi> This I can truly say from a sence I had of him, that I believe he was one whose Meditation was on the Lord, Day and Night, for since I have been concerned to bear a Testimony for the Lord, I have had great Society with him; I have considered his solemn Carriage and weighty behaviour when he was in the Body and I have heard him speak of the many straights and conditions he had been in since first he believed that God did expect Worship and Service from him.</p>
            <p>And further, I have this to say of our Friend <hi>Clement Lake,</hi> Deceased, that he was a Man wholly given up to answer the Mind and Will of the Lord; for I can truly say from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sence I had of him, that his Conversation was Heavenly, and that the Lord hath made his promise good unto him, as he did unto the Righteous in all Ages, and through the Faithfulness of him that hath promised, we are made as Witnesses of it, that his promise is fulfiled in us, by the Spirit of his dear Son Jesus Christ our Lord and Master, for so he is. And I being with <hi>C. L.</hi> and having had a certain knowledge that the Lord's Goodness lasted with him, and he in it unto the end of his Dayes, for which we can do no less then to return the Praise, Glory and Honour that is due unto the Lord, for his Mercy and Goodness bestowed upon his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So he dyed the Death of the Righteous, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Reward of the Faithful.</p>

            <head>The Testimony that I have to bare for my Dear Husband, <hi>Clement Lake</hi> (deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is as followeth;</head>
            <p>HE was a Man endued with much Faith and Patience, tender of the Honour of the Name of the Lord, and Zealous for his Truth and Worship, and a good Patern and Example in his Family, often exhorting me, his Children and Servants in wighty sayings, touching the good and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Souls, telling us, that if we perished he was clear of our Blood; and since his Death several of my Neighbours have born this Testimony of him to me, that they never were in company with him but they received Benefit by it; and farther, I bare Testimony of him, though often attended with much weakness of Body, yet he was very chearful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, many times Declaring the Goodness and Love of God towards him, from time to time, in the many Exercises and Tryals he went through in baring his Testimony for the Truth, in the Town of <hi>Crediton,</hi> (in <hi>Devonshire)</hi> where he lived, and elsewhere; and further, he was a man of a clean Conversation, his very Enemies have since his Death spoken well of him, and confessed they believed he is happy; and further, I cannot well be clear, but must acknowledge, that after my Husband was Convinced of the Blessed Truth, through the many Instigations of those whom we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were in fellowship with, and others, caused me to grieve him very much by ill demeaning my self towards him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time; but since the Lord was pleased to open my

understanding, and give me a sight and sence of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Enemy (who is the sower of discord) I have been much troubled, and known sorrow for the same; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I add, it was the great Love of God towards me in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the desire of my Soul, which was often with many a Cry and Tear, that he would shew me the way of Life and Salvation and where he feeds his Flock and causeth them to rest at Noon day; and since the Lord appeared and answered (Blessed be his pure holy Name for evermore) we lived in great Unity, Love and Fellowship, to the Comfort one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Ah, but at length he was visited with a strong Feaver, whereof he lay near a Week and ended his Dayes here, the 23d of the 12th Month, 1689. And when the Lord was pleased to take him from me, it was I must confess, very heard to me, considering my great loss of so dear and tender a Husband as he was to me; but being throughly perswaded and satisfied in my Heart that he is at rest with the Lord, I am satisfied in the Will of the Lord, who is over all, God blessed for evermore; <hi>Amen,</hi> saith my Soul.</p>

            <p>DEar Christian Friend, the true Christian love I have born to you, ever since I came acquainted with you, and saw the Grace of God in you, hath engaged me in real Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to your Soul, to give you this Paper, if happily the Lord may thereby Confirm you in his Truth, against the Soul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Errors of <hi>Quakerism;</hi> I am perswaded if the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those Men were but truly understood, and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that necessarily flow from them, known to you, you would with as much Satisfaction, chuse to dye a <hi>Martyr</hi> in opposition to that Error, as the Christians of <hi>Queen Mary's</hi> Dayes did, against <hi>Romish Idolitry;</hi> give me leave to say plainly, a <hi>Quaker</hi> cannot be a Christian, I mean a <hi>Quaker</hi> that knoweth and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Principles of that party, and I can confirm it as strongly as I assert it plainly, and will do it for your sake, by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, every part and Branch whereof I am fully satisfied in.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Quakerism</hi> Subvert the Fundamental and Essential Articles of the Christian Religion, then no <hi>Quaker</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands and professeth the Principles of <hi>Quakerism,</hi> can be a Christian, But it doth so as will presently appear; For:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> They Deny the Existance of the Human Nature, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Blood of Christ.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65878:5"/>
               <hi>2.</hi> They Deny the Imputed Righteousness of Christ, as the matter of our Justification.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> They Deny the Resurrection of the Body, and its Partisipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Glory with the Soul.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> They lead Men to the Covenant of Works, and Obedience to the Light within for Salvation.</p>
            <p>All these are there real Opinions, let them dissemble, and hide themselves never so Cunningly, I can prove it out of their own wicked Pamphlets, I have had it from there own Mouths, and that often; and to satisfie you of the truth of what I charge them, if you will but conseal the Paper from them, and ask any of their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers your self, so as they apprehend not your design, these Questions you shall find the Charge Just and Real against them; take a fit Season, and Demand thus.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Are we Justified and Saved by that very Blood of Christ that was shed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or by some other means then by the Blood of the Man Christ Jesus?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Is Jesus Christ now in Heaven in a true and real Body of Flesh and Blood? Or is he not?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Is the Active and Passive Obedience, which Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed here on Earth, in the dayes of his Flesh, the matter of our Righteousness before God? Or is it something in our selves?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Shall these very Bodys of Flesh and Blood rise again at the last Day, and be glorified with the Souls, and remain Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bodys still, for Substance, though glorified Bodys for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? Or what shall become of them?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Must we expect Salvation by believing in Christ for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and applying his Righteousness to our Souls by Faith? or must we expect it by Obedience to the Light within us?</p>
            <p>This being done discretly, so as that they see you do for Satisfaction, and not to intangle them, I am confident you will find to your Sorrow, that I have too Justly charged them with those Damnable Errors, and then the Snare is broken, and

your Soul escaped; But you must have a care of there deceitful Answers, and hold them close to the words of each Question, else they will hide the hook in general and plausable answers.</p>
            <p>But it were better for you to converse on these points with sound and sollid Christians, that know their Principles, then trust your self amongst them; but if you must, I doubt not but by a discreet management you may have it from the Mouthes of their chief Leaders; the Lord keep your Soul in his Truth; remember there are damnable Errors, <hi>2 Peter 2. 5.</hi> as well as Practices Give me a few Lines that may rejoyce, and comfort my Heart concerning you, for my love to you makes me Jealous over you.

               <hi>Clement Lakes</hi> Answer to the foregoing Letter.</head>
            <p>I Have considered thy Letter, and the high Charges in it; and to begin with the first.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That they deny the Existans of the Humane Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall, as I said, answer in Scripture Language, and shall take heed of Philosophical words, because I do not profess my self to be one; I look on it as a Just and reasonable thing due from all men, that all proposals of Questions to others about there Faith and Believe of the Scriptures, should be in Scripture Language; I do not remember that ever I read of the word <hi>Existaens</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> in all the Scriptures of Truth; I shall take heed according to the Apostle's advice, of vain Philosophy, and shall ground my Faith according to the Scriptures of Truth in all the matters on which my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dependeth.</p>
            <p>I believe that Christ is glorified with the Father, with the same Glory he had before the World was, according to <hi>John</hi> 17. 5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. He is received up to Glory, and that he shall come again in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 27. And that he is sitting on the right hand of Power, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 62. And that he ascended up far above all Heavens; And that he is gone into Heaven, and is on the Right Hand of God, and that it is a Glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. And if this make me an Heretick, for belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as the Scripture hath said, I shall willingly bare thy Judgment.</p>

For the Second part of it, <hi>That they deny the Satisfaction of the Blood of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a false Lying Slanderous Charge, charge it who will; for my part, according to what I have heard and seen since acquainted with them, of all the sorts of Professors that I have been conversant with, I have not known any to have a greater Esteem for, and put a greater value on the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, then those do that are thus charged; and indeed it is no wonder that they thus value it, seeing a remnant have experienced such unexpressable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from it, and benefit by it.</p>
            <p>As for my part, I believe Salvation in no other and out of him there is none; and I believe, and know it is the Faith of those with whom I walk, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. And he is the Propitiation for our Sins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. And he hath purchased us with his own Blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and by him we have Remission of Sin, and we are Justified by his Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9. And by it we have Eternal Redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. And if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Christ cleanseth us from all Sin: And what the difference is between the walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Light, that is so much derided, and walking in Christ, I know not; but if we walk in him the Blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse us from all Sin, <hi>John</hi> 7. 9. And I believe not only from the guilt, but from the filth also, verse 9. And I believe that Sanctification and Justification are inseparable.</p>
            <p>I see but little mention made in thy Letter of the cleansing vertue of Christ's Blood, or the work of Regeneration that must be wrought in man, or the new Birth that must be Experienced, or no entreing the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. And we believe, that for all those for whom the Blood of Christ maketh Satisfaction, they know and Experience a

They know Redemption from a vain Conversation by the pretious Blood of Christ, and I hope that this is also clear, If Scripture will pass, and I be believed, that it is the Faith of those called Quakers.</p>
            <p>As to the Second, that <hi>They deny the Imputed Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the matter of</hi> Our <hi>Justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I answer this Question, I would query my self what is ment by <hi>Our?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether it be all men universally, without condition or quallification? and so whether Christ did in the Body of his Flesh, in his own Person all that was to be done for man? or whether his work is not to be experimentally known in every man, for the destruction of Sin, and the work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by all that shall have the benefit of his imputed Righteousness, yea or nay?</p>
            <p>For my part this is my Faith, that he is a blessed Man to whom the Lord imputeth Righteousness, and to whom the Lord will not Impute Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. But I believe also, that those Souls that are in this Ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed State, do know and Experience a work of Sanctification wrought in them, and the destruction of Sin wrought for them, and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Sin, all wrought by the same Lord Jesus Christ for all those that believe in his Name and Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. And he was also made manifest for the destruction of the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. And where this work is wrought for man, and in man, the fruit of the Spirit is brought forth, according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. And this also is my Faith, that they also know the old man to be Crucified, that the Body of Sin may be destroyed, that henceforth they may not serve Sin; and so know a washing and a sanctifying, before
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65878:8"/>
they know themselves to be Justified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. And those shall have the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That <hi>they deny the Resurrection of the Body, and its Partisipation of Glory with the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is another false Charge; we believe the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, that the dead shall be raised up incorrupta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. And we believe the Resurrection of the dead both of the Just and Unjust, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. And that those vile Bodys shall be made like to his Glorious Body, <hi>Phil</hi> 3. 21. And we believe that all that are in the Grave shall come forth, they that have done well to the Resurrection of Life, and they that have done Evil, to the Resurrection of Damnation, <hi>John</hi> 5. 28. 29. And those that are guided by the Counsel of the Lord, and follow it here, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up to Glory <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 24 And that we shall be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gather with the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 18. And we believe that those that follow Christ in the Regeneration deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and take up the Cross, shall Inherit Eternal Life, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 28, 29. And we believe also, that the end of those that are Enemies to the Cross of Christ, will be destruction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That they lead Men to the Covenant of Works, and Obedience to the Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Slander, cast out of the Mouth of the old Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon like a Flood, to prejudice the World, and spread by his Agents; what ground Men have for this Charge I know not, except it be for pressing People to the Mortification of Sin by the Power of the Lord, denying of self, Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Flesh, with the Affection and Lust thereof, and tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng up the Cross and following of Christ, who is our Way, Truth and Life, out of whom we believe there is no Salvation from Sin or Wrath: No Name or Power given under Heaven whereby any Soul can be saved, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65878:9"/>
Jesus Christ; He is our all in all, and man is nothing, neither can do any thing as to his own Salvation; for without him we can do nothing, it is he that worketh both to will and to do of his own good Pleasure: And to as many as receive him, to them he giveth Power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his Name, which Faith also is the Gift of God. It would be thought hard measure from us if we should say, that because no mention is made in all thy Letter, of any thing that is to be wrought in man, or done by man, as a Quallification of those that shall partake of those benefits by Christ, that therefore you do believe that Men may partake of them, and yet do what they will, and live as they list, tho we have as great a ground for it, as any have for charging us to lead Men to the Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>For the Second part of the Charge, <hi>That they lead Men to Obedience to the Light within for Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I will say, that Rebellion is as the Sin of Witch-craft, and Stubbernness is as Idolatry, and that without Obedience there will be no eating the Fat of the promised Land. And for the Light within so much despised by the dark Rabbies of the World, this Light of <hi>Israel</hi> shall be for a Fire, and his Holy One for a Flame, that shall burn and devour the Thorns in one day, <hi>Esa.</hi> 01. 17. And that we press Obedience to the Light within, we own, who is Jesus Christ the Light of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Light of the World, who is given to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the People, and a Light to the Gentiles, to open the Blind Eyes, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42. 6, 7. This was <hi>David's</hi> Light to his Feet, and Lanthorn to his Paths, <hi>Psa.</hi> 119. <hi>vers.</hi> 115. And this word, or Light, or Jesus was in the beginning; and in him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men, 1 <hi>John</hi> 8. And this beginning he is our Light and Life, and he it is that expels the Darkness out of the Heart; and those that are Obedient to him are called the Children of Light, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:65878:9"/>
5. 8. And it is by this Jesus Christ, who is the Wisdom and Power of God, the Light that maketh manifest all things as they are, that bringeth down every Imagination in man that exalteth it self against the Lord, and bringeth every thought into Obedience to himself; he it is that is the author of Eternal Life to all that obey him, <hi>Hebrew</hi> 5. 8. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. And that he is within, and dwelleth in the Saints, we own it, tho for owning it we are an Abomination to the Egyptians, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Are not the Saints the Temple of God? And doth he not dwell in his Temple? And is it not in the Heart? And is not the Heart within? And is not his Throne there? And is it not there he giveth in those sweet and blessed Comforts to his People? And is it not there he poureth out his Wrath on the Wicked? And is it not in the Heart that he is striving with the Children of Men, to reclaim them by his motions? And Mens Disobedience to it is a grieving of him, and rebelling against him, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 19. And it seemeth to me, that any man that hath Reason or Religion, should be satisfied with this account, unless those that will Unchristian others that they might be thought the best Christians themselves, and bespatter others that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves might shine. And So I have answered the first four Charges, and if I am besides the Truth, I desire it may be manifested to me in a few Lines.</p>
            <p>I look on it as a Just and Reasonable thing, that before any Man Unchristian another, that first they prove there own Position to be according to Truth.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, that they prove those Persons guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying those Truths, for which they Unchristian them, which neither is done in thy Letter, but by a bare say so, as if it must be true because it is said, and said by such a one; but it is no new thing, such there were in the dayes of old, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. But he that hath the Key of <hi>David</hi> hath opened a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65878:10"/>
Door to us, that no man can shut, and by this little strength we have kept his word, and have not denyed his Name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 8, 9. For which the People are angry that we do not as they have done: And nothing less then to Unchristian us will serve. But what if the day should come that you should acknowledge the Lord hath loved us? sure it would be a great change? I shall not inlarg any furher, to speak of the five last things, but may refer them until I have the answer from them, from whom it is expected; and as I have said formerly, wherein I am beside the Truth, in what I have written, let it be signified to me in a few lines, who am a well-wisher to the prosperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and desire the Good of all men,</p>

            <p>I Received lately an Answer to my Letter, written many Years since, to preserve you from Quakerism, whether this Answer were made by you or others, I examine not, for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose; our point is not what you believe, But what is the known published Doctrine of the Quakers, from which my care was to preserve you; I told you that a Quaker owning the professed Principles of Quakerism, cannot be a Christian, and instanced in several Fundamental Points of Christian Doctrine denyed by them; to all of which you gave me your own private Judgment, in Scripture terms, which seemeth generally sound, as I hope you still remain in your own Principles: But what is this to the Doctrine of that People with whom you now walk, forsaking those Assemblies where first you found Christ, if ever you found him; I am only concerned to prove my Assertions, that Quakerism overthroweth Christianity; and this is plain by what followeth, which I take not up upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports at Random, but give it you out of their own printed Discourses.</p>

            <p>Secondly, He cannot be a Christian that affirmeth Perfection, and Freedom from Sin on this side Heaven, <hi>1 John 1. 8.</hi> This hath been often asserted in my hearing by the Quakers, and is Printed by <hi>Mason,</hi> in page <hi>3.</hi> of his Book, quoted from Ephes. <hi>4. 12.</hi> Concluding thus, <hi>Were England's Blind Watch-men Commissioned from Christ, they would not thus prate against Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, He cannot be a Christian that maketh no distiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Godly, and the Ungodly, but doth affirm that Christ enlightens every man that cometh into the World, with a saving Light; but so did <hi>John Stubs, George Fox,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others affirm it, and defend it in a set dispute with <hi>Mr. Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> in the Printed dispute, Page <hi>13.</hi> Labouring to prove <hi>that every man in the World hath the Spirit of Christ savingly in him,</hi> from <hi>1 Cor. 12. 7.</hi> If so, we must alter the whole frame of cripture and <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> And as to Christ's imputed Righteousness, how slighting doth <hi>Nayler,</hi>

            <p>It may be you will say these were But perticular Persons, and you reject there mistakes, I say, they were the leading men of your party; and how shall we know your Opinions but from there Books? as for you, I pray the Lord would preserve you sound in the faith, and return you to your first Love, to his Saints and Ordinances.

            </head>
            <p>I Received thy Letter, and by it understand that thou hast received mine, which thou dost question whether made by me or others; I assure thee that no other but my self did indite or write one Line or passage of that or this; thou tellst me again that a man owning the professed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Quakers can not be a Christian; and that thou didst instance in several Fundamental Points denyed by them, to which I replyed they were false Charges, and to all of them I should give my reply as my own private Judgment, which was seemingly sound.</p>
            <p>This is another abuse, seeing I said, it was the Faith of those called Quakers also, and the Faith of those with whom I walked. But it seems tho my Answer were sound yet not very Acceptable, for it was in Scripture terms. It is true, I am utterly against it that Scripture should bow to vain Philosophy, and to be wise above what is written, and also it seems one thing not liked, my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakeing those People with whom I have walked, (it is true) while they walked I walked with them; but when they grew weary and sat down, must I be blamed for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they did, because I walked still, and that by the Footsteeps of the Flock according to there own adivce,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65878:12"/>
and cannot set down or turn back? There is one thing that I have observed of the like nature, and is counted rather a Vertue then a Vice in others (which is this) in the time when the Sheepherds fled, and the People scattered, the Cross of Christ appearing, the People crept in under the Wing of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for shelter, I do not say to avoid the Cross of Christ, (look they to that) sheltered they were, and fed too, with such food as they had to give them, if not wholsome, why did they use it? What made them there? Why did their Stewards permit it, if they found the Bread of Life there? Why are they drawn off again? was not this permitted by thee and others, if not approved? (and why was it?) to keep the Children quiet, that they might not Cry for Bread, when the Stewards would not give them any, for the Lyon was in the way; was it good Bread then, and is it Husks now? Now they will feed these People themselves, or rather these People must feed them, for their Bread now yeildeth a good rate, and if they will not come up to the price, we will go to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flock: Well now, these People must leave those with whom they have walked, and be blamless, but blamed if they will not leave them; surely I must needs say that they all dealt very disingenously with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to leave them now they have most need of them, as I have told many to there Faees, and not only so, but rejoyce in there Ruin, which is an ill requital for there former kindness; but enough of that.</p>
            <p>In thy former Letter thy Charges were drawn, and in thy last Letter I expected proof of what was then Charged, but I have failed of my Expectation, and of fare dealing too, for the first Bill is lost, and a new Indictment is drawn up, which is not fare; it yet lieth on thee to prove it, or bare thy shame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65878:13"/>
In thy first Letter we were Unchristianed by thy false Accusation and lying Slanders no small Evil for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ to be found guilty of, to unchristian such a body of People with a bare say so, it is a Spot, but not of God's Children, they are Children that will not lye; and it hath caused my Heart to grieve that such a one as thy self should be the author and spreader of them, so that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in this place who have had thy Person in admiration, have been doing the same evil Work, having an Implicet Faith, much like a Generation of men, who believe as the Church believeth, and it is true because the Church saith it; and so they did believe it and spread it because thou said'st it. But now the Refuge of Lyes is sweeping away, People having had oppertunity of hearing Friends, and Conversing with them in this place, thy Folly now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, and thy Assertions are found to be Lyes, tho' <hi>John Flavell</hi> have said it, <hi>Hicks, Faldoe</hi> and others; for the Earth is lightned with the Glory of the Lord, and we would that all men knew us as we are, and then let them judge, for we are not ashamed of our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>But to leave the first, and come to the Second Charge or Indictment, <hi>He cannot be a Christian that rejects the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a Rule.</hi>

            <p>3dly, <hi>He cannot be a Christian that affirmeth Perfection or freedom from Sin on this side Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is the Scripture rejected here, and made to bow down to the experience of men? who are taught by their Teachers, <hi>that it is impossible to have the Works of the Devil destroyed;</hi> and so make void Christ's Coming, when some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there is that cannot be parted with, and therefore a Cry is made, damnable Doctrine to have Sin destroyed.</p>

I shall first lay down that God hath commanded it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> Matth. 19. 24. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, sell all;</hi> All must go if God call for it, or no Perfection; he had done many things, and that from his Youth up, and many Sins doubtless were slain, and the man dead to them; A brave Professor for our days; but one thing must be kept, a Wedge of Gold, a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish</hi> Garment; he had great Possessions, and that he could not part with for Treasure in Heaven, the pretiousness of which he had not the Experience of by Faith, and this made him go away sorrowful; doubtless he liked not the Doctrine of Perfection like the People of our days, men can be content to have Drunkenness and Swearing, Murder, Theft, and such like <hi>Goliah</hi>'s slain; this is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to live without to some, and cry, they will enough against those that will not, and well worthy: But what Sin is it I would fain know that the Lord cannot, yea, will not destroy and keep us from as well as these, if People did not hide them, and will not let them go? Is it possible men may have the greater, and not the lesser slain by the Power of the Lord? if they would bring them forth, he would slay them before the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

There is something that is sweet to them, like as to <hi>Saul,</hi> goodly in their Eyes, and that must be spared; but that which is Wild, Disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Reproachful, that must be destroyed; but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the other was his Ruin. Ah, if People were but ingenious, and bring forth that to the Sword that is for the Sword, and that to the Fire that is for the Fire, would not then this Sword and Fire of God's Spirit burn up and destroy those Fatlings and Lambs that they keep in their Bosom, as well as that which is Wild and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge?</p>

I shall desire thee to view what thy own Pen hath written, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. of the Saint indeed; thy definition of keeping the Heart, it is to have the Heart set right; It will be too tedious to transcribe all, view it what thou sayest there, what man was by Creation, what man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came by Degeneration, and what man is by Regeneration, where all is set right again; and <hi>pag.</hi> 22. <hi>Had they kept their Hearts with God, all had been well;</hi> and what is that but to keep from Sin, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. holy <hi>Job</hi> durst not suffer his Heart to yield to an impure Thought, surely then to no wicked Action, and so in a Sinless State, as long as he kept there. I would fain know of thee, if thou dost please, whether it be possible for a <hi>Christian</hi> to observe those directions laid down in thy Book? If possible, whether that Soul will not then be kept from Sin? and if possible, why are we then Unchristian'd for believing of it? If impossible, why thou dost press People then to Impossibilities, and take Money for it to view thy own Book well, and practice it also? and I dare to say thou wilt come to that blessed state; Look to the 191 <hi>pag.</hi> read it at large, where thou cryest out, <hi>Away with bold Censuring.</hi> But it was but a little way, for in the 194 <hi>pag.</hi> thou canst Censure the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they never knew what belong to Practical Godliness, and study of their own Hearts: I beseech thee in the bowels of Love, do not be found in the number of them that say and do not; by what Scripture-Rule dost thou thus judge the Secrets of thousands of Hearts, Persons whom thou never knewest nor sawest: View 198 and 199 <hi>pag.</hi> where thou complainest of the Lives of Professors; and how can it be otherwise? (What is the Reason of it?) they are told it is impossible to get themselves free of Sin; and so one sets down Captivated with one Sin, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with another Sin. I tell thee in the Bowels of Love,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65878:15"/>
that if ever the Lord did send thee to Preach the Gospel, it was for the Perfecting of the Saints, and turning men from the Power of Satan to the Power of God, and from Darkness to Light; and not to tell them the strong man cannot be cast out, and all his Goods spoiled, <hi>But,</hi> say you, <hi>there is something that cannot be destroyed;</hi> Where then is the Purgatory to cleanse Souls? You say, and it is true, That as the Tree falleth, so it lieth; and if men dye in their Sins, where Christ is gone they cannot come, and no unclean thing can enter the Kingdom of Heaven; and yet poor People cannot be cleansed: Ah the Souls that split on this Rock!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> The Scripture holdeth forth there have been Perfections; I shall quote the Scriptures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 64. 4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 21. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. 11. where the Apostle Prayeth for it, and Exhorteth to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>How shall we that are dead to Sin live any longer therein?</hi> Men must know a Death to Sin, or I will be bold to say, shall know a Death for Sin, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. They must know the Old man Crucified, that the Body of Sin may be destroyed, that henceforth they should not serve Sin, <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. He that is dead, is freed from sin; men will not know a Freedom from Sin, until they know a Death to Sin, <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. Being then made Free from sin, they became Servants of Righteousness; <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. When dead to sin, then servants to Righteousness, and then men have their Fruits to Holiness and their End is Everlasting Life: This is the Doctrine of Christ.</p>
            <p>But the Doctrine of Devils is to say, <hi>that men may Sin, and not dye;</hi> he was the first that preached it; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Ye shall not dye;</hi> here is the great Lyar; And what are those men that say, <hi>men cannot be free from Sin till they come to Heaven, cannot cease from Sin till come to Heaven?</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65878:15"/>
that <hi>Sin cannot be destroyed?</hi> What is this but to make Christ's coming void, who came to destroy the Works of the Devil, to save his People from their Sins? Is not this a departing from the Faith that overcometh the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and a giving heed to the seducing Spirit and Doctrine of Devils, to speak Lyes to uphold the Devil's Kingdom? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. and unchristian all that believe; as the Scripture hath said, that Christ saveth from Sin, (not in Sin) from the Power and Practice, from the Filth as well as the Guilt, all that he will save from Hell and its Damnation; and who are those that cry out against it, but those that will make Christ, Scripture, and all bow down to their sinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Is there not some little one in them, that they will not give up to God's Sword and Fire, some Fatlings in their Bosom, goodly in their Eyes, like <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet think their Souls shall live for all this, that gather up the Failings of the Saints to feed upon; that because <hi>Noah, David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and others failed, they may, yea, must sin all their days: I beseech thee in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der love of the Lord, to perswade the Children of men to a thorow Work of Sanctification in Body, Soul and Spirit, and a perfecting Holiness in the Fear of God, and a Cleansing from all Unrighteousness, and a casting out of the Heart all that offend him, not only some things, but all things that offend him, all which is to be done by the Power of the Lord; and so come to know a Perfection in Christ, and so come to be one with Christ, as he is with the Father, and the strong man cast out, and all his Goods spoiled, and so come to be a Habitation for God through the Spirit. My Heart is here enlarged, and my Mouth opened to bear witness to the Truth of God, that Christ is able and willing to save from all Sin, and to keep us from failing, if men believe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65878:16"/>
in his Power, and keep to it; for it will be to all men according to their Faith; but if men do not, yea, will not believe Christ is that he, that can (yea) and will do these things for them, they shall dye in their Sins, and where he is gone they cannot come.</p>
            <p>3dly, <hi>He cannot be a Christian that maketh no distinction between the Godly and the Wicked, or Ungodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Saddle best fits thy own Horse, on whose back I shall set it, look to the Epistle of thy Book called <hi>The Saints indeed;</hi> where no difference is made between the Godly and the Ungodly, the one so Confers, Prays, bewailes Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, talks of Experience, open their Condition, neglect the watch over the Heart, and does often fall into scandalous Sins as the Wicked do? What difference dost thou make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Godly and Ungodly Hearts, except it be in this that one shall go to Heaven, and the other to Hell, tho they thus live, no difference in the Life, except it be that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called by thee are worse in their Lives, for by their example they make fast the bands of death upon both; the former are cruel, and shed the Blood of other Souls; fall often into Scandalous Sins; and for proof <hi>David</hi> is brought, He committed Murder and Adultery: Did he fall into this often? was it the Practice of his Life? was not the remaining part of his Life spent in mourning and watching, and warning against, and praying against all Sin? and did he not declare his abhorrance of it, by his abstaining from it, all false wayes he did utterly abhor? and did he utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it with his Tongue, and not abstain from it in his Life? surely his remaining Years were far different from the Life of the Wicked, and so were the Life of other Saints after their falls, and therefore take this Charge home to thy self, who pleads for Sin term of Life, and Unchristian
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65878:16"/>
others who plead for purity of Heart and Life, and a ceasing from Sin, and a Freedom indeed by the Truth: Be not offended because I spake forth the Words of Truth, it is for the honour of my Saviour Christ Jesus. And it is my Testimony that I bare against the Devil and Sin and the Pleaders for it (that he can) that he doth) that he will save from Sin those that believe in him, and come to him and receive him in all his Offices, to them he will give Power to become the Sons of God; and what is that, but to cease to do Evil, and learn to do Well?</p>
            <p>And now for the proof of thy Charge, for which we are Unchristianed, and that we make no Difference between the Godly and the Wicked, is this, <hi>that Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth Every one that cometh into the World with a saving Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would fain know whether Saints be Born Saints? If not, but all are by nature Children of Wrath, Enemies to God by wicked works, as I believe they are; Then whether that Spirit that strived with them, and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them of Sin, Righteousness and Judgment, and brought them out of the state of Darkness, Enmity and Rebellion, and turneth them, or leadeth them from the power of Satan, to be lead, giuded and governed by the Power of God, be not the same Spirit, that is striving with and in the Wicked to reclaim them? and whether it would not reclaim them, if they did follow it and obey its Reproofs, Instructions and Counsels? God gave his Good Spirit to the old World and others, and doubtless willing and sufficient to save them, if they had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and rebelled against it; it was Gods Good Spirit that was saving which was given to rebellious <hi>Israel,</hi> but they Rebelled and Vexed it, that it could not dwell in them,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65878:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and it is the same secret still Voice that cryeth after, or in Man and Woman, <hi>This is the Way, walk in it; Return, Return, why will you Dye?</hi> But by Rebellion against, and Resistance of, Grieving, Vexing and Quenching its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it ceaseth to strive, and wo then to that Soul when left to commit Sin with Greediness.</p>
            <p>And as I have said formerly, I say again, if in any thing thou supposest I am beside the Truth, signifie it to me in a few Lines, who desireth and prayeth for the coming of God's Kingdom in the Hearts of the Children of men.</p>
