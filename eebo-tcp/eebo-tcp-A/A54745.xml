            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface <hi>To the Youthful Gentry.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT hath been such an hereditary practice for the Author, to declare to the Reader the depth of his design, that should I decline this custom, I should not free my Endeavors from the nice exceptions of the too curious Criticks of these times. When Playes were at their height, Prologues were so in fashion at the Court, and so desired on the Stage, that without them the Audience could not be pleased; so that the best Poets were forced to satisfie the greedy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the multitude, that gaped and yawned for such set and starcht speeches to be gravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to their Worships by the man in the long cloak with the coloured beard. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Mr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> that though he writ with such a free and sparkling Genious, that future Ages shall scarce ever parallel, yet his importunate Commedians would often croud upon him such impertinences, which to him seem needless and lame excuses, his Works being so good, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation rendred them as the only bad Lines his modest <hi>Thalia</hi> was ever humbled with. The truth is, when an Author hath set down well, and so descended to his Readers capacity, that
<pb facs="tcp:42260:4"/>
his Muse is obvious and easie to be understood, what needs there a Clavis or a Thred where there is no Labyrinth; notwithstanding, we cannot but be sensible that some Prefaces have so abused the credulous Readers trust, that they cannot now be too slightly set by, as most of them may; and that not improperly, be fitly compared to rich capparrison'd Jades, to painted Inn-posts, to Wenches admirably trickt forth, but pull off their dressings, and they look like flead Cats. What the Country-man said of the Nightingale, <hi>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> A great cry and no wool, may be rightly applied to them. I acknowledge, Courteous Reader, that as I have already in my Epistle to the <hi>Coy Ladies,</hi> discourst Jovially and Ironically of Love, as also in my other Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, treated by way of Introduction, of the right management of Eloquence and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if I had not still inforced my Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to further serious and useful Instructions, for my Readers greater benefit, this Preface had been like those I have found fault with, superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; or at least to little purpose. And now it will be expected, nor can I do otherwise, then make an ingenious confession, why I set those subjects of Love and Complements apart by themselves; I shall give my Reader sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that I might not justle too much matter into this Preface, which I only intend for a Landskip to the Work, my whole design being included in these two particulars. First, why I have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished this Volume. Secondly, what Profit and Delight an understanding Reader may expect
<pb facs="tcp:42260:4"/>
to drive to himself from his diligent perusal of it.</p>
            <p>For the first, to deal plainly with my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, the several simple Pamphlets that have treated so surreptitiously of this subject, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted this employment from me, as I could not but be highly incensed, to see them so cheated and baffled by such specious pretenders, but most wretched performers of what they undertook. I will not vex my Reader with the Names or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles they are distinguisht or dignified with, I hope by this time all Ingenious Persons have learnt sufficiently to detest them. For my own part, in these my Studies I have not so much as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any other notice of them, then to shun the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their papers; and though some may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that the Green is the same that we bowl on, such persons, if they make but the least inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shall quickly find that my Byas is turned another way, my flight is higher, my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are different; for without any vain glory I may confidently attest to the world, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of several persons of Honour, as well by their particular prescriptions, as also by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of their choisest Manuscripts, built up this Volume. It took its birth from them, to whom with a most sincere gratitude it doth again hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dedicate it self.</p>
            <p>For my second Consideration, what benefit the Peruser of this Book is likely to acquire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, I shall express to him in few words; he hath, as I may rightly call it, a Magazin richly furnisht, for his dispatch of any of those high Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:42260:5"/>
               <hi>Cupid</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> shall at any time instate him in; all manner of Adresses, Entertainments, and Ceremonies, whether of Salutation, Love or Court-ship, which are comprehended under those Heads of Wooing and Complements; from whence as from two Springs, the other lesser streams do distill, whether of Prose or Verse, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Drolling Subjects in Letters, or otherwise; these contain in them, a grand part of the body of this Work; for the other Additions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, Posies, Characters, Jeasts, Clinches, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, &amp;c. as also the <hi>Miscelania,</hi> of Natural, Amorous, Moral, Experimental, Paradoxical, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ovial Questions with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, I am confident they will no less inrich the Readers Mind, then admirably delight his Fancy. As for the several <hi>A-la-mode</hi> Games and Sports, I have inserted them with such plain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that any person of a reasonable capacity, may quickly be expert in them; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I have invented a Riming Dictionary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Monasyllables, for the ending of Verses, applicable for those that are yong Practioners in the pleasant Sport named <hi>Crambo:</hi> together with another particular Alphabet, intituled, <hi>The triall of Wits,</hi> which consists of Epithets, properly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for immediate use, on the sudden occasions of Writing or Discourse, which I have also appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the other Recreation, so much in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, called Substantives and Adjectives. And that the Ingenious Reader may be assured of my care and industry, to render this Book worthy of his acceptance, I have also presented him with a
<pb facs="tcp:42260:5"/>
compleat Tract of the Art of Logick by way of Question and Answer, so clearly delineated, that the Judicious Student may in a short time attain to a competent knowledge of those most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary ways of Arguing and Disputing, so much practised in the Universities.</p>
            <p>How advantagious this work will be to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Persons, will more easily be instanced, if we rightly consider the incongruity of mens parts, and look narrowly into their gifts; one speaks well, but writes improperly, another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his pen in excellent sence, but wants good language; another hath a good invention but no method; so that whatsoever some of our Moderns pretend to their <hi>ex tempore</hi> inspirations, it cannot but be confessed by all men in their right minds, that Artificial set Forms may be aiding to them all, not as they are litterally to be applied but as they are additional helps to quicken and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Genius. This my assertion will be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made good, if we do but consider the smooth effeminate silken tribe, how some of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themselves, who if they are put to it on sudden alarums or unexpected summons of their fancies by letters, or otherwise, how are they forced in such exigents, to have recourse to their Romances, Plays, Manuscripts, and such like Common place books, they turn down the page, transcribe, and for the present subsist on such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der notions. How without blushing can I express it, that I have known a wench of fourteen, with a few Dramatical <hi>Drayton</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> Quillets, put to the <hi>non plus</hi> a Gallant of thirty; I may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:42260:6"/>
dispose on it, that I have heard such a Lass defeat a Gentleman of some years standing at the Inns of Court.</p>
            <p>To those that scruple at Complemental Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Tenders of Service, I positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that such nimble applications, if rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, are most absolutely useful; and that those which have been adorned with such qualifications have had such tall advantages over others, as sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never to fall short of their ends; more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when their good behaviours have been set off with Eloquence, which though it often carries with it self a false fire, yet if it be smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and discreetly manag'd, it works wonders, not only for the present, but future times to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at. Not to detain the worthy Reader with any longer suspence of so unquestioned a truth, I shall only desire thee to take notice, that these my endeavours had a gentle rise, so they still car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them a more than ordinary splendor; as they have shuned the common rode of all former Writers, so that if with <hi>Phaeton</hi> my muse is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times placed in the Chariot of the Sun, that she soars at the highest and most generous Designs; she may apologize for her self, that it was not her ambition, but the commands of several noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose importunity from her most serious Studies diverted her so far, as to make her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of their recreations, whether they took the air in the <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> raced in <hi>Hide Park,</hi> or expaciated, as <hi>Portugals</hi> called it, in <hi>New Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> or otherwise revelled at their Balls; in
<pb facs="tcp:42260:6"/>
all which Celebrations of pleasures with them, though my Muse was obleiged to observe some particulars, yet they are such as are civil and modest, such as need no veil, nor reflect upon any person whatsoever; and I hope so well of her, that as her Sphere is higher, she hath not been deficient in this her Deportment, so as to stoop to any more inferiour Theam, then what might be worthy of her. Courteous Reader, of late there hath been a scarcity of Wit, it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seem to be more discretion in us, for to husband it as well as we can; what thou hast here, as I have sufficiently intimated, hath been derived from the best hands, such sprightly quick wit, as I can assure thee no language in so small a page ever afforded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: In a word, thou mayest rest satisfied, that the ingenuity that is contained in this Book, is to much for one single brain to teem with, and therefore wonder not, if in such a Caskanet thou findest so much of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable treasure to inrich thy Fancy with; such, but that it seems too proud an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression from my self, others have been bold to affirm, that to compleat this Volume, they could not imagine what more could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or invented. For my own part, worthy Reader, I submit these my best endeavours to thy impartial and judicious censure, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of thy well poised Genius, as the only <hi>Jacob</hi>'s staff, with which the height of these conceptions can be rightly taken; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb facs="tcp:42260:7"/>
the inconsiderate opinion of some ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Criticks may be, I am confident that as long as Wit, Love, or Courtship are in fashion, this Book shall live and flourish.</p>

            <p>INcouraged by your former inexpressible favors, I am at this time emboldned to prostrate these my Devoirs at your feet: after your Ladiships e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress from the <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> I was invited by the pleasure of the season, into the solitary reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redness of an Arbour, where in my Tale-book I intended to insert some slender Observations of those harmless Transactions and civil Frolicks, that had past betwixt you and your Servants, whose entertainments you had graced that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the serene influences of your propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous smiles. I had scarce for the recreation of my Genius, employed my pen to the draught of the first Character, when of a sudden from a shady Grove, I heard a mournful hollow sound, which at the first, I imagined to have been occasioned by some fresh gale of wind, that had only rustled among the trees, till ascertained otherwise by the iteration of a Heart-tearing groan: I was so far disturbed as to cast my eye of one side, where I soon discovered a woful weight; who by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly posture, and leaning of himself so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedly against a tree, as if he supported it; I could not but with probability of reason at the the first sight determine, to be some wretched In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amarato,
<pb facs="tcp:42260:8"/>
some Love-sick person; such an one whom the blinde God hath more fiercely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then the twelve signs of the Anatomy. A dismal object he was; and so represented to my view, as if his misfortune had ruined him so at once, as that he could not be rendred more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; he lookt as if one of your Ladiships had whispered into his ear that doleful tune of <hi>Adieu,</hi> or at least that desperate sentence, Miscreant, thou shalt lie alone with thy bed unwarmed a score of frosty Winters. It cannot be amiss, by your Ladiships fair permissions, to draw the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from before this Love Martyrs picture, to describe him to you, <hi>vultu, gestu, &amp; oculis,</hi> just as I then found him suffering his ten Persecutions; his Hat in one place, with papers of Verses in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, were so fantastically dispersed on the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Grass, that if he pleased, with his Feet he might spurn the wantonness of his own Muse: for I perceived by the baldness of his crown with scratching, that he had lately been delivered of Acrosticks and Encomiums; in praise of some of your Beauties. After the writing of which, for fear of a non acceptance, he was most pestilently dogged, and as I then found him, in such a sullen station, yet were not his eyes so set in the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his head, but that I discerned from them such diliberate and heavy motions, as caused me, had I not been convinced by the former symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of his disease, to have suspected, whether otherwise, according to his education, he were not some Clown, who having mistaken the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, wept for fair weather. Certain I am
<pb facs="tcp:42260:8"/>
that I saw a most pitiful object, one that I could not but conceive that his Mistress had frowned on, and he in requital thought for a foil, to shew her a worser face then her own. I protest to your Ladiships, after I had entertained my most serious thoughts of him, I could not but take him for such an unthrift, as had spent the best stock of wits in adoration of his Ladies Looking-glass; I approacht nearer to him; not Imagining but that he would at length have disimprisoned to his thoughts in some discourse; for indeed after a stricter surveigh of his presence, he seemed to me as if he indeavoured to hew and fashion out his conceptions to some purpose, though I am confident they proved as unprofitable to him, as an unfinisht piece of Artifice; what weight he poised in his Perricranium, I cannot well guess, but thus much I observed, that sometimes his head hung down to his breast, like the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster boys brother; till of a sudden he assumed more confirmed imaginations of his Mistresses kindness, which in an instant placed it again, and fixt it right, as it was before, on its own Pedestal; his face was scorcht with his Ladies eyes, as if he bin a three years voiage at the <hi>Indies,</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded his very Soul was tanned, for beauty hath the same influence with the sun, it blacks within, as his brighter beams do burn without. Bless me from <hi>Cupid,</hi> O Mistress! thought I, give me a friend and good wine. But to proceed in my description, I vow to your Ladiships, he hath so strictly manacled himself, that his arms seemed pinnioned, like rabits feet to a spit, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:42260:9"/>
like the strings of a book; in such a posture he showed, as if he had been all contemplation, no action; like a woful Jesuit, that had forsaken the world, so as never to rise from before his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix; one might have taken him for a statue, had not his sighs breathed from his heaved-up heart, a kind of a living death, which together with sudden startings caused a paleness sometimes to overcome the otherwise more dusky colour of his face, even so as that same time, to discover that in <hi>diebus illis,</hi> his cheeks had entertained some tell-tale blushes, and dimpled smiles. His afflictions were so merciful to him, that to my better apprehension his very tears were of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign use, which as they then gusht forth, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to quench those flames his Mistresses eyes had kindled, which otherwise would have scorcht him to ashes, and to this purpose I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive they did distil all the seasons of the year. I could not but laugh at the cloaths he wore, which were so far from <hi>A-la-mode,</hi> that I rather conceive he had mistaken one piece for another; as if he had put on his breeches for his doublet, the buttons wherof, were most of them off, for at every sigh that came from him, like Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, half a dozen of them dropt at a time. At this strange disguise of his habit, together with the further waggery of the blinde God, I could not but cry out, Fie, when I saw how his garters were tied in the wrong place, about his neck, as if he had received his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and should want no accommodation for his journey to the Elizian fields, whither certainly his stragling thoughts had
<pb facs="tcp:42260:9"/>
already transported him; for he appeared to me, as if he dreamt waking of some business that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned another world. Alas cruel Fair Ones, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of your pitty, without my more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune address, he had been for too much loving, your most unhappy Victim. When I first begun to break the silence of that place, where all things were as still as night, he heard me with his eyes, his ears followed his minde, which I perceived was not then at leasure, as he was at that time all things but himself; but having now at length recollected so much strength as to breath a few horse sighs, for as then he wanted other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to speak his misfortunes, so desperately had this idolatrous Lover faln sick of his Goddess. At length after he had bestowed on me an angry nod, for the strangeness of my intrusion on the privacy of his thoughts, he started forth into an unusual kinde of furious madness, unclasping his arms, which before I suppose could never have been untwined, he fell to beating and thumping of his breast. I could not chuse at that time, but be merrily conceited, that this incensed rage of his, might arise from some displeasure he took, that his Invention could not presently teem with some Anagram, as fruitful as his Mistresses name. To be breif, I was amaz'd to think into how many strange shapes this Passion of Love transforms us, what Owls and Monkies it makes of us; in truth, the variety of antick tricks he played, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the vain apparitions, that questionless at that time peopled his brain, rendred him to my thinking, the most unfit person that ever I
<pb facs="tcp:42260:10"/>
saw for any humane converse: I assure you, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, so monstrous and fatal to the most eminent Heroes of the world in all Ages, have the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your implacable Sex proved. Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Ladiships any longer with the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of this distracted Lovers Herculian passions, by degrrees after he had a while held his hands, with a little chasing of his temples, stopping of his ears, tweaking of his nose, he came again to himself, and then crossing his breast, after a few lamentable Ay mee's he removed from the tree, into which, till then, I thought he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted. It was now night, whereof he was so sensible, as also of his late indisposition, that he requested my company with him out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. As we walkt, I discoursed the strangeness of his distemper, for I durst not acknowledge his Love to be a disease, least I should have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned his prejudice, so far, as for him to have esteemed it to have been incurable. We agreed to go to the Tavern, where, after we had lustily quaft the Blood of the Grape, I presented him with this Book of the <hi>Mysteries of Love,</hi> which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with clapping of warm trenchers to his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so perfecty and speedily recovered him, that within a few dayes after I met him in <hi>Bloomes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> with fresh Roses in his Cheeks, he lookt as if his Soul were returned to its right home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>probatum est.</hi> Thus have I given your fair Ladiships a large, but no Empirical, relation of the cure of this mad Lover, without either casting of his Urine, or any other Charms on his Mistress, except they are such as are contained
<pb facs="tcp:42260:10"/>
in this Book, the Witchcrafts of Eloquence, and the right Arts of Wooing; which as I hear, have since taken her Fort in, and that they are now happily married, I wish them all joy; only I thought fit in this my Epistle, to give your coy Ladiships notice, what vertue this Volume hath, to triumph over your most Beautiful Disdains; to turn your Frowns into Smiles; your Angers into Kisses; to repreive those whom you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined for most bloody Sacrafices; to metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phose your Champion <hi>Cupid</hi> from a Boy to a Man, to give him his eyes again, peruse this Book, bright Ladies, and commend it to any of your modest Sex, that are troubled with the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickness of Love, they cannot fail of a Remedy, 'tis <hi>Diana</hi>'s own Receipt Book. To conclude; I do not desire that either of the Sexes should take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyrannous advantages over one anothers Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, neither would I bar them of their Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; but that after the Youths have plaid a while at Bo-peep, lookt Babies in one anothers eyes, <hi>Hymen</hi> in his saffron robe, hath his torch light, may conduct them to their Marriage Beds: which is the hearty wish, and hath been the aim of these endeavours of your Ladiships</p>

            <head>A short Advertisement to the Reader, by way of introduction, for his better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Mysteries of Eloquence and Complementing.</head>
            <p>HAving already in my Epistle to the Coy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams treated or rather traversed, the passion of Love with a serious and light fancie, like <hi>Gallen</hi> and <hi>Donquixot,</hi> mixt together, to please as well the Stoical Student, as the most airy and fantastical Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant: I have since thought it no less my duty to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of these two other mysteries, of Eloquence and Complementing. This task I might have evaded, since none of the former scriblers of Books, in this kind, ever particularly undertook these Subjects, which I must either impute to their simplicity or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness. Courteous Reader, Eloquence is so absolutely necessary, and pertinent to humane converse, that it cannot but be confessed by all intelligent persons that in the management and conveyance even of reason it self, it would be most expedient, that there should be so many Artifices and Masteries together, with most subtil Conducts; for without them a man cannot so well attain his ends. Hence it is that the Learned compare Eloquence to the Chymists Elixar; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all qualities in it, yet it should not have one perceiveable: it is not to be denied, but that this age is that which expects that men should learn the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick from their own Genius; or as some Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists writes of the Spider, that she weaves her web out of her own bowels, or like our Enthusiasts, that
<pb facs="tcp:42260:11"/>
pretend to inspirations. It were to be wisht Eloquence could be so attained, rather then that the Schools should so manacle and fetter it with their old Maxims; but if these so pregnant persons in their own imaginations did but rightly consider what Eloquence is in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition; <hi>How that it is a way of speech prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over those we have designed to prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> and that it is so Etherial, or rather I cannot tell, how Divine, that it depends not alone on the single Embroidry of words, but there must be somewhat more in it; an excellent knowledge of men, deep and studied acquaintances with their passions: a man must not onely know very perfectly the agitations of his own mind, but be seen and conversant in those of others; otherwise it wants that which animates and breaths a fire, which makes it both warm and shine. We say of Logick that it files and keels the reason of a man, which otherwise had been blunt in the wedge and tongue, which is the only distinction of a man from a bruit beast. The same may be said of a person without behaviour and good language, that he is but a meer motion, a most sad spectacle. Indeed this is our misery, that though Eloquence be so absolutely necessary, yet it is such a thing of it self, that though we make use of our quickest conceits, we can rather wish for it then describe it in its perfect Idea; the Crises of it having been so altered from time to time in all Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and publique Harrangues, in so much, that it cannot be amiss to consider how the ancient Orators that lead the people whither they pleased, were put to it, being sorced to wrestle with the disadvantages of single nature, so as at the last to divide and throw it into several Subjects, by which they reigned over
<pb facs="tcp:42260:12"/>
the mindes of men, and did many strange things, the end of Oratory being to perswade.</p>
            <p>Thus having discoursed of Eloquence, I am now to descend to entertain some thoughts of her fair subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient Hand-maid, Complement. Civility is the most refined Complement; for as Complements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do but serve to compleat the Gentry, so where they are thus tendred, they are always in Fashion; ever new, ever acceptable; and as they entertain a grace in the wearer, so they deserve an admiration from the beholder. And thus they have in all ages been received for no less formal, then real accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments; and are held as most absolute ornaments of Gentility. Complements were first intended to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betwixt the Civil and the Savage; Persons of Honour and Peasants, yea, to appropriate a title of Prehemincy to such, who exceed others in grounds of Precept of Morality; such as used not paintick Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, but express'd themselves compleat without singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that could love without flattery, discourse without affection, that freed Courtly Ceremonies from dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and made Vertue their Mistress; that knew what it was to protest in jeast, and entertain Suitors onely for their Pastime. All wise people are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinced, that Complements consist not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Cringes, Salutes, Superficial Discourses, foolish Repetitions or frivilous Extravagances; these are but the shadows, which they that use forget the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: wheras the attraction and desert of a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consists very much in the gracefulness of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, beautified and set forth with a modest and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive comeliness; nor do I question but these three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have many such noble and compleat Ladies that
<pb facs="tcp:42260:12"/>
prefer the inside before the outside, the kernel before the shell; that make honour the Load-stone, by which they daily draw near to perfection, their own proper Centre. Certain it is, that tho' our tongues, hands, and legs be the same, our Elocution, Action, Gesture, and Posture are not the same; though managed in the like manner by others, yet are they not alwayes directed to the same ends, as there are vast differences to be made betwixt Vertue and Vice. I cannot want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the fantastical Amorist is one of those pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies that hath them in a continual practise; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth will complement your very glove, worship and sweeten every seam of it with the perfume of his discourse; he will take it for an extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor but to be the porter of a Ladies Fan, whilst she pins on her Mask: these kind of complementings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong great persons are like chantings among Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars; only in use with the Mimicks and Buffons of our times, whose behaviours deserve more derision then applause. I will not here squirt any more ink at them, Courteous Reader, in my Preface to the youthful Gentry you shall find something to this purpose inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which I accounted too improper for this place. To draw to a Conclusion, the Court, and such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent places as <hi>Hide Park,</hi> the <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> and the <hi>New Exchange,</hi> and set Meetings at Balls, are esteemed the fittest Schools of Ceremony and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement; where the most select, as also the newest Fashions are alwayes in request; where if discretion be not wanting in the Courtier, he will not fail to confirm himself to the mode and condition of the place that he is to exercise his Genius in. For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements do not suit with all places, nor with all sorts
<pb facs="tcp:42260:13"/>
of men; it ill beseems a Mechanick to play the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; that urbanity which becomes a Citizen, would relish of too much curiosity in a Countrey-man; and that Complement which gives proper grace to a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, would cause derision if presented by a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or a Factor. The Statesman requires a graceful and grave posture, whereas in ordinary affairs of Traffique, it were indiscretion to represent any such state. Thus I might instance from the Madam to the Chamber-maid, but that I am resolved to trouble the Reader with no further Preadmonitions, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ensuing Work will fully inform him in whatsoever other concernments have been wanting in this Advertisement. Farewell.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Your most humble servant, Sir, I'le assure you, had you not come as you did, you might perchance have found me there before you, for my Cousin here and I were taking up a resolution to be jogging that way.</p>
               <p>I'le assure you, Madam, your journey will not want its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, beside that of the season, if the Town news hold true.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42260:14"/>
I see you came, Sir, with a resolution not to be deny'd, having brought an argument so perswasive to Women, as that of Novelty; but pray what is it?</p>
               <p>Madam, they say, Sir <hi>Charles</hi>—hath put off his mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-weeds, and appears this day in the Park with a new Coach and Livery: they report he looks with an amorous Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon the young Lady—to whom he intends, as they say, to give a Treatment at the <hi>Spring Garden;</hi> so that if Businesses be well manag'd on her side, it may chance to be a match. But, pray give me leave, I heard lately that the old Countess—is dead.</p>
               <p>Very true, Madam, I was this morning at a Drapers shop in <hi>Pauls Church-yard,</hi> and there came in her Steward to provide Four hundred pounds worth of Mourning.</p>
               <p>Do's it not bring a very great addition to my Lords Estate?</p>
               <p>Doubtless Madam, a very considerable one; for she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a near and parcimonious Woman, and indeed was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable for nothing else, but the affection she bare him. I could tell you more, Madam, but I defer the rest for discourse in the Coach.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>In the Ring.</head>
                  <p>Coachman, keep the out-side of the Ring, I think, Madam, that way will not be so dusty. This is the voice of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that would shew a more then ordinary care of his Mistress.</p>
                  <p>Much discourse cannot be expected from that restless mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wheels and Horses, it being only a preparative for treatment talk; neither indeed in that place of Observation, is more required, then only as occasion serves, to tell your Lady, <hi>That is my Lord such a ones Coach; That's my Lady such a one; That's Squire such a one.</hi> And then when opportunity offers it self, to say, <hi>Your humble Servant; my Lord; Your most humble Servant, Madam.</hi> For though it be not so great a sin, yet it is as great a Solecism, as to talk at Church; and they shall be counted as shallow persons, that can give no account of what they have seen here, as those that can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing that they have heard spoken to a Text. This is not without reason, for it being an impossibility for Ladies to travel, it was thought fit that there should be a publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42260:14"/>
of all sorts of Societies and Habits, both Forreign and Domestique, that so those young and tender Gallants might be spar'd the labour of going beyond Sea.</p>
                  <p>In the spaces among the Coaches there walk up and down Objects of Charity, and Enticements to Liberality.</p>
                  <p>Beggars, and Fruiterers, who are bold Wenches, and by their own, well knowing the disposition of other Women, with their Eyes fix'd upon the Ladies, and their Ware held up to the Gentlemen, they cry so as they may easily be heard,
<q>
                        <l>My Lord, Will your Honour have any Civil Oranges!</l>
                        <l>Madam, Will your Honour buy a Basket of Cherries!</l>
                     </q>
The Gentleman finds himself surpriz'd, but knows not which to give, Oranges or Cherries; yet at length remembring Oranges. how great whetters of the stomach they are, and deeply considering the price of Cheesecakes, he resolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cherries.</p>
                  <p>Then quoth he, <hi>How do you sell your Cherries, good Woman? A Crown a Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Madam, I do here present you with these First-fruits of the Year, which would have been due from <hi>Pomona</hi> her self, had she not forgot the duty that she owes your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>The Lady makes a short reply, well knowing the end of his kindness, which was to stop her mouth.</p>
                  <p>Whether Cherries are diuretick or no, I will not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute; however, the Coachman presently after hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him to wheel off, and the Lady finds in her self a disposition to walk on foot toward the Brakes: yet she is not so much tormented, but that she can talk; which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly much to this effect:</p>
                  <p>Really, Sir, I have not seen so great an appearance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Park all this Spring before.</p>
                  <p>Madam, it was the lustre of your person drew'em hither, and doubtless having now seen you, they will have no cause to repent their coming.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you have a strong faith to speak so highly of one whom you have known no otherwise then in the formalities of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42260:15"/>
I wish I that know my self better, knew my self so well as to confirm your Encomiums.</p>
                  <p>Madam, that lies not on your part to do, for wherefore hath Nature granted Man to excell in the invention of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but that she would not so far deprave the dignity of the Female, which is her own Sex, as to make them the vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious praisers of themselves; and it is retaliation sufficient in you, to favour us with the acceptance of our Labours. I confess I am fallen upon a subject that I could dwell upon; I could make a particular harange in the praise of every part that builds up the noble Frame of your Body, but I am put to silence by that little Bird which warbles tydings of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to your ears. Do you not hear the Nightingale Madam?</p>
                  <p>I do, Sir. And indeed it is the first time I have heard her this Spring. They say it is lucky to unmarried people to hear her before the Cuckow.</p>
                  <p>Doubtless then, Madam, the end that brought her hither, was to bring you that good fortune.</p>
                  <p>Sir, It cannot be but that you must have a greater share in her happy Auguries, who better deserve them.</p>
                  <p>I should then, Madam, deserve your self, which is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest Augury I can expect. Pardon me, Madam; if you have open'd my mouth to utter so great crime; for indeed I could say, I love you, but that I fear lest you should frown me into despair for such a high presumption.</p>
                  <p>Believe it, Sir, my ambition never aspir'd to such thoughts, as you would fain put into me; but if you have idly scatter'd a little respect upon a person no way meriting, doubtless a few dayes and another Object will soon randezvouze your Passions another way.</p>
                  <p>Madam, could any protestation avail to fix my Constancy in your belief, you should soon command me to seal my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate Vows upon the Ground on which you tread; yet since that cannot be, I onely beg this on my knees, That you will still count me your Servant, whom it shall suffice to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with that Liberty which you have hitherto given, till time shall discover my immutable Affection, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firable Testimonies of my Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman resolves now to strike while the Iron is hot, and to win her with kindness; for which end he carries her to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42260:15"/>
the Lodge, and throws away forty or fifty shillings to please her appetite; and to shew her that he was not so much cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of his Money, as of her Good Will: He breaks up Cheesecakes, cuts up Tarts, and calls in for Wine and Sugar, as if his Mistress had a Legion in her belly; though his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance is such that he eats nothing himself, for fear she should have a desire to any particular plum in his morsel, In drinking, he sweetens her Affection with a great deal of Sugar with an humble obeysance, wishing it were Nectar for her sake. She cannot be so unmannerly as not to drink to him, there being no body else in the room, which he takes for a very great kindness, and wishes for the capacious throat of the great Gyant, that he might swill up a whole pipe for joy. The Wine inspires him, and produces many extravagant Vows, and sundry Comments on her Hands, Lips, Eyes, and Forehead; which beget an host of Comparisons, putting such a scorn and contempt upon the Sun and Moon, as if they were but meer Candles of Ten in the pound, subject to be capt by every common Extinguisher. At length, emboldned by a surreptitious vapor, upon the merits of his Oblation, he craves a kiss, which being granted, with a high satisfaction he calls to pay. This is the meek spirited Lover. But that bold Mamaluck Yelep'd, a Hector, courts his Lady more daringly.</p>
                  <p>Madam, cryes he, By Heaven I love you, and then he falls down with a submissive reverence, and kisses the hem of her Petticoat; then arising up again, he proceeds, Madam there is no person living bears you a greater respect then I, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more affection for you in his bosom then my self; make trial of it, Madam, and though you bid me die, I'le do it willingly.</p>
                  <p>He comes into the Park, like the son of Death, arm'd with the accouterments of Mortality, Sword and Pistol? he stands not much upon the nicety of Habit, so his Belt be not out of fashion. He is generally known in the Ring, and every one salutes him by the name of <hi>Tom</hi> or <hi>Jack</hi> such a one, whose kindness he requites with an Oath, and an Humble Servant: and so having done his Evening Exercise, he retires to the Lodge, where he spends his money with such a liberality, as if he bore malice to his fortunes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Question was put,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether <hi>Colatinus</hi> were not a cuckold for all that <hi>Lucretia</hi> stabb'd her self?</p>
                  <p>To which the Lady answered in the Affirmative.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was demanded,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether of the two wrought the most excusable Love-cure upon themselves, <hi>Hero</hi> that drown'd her self, or <hi>Phillis</hi> that hang'd her self?</p>

                     <hi>It was answered,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phillis</hi> that hang'd her self; because it may be the nature of some women to love hanging so well, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hang by the neck then not hang at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was ask'd,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether it were more dangerous for Ladies to dance upon the Ropes, or to dance upon the Ground?</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To dance upon the Ground, because that sport hath been the occasion that several Ladies have caught many a shrewd fall.</p>

                  <p>What was the humor of those people that dyed for Love?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>

                  <p>Why women are said to be in subjection to men,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Answer was,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For they said,</hi> Beauty was like the rind, presently peel'd off; that a womans Wit was quickly crack'd; and that therefore Wealth, which was like the kernel, and brought substance along with it, was to be preferred as best of all.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Give me leave to tell ye, Ladies, that if your modesty will not let you aver so real a truth, yet the respect which I bear to Ladies, commands me not onely to acknowledge, but to be a witness thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> Sir, we beseech you not to take so difficult a task upon you, before question be made of what you affirm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is good to be modest, when we speak in our own commendations, or of the vices and imperfections of another; but when we speak in the praise of a friend, we ought not to conceal any thing of the truth.</p>

                     <hi>B.</hi> Sir, you place among your commendations, things that we are not guilty of, rather fancying and imagining such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and perfections which may become your eloquence to exalt, then believing any such in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Ladies, you would force me to an injurious respect; but it is as impossible for me, to forget your deserts, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my devotions towards you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> Sir, it is your aim to overcome us with the excess of your courtesie: yet believe it, Sir, that there is not any one of us, that does not think her self highly honour'd, if she may bear the title of your most humble servant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Ladies you would make me to dispair, in seeking to beat down that honour which is your due. However, I shall not cease to admire your perfections; being sorry that I have not merit enough to render my obedience worthy your acceptance.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Lady, here is a very fine appearance of fair and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons, and indeed I cannot but esteem my self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy in meeting with them, to participate of the content that now dwells here; but more particularly in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the happiness to see and know you, as being a person in whom all perfections imaginable are so illustrious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> Sir, the character which you have given of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is very fine; you could not wish for persons more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, nor find more honest content in any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. But your favour, Sir, is too excessive, to attribute such great praises to her that doth so little merit them, and which in comparison to others, hath no one vertue to render her considerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Madam, your modesty makes your speak to your own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, and it may be permitted to you; but if I should consent to what you say, it would be a great fault in me; or if I should dissemble a truth which is so apparent to the eyes of the whole world, I should render my self altogether unworthy to behold so fair an object, should I not know how to admire the wonders and graces of your beauty; the lustre whereof, your modest expressions are not able to reclipse. For my part, I cannot conceal how great a sway you bear over my affections,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42260:22"/>
so that there is nothing in my power, that I do not freely dedicate to your service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>B.</hi> Sir, the more high you are in your expressions, the more am I subject to abate of the praises which you so liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestow upon me; in regard Heaven hath not been so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of its graces towards me. And therefore not judging my self worthy the favours which you heap upon me, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat you, Sir, to change your discourse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Lady, though at present, you refuse me the honour of serving you, yet I shall not cease to seek all occasions to make the truth and sincerity of my words apparent.</p>

                     <hi>B.</hi> Sir, all that a Daughter of Honour owes to a Person of Merit, you have already at your devotion; I respect your qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, admire your vertues, and wish you a happiness answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the nobleness of your designs.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Madam, I have not so far forgot my self, as to forget your merits and perfections. My resolution is unseigned, to serve you to the utmost of my power, and your refusal dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth nothing of my affection; only take it for granted, that I desire to be your servant.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I am not Mistriss of my self, and for that reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accept of your offer; but if you shall find, that the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you say you bear me, is well liked of by my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, I shall esteem my self, very much honoured in your love, and shall, as far as honour will permit me, do any thing to assure you of my good will.</p>

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You dissemble that which is well known to many, and which hath been told me some few days since.</p>
                  <p>Pray <hi>Sir,</hi> do the favour to tell me what it is, for I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think nor imagine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> They say that you intend to marry in this Town.</p>
                  <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'tis the first news that I have heard of any such thing.</p>
                  <p>I can assure you, <hi>Sir,</hi> those that told me, believe that they know very well; and they take upon them to report many particulars.</p>
                  <p>Pray <hi>Sir,</hi> be pleas'd to tell me, to whom, and what are the good Conditions of this Marriage; perchance the person and the advantages may be such, that I may speedily advise with my self; and as speedily resolve.</p>
                  <p>Why should you do so, <hi>Sir?</hi> Would you marry out of your Countrey, far from your friends, and distant from all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences; obliging your self to quit the sweet presence of your kindred, or else to bring a strange Woman among them, which of what House or Quality soever she be, either will her self be despis'd, or bring envy upon you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You have not answer'd my question, but instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of have made a kind of sophistical digression.</p>
                  <p>I shall therefore come now more close to the matter; the young Lady is the daughter of <hi>M. N.</hi> to whom her Mother left a very fair Estate, besides a very fair Portion which her father intends to bestow upon her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You have told me so much that you make my mouth water; I know her Father well, he is a Gentleman of worth and honour; the young Lady is Fair, Wise, and Rich, which are three good qualities: And truly I do not so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like her, but that if I thought I had so much interest in her Affections, as that I should be master of them for asking, I would run the hazard of sending one packet.</p>
                  <p>Surely, <hi>Sir,</hi> you must know something, I am told that you do not speak the truth, dissemble the matter as well as you ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Believe it, <hi>Sir,</hi> nothing to any such purpose has been so much as mention'd by me. Those that report this, are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42260:25"/>
persons that take all occasions to babble, and urge the least appearances of a thing for certainties: and certainly this rumour comes from my frequenting often the places thereabouts, or because that now and then I go to see her Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> That may be very likely; but 'tis very incredible but that there must be something in it: you know there is no smoak but there is some fire.</p>
                  <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I do not wonder at all at it; for we must give the world leave to talk.</p>
                  <p>But do you believe you should do well to engage your self in a business of such importance, on which, not only your fortune, but the content of your Parents depends.</p>
                  <p>Be confident, <hi>Sir,</hi> that I was never counted a rash person, yet I have such an assurance in the paternal care and wisdom of my friends, that if any advantage did present it self in my behalf, they would not stick to quit some part of their content for my good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> You have fully satisfi'd me, and if there be any thing begun already, I wish you all happiness and content.</p>

                  <p>Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I think that fame is more favourable to me then truth, seeing that all that which is publish'd concerning me proves so false; and therefore you have reason to present me your feigned service, in obedience to my feigned merits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> You wrong your Beauty, which being so great, can work no other designs in men, but those of truly honoring you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> This confirms my former opinion, for seeing my self without Beauty, of which you cannot be ignorant, I must necessarily be unprovided of all those Services that depend thereon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I fear I should sin against the truth, should I put my self to the trouble to make you see them; it is a thing so visible of it self, that by endeavouring to demonstrate it by words, I should presume to assist your judgment.</p>

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I find that you are easily able to overcome my Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, but not my Belief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I am confident to gain this advantage by showing the proofs of my Obedience, that men will condemn your misbelief, to authorize my true sayings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> Such kind of words as these, are usual in this age, which promise alwayes a great deal of Sérvice, but performs little but outward Complement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> 'tis very ordinary to swear the same words, but a thing very extraordinary to make them afterwards appear to be truth: But that which may assure you that I do not walk the common path, is, That I know your Beauty to be such, as is onely to be serv'd by knowledge, not by imtation; which makes my Design glorious, and my Enterprize noble, that waits on such an Object.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I know not how you can call this an Enterprize, since your Design is more easie then courageous; and a noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize hath always difficulties that opose it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> My resolution to serve you is so magnanimous, that there can no ill fortune attend upon it; for if you do make the end happy, it will be always an honour to my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to have, and to pretend to your accomplish'd Graces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> Since you do establish your content upon unhappiness, your hopes, cannot deceive you much; for if it do deceive you, it will be in making you happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I can easily count it an honour to serve you, as being oblig'd by your merit, and my obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I shall never counsel a generous soul to stop at such Designs, since his resolution is so low, that infallibly both the Design must fail, and Repentance ensue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> That which animates me more to do you service, is this, That I shall receive this honour from the Enteprize, that there is no small difficulty in performing it, with that perfection, as it requires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> If you do give such proofs, as you offer, of service, you shall be acknowledg'd through the whole Empire of Love.</p>
                  <p>

                  <head>The Departure.</head>
                  <p>Adieu dear Beauty; it behooves me to be banish'd from you, that I may dispose my Soul to esteem you the more; one way, by the loss of your presence, another way, by recollecting the thoughts of past happiness.</p>
                  <p>Truly <hi>Sir,</hi> you have very great reason to make use of your Fancy, when you would praise me; for Fancy and Thoughts will forge imagenary Merits, where your Eyes and Judgement will finde the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> You do very well make use of a new custom, I believe you would perswade your self to speak false, that you might have an advantage over one, that breath nothing but the truth; is it possible that such a vanity should make you offend that which I honour, and that which you possess. Truly <hi>Madam,</hi> you will gain nothing by it, but the pleasure of fine words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> Call them rather true, and then you will speak truth your self.</p>
                  <p>You continue, <hi>Madam,</hi> acquiring new glories to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, by maintaining Paradoxes against your Beauty, which will be alwayes perfect in it self, though not in your opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> If I am perfect, I do know my self; perfection being the knowledge of ones self: since therefore I do know my self, I may be permitted to stile my self very poor in Merits. But you would perswade the contrary, to exercise your parts, knowing that it is a greater honour to vanquish the Truth, then to sustain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> The design which I have to serve you, may give you testimony sufficient of that power which you have to dispose of me; In one moment I saw you enjoying a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand wonders, and in a moment I was sensible of a thousand torments of Love; and being capable of nothing but Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, methought that this Beauty was in the world for no other end, but deserve, and for me to be obedient to. I see no reason, Fairest, that the belief which I have taken with the clearest judgement that I have of your Beauty, should be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up by your misbelieving opinions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> They say, that contrariety doth animate persons the

more; and therefore I shall be silent, that I may hinder these unjust Praises; perhaps you will have pitty on my seeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and will be weary of conquering so easily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> 'Tis rather my self that ought to keep silent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so lately in an astonishment; but as for you; <hi>Madam,</hi> it would be a sin against your fair lips, whose words are Oracles.</p>
                  <p>Then pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> why do you not believe that which I say, for all Oracles are truth?</p>
                  <p>But why will you, <hi>Madam,</hi> by perswasion hinder the belief which I have taken with sight and judgment. For I will believe your Beauty against all your unbelief and undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and also continue the Service which I have sworn you, against any thing that shall hinder it. My Attempt also hath promis'd my Design, that future Ages shall admire your Merit and my Servitude; and record us as the most faithful Lovers in <hi>Cupid's</hi> Dominions.</p>
                  <p>I fear, <hi>Sir,</hi> that time will alter this opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> Time can do nothing against that which Love hath ordain'd; he is the master of Fortune, and an enemy to change. But wherefore this superfluity of speech? It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believe by the force of Words, then by the force of Perswasion; and therefore at this time, it is more necessary for me, to demand of you Remedies for this remove, the apprehension whereof makes me endure this present pain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> It behooves you to forget your Design, and you will avoid the Pain that will follow, and also the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>No, <hi>Madam,</hi> I will keep the memory of my Design eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and shall always see painted before me the glory of my Enterprize. Adieu great Beauty, you shall never cast your eyes downward, but you shall perceive, lying at your feet, him that admires you; nor ever elevate your Thoughts to your deserts, but you shall remember your conquest. Adieu Fairest, for now I leave the Sun, and go to seek out Night and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows cell.</p>

                  <p>I come, <hi>Madam,</hi> to receive as much content from your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42260:27"/>
chearful Countenance, as the loss of it hath yielded me sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. I know the Good will now be as great as the Evil, since they proceed both from the same cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I do believe that you do receive the one, as well as you have suffer'd the other: but I beseech you, <hi>Sir,</hi> to tell me from whence that pain proceeds, which you say you do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; for as to my self, I do believe, that the pleasure of Thinking, is greater then that of Seeing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> It is permitted me to think, but experiment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me believe that opinion; for I receive from my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations only a good imagination; on the contrary the sight cannot err.</p>
                  <p>But it is said, <hi>Sir,</hi> that the presence only contents the Eyes, which are Mortal; but that absence exercises the Soul, which is Divine; and therefore if that did any way afflict you, you might easily avoid it.</p>
                  <p>It was some good Genius, <hi>Madam,</hi> that took me yesterday from your eyes, that I might the better value the happiness of their lustre, and avoid the extremity of that pain which the loss of them made me endure; causing in me such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to return to you, that every hour I staid from you seem'd an age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> That which is foreseen is easily avoided. Now you perceive whence the evil that you speak of proceeds, yet the little occasion that you had to fear it, makes you find it out willingly; therefore blame your own desires, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd you this evil, and do not complain on Destiny, which is always just.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> My Will is not the cause; for then I should fly my self, and come back to you: but Love, to abuse me the more, gave me the Desire, and hinder'd the Effect. Though I believe it to be one of his Destinies, for it behooves a true passion to overcome the violence of all opposition by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent constancy.</p>

                  <p>Fairest, It is now time that I should require from you some Assurances of your friendship, because I cannot grant you that authority which you have over my Affections, but by the service which I am willing to render to your power:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42260:28"/>
The proof whereof depends upon opportunity, and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity occasion upon your commands: swear to me therefore, by your fair Eyes, that you love that which they have subdu'd, that I may boast my ruine to be a mark as well of my glory, as of your puissance.</p>

                  <p>Dear <hi>Lady,</hi> why should you not affect that love which you your self have created? Would you cause it to be born and dye at the same instant? that would be the action of an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant soul.</p>
                  <p>It is you, <hi>Sir,</hi> that run the hazard of being call'd by that name; for if love proceed from merit, you will soon finde some one more worthy your Affection then my self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I shall never seck the means to find any more signal worth then that which you possess; it is permitted to those who are less worthy to have such jealousies, but not to you whose Beauty hath such a supereminence above all others in the world. No <hi>Madam,</hi> take counsel of your own worth, and it will shew the fair Election which I have made, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it is to be changed; the design coming from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Soul, which being Divine, cannot erre.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> they say that love is very subject to knowledge, of which you being so well provided, 'tis to be fear'd, that you may make use of those agreeable diversities, that Love doth every day present to unfaithful Lovers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> May he banish me from his Empire, if I have any other Will, then what is agreeable to his. He sees that I am yours, so his Power and my Will are agreed; my Designs concur with his Commands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I believe that Love himself could not know how to force you to love.</p>
                  <p>He fear'd, <hi>Madam,</hi> lest he should be made himself a slave; He hath no force able to resist your puissance, unless it be your own: therefore since you have this Glory entire to your self, to have vanquish'd all the world, there remains nothing now, but that you should vanquish your self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir,</hi> I cannot do any thing else but vanquish, having neither Will nor Thought, which doth not render obedience to that duty, which I have taken to be the perfect guide of my life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> You oppose your Designs to my Prayers, to the

                  <p>If it be your Difficulties, <hi>Sir,</hi> that can create your Glory, why do you complain?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I do not repine at the pain, but at your unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that will not acknowledge it; but if that be not so, I do conjure your fair Lips to produce some assurance of your friendship.</p>
                  <p>Will <hi>Sir,</hi> then I do promise your servitude, to acknowledge it for the price of your constancy; and believe this, that as my true passion doth onely oblige me, so there is no adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall have power over me.</p>

                     <hi>Madam,</hi> I wish that I could transform my whole will into words, to render you sufficient thanks for this favourable promise; but since I am not born capable of such a happiness, I will only say this, That he to whom your Favours are so liberally extended, shall pass the rest of his days in your Service.</p>

Not me, <hi>Sir,</hi> I never could in the least pretend to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that is a happiness which, I swear to you, my Desire doth rather enjoy then my Hope; and there is reason for it, seeing you the possessor of so many rich Qualities.</p>
                  <p>I see, <hi>Madam,</hi> that I shall possess nothing hereafter, since I must take all from my self to bestow it upon her, for whom I could willingly suffer my self to be robb'd of all.</p>

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> When I shall enjoy that happiness, the gift will be much greater then all I can yet call my own.</p>
                  <p>Teach me, <hi>Madam,</hi> how I may swear, and you shall see what use I will make of it, to assure you, that I am wholly yours; and that that which Love gives you now, can never be taken from you but by death.</p>
                  <p>Sir, Be confident that I shall diligently seek all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to deserve you; and receive these words for the most infallible, that ever Faith it self swore.</p>

                     <hi>Lady of my constant affections,</hi> impose what conditions you please, the strictest of them will not be too heavy for him that desires to bear the burthen of your love.</p>

Truly <hi>Bess,</hi> you are in the right on't, for the nails of your allurements have scratch'd my mind, the pins of your features have prick'd me; and the foot of your disdain hath trod upon the toes of my perseverance; and besides all this, you have struck me to the heart.</p>

He must then furnish himself with all the Books of Complementing, and be sure to get enough to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to shew his wit the first night before the Waiting Gentlewoman at the Stewards Table. His motion must be with such a Clock-work formality, as if he were only made to strike the Quarter-Bell upon Bow-Steeple.

                  <p>The Cure of this, is by way of humble Petition to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, to afford him her Combings, and some few spare Locks, to hide the nakedness which she laid bare.</p>
                  <p>The other is the dwindling away of the calves of his legs; This happens from his being overtoyl'd; for being to divide himself between the Lady and her Woman, they never leave sucking him, till they have made him so transparent that you may see his very thoughts. For the cure of this disease, he must go to the Hosier instead of the Apothecary. If the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman will take the pains to nurse him, his body may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps return again to his soul, otherwise he dies like a Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, having spun out himself to pleasure others.</p>

                  <l>And jealous of her coming, brake the mould.</l>
                  <l>In his proportion, done the best she could,</l>

                  <l>I thought at first, It never would burst,</l>

                  <l>But by the rouling and trowling about</l>
                  <l>How kindly and sweetly the Marrow flew out</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Of his Pudding.</hi>

                  <l>Well, since I ne'r, was fed with such geer,</l>
                  <l>Untill my <hi>John</hi> did prove so kind,</l>
                  <l>I made a request to prepare again</l>
                  <l>That I might continue in Love with the strain</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>Could ever have been in its former plight,</l>
                  <l>He rumbl'd and jumbled me ore and ore</l>
                  <l>Till I found he had almost wasted the store</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Of his Pudding.</hi>

                  <l>Which by my Assistance was brought to pass.</l>
                  <l>But by his dulness and moving so slow</l>
                  <l>I quickly perceiv'd the stuffing grew low</l>

                  <l>Though he grew cold, my Stomach did hold</l>
                  <l>With vigor to relish the other bit,</l>
                  <l>But for all he could do, could not furnish agen,</l>
                  <l>For he swore he had left little more than the skin</l>

               <head>The FRYER and the MAID.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>ASI lay musing all alone</l>
                  <l>A merry Tale I thought upon;</l>
                  <l>Now listen a while and I will you tell</l>
                  <l>Of a Fryer that lov'd a Bonny Lass well.</l>
                  <l>He came to her when she was going to bed</l>
                  <l>Desiring to have her Maiden-head;</l>
                  <l>But she denyed his desire,</l>
                  <l>And said that she did fear Hell-fire.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Tush, tush, quoth the Fryer, thou need's not doubt.</l>
                  <l>If thou wer't in Hell, I could sing thee out:</l>
                  <l>Why then, quoth the Maid, thou shalt have thy request;</l>
                  <l>The Fryer was as glad as a Fox in his nest.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But one thing more I must request</l>
                  <l>More than to sing me out of Hell-fire,</l>
                  <l>That is for doing of the thing</l>
                  <l>An Angel of Mony you must me bring.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Tush, tush, quoth the Fryer, we two shall agree,</l>
                  <l>No Mony shall part thee and me;</l>
                  <l>Before thy company I will lack</l>
                  <l>Ile pawn the Gray-gown off my back.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The maid bethought her on a Wile</l>
                  <l>How she might this Fryer beguile;</l>
                  <l>When he was gone, the truth to tell,</l>
                  <l>She hung a Cloth before a Well:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Fryar came, as his bargain was,</l>
                  <l>With Mony unto his bonny Lass;</l>
                  <l>Good morrow, Fair Maid, good morrow, quoth she;</l>
                  <l>Here is the Mony I promis'd thee.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>She thank'd him, and she took the Mony;</l>
                  <l>Now let's go to't, my own sweet Honey:</l>

Nay, stay a while, some respite make,</l>
                  <l>If my Master should come, he would us take.</l>

                  <l>Alass! quoth the Fryer, where shall I run;</l>
                  <l>Behind you Cloth run thou quoth she,</l>
                  <l>For there my Master cannot see.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Behind the Cloth the Fryer went,</l>
                  <l>And was in the Well incontinent:</l>
                  <l>Alass: quoth he I'm in the Well;</l>
                  <l>No matter quoth she if thou wer't in hell.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thou said'st thou could'st sing me out of Hell,</l>
                  <l>I prithee sing thy self out of the Well;</l>
                  <l>Sing out, quoth she, with all thy might,</l>
                  <l>Or else thou'rt like to sing there all night.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Fryer sang out with a pitifull sound,</l>
                  <l>Oh! help me out or I shall be Drown'd:</l>
                  <l>She heard him make such a pitiful moan,</l>
                  <l>She hope him out, and bid him go home.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Quoth the Fryer I never was serv'd so before;</l>
                  <l>Away, quoth the Wench, come here no more:</l>

               <head type="sub">To a Duke.</head>
               <p>A Duke first was made by the French Kings, when they had chased the Romans out of <hi>Gallia;</hi> bestowing the name of <hi>Dux,</hi> a little altered to the French Idiom, upon those to whom they gave the Principal Government over those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which they had recovered: in process of time theyusurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Inheritance of their Governments; and made their Fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feswhich before were revocable at the Princes pleasure, to be hereditary. So that at length their Titles came to be so much esteemed as to be thought the next in order to that of a King.</p>
               <p>The Title which is most usually applied to a Duke, is that of <hi>Grace;</hi> and we address ourselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ohim by word of mouth, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it please your Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he be the Kings Son, or of the Royal blood, we write to him thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the most Illustrious Prince Henry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the most excellent Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or else,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the most High and Noble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EArls at the same time, and upon the same account, were created by the French King, only here seem'd the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be between them; for the Dukes seemed to have the Military Power, and the Earls were only made to exercise the Civil Jurisdiction in the Towns where they were plac'd.

They are now the next in order to Marquess; by word of mouth we make our Addresses thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it please your Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And write to him thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Right Honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Marquess formerly was the Governor of a Fronteer Town, and inferiour to the Earl of a Province; but supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Earl of an Inland Town. In speaking we thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress our selves to them,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it please your Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We write to them thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Right Honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Viscount was formerly the Lievtenant to an Earl, so that their Dignity hath continued next to that of an Earl ever since; and indeed between a Viscount and a Baron or Lord, there is no difference used in making addresses to them. We speak to them thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it please your Honour my Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We write thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Knight is the next Degree of honour being more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Military Dignity; but of late very much confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. They bear the Title of Right Worshipful. We make our dress thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May it please your Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We write thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Right Worshipful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ESquire was formerly but he that bore the Shield and Lance of a Knight before him. It is now the next Degree of Honour to the Knight; and now so much used by Gentlemen, that he who stiles not himself Esquire, is hardly a Gentleman. He bears the Title of Worshipful. And we write to him thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Worshipful</hi> J. D. <hi>Esquire.</hi>

                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42260:76"/>
Note here, that the same Titles are appliable to the Wives as to the Husbands; and though the Daughter of an Earl marry an inferior person, yet she doth not lose her Title, which is, <hi>Right Honorable.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>My resolution is to possess my self always, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Could my endeavours take effect, or my vows accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you should not long reckon me in the number of your unprofitable servants, for I am most assuredly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Sir, I know your high merits, and the nobleness of your condition hath much encreased the number of your servants; yet I will say this, that though you joyn them altogether, yet they are not so much as I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>You may easily know, without being a Prophet, the dear esteem I have for you, and may believe without any further assurance, that I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For though you may have a more powerful, yet you never can have a more constant and faithful servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Only be confident of this, that I am more than any man in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I shall never be capable of apprehending any thing else, but how to testifie my devotion to be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>LAdy,</hi> I am now at last in part perswaded, that I have now two the best fortunes that the earth can afford me; the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of our virtue, and of your favour. You may say, this language is very fair, and that my friendship speaks like love. I have no other answer to return you, but that as you gain hearts, you have found a way to enter into them, and see what affections they produce. Let me therefore intreat you to behold the violence of devotion; and since I do entitle you my Goddess, be pleas'd to express your self by the effect of so fair a name, in accepting the heart more than the hand, and prizing the character of my sincerity above the value of my oblation. Certainly I should be the most unfortunate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the living, should you be a severe censurer of my works or words; in both which there is neither power nor elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:

                     <hi>LAdy,</hi> The continuance of your melancholy having toucht me so far, as to make me partake of your grief, wonder not if you receive these undeserved lines from me, which I hope will wipe away your tears, if you consider him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats you to be pitiful to himself; if not, to his youth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, Dearest, my sorrows for your self carry more reason with them, then yours for your deceased Brother, which can have no other pretence than custom, and your good nature. Pardon me if I tell you freely, that if you do not decline your grief, I shall abate of the belief I had of your spirit. I know well that the loss of Friends must needs touch us, nor would I remove the sense of mourning, but the error; not the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of tears, but the superfluity of them.

the sad remembrance of him, a much longer time than any of his Friends: not that his merit doth oblige you, for I well know that all merit loses its esteem in your presence, being so perfect as you are; nor your Piety, though it be a thing natural to you with your other vertues; but only his love, and constancy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both equally incomparable. Neither do I believe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these do oblige you at all, for though his love were very great, that could not be otherwise, seeing you were his object, no more than his constancy whatever it were; so that to say the truth, I know not what can urge you to bewail his loss, unless it be the goodness of your inclinations, being as mild and sweet as you are, fair, and consequently full of Piety. I should weep my self, for having the least thought to condemn your tears, yet give me leave to believe, that when you remember that the fires pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from your eyes did help to consume his life, it would make them weep for sorrow. Now what punishment will you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon your Beauty, if there be nothing in you that hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken of the millions of pains which he hath endured for your sake: Certainly you ought to suffer Shipwrack in the Sea of your tears, unless the God of Love have need of you for one of his Altars.

I have but one grief, that I have not Soul enough to judge of those perfections that dwell in you, which though I can never attain rightly to conceive, yet I am confident, no man can honour them more, so that should you call me your Idolater, you could not strain a word that could so rightly, as that, express my respects toward you.</hi> Sir, <hi>Complements are very rare with me, and therefore I request you to believe me, when I say, that they must be very strong cords and dangerous commandments that shall remove me from your service; I know I can never deserve such violent proofs of my obedience: it shall suffice me that I doubt not of your love, as being,</hi>

You know how much I am interested in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. In a word, I assure you, that if you do not quit your bed, I shall be forc'd to betake my self to mine. These are the absolute protests of,</p>

                     <l>Whose fires in funeral flames can onely die.</l>
                     <l>May I not live, if all things plead not sin;</l>
                     <l>I wonder what strange sear doth keep thee in.</l>

                     <l>Soft breathings best please love, not the sierce Drum;</l>
                     <l>If that thou wilt I can more gentle be,</l>

                     <l>I must resemble some one Deity.</l>

                     <l>That am confirm'd how men can swear and lie?</l>

In the first place, I counsel thee O man or woman, who ere thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if a young man or a young woman hath by chance got a Clap, and is willing to give all he hath, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to endure the disease long, wilt thou be so base and sordid, to make his or her earnest desire to be the cause of thy exaction. Assure thy self that money got by such exaction, will be a worm to consume that part of thy Estate which thou hast honestly got. In the next place, be not too inquisitive of any Patient who he is, and where he dwells; for if he have not a mind to tell thee, what hast thou to do to enquire any thing concerning him? Thirdly, judge not rashly of him, as who should say, you have been lying with a Wench; for you cannot but know that there are many ways of getting Claps beside that one; as by drinking with the party, lying in a hot bed with him, sitting upon a close-stool after him; as also by lifting, riding, or any other manner of straining. Then let every Patient receive his cure with all privacy. And lastly, do not flatter me daily with any patient whatsoever. This is the part which ye have to act upon the Theatre of this world, which, if thou dost not justly perform, consider, I say, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you must make your exits into Stoves and Sweating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubs, much hotter then those with which you ever afflicted your patients withall, being on earth. Heaven direct your course, that you may be neither Cheaters, Imposters, nor Cozeners, as most are who profess the cure of Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers; but that ye may be in this, as well as in all your other actions, faithful and honest; which is the daily wish of</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The subject is that to which any thing is adjoyned.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The minde is the Subject of science, ignorance, vertue, vice, because these happen beside the being. The body, of health, sickness, strength, weakness, beauty, deformity. Man is the Subject of riches, poverty, honour, infamy, apparell, company. The place is the Subject of the thing placed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. How prove you this last by testimony and example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Philosophers attribute a place to Divine beings although wanting part and greatness. So the place of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the difference of places is in Geometrical things. So of Physick, it is more diligently considered in Physical things. In the world, in simple Elements, in Compound things.</p>

                  <p>A. The subject of senses are called sensibles; of vertues

                     <hi>Q. What are Opposites?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Opposites are disagreeings, which disagree in reason and thing; therefore cannot be attributed to the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the same, and at the same time.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Make this plain by example?</hi>

                  <p>A. So <hi>Socrates</hi> cannot be black and white of one and the same part; father and son of the same man; whole and sick at the same time: but he may be white on the one part, black on another; father of this, son of that man; sound to day, sick to morrow.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A. So it is.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the kindes of Opposites?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Disparates, or Contraries.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are Disparates?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Disparates are opposites whereof one is opposed equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to many.</p>
                  <p>A. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Green, Ash-colour, Red, are means between White and Black, which are Disparates, both with the extreams and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves. So liberality and covetousness are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates among themselves. So, a man, a tree, a stone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite of this kinde are Disparates; neither can one thing be, a man, a tree, a stone.</p>

                     <hi>Q. What is the distribution from the effects?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The distribution from the effects, is when the parts are effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. In a ship the sea-men, some scale the masts, some run in at the doors, some draw water, the governor holdeth the rudder in the ship</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. May not distribution of genus into species be comprised under this head?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Yes, distribution of genus into species doth here excel.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is genus?</hi>
                  </p>

A. Genus is the whole essential in parts.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is species?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Species is the parts of genus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A We say a living creature is the genus of a man, and a beast; for a living creature is the whole of that effect: <hi>viz.</hi> a corporal living substance, which commonly pertaineth to the beasts and men. We say the species of a man and a beast is living, because they are parts of a living subject, which living essence they have common. We say a man, the genus of every man; and a lion, the genus of every lion; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, every man, the species of a man; every lion, of a lion.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the kinds of the genus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The genus is most general or subalternate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. What are the kinds of the species?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The species is subalternate or most special.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the most general genus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The most general genus is that of which there is no kinds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. In Logical invention, an argument is the most general genus of artificials and inartificials.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. What is the subalternate genus, and the subalternate species?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The subalternate genus, as also the subalternate species, is that which is the species of this, but the genus of that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The cause is the species of an absolute arguing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the genus of the matter and form.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. But what is the most special species?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The most special species is that which is individable into other species.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The matter and form singly.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the genus and species notes of?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Of the causes and effects.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. In a living thing there is a corporeal essence, which in the matter is belonging commonly to the species; as also the faculty of life and sence, which in the form pertaineth commonly to the species.</p>

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:42260:157"/>
Q. <hi>It should seem that the genus containeth the causes, which do attain to the species of it; and therefore contrarily, the species contains the effects of their genus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So it is.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>From whence then is that universal famousness and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> From hence, because it declareth the causes,</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Shew some example now of the distributions of the genus into species?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Distribution of genus into species is very excellent truly, but hard and seldom found, yet we will bring what illustrations and examples we can. <hi>Ovid. Met.</hi> 1. Divideth living creatures into five species? stars, birds, beasts fish, men: he giveth life to the stars, as the Philosophers do.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>No region is without some living thing,</l>
                     <l>Stars in the skie, the forms of Gods being:</l>
                     <l>Birds in the air in abundance be,</l>
                     <l>Beasts on the earth, and fishes in the sea.</l>
                     <l>But yet 'mongst these a creature more divine,</l>
                     <l>Who may them rule and govern all in fine;</l>
                     <l>There wanted much until that man was born.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>So <hi>Cic. Offic.</hi> 1. Divideth vertue into four species, prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance; but all that is honest springeth out of one of these four parts, for either it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the knowledge and skill of the truth, or in the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the society of men, and giving every one his own; also in trust of things bargained, or in a high mind and admirable greatness or courage, or lastly in all things which are made and called order and means, in which is modesty and temperance.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is distribution of the genus into the forms of the species?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Distribution of the genus into the forms of the Species is the same; because the form with the genus, constitute their species.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Of living creatures, one is speaking, another dumb.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>May not genus and species be handled a part and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, genus and species are not only handled after this simple form of division, but also apart one from another.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>

A. <hi>Pro Arc.</hi> But lest any should wonder that we say so that there is a certain faculty of wit, and this reason or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of speaking, neither that we have truly given our selves altogether to this study; for all arts which pertain to humanity, have a certain common band, and are contained (as it were) in a certain knowledge amongst themselves.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A. Art is the genus; poesie, and eloquence the species.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. You have expounded the artificial arguments, the inartificial followeth; tell me then what an inartificial argument is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> An inartificial argument is that which argueth not by its own nature, but taken force from some artificial argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. It seemeth by this, when a hidden truth of things is more subtily searched for, that this argument hath small force of proof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So it is, but in civil and humane things, oftentimes this argument effecteth the greatest trust from the moving argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if wisdom, vertue, and good will be present.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is it called?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In one name is called testimony.</p>

                     <hi>Q. What are the kinds of testimony?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Divine or humane.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Not only the miracles of the Gods, but also the answers of Prophets and Fortune-tellers are counted amongst divine testimonies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All these are brought forth <hi>Cat.</hi> 3. For that I may omit (saith the Orator) the fires seen in the night from the West, and the burning of heaven, as also lightning, as earth-quakes, with other many things done to us Consuls, as those which are now done do seem to proclaime the Gods immortality. And a little after, at which time when the <hi>Araspatians</hi> were come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of all <hi>Herturia,</hi> they said that slaughter, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perishing of the laws, civil and domestical war, and the fall of the whole city and empire approached; unless the immortal Gods pleased by all reason, by their power should change those destinies. At length when he said that they mocked at the answer of the <hi>Arispatians,</hi> and that they did more regard the sign of <hi>Jove,</hi> turning to the East, he then said, But is not he so present, that it should seem to be done at the beck of the mighty <hi>Jove;</hi> that when this morning before my door, by my command and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, the Judges being then in the house of <hi>Concordia,</hi> at the same time there appeared a sign, which being turn'd toward
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42260:160"/>
you and the Senate, both you and the Senate saw manifestly laid open, who they were that were against the health of all men.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give another example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That of <hi>Tibullus</hi> is more short.</p>

                     <l>But if that Oracles true things do tell,</l>
                     <l>Then this in our name see thou do declare?</l>
                     <l>That he doth promise <hi>Delius</hi> to give,</l>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A. Pro Mil.</hi> for there is (O ye Judges) a law not written, but born with us; which we have not received, learned, read; but taken, drawn, expressed from nature: as if our life should be in some hazard, force, danger, either of thieves or enemies, all honest reason were to be sought of safety; but if the twelve tables will have the night thief, yea, the day thief too, if he defend himself after any manner, killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out punishment; who is there that will think him that is slain to be punished, when as there is a sword reached to us, to kill that man, by the lawes themselves.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>You have expounded the common affection of Axioma's, the kinds follow, what are then the kinds of an Axioma?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. An Axioma is simple or compound.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is simple?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Simple is that which is contained in the force of one word; and therefore by an affirmative or negative word it affirmeth or denieth.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give examples?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Fire burneth, fire is hot, fire is not water.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Shew the force of these examples?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Here fire is the anticedent, burneth the consequent: and this is the first disposition of invented things; of the cause with the effect, as in the first example; the subject with the adjunct, as in the second; the disagreeing with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing, in the third: after a certan manner any argument may be enuntiated, (except those full of comparison and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution) agreeings truly by affirming, disagreeing by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the kinds of a simple Axioma?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. A simple Axioma is general or special.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. What is general?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. General is when the common consequent is attributed generally to the common antecedent. And this contradiction doth not always divide the true and false, but both parts of the contingent, as also not of contingents may be false.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> A special Axioma is when the consequent is not attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every antecedent, and here the contradiction ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth the true from the false.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>what are the kinds of special?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Is not this conjunction also denied more manifestly by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the consequent?</hi>

Negation therefore and contradiction determineth, if the antecedent be, that therefore the consequent is not. Wherefore when thou shalt judge the connexive to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute true, thou shalt judge it also necessary, and thou shalt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stand this necessity to spring from the necessary connexion of parts, the which may also be even in false parts.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Contract is when the argument for the example is so subjected to a particular question, that the antecedent may be

understood to affirm each part, and in the assumption.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give an example?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This argument is understood to go before each part of the question, as if it were expressed, constancy is a vertue, and confidence; and therefore certain confidence is a vertue: also boldness is not a vertue, and yet it is confidence; and therefore some confidence is not a vertue. So in the use of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, the master of the Syllogism draweth the judgment, neither is it set forth otherwise. And this exposition the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Syllogism is expounded by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> so that the Syllogism in its full judgement is more clear and manifest.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the disjunct syllogism?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The disjunct syllogism is the syllogism composed of a disjunct proposition.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the manners of distinction?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Two.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the first?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The first taketh away one and concludeth the rest.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either it is day, or it is night.</p>
                  <p>But it is not day.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore night.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give another example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The judgement of <hi>Cicero</hi> in defence of <hi>Cluventias</hi> is such: but when as this condition was proposed to him, that either he should accuse justly and piously, or die sharply or unworthily: he would rather accuse after that manner, the die after this.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Make the disjunction appear clearer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Either he must accuse or die.</p>
                  <p>He must not die.</p>
                  <p>He must accuse therefore.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>Give another example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is the like reasoning, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. Dost thou not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it is determined, that either those who have done this thing are homicides or revengers of liberty? But attend a little and take the thoughts of a sober man for a little time, and I who am of them, as my self doth confess, will familiarly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with thee as a fellow: I deny that there is any mean: I grant that they are, except they be deliverers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42260:170"/>
of the Roman Commonwealth more then villany, more then homicides, more parricides: if truly it be cruelty, rather to be a father to the countrey, then a murtherer of ones self. Thou art a wise and considerate man what sayest thou? if they be parricides, why were they honored of thee, and called to this order by the Roman people? why was <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> by thy means freed from the law, if he were absent more then ten days from the city? why did <hi>Apolinares</hi> receive <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Brutus</hi> with incredible honor? why was the provinces given to <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> why were their questors added? why were the number of Legates increased, and this done by thee? they are not therefore homicides. It followeth then that by thine own judgement they are deliverers, when as truly there can be no third admitted.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>If the parts of the disjunct proposition shall be more then two, how shall they be judged then?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The art of judging them and concluding them shall be the same.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So <hi>Cicero</hi> judged <hi>Rabitious</hi> to be among the Consuls. And we see (saith he) these three to be in the nature of things, to wit, that either he should be with <hi>Saturninus,</hi> or with the good, or that he should lie hid. But to lie hid is proper to the dead and rotten: to be with <hi>Saturninus</hi> of fury and wickedness: vertue, and honesty, and shamefastness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained him to be with the Consuls.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>What is method?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Method is a dianoia of diverse homogene axioma, preposed for the clearness of their nature, from whence the agreeing amongst themselves of them are judged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in memory.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is to be considered in method?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> As verity and falsity is beheld in the axioma, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and inconsequence in the syllogism; so in method it is to be considered that by it the more clear may precede, the more obscure may follow, and that altogether order and confusion be judged.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Make this plainer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> After this manner is disposed from homogene axioma's in the first place, by an absolute notion, the first; in the second place the second, in the third place the third, and so forwards</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>It seemeth by this that method doth continually pass from universals to singulars?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So it is, for by this sole and only way it proceedeth from antecedents altogether, and absolute notions, to the declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of unknown consequences: and this is the only method that <hi>Aristotle</hi> taught.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, the examples of doctrines and arts do chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate and set forth the unity of method, in the which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the rules are general and universal, yet the degrees

                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Why shall the first be in the most general place and order?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because in light and knowledge it is first.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because in their clearness they are next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. It seemeth by this that those things which by nature are more known shall precede, those which are less known are substitute, and at length the most special follow?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> All definitions, distributions, are found in the rules of Grammer, and every one of them severally judged; and all these documents inscribed in diverse tables, are confounded and mingled together as it were in a certain pot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. What part of Logick teacheth us to compose these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Rules and digest them into order: first there is no need of the places of invention, when as they are all found: neither in the first judgement of axioma's, when as every axioma is proved and valued: neither of the second judgement of the syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42260:171"/>
when as all of them are disputed and concluded contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of several things by these only syllogisms; it seemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be only method, is it not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes it is onely method,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu. How is it done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Logician by this light of artificial method selected out of this pot the definition of Grammer; (for that is most general) and placeth it in the first place: Grammer is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of speaking well. Then he taketh out of the same Oven the partit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on of Grammer, and placeth it in the second place. The part of Grammer are two; Etimology and Syntaxis. Then outs of the same vessel he seperateth the definition of Etimology of words, and joyneth it in the third place to those that go before: then he seeketh out parts of words in letters and syllables, and the kinds in words of number, and without number; and placeth them with their transcitions in their several places. And so the definitions of all the parts of Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molog, together with their distributions, colligations, and most special examples he placeth in their several places, and so likewise in the Syntax. This way all the arts have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to themselves.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No, it is also declared in all things which we would teach easily and plainly.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Georgicks distributeth, as I said before, the proposed matter into four parts; and in the first book follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth common things: as Astrology, Meteorology, and of Corn and Tillage; this was the first part of his work. Then the transcition is adhibited in the beginning of the second book.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Thus far of tillage and of stars were we;</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Then he writeth generally of trees, as also specially of plants; the second transcition is adhibited to the third part, but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42260:172"/>
more imperfect and without an Epilogue. In the beginning of the third book of Oxen, Horses, Sheep, Goats, Dogs.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>We'l sing of Goddess <hi>Pales,</hi> all's of him,</l>
                     <l>Who by <hi>Amphryso</hi> kept his sheep most trim.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>At length in the beginning of the fourth book, there is the third transcition of the fourth part; but also imperfect from the only preposition of their Bees.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So therefore the Poet studieth to place the most general first, the subalternate middle, the most special in the last place.</p>

A. The Orators in Poems, Narrations, Confirmations, Perorations do follow this order, as the nature both of the art, and the order of the thing do require, and sometimes more studiously too.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Give example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. <hi>Cicero</hi> in an accusation first by propounding, then by parting, followeth this order. <hi>Questor Cu. paxeris,</hi> saith he, thou hast been Consul unto this time fourteen years, and from that day unto this day in which thou hast made me, I call thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement; there was no void hour found in robbery, wickedness, cruelty, iniquity. This is the proposition and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the chief matter, as in this judgement most gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The partition followeth: These are the years consumed in the questorship, and a Sciatican embassage, and the Urban pretorship, and in the Sicilian pretorship: wherefore this shall be the fourfold disposition of my accusation; which four parts with their particular partitions he hath also handl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their several order and place, and coupled them with transcitions; the three first in the third book. Wherefore (saith he) his questorship being shewed, and his first magistracy, together with his theft and wickedness looked unto, let us attend to the rest. Then having expounded the faults of his embassadorship, the transcition to his pretorship, followeth. But let us now come to that famous pretorship, and those faults which were more known to those which were present, then to us who come meditated and prepared to pleading. This trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cition is more imperfect without an epilogue: at length in the beginning of the fourth oration, there is the like trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cition to the fourth part of the Sicilian pretorship. Many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things, O Judges, I must pretermit, that I may in some manner speak of those things which are commited to my trust, for I have received the cause of Sicilia, that province hath drawn me unto this business.</p>

                  <p>Q. <hi>It seemeth that in the divers axiomatical homogenes, as also in the judgement of the syllogism, the notes of method shall be as often as any thing is taught clearly: but is there no other kinde of method?</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> Yes, when as the auditor shall be deceived in a certain part with delectation, and a greater motion then certain homogenes are rejected, as the lights of definition, partition, and transcition: and certain heterogenes are assumed; as digressions from the matter, and commemorations upon the thing; but chiefly the order of things in the beginnings is turned over, and certain antecedents are put after consequents. Therefore to that rule of perfect method, this may seem somewhat more imperfect; the form is not only lame things being detracted; or abounding, things being added; but also the order of it being inverted by certain degrees, is preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Give an example of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The like the Poet maketh with a certain greater kind of artificialness, while he propoundeth to himself to lead the people. <hi>Viz.</hi> the beast like heads of the multitude, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deceived diverse ways, he beginneth in the middle, and there oftentimes he comprehendeth the first; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the last he placeth in an uncertain and an unthought of chance. So as <hi>(Horace</hi> saith) <hi>Homer</hi> disposeth his Iliads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ne doth this man</hi> Troy's <hi>Wars divide so well,</hi>

                     <hi>He always maketh haste the vent to tell:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Even in the midst his reader he doth catch;</hi>

                     <hi>Leaves off his tract, with haste from it doth snatch.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And thus he lies, thus mingles false with true;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So that ne first nor midst in it I view.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q. Proceed to further example?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> So <hi>Virgil</hi> taketh <hi>Aeneas</hi> from <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and makes a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him in the banquet of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and at last bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his diverse troubles. So the Commedian Poets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though with great judgement they have distinguished their Comedies by Acts and Scenes, yet do so effect, that all things seem to be done by chance. The Orators attribute all to victory. Therefore this seemeth to be placed chiefly by them, not so much to teach as to perswade; when as also those things which do equally excel, are kept even unto the last, and the means are conferred into the middle, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Homers</hi> disposition.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ANger</hi> is blood powred, and perplexed into a froth.</p>
            <p>Reason to rage is like bands to a sore, which often stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king makes the anguish more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anger</hi> is like a deadly weapon, we hear his voice before it doth execution, and then we arm.</p>
            <p>So looks the chased Lion on the daring Hunts-man that hath galled him, then makes him nothing.</p>
            <p>As a Savage Bore (that hunted long assail'd and set upon) with his only eyes swimming in fire, keeps off his baying hounds, though sunk himself, yet holds his <hi>Anger</hi> up, and shows it forth in foam, makes firm his stand of battalious bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, feeds his hate to die, and whets his tusks with wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful majesty; So fares a furious <hi>Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anger</hi> is like a full hot horse, who being allowed his way, his self mettal tires him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambition's</hi> gilded spheres are like to painted hells, which please the eyes, even while they show the heart where horror lies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambitions</hi> thoughts, like woods, whilst they maintain the flame of high desires, grow ashes by the same.</p>

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42260:198"/>
               <hi>Ambition,</hi> like water floods, not channel-bound, neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing banks, doth over-run, and groweth nothing when its rage is down.</p>
            <p>So have I beheld an exhalation, that would be a star fall, when the Sun forsook it, in a sink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambitious</hi> men like furious cannons, are often burst with over-charging.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Allegiance</hi> tempted too far, is like the trial of a good sword on an anvil, as that often flies in pieces without service to the owner; so trust inforced too far, proves treachery, and is too late repented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affections</hi> injured, like tempest threatned, trees not firmly rooted, ne're spring to timely growth.</p>
            <p>Our love like sparkles are, they brightest shine when they go out.</p>
            <p>The pleasures of <hi>Adulterers,</hi> are like to the sea, groundless and wide.</p>
            <p>Look how a wolf doth like a dog appear, so like a friend is an <hi>Adulterer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We see that trees bears no such pleasant fruit there where they first grew, as when they are new set, perfumes, the more they are chafed, the more they render their pleasant scents; &amp; so <hi>Affliction</hi> expresseth vertue, whether true, or else adulterate.</p>

            <p>A <hi>Broker</hi> is a City Pestilence, a moth that eats up gowns, doublets, and hose.</p>
            <p>What are our <hi>Bodies?</hi> A little curded milk, fantastical puff-past, like paper prisons they use for to keep flies in.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Boasting</hi> Swaggerer is like a walking spur, he gingles much, but never pricks.</p>
            <p>A Swaggerer that fights, as the geese did that saved the Capitol, only with prating.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beauties</hi> are like to books, those that do study them do know them best: and to say truth, it is still much as it pleases the Common Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beauty</hi> concealed, is like a Jewel in the dark.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Bawd</hi> is like a Broker, she takes fees on both sides.</p>

A <hi>Bawd</hi> is both Ware and Merchant, Flesh and Butcher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chamber-maids</hi> are to show Mistresses, like porches, unto doors, you pass the one before you can have entrance to the other; or like mustard to a piece of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Chamber-maids</hi> are like lotteries, one may chuse twenty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shall find one good one.</p>
            <p>To say a <hi>Waiting-woman</hi> is handsome, and yet chaste, is to affirm all pages gelt; or that the Knight keeps to his Lady in the high bed, and never truckles.</p>
            <p>A good <hi>Consceince</hi> is a well built castle, no battery nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion can take it.</p>
            <p>A Princes <hi>Court</hi> is like a common fountain, whence should flow pure silver drops in general; but if it chance some curse example poison it near the head, death and diseases are spread through all the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courtiers</hi> are fickle things to deal with, a kinde of March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane men that will not last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Courtiers</hi> in Citizens houses are summer fires, that may be well spared, and being quite out are best; they do the house no good, but help to consume and burn the wood up, and overheat the rooms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credit</hi> is like the chastity of a maid, which if once broke, is ever after lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credit</hi> not kept up is like a Pallace, which for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair falls to ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credulity</hi> is securities blind nurse, the dream of fools, the drunkards ape, that feeling for his way, even when he thinks in his deluded sense to catch at safety, falls without defence.</p>
            <p>Great Elephants and Lions murther least; the ignoblest beast is the cruelest.</p>
            <p>To be a <hi>Cuckold</hi> is as natural as to be a married man, as to eat, sleep, or wear a night-cap.</p>
            <p>It is all one to trust ones arm in the throat of a Lion, ones purse with a Curtizen, ones neck to the chance of the dice, ones religion to a Synagogue of Jews, as ones wife with a friend.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Despair</hi> is a plummet in the heart, that weighs and pulls us living to the dust we came from.</p>

               <hi>Disdain</hi> is like to water powr'd in fire,</p>

               <hi>Dissimulation</hi> is a canker, which for the most part, seizeth the choicest fruit with its infection, still ordained for to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease the natures of best complexions.</p>
            <p>Goodness is but an out side, we all set</p>
            <p>In rings of gold, stones that are counterfet.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Dissembler</hi> is like a goodly apple, rotten at the core.</p>
            <p>Womens tongues for their garulity are like to clocks, if they go too fast, they never go true</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Envy</hi> is like a flie that passeth all the bodies soundest parts, and dwells upon his sores, and if her squint-eye have power to finde out none, she then forgeth some; she makes that crooked, ever which before was streight, calls valour giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and justice tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Extreams</hi> in our delights have violent ends, and in their triumphs die, like fire and powder, which as they kiss con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume; the sweetest honey is loathsome in its own delicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and in the taste confounds the appetite.</p>
            <p>As the east and west upon the globe a Mathematical point only divides: thus happiness, and misery, and all extreams, are still contiguous.</p>

            <p>A false <hi>Dissembler</hi> is like the serpent that parted with its subtilty, and closed it in the fruit.</p>
            <p>'Tis with our souls as with our eyes, that after a long dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, over dazled with the approach of sudden light; when in the midst of fears we are surprized with unexpected happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; the first degrees of joy are meer astonishments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fidelity</hi> in secrets, though it be honest, bears its punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with it; such a person is like to one, that in cold nights will needs have all the fire, and there is held by others, and embraced only to burn himself by their direction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flattery</hi> is the bellows that blows up sin; we seldom see a flattering Knave turn Courtier, but many Courtiers have turn'd flattering Knaves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fools</hi> are like obedient children brought up under a hard mother in law, and a cruel; who being not used to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasts and collations, when they have course bread offered them are thankful, and take it for a favour too.</p>
            <p>A man of <hi>Fortitude</hi> doth imitate the weather, that sings in tempests, and being clear is silent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear</hi> dwells with earth-quakes, shipracks at sea, or prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in heaven; a valiant man, he cannot see so many fathom beneath the height of his own heart, as fear is.</p>
            <p>Valiant hearts Kings may dissolve, but not defeat; a man that is void of fear when he doth fall, he lies great in his ruines (like the sacred carkasses of scattered temples) he still reverend lies, and the religious honour him no less, then if he stood in all his majesty.</p>
            <p>Without misfortune vertue hath no glory, valor is of no use, opposed trees make tempests, shew their powers, as waves forced back by rocks, make <hi>Neptunes</hi> towers.</p>
            <p>It is not breath can fright a noble truth, nor is there Magick in the person of a king that plays the tyrant; if that therebe a good sword can easily uncharm it, as the calm air stills tempests.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fortune</hi> hath hours of loss, and hours of gain; the brave man feels them both, who like the angry bull, never goes back for breath, but when he means to arm his fury double.</p>

               <hi>Gamesters</hi> have hearts more spacious then Kings: did they divide the Empire of the world, they would make one throw for all.</p>
            <p>To define a <hi>Gallant</hi> of the times right, a Mercer formed him, a Tailor makes him, and a Player gives him spirit.</p>
            <p>The shrub securely grows, the tallest Cedar stands most in danger of the winde.</p>
            <p>Thus we distinguish the noble from the base, the noble finde their lives and deaths still troublesome: but <hi>Humility</hi> doth sleep while the storm grows hoarse with scolding.</p>
            <p>The rates of <hi>Honor</hi> are arched so high, that Giants may let through, and keep their impious Turbands on, without good morrow to the sun.</p>
            <p>Why do we scorn inferiour men, since to be lower then the worms, is to be higher then the greatest Monarchs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humility</hi> is yong Ambitions ladder, whereon the climber upwards turns his face, but when he once attains the upmost round, he then unto the ladder turns his back, looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend.</p>
            <p>When once the Spring, main <hi>Hope,</hi> is fallen into disorder no wonder if the lesser wheels (Desire and Joy) stand still: our thoughts, like Bees when they have lost their King, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confusedly, and settle no where.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> is in opposition with Despair, and like the zealous advocate in the cause of his afflicted client, labors still to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the quirks and fallacies Despair is nimble in, whilst Fear with trembling expects trials issue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honor</hi> in noble persons, as the pure oar refined, exceeds in value treble proportions of the courser dross.</p>
            <p>Men in themselves intirely <hi>Honest,</hi> may march safe with naked feet on coals of fire; so flames do reach at heaven ere they expire.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Honest</hi> soul is like a ship at sea, that sleeps at anchor when the ocean's calm, but when she rages, and the wind blows high, he cuts his way with skill and majesty.</p>

            <p>How subtilly Hell doth flatter Vice, mounts it aloft, and makes it seem to fly; so the fowl the Tortois mockt, who to the sky the ambitious shell-fish raised: the end of all is, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he may from thence dead fall.</p>
            <p>As men in scorn of a true flame that is near, run to light their tapers at a glo-worm; so pleasures are valued above hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

            <p>Without <hi>Injuries</hi> the world would languish, and have enough to do; discord in part, makes harmony in the whole, and some must laugh whilst others do condole.</p>

               <hi>Man</hi> is a ship that sails with adverse winds, and hath no Haven till he land at death, then when he thinks his hands fast grasp the bank, comes a rude billow betwixt him and safety, and beats him back into the deep again</p>
            <p>To <hi>Marry</hi> is to be long-lived, variety is like rare sawces, provoke too far, and draws on surfets more then the other.</p>
            <p>The marriage rites are like to those that do deny a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, they locally contain a heaven or hell, there is no third place.</p>
            <p>The joys of <hi>Marriage</hi> are a heaven on earth, lifes paradise, there is no rest orative like to a constant woman; (but where is she) it would puzzle all the Gods to create such a new monster.</p>

               <hi>Mischiefs</hi> are like to darts shot at repelling walls, in their return they light on them that did direct them.</p>

               <hi>Murther</hi> is open eyed, and as the sea, whose covetuous waves imprisoned by the land, bellow for grief, and roar upon the sands; so from the earth it cries, and like a childe wrong'd by its careless nurse, will not be stilled.</p>

            <p>With what a compelled face a woman sits, whilst she is <hi>Drawing,</hi> I have noted divers, either to feign smiles, or suck in their lips, to have a little mouth, dimple their cheeks, and so disorder their face with affectation; at next sitting it hath not been the same. I have known others have lost the entire fashion of their face in half an hours sitting; in hot weather, the painting of their faces was so mellow, that they have left the poor man harder work by half to mend the Copy they wrought by. Indeed, if ever I would have mine drawn to the life, I would have the Painter steal it at such time, when I am devoutly kneeling at my prayers, there is then a heavenly beauty in it, the soul moves in the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies.</p>

weep, there is a Manuscript now kept in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> that shews he had nine years a Fistula in his eye. As for <hi>Diogenes</hi> that fasted much, and took his habitation in a Tub, to make the world believe he loved a strict and severe life, he took the diet, Sir, and in that very Tub sweat for the French dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; and some unlearned Apothecary since, mistaking its name, called it <hi>Cornelius</hi> Tub.</p>
            <p>There was never yet <hi>Philosopher</hi> that could endure the tooth-ach patiently; however they have writ the stile of Gods, and made a pish at chance and sufferance.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar sort of <hi>People</hi> in Rebellion, are like unknown Lands, those that first possess them have them.</p>
            <p>What can be expected from the <hi>Herd</hi> but contraries; he that trusts them, where he should finde them Lions, findes them Hares; where Foxes, Geese.</p>
            <p>The Vulgar have, for the most part, sick mens apperites, they desire that most, which doth them most hurt.</p>
            <p>He that <hi>Repents</hi> e're he commits a fault, doth like a thrifty sinner store his soul with mercy, to absolve that sin himself, which he hereafter is so like to fall into.</p>

            <p>Divinity which calls our anger sin, and courage pride, hath sent this silly Cherub on earth, <hi>Patience.</hi>

               <hi>Patience</hi> it is the greatest enemy to law that can be, for it doth embrace all wrongs, and so chains up Lawyers and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens tongues; it is the perpetual Prisoners liberty, his Walks and Orchards; it is the bond-slave's freedom, that makes him seem proud of his iron chains; it is the Beggars musick, who thus sings, Although their bodies beg, their souls are Kings.</p>

            <p>The fears and joys, hopes and desire mixed with despairs and doubts do make the sport in love; they are the very dog with which we hunt the hare, but as the dogs woud stop and streight give over were it not for the little thing before; so would our <hi>Passions,</hi> both alike must be flesht in the chase.</p>

            <p>There are many half <hi>Travellers,</hi> that went out men, and good men, that when they have returned, lookt like poacht eggs; their souls suckt out, empty and full of wind; all their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <hi>Truth</hi> is not made of glass, that with a small touch it should fear to break.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> is like your Coat of Arms, richest when plainest.</p>
            <p>Whom heaven is pleased to stile <hi>Victorious,</hi> to such applause runs madding; like <hi>Bacchus</hi> drunken Priests, who without reason in their Sacrifices, voiced their Leader on a Demigod; when as indeed each common souldiers blood drops down as currant coin in that hard purchase, as his, whose much more delicate condition hath sucked the milk of ease; judgement commands, but resolution executes.</p>
            <p>He that fights well at the end of the Wars,</p>
            <p>His head wears Sun Beams, and his feet touch Stars.</p>

               <hi>Vertue</hi> is a sollid rock, whereat being aimed, the keenest darts of Envy cannot hurt,</p>
            <p>Her Marble Hero's stand built on such Bases,</p>
            <p>That they recoil, and wound their shooters faces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> is a Labyrinth, where unguided men walk up and down till they are weary.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> is a Foot ball, we run after it with whoop and hollow, he that is next to it is sure to catch a fall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World's</hi> a City full of straying Streets;</p>
            <p>And Death's the Market place where each one meets.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> is like an Inn-keepers Chamber-pot, it receives all waters, both good and bad, it hath need of much scowring.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> shoots up daily into more cunning, the very spider weaves her cawls with more art to entrap the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton silly flie; so that we had need to keep our wits wound up to their strecht height.</p>
            <p>Where the <hi>Whore</hi> ends, the Bawd begins; and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Bawd is the generation of a Witch. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> holds an opinion, that a Witch turns to a wild cat; as an old Oastler turns to an ambling Nag.</p>
            <p>As of the Lion and Eagle, it is said, that when they go they draw their sears and tallons close up, to shun rebating of their fierceness; so our wits sharpness which we should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in noble knowledge, we should never waste on vile and gar admiration.</p>

            <p>You have a pretty ambling <hi>Wit</hi> in summer, do you let it out, or keep it for your own riding; who holds your stirrup whilst you jump into a jeast, to the endangering of your <hi>Quodlibets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Like <hi>Jupiter</hi> you want a <hi>Vulcan;</hi> but to cleave your head, and out peeps bright <hi>Minerva.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>War</hi> is a school, where all the principles tending to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are taught, if truly followed; but for such as do repair thither, as to a place in which they do presume, they may with licence practise their Lust and Riots; such will never merit the noble Characters of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Wars</hi> are bad, yet sometimes they do good,</p>
            <p>And like to Surgions let sick Kingdoms blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whores</hi> are sweet meats, which rot the eater, poisoned perfumes, cozening Alchimy, shipwracks in calmest weather, Russian winters, which appear so baren, as if that nature had forgot the spring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whores</hi> are the true material fires of Hell, worse then the tributes paid in the Low Countries; exactions upon meat, drink, garments, sheep, I, even one mans prediction, his sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whores</hi> are like those brittle Evidences of Law, that forfeit a mans wretched estate for leaving out a sillable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whores</hi> are like those flattering bells, that ring one tune at Weddings and at Funerals.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Whore</hi> is like the guilty counterfeited coin, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever first stamps it, brings in question, and troubles all that do receive it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Whore</hi> is as modest as one can be, that hath lest to blush at twelve: felt motions at eleven, and hath been hardned before three congregation, and done pennance.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Wench</hi> that will make a Hermit run to Hell for a touch of her.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>Whore</hi> for to turn honest is one of <hi>Hercules</hi> Labours; it was more easie for him in one night to make fifty Queans, then to turn one of them honest again in fifty years.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Whore</hi> is one of the devils vines, all sins like so many poles, are stuck upright out of hell to be her props, that she may spred upon them; and when she is ripe, every Knave hath a pull at her; till she be pressed, the yong beautiful grape sets the teeth of lust on edge; she will be tasted though she be rank poison.</p>
            <p>Sives can hold no water, nor <hi>Harlots</hi> hoard up money; she
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42260:208"/>
hath too many sluces to let it out; yet she is the Gallipot that drones do fly to for the sweet sucket that they thinks within it.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Widdows</hi> are a politick generation, proved so by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> many voyages make an experienced Sea-man; many offices a crafty Knave; so many marriages, a subtil cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Widdow.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Widdow</hi> is a garment worn thred-bare;</p>
            <p>Selling at second hand like Brokers ware.</p>
            <p>A good <hi>Wife</hi> she is a golden sentence, writ by our Maker, which the Angels know how to discourse of; only men know not how to make use of.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Woman</hi> was made of the rib of a man, and that rib was crooked: the Moral of which is, That a man from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning must be crooked to his wife, let him be an Orange to her, and she will be as sower as Vinegar to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Women</hi> are the baggage of our lives, they are troublesome and hinder us in our great march; and yet we cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Women</hi> are like to burs, where their affections throw them, there they stick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Women</hi> carry springs within their eyes, and can out-weep the Crocodile, till too much pity betrays us men to their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless devourings.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Woman</hi> is a Labyrinth, we can measure the height of any Star, point out all the demensions of the Earth, examine the Seas great womb, and sound its subtil depth; but Art will never be able to finde out the demonstration of a Womans heart.</p>
