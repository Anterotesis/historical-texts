            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALthough you are by far the
least in Number, you are yet
to be esteemed as the much
more considerable part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of that Country, in respect of
your Power, and the Authority which
you bear there. 'Tis true, that upon
the first Subduction of the <hi>Irish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:48019:3"/>
to the <hi>English</hi> Government, the
Laws and Liberties of Englishmen
were granted unto them, equally with
the Colony of the <hi>Old English</hi> that
were planted among them; but as they
were a people that had been always
us'd to a sort of wild aud barbarous
way of Living, they did not affect to
embrace the more Civiliz'd Customs
and Manners of the <hi>English,</hi> but for
the most part kept themselves off from
uniting and joining with them in the
Management of the Government, which
by the Concessions made to them, they
might freely have acted in; yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
as a distinct and separate people,
sway'd and influenc'd by their own
petty Princes or Chiefs of Clans, even
to the breaking out into frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections
and Rebellions against the
<hi>English</hi> Government; which therefore
continued all along to be chiefly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
<pb facs="tcp:48019:3"/>
by the Inhabitants of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Pale: And in this state the
Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> remain'd until the
Reformation of Religion, from whence
sprung such a Revolution as produc'd
a great Change in the Administration
of the publick Affairs there: For after
the Reformation had obtain'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Ancient <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>
did generally remain of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Communion, and consequently when
'twas found dangerous to continue them
in the Execution of publick Trusts,
they also as well as the <hi>Irish</hi> of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame Religion, were in process of
Time, by the Influence and Authority
of <hi>England,</hi> utterly disabled from
acting any thing in the Government of
the State; and 'tis in their rooms
that you have since succeeded, and are
therefore look'd upon and treated by
<hi>England</hi> as the governing part, and
<pb facs="tcp:48019:4"/>
effective Body of the Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when I came to consider Mr.
<hi>Molyneux's.</hi> Book, I thought it very
strange, that he who design'd so Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
a piece in your Favour, should
yet give you no stronger a Title to
the preheminence which you bear in
that Country, than what would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
upon you from those Concessions
which were anciently made to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Irish</hi> and Old <hi>English;</hi> which,
as he would perswade us, did amount
to no less than the establishing them
upon the Foundation of an Absolute
Kingdom, distinct and separate from
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and wholly
Independent thereon; the Consequence
of which, if it had been so, would
have stood you in very ill stead, for
as you cannot make any pretensions
to such Concessions, because you are
<pb facs="tcp:48019:4"/>
not (generally speaking) descended
from either of those People, but their
Progeny are still in being, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be such; all the Rights and
Priviledges which Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath
so strongly contested for, should be
due to them, if the Case must be taken
as he hath stated it; and nothing can
be more plausibly offered in their Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
for the cutting the Throats
of the Modern <hi>English,</hi> than this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> is so fond
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ixing you upon this Old Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e even disputes the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their forfeiting, or the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of our retracti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions:
I believe indeed, that he
might forsee, that if it should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that the frequency of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
and our reducing them by force
of Arms, did amount to a Reconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this their Independent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:5"/>
(as he makes it) that would
have dissolv'd that ancient Concession,
and spoyl his Design of entailing it
upon you: However it be, I think
this sort of Title does naturally fall
under an inextricable Dilemma: For,
If <hi>Ireland</hi> was granted to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Irish</hi> and Old <hi>English,</hi> as an
Absolute, Independent Kingdom, and
was never since re-conquered by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the Right of administring
the publick Affairs of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(under the King) ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in them, since 'twas never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to you by their Consents; and
then they have no reason to consider you
otherwise, than as having no Title
more than Usurpers and Oppressors,
and that you may justly be treated
as such whenever they are in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do it? But if this Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Kingdom hath been reconquer'd,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:5"/>
the former Concessions are actually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
and neither you nor they can
have any more pretence to an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Kingdom, until you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curea
New Grant for it: And thus
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> in labouring to raise
you higher than your proper Basis,
hath quite unhing'd you.</p>
            <p>But I have yet no doubt of your
being as well Entituled to the Power
and Authority which you enjoy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
in that Country, as any People
in <hi>Europe</hi> are; and that it is justly
deriv'd to you, from a much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Original than what Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>
hath assign'd; and I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
undertaken in the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to controvert his Notion through
every point, and to shew in Opposition
to his Arguments; <hi>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the <hi>Second,</hi> having subdu'd <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the means of an <hi>English</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48019:6"/>
Army, that Country came to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
to the Imperial Crown, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> but not to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of King <hi>Henry,</hi> in any separate
propriety from the Kingdom. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
That the Subduing of <hi>Ireland</hi> by
the people of <hi>England,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of their King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>
was then esteem'd to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and is much more to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so, than <hi>William</hi> the first's acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and
that <hi>Ireland</hi> was thereby most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
brought under the Iurisdiction
of the Parliamentary Authority of
<hi>England. Thirdly,</hi> That King
<hi>Henry's</hi> Descent upon <hi>Ireland</hi> was
a just Undertaking, and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
submission of the People to the
Government of <hi>England,</hi> their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
its Laws, and being endo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d
in all the priviledges of <hi>Englishmen,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48019:6"/>
made them become a Member of, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd
to the English Empire, and gave
<hi>England</hi> a just Title to exercise a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Iurisdiction over them. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
That all the many Concessions made
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> empowering them to hold
Parliaments, &amp;c. can be understood no
otherwise, than that they should be enabled
to devise and enact such Laws when
Occasion required, as were suitable
to the Circumstances of that Country:
But that no Grant ever did, or
could make <hi>Ireland</hi> an Absolute, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
Separate Kingdom, and wholly
Independent of <hi>England,</hi> or invest
it with such a supream Legislature as
is inherent in the Head of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
only; which, with respect to
the Body of the <hi>English</hi> Empire, can
never reside any where else than in the
King, by and with the Advice and
Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of the Lords and Commons of
<pb facs="tcp:48019:7"/>
               <hi>England</hi> in Parliament assembled.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the Presidents and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
quoted by Mr. <hi>Molyneux,</hi> do
not by any means assist his Argument,
but do most of them support mine
against him. And <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That his
Reasons and Arguments offered on one
side and t'other, are as little to his
purpose; but that the <hi>English</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>Ireland</hi> always were, and
ever must be properly accounted as a
Colony of <hi>England,</hi> and hath ever
been by her protected and supported
as such.</p>
            <p>By these Principles then, and no
other but such as these, can the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
be justify'd in their Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Irish;</hi> whereas if they had
been an absolute, distinct, independent
People, the former and latter Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
they have given us, could not
have been Rebellions, but were just At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb facs="tcp:48019:7"/>
to vindicate their Rights against
a People that had without Reason vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
them; their Lands had not been
legally Forfeited, but forcibly taken
from them, against all Iustice and
Reason; and the Spilling of so much
of their Blood must lye heavy upon
those that provok'd them to take up
Arms, in Defence of their just Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Properties. Is it not much
more for your Interest then, to put
this matter on the right bottom, upon
which our Actings towards them were
always grounded, by considering the
<hi>Irish</hi> as a People that had been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
and brought into Subjection to
the <hi>English</hi> Government, and were
united to it in the Nature of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of its Empire; and to esteem
the <hi>English</hi> that have been settled
there as a Colony of <hi>England,</hi> which
we were oblig'd to protect and defend
<pb facs="tcp:48019:8"/>
against any Insults and Violences of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them by the Natives? For this
must justly subject them to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures
and Penalties due to Rebels,
vindicate us in the Severities we have
exercis'd upon them, support you in
the possession of the Estates which
were taken from them, and return the
the Guilt of all the Blood that hath
been shed in the <hi>Irish</hi> Wars, upon
their own Heads, as being the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors.</p>
            <p>These things are so Obvious, that
I believe, there are many of you that
can have no good Opinion of Mr.
<hi>Molyneux's</hi> Book, yet I am told that
there are others, and some of good
Rank among you, that are very fond
of it: does indeed with respect to
you carry the face of a Popular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and is artfully written; and
he that can take the Latitude of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb facs="tcp:48019:8"/>
his own Imaginations and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
Conjectures with the Confidence
of Realities and Certainties, suggest
Falsities with the utmost Assurance,
and omit Material Truths; may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
much upon an unwary Reader,
especially if be thinks what's offer'd
is for his Interest.
<q>Quod volumus, facile credimus.</q>
But any thoughtful Man, that will give
himself leave to Consider it impartially,
will find it to be one of the weakest and
most mistaken Books that ever was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with such a flourish of Language,
and shew of Learning and Integrity.
The Story of King <hi>John's</hi> being made
an absolute Independent King, is the
main Prop on which he lays the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
stress of his Reasoning, aud yet it
proves but a meer Imagination: The
Writers indeed of these Times do say,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:9"/>
he was made King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but
it looks but like a Complement to him,
for the Grant it self shews plainly that
'twas but feudatory Donation, and that
'twas never intended to make him an
Independent King, because he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
to use no higher Stile than that
of Lord of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> also deals very
unfairly in many other particulars,
and it appears that he had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the point he contests, than to
discover the genuine Truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for he hath not only stretch'd in
favour of his Argument beyond what
any Authorities can warrant, but he
has also conceal'd divers obvious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that make against him; of
which I shall observe to you some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which have occur'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to me
since I had gone through with my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
I have accidentally met with
<pb facs="tcp:48019:9"/>
Sir <hi>Richard Bolton's</hi> Statutes, (which
he quotes) wherein I Observe,<note place="margin">28 H. 8. Ch. 2. Ch. 8. Ch. 19. 33 H. 8. Ch. 1.</note> that there
are several Acts that declare in most
express Words, that the Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland</hi> is <hi>appending; united; knit,
and a Member rightfully belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Imperial Crown of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
And yet Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
this to us with such a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution,
as represents it but <hi>as it were
united,</hi> and <hi>which he conceives ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
no more, than that</hi> Ireland
<hi>shall not be alien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d or separated
from the King of</hi> England; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but I cannot imagine that he is so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of our Constitution; as not to
know, that we can have no Notion of
uniting or annexing to the Imperial
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as appropriated
to the King's Person, distinct from the
Kingdom, which if it can be sence any
where else, is yet perfect Nonsence in
<pb facs="tcp:48019:10"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> But I have met with one Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication
so notorious, that I must not
omit shewing it: Mr. <hi>Molynex</hi> in
page 41. hath these words; <hi>For the
Dominion and Regality of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>was wholly and separately
vested in King</hi> Iohn, <hi>being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
granted unto him without
any Reservation. And he being
created King in the Parliament
at</hi> Oxford, <hi>under the Style and
Title of Lord of</hi> Ireland, <hi>enjoy'd
all manner of Kingly Jurisdiction,
Preheminence and Authority Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
belonging to the Imperial State
and Majesty of a King, as are the
express words of the</hi> Irish <hi>Statute,</hi>
33 H. 8. cap. 1. I must confess,
that I believ'd that this Statute had
been as express in the matter as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
it, but 'tis so far from it, that
there is no mention made of King <hi>John,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48019:10"/>
or his Grant in it: The words of the
Act are, <hi>Forasmuch as the King
our most gracious Sovereign Lord,
and his Grace's most noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
Kings of</hi> England, <hi>have
been Lords of this Land of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>having all manner of Kingly
Jurisdiction, Power, Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies,
and Authority Royal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
or appertaining to the
Royal Estate and Majesty of a
King, by the Names of Lord of</hi>
Ireland. We deny not, that King
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth's</hi> Progenitors, the
Kings of <hi>England,</hi> had this Royal,
Sovereign Authority over <hi>Ireland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but his Insinuation, that <hi>John</hi> had it
before he was King of <hi>England</hi> is
plainly false, and not warrantable by this
Statute.</p>
            <p>Again, he mightily imposes upon the
World, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a New Law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but those
which he had before-mentioned:</hi>
And though while I am dealing with
Mr. <hi>Molyneux,</hi> I confine my self to
mention no Authorities but his own, yet
I will here presume for a proof of his
Ignorance or Disingenuity, to name some
other old Acts binding <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
have been imparted to me by a very
Learned and Observing Gentleman of
our House of <hi>Commons,</hi> whose Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
I can relye on, without troubling
my self to search the Records; and
I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Attwood</hi> hath
been much fuller in this particular,
though I deny my self the reading his
Book till my own be perfected.</p>
            <p>The Statute of <hi>York, 12 Ed.</hi> 1st.
Enacts Laws to be observed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland; 11 Ed. 3. cap. 3.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48019:11"/>
Prohibits any Cloaths to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England, Ireland, Wales,</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> (for we then claim'd a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over <hi>Scotland</hi> also) but such
as were made in the King's Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
upon pain of Forfeiture; <hi>27 Ed. 3.</hi>
Erects Staple-Towns in <hi>Ireland; 34
E. 3. cap. 17.</hi> Enacts, that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nts,
Aliens or Denizons, may come

and freely return; <hi>43 Ed. 3. cap. 1.</hi>
The Staples of <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. shall be
kept at the places where they were first
ordain'd; <hi>1 Hen. 6. cap. 3.</hi> Enacts
that the <hi>Irish,</hi> that have Benefices or
Offices in <hi>Ireland,</hi> shall abide there
upon their Benefices and Offices, upon
the pain of forfeiting the Profits of
their Benefices and Offices for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and mentions the like
Law made the <hi>1st.</hi> of <hi>Hen. 5th.</hi>
From these and many other instances,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:12"/>
it evidently appears, that <hi>England</hi>
hath always exercis'd a Legislative Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over <hi>Ireland,</hi> whenever fit
Occasions have made it necessary.</p>
            <p>I have also seen the <hi>Irish</hi> Acts of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
and Explanation, and though
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> says, that they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew, that the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi>
may repeal an Act pass'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
yet I find nothing like it in those
Acts; but on the contrary, the King's
Declaration, which is of the Body of the
Act of Settlement, although it takes
Notice that the Estates and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
enjoy'd by the Adventurers, would
prove very defective, if they were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Letter of the Law, because
they had not strictly pursu'd and observ'd
those Acts of 42, from which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
their Title; yet 'tis made the first
Business of this Act, to confirm these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
in the Inheritance of all the
<pb facs="tcp:48019:12"/>
Estates allotted them by virtue of those
<hi>English</hi> Acts of Parliament; and 'tis
provided, that if they should be obliged
to restore any of those Lands to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents,
they should be first repriz'd
to the full Value out of other forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lands. What more could be desired,
to shew the utmost regard to those
<hi>English</hi> Acts of Parliament? 'Tis
true indeed, that the Act of Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
retrenches one Third of the Allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made to the Adventurers; but
this could not be construed as any
Breach upon the <hi>English</hi> Acts, for
if they had taken a greater share, than
the Lands that remain'd forfeited would
amount to, 'twas but reasonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to a just proportion: So that
here again Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
strain'd this Suggestion beyond
the Truth of the Fact. I have indeed,
remark'd these things at large in their
<pb facs="tcp:48019:13"/>
places, but as some more perfect Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
have since come to my Hand,
I thought they might not improperly be
hinted here, for the obviating the too
great Opinion of Mr. <hi>Molyneux's</hi>
performance, with which some may yet
remain praepossess'd, and preparing them
to entertain my Answer with the less
prejudice.</p>
            <p>I have heard indeed, that 'tis not
to Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> alone that we are
beholding for this Notion, but that
it hath for several Years past been
talk'd on among several of your People,
and he hath only redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d it into form,
and now at last brought it forth into
the World; and you may observe by
the Votes of our last Parliament, that
they were of the Opinion, that several
Resolves of your House of Commons
gave Encouragement to the publishing
of this Book. But I would yet hope,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:13"/>
that many of that Assembly were not
so far appriz'd of the Matter, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
to Design the doing any thing
that should give so great an Offence
to <hi>England:</hi> Yet I can assure you,
from the Conversation I have had with
several of the Members of our House
of Commons, that although they had
not Leisure to proceed further upon
this Business in their last Sessions,
'tis however very probable that it may
be taken into Consideration again by
the ensuing Parliament, as a Matter
which if it be not check'd in time, may
produce very ill Effects: And you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be sensible of the Dangerous
Consequences of breaking the fair Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
and firm Confidence that
ought always to be maintain'd between
the Head Government and its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
and that when Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Iealousies are once enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:14"/>
they are too apt to be improv'd
into Extreams on both sides. You know
also, that you have an Old Enemy near
you, who would be ready enough to
entertain hopes of Advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from any such Iarrings: And
you must needs acknowledge, that 'tis an
imprudent thing to provoke those that
have not only Right, but also Power to
support it.</p>
            <p>It hath been an usual Policy with
some other Governments, to keep so
strict a Hand over their Colonys, as
not to suffer the <hi>Criolians,</hi> or People
born there, to bear any Considerable
Office or Command therein; but the
Government of <hi>England</hi> hath not
dealt so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ardly by you, and doubtless
it will be always your Interest to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the giving any Occasion to distrust
your Fidelity, and to think it may be
needful to treat you with more Caution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48019:14"/>I should think therefore, that you
cannot do your selves a greater Right,
than in the next Sessions of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
not only to Censure this Book,
but utterly to Disclaim also the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your being a Kingdom so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
within your selves, as to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
independent of the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
I hope I have been able in my
following Discourse, to Convince any
reasonable Person that it cannot be so,
and that instead of doing you any good,
'twould tend to your Destruction to
have it thought so: Yea, and if you
should Recognize your selves to be a
Colony of <hi>England,</hi> (as I have shewn
that you cannot be lookt upon under
any other Consideration) I believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more agreeable to your
Circumstances, or better support your
Title to what you enjoy in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
It would also be well worth your
<pb facs="tcp:48019:15"/>
Thoughts, whether it might not be fit
for you to shew your Readiness to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
something, according to your
Ability, towards the Reimbursing of
<hi>England</hi> a part of the vast Charge
they have been at, in recovering that
Country, and restoring you to your
Estates; whereby you may possibly
prevent the Parliament of <hi>England's</hi>
requiring it of you; for I can tell
you, that since Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath
started the Thought, some of the most
considerable Members of our House of
Commons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave talk'd on't.</p>
            <p>I have no ill will to <hi>Ireland,</hi> I have
had the Honour to have been in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with many of you, for whom I
have the utmost Respect and personal
Esteem, and I have been sorry to see
so much of an Inclination in some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Persons, to favour this Opinion of
Mr. <hi>Molyneux.</hi> The sense of Power
<pb facs="tcp:48019:15"/>
and Profit prevails much upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Frailty; nay, it easily subdues our
Reason, and makes us unwilling to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Convictions against what we have
believ'd to be our Interest; but I have
endeavoured to shew those that are
mislead in this Matter, that it can by
no means be their Interest to be freed
from the Iurisdiction of the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Authority of <hi>England:</hi> You know
that you are not able to protect and
defend your selves against the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and that the Kings
of <hi>England</hi> cannot raise Money upon
the People to help you, without their
Consent in Parliament; would you
have them then only to have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to raise Money, and appropriate
it to your Service, without having any
more to do with you? Or can you
think, that the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
will ever more assist you upon
<pb facs="tcp:48019:16"/>
those Terms? rather may they not
with good Reason demand a Reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursement
of what Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>
owns to be due to us for former As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances?
which would doubtless a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to a greater Sum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> than you

and yet 'tis too well known, that
many of your People have been apt to

done for you, and to tell us, that what
we did was not out of regard to them,
but to our selves: And since the Bill
design'd to restrain you from spoyling
us in our principal Trade of the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Manufactury, by underselling us in
Forreign Markets, we have been sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </gap> Give me
leave to tell you, that this is not lookt
upon as a modest or friendly Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
much less does it denote any sense
of Gratitude retain'd in a People that
were so lately Reliev'd by <hi>England,</hi>
and restor'd to the enjoyment of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Estates, which they must never
have expected but through the Help
of <hi>England;</hi> and this hath been done
wholly at our Cost, and they have not
(hither to) been askt to Contribute one
Penny towards it; some People would
<pb facs="tcp:48019:17"/>
not surely have so soon forgotten so
great a Benefit. I am yet desirous
to reason a little with you upon this
Matter, but 'tis hard to use so much
plainness as is requisite, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Offence to some, which I would
as far as possible avoid, my Design
being real Friendship and Good-will to
you, and I should rejoice if I might be
instrumental to Reconcile you to an even
Temper of Mind; but that's hardly to
be done with such as shall persist to
be of the Opinion that they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the right: Suffer me however
to tell you, that you have ways enough
to employ your Poor, without the Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Trade, which with you (as to those
sorts that hurt us) is a New Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking:
You have large and encouraging
Improvements arising from the product
of your Lands; your great quantities
of Provisions, Butter, Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48019:17"/>
afford you a fair Foundation for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade, besides you are very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a Linnen Manufacture, if
you will employ your Stock and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
that way. On the other hand,
<hi>England</hi> hath for many Ages, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
her self to the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury,
the poor are settled in it, and
have no other way of Livelyhood; she
hath no means of gaining Wealth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to support her Government without
it; but your being able to work so much
cheaper, must of consequence abate the
prices to so great a degree, as that
she cannot be able to hold the Trade;
which in time will cause a decay of
her Wealth and Power, draw inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Ruin upon her whole Empire,
and involve your selves in the same:
Is it not easie then to determine, for
whom 'tis reasonable to give place in
this Contest? 'twas upon this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb facs="tcp:48019:18"/>
you have been restrain'd from
exporting your Wools to any Country
but <hi>England,</hi> and is not the necessity
of restraining the Manufacture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
much more cogent? Bear with me
to say, that the evident reason of the
thing is sufficient to convince all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that <hi>England</hi> must be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
oblig'd to preserve this Trade
to her self; that she cannot suffer any
of her Members to interfere with her
in it, and that to advocate against so
just an exerting of the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
shews only a self-seeking Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
in Minds that would grasp all to
themselves, without having any regard
to the Well-being of the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
of which they are but Members:
You see the People of <hi>Romney-Marsh,</hi>
are not willing to be hindred from send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Wools to <hi>France,</hi> and the
justice of the thing is as much to them
<pb facs="tcp:48019:18"/>
as you, the only difference is, that they
being within the Realm of <hi>England</hi>
send Representatives to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and yet perhaps they would have
been as far from consenting as you,
if they had not been over voted: But
there would be no possibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Societies, if such Compulsions
might not be exercis'd towards parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>We must yet own that 'tis but a
natural infirmity, for Men to be hardly
perswaded into the right reason of
things which they believe to be against
their own Interest; nay, we find that
they are too apt to be prejudic'd against
such who endeavour to convince them
of their Mistakes; and as we observe
that particular Persons are subject to
prevailing Inclinations, so also there
are Habits and Dispositions, that are
in some measure peculiar to distinct

Countries and People, from whence it
hath been usual to give general Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of the Inhabitants of particular
Countries, according to the Virtues or
Vices that have been noted to be most
predominant among them; neither is it
difficult to assign some natural causes,
from whence such habitual Dispositions
may proceed; for some instance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I would offer the consideration of a
Colony well settled in an abundant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where the People find very easie
means of subsistence and improvement,
and are in great measure exempted
from the solicitious Cares and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Life, that attend the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of places that are more populous
and fully cultivated; and where also
they have been us'd to exercise a large
Dominion and Power over the Natives,
who have been always kept in a servile
Obedience and Subjection to them, to
<pb facs="tcp:48019:19"/>
a far greater degree than can be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a Country where the People enjoy
a more equal share of Liberty: Is it not
reasonable then to expect, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of such a Colony may be naturally
Generous, Hospitable, Free of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and of Couragious and Bold Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?
These are Virtues, which every
Body will commend; but is it not as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for such a People, to be less ready
to pay so intire an Obedience as may be
requir'd of them by their Superiours, and
to be uneasie under any Checks, that may
impeach them in the prosecution of such
Advantages that they may find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
capable of, without considering how
preiudicial they may be to others? may
there not be an aptness in such a People to
be somewhat assuming, and to have a
good Opinion of themselves? will there
not be a proness to impatience, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
to reflect, when any Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:48019:20"/>
is given them? may they not be likely
to expect more regard from others, than is
really due to them? Is it not probable, that
they would be less considerate in giving
Offence, than ready to take Offence at
others? may not heighth of Spirit be
nearer their Temper, than true Humility?
Moreover, as they have no Concern in
the transacting with Forreign Nations in
matters of Government, they may be the
less us'd to consider of the Nature and
Reason of Political Managements, or to
think how far it is incumbent upon a
Mother Nation or Supream Government,
to regulate all her Colonies or Members,
so as that the Tranquility of the whole
Empire may be best conserv'd; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they may be subject to forget the
Obedience and Duty which must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
owing from them to her: These
are Humane Infirmities, that may be very
naturally incident, to a People under the
fore-mentioned Circumstances; and I have
met with ingenuous Persons who have
been bred up in such Colonies, that have
readily acknowledg'd, that their Iudgments
have been much rectify'd in these matters,
when they have come to see more of the
<pb facs="tcp:48019:20"/>
World, and been made sensible of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Accomplishments that are to be found
in a more Polite Conversation; they may
perhaps attain to a good pitch of School-Learning,
but that can amount to no
more than a very superficial Knowledge,
in respect to the far greater improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is to be gain'd by reading the
great Book of the World, and practising
the ample Study of Men and Things.</p>
            <p>I am tender of putting these things too
home, because I know that though Men
should be brought to see their own Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
but few can endure to be told of
them; yet a Marriner will esteem him for
a Friend, that warns him of the Rocks and
Sands that lye in his way, and a wise man
will never account such an one his Enemy,
who over-perswades him into the right way,
when he was confidently going on in the
wrong. I am sure, I want not good
Will to the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no Man that hath no concern there,
can wish their Prosperity more than I do,
and I am very sensible, that 'tis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>England</hi> to encourage them in
all such improvements, as may conduce
to their Happiness and Well being, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb facs="tcp:48019:21"/>
they are such as may not prove
highly prejudicial to her self.</p>
            <p>I shall think my pains in this Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to have been very well bestow'd,
if I have been able to offer any thing
that may convince you, that 'tis your
undoubted Interest utterly to abandon the
Thoughts or Desires of being look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Parliamentary Authority of
<hi>England,</hi> to be a People wholly exempt
from their Iurisdiction: And as I know
my Name is too inconsiderable to add
any Authority to the Argument, I hope
I may be excus'd in concealing it from
the Odium of such, who may not discern
the sincerity of my Intentions towards you
in this Essay; and yet I will not doubt,
but there are others who will believe me

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO
Mr. Molyneux.</head>
            <p>OF all the Freedom that hath
been taken since the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Press, we have
scarcely seen so bold an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
as that of this Author, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no less than to strike off from
the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> with a dash
of his Pen, the whole Nation of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
over which it hath exerciz'd a
just Dominion for many hundreds of
Years; and yet I believe it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that he hath not shewn the
want of Consideration more in his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48019:22"/>
choosing an Argument of so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Consequence, than by his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial,
confus'd and mistaken way
of managing it, the strength of any
reasoning that he hath offer'd, being
much more applicable to the Native
<hi>Irish,</hi> with whom the Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
(if there were any such) must
have been made, than to the <hi>Brittish</hi>
Protestants inhabiting among them.
But it is to be considered, that the
Political State of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very considerable Alterations since
the first possession of it by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish;</hi>
for though that first Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Irish</hi> was so universal, as
that the <hi>English</hi> possess'd themselves
of most of the considerable Towns,
and settled far and wide in the Island,
yet in after times, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the <hi>Irish,</hi> and the mixing
and uniting of many of the Old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
with them, that part which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
intirely under the <hi>English</hi>
Obedience, came to be confin'd to
a Narrow Compass, perhaps not
above four or five Counties, which
was till very lately di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tinguisht by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48019:22"/>
the Name of the <hi>English Pale,</hi> and
the far greater part of the Country
remain'd under many petty Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
possess'd by the <hi>Irish</hi> Lords and
great Men, who paid but very little
Obedience to the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
but on the contrary, some or
other of them were almost continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
giving disturbance to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Government that was settled
there, by which means they were
shut out from having to do with the
<hi>English</hi> in the Transacting of the
Publick Affairs of the Country; and
the Reduction of them never came
to any tolerable Perfection, till so
lately as the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi>
so that indeed those Ancient
Parliaments, and other Managements
of the Publick Affairs there, which
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> mentions, did scarcely
operate further than among the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Settlements, which, as I said before,
extended but to a small part of the
Island.</p>
            <p>There was yet another great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
which made a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
alteration in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48019:23"/>
of the Government of that
Country, and that was the Change
of Religion; for after the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
came to be throughly establisht,
and the Roman Catholicks were
found to be continually designing
against it, all of that Religion were
excluded from having to do in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Managements; and this shut
out not only the Native <hi>Irish,</hi> but
even the Old <hi>English,</hi> who mostly
continued under that Profession. But
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> takes no Notice of the
Distinctions that ought to be made
of these different Interests, but that
he may carry on his Point, blends
and confounds them all together; as
if they were to be considered alike,
as one intire People, establisht and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuinuing
upon the same bottom of
Government. If then due Regard be
had to these and other Distinctions,
which must be observ'd upon his way
of Arguing, I believe it will be found,
that this doughty piece of <hi>Irish</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will appear but a very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
performance.</p>
            <p>I would not however detract from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48019:23"/>
any thing that may deserve applause,
and therefore must commend his
smooth way of Expression, and own
him to be a good Master of Words,
but yet to have applyed them so ill,
will still continue him under the
Censure of being much wanting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Integrity or Judgment, and
makes this Book of his to deserve no
better a Character than that of <hi>Vox
&amp; praeterea nihil.</hi> I have heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that some have been taken with
the seeming Modesty and Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with which he introduces his
Discourse, as if it were but an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
representation of the ancient
Rights and Liberties of the People
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a just Remonstrance
of some Encroachments and Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made upon them by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England;</hi> but if it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>
hath a certain Jurisdiction over them,
and that it hath never treated them
otherwise than according to the Rules
of Justice, and with such a due Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
as becomes every Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to Exercise over all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48019:24"/>
of its Empire, for the Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Peace and Tranquility to
the whole, and in that have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Bounds of a reasonable and
just Dominion; that part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
that shall endeavour to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves from the Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they justly owe to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Government, that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
protected and defended them,
and shall challenge to themselves Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
and Privileges, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were or could be granted them,
without prejudice and injury to the
greater Body of the Government, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not to be considered as As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors
of their own Rights, but
rather as Invaders of the lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which God hath placed over
them; and certainly it must rather
be Matter of Contempt and Derifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than of Commendation, to see a
Man treat his Superiour with a strain
of Fine, Smooth, Gentle Words, and
Fawning Complements, upon a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that is altogether imposing and
odious to him. Thus much I thought
requisite to premise, and so shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48019:24"/>
to the Examination of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
In which I intend to take
Notice only of such matters as I
shall think most Observable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his Dedication to the King, he</hi>
Humbly implores the Continuance of his
Majesties Graces to them, by protecting and
defending those Rights and Liberties which
they have enjoy'd under the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> for above 500 Years, and
which some of late do endeavour to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
His most Excellent Majesty is
the Common Indulgent Father of all his
Countries, and hath an equal regard to
the Birth-rights of all his Children; and
will not permit the Eldest, because the
strongest, to encroach upon the Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Younger.</p>
            <p>Here is should be Noted, that by
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> he must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as distinct
from the Kingdom, (although I think
this a very improper way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
which is evident from his
Simile of the Eldest and Youngest
Child, as well as by the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of his Argument; and this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might have serv'd the turn in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48019:25"/>
making his Court to a <hi>Mac Ninny;</hi> or a
Prince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ond of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, but
it looks but like a course Complement
to his Majesty, to entertain him with
a meer begging the Question, when he
knows right well, at what a va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
Expence of the Blood and Treasure
of <hi>England,</hi> that Country was so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(under his Glorious Conduct)
reduc'd to its Obedience; and he is
too Just and Generous a Prince to
endure that any Parasite should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, that any acquisition gain'd
at the Expence of great Taxes rais'd
upon the whole Body of his Subjects
of <hi>England,</hi> and even appropriated by
the Parliament for the particular
Uses in which they were to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
can appertain to him in any
propriety distinct and separate from
the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it reasonable for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that his Majesty should believe,
that the <hi>Some</hi> he means, are about
to violate their Rights and Liberties,
without clearer Proof than any he
hath brought. But it may be worth
Inquiry, to know in what sense he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48019:25"/>
brings <hi>Ireland</hi> in with us for an equal
share of Birth-right, allowing us no
higher Priviledge than that of being
the Elder Child. If he means this
with respect to the <hi>Old Irish,</hi> surely
the many Disturbances they have
given us, and the many Occasions
we have had of reducing them by
force of Arms, may fairly admit us
to some higher Title over them; but
if he means it of the <hi>English</hi> Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
they will certainly own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be descended from <hi>England,</hi>
and it would ill become them to start
up and call their Mother by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Appellation of Sister. What
he hints of encroaching upon their
Possessions, cannot be taken to have
any fair Meaning, unless he intends
thereby to blame us for seizing the
Estates of those that have been in
Rebellion against us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his Preface he tells us,</hi> How
unconcern'd he is in any particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
which at this juncture might
seem to have occasion'd his Discourse.
He hath no concern in Wool or the
Woollen Trade, he is not interested in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48019:26"/>
the Forfeitures or Grants, nor solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
whether the Bishop or Society of
<hi>Derry</hi> recover the Lands they contest
about.</p>
            <p>I believe seven Eighths of those
Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that have been
so busie in soliciting against the
Woollen Manufactury Bill, might
make as fair a Protestation as
this, and yet it seems they thought
themselves concern'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of that Matter; but
his Reach in this, is to shew
his Dislike of the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi>'s medling with the Business
of the Forfeited Estates, as well as
the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He says,</hi> 'Tis a Publick Principle
that hath mov'd him to this Vndertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
he thinks his Cause good, and his
Country concern'd; 'tis hard if they may
not complain, when they think they are
hurt, and give Reasons with all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and Submission: The Great and
Iust Council of <hi>England</hi> freely allow
such Addresses; to receive and hear
Grievances is a great part of their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and to redress them their chief
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48019:26"/>
Glory, but that's not to be done till
they are laid before them, and fairly
stated for their Consideration.</p>
            <p>'Tis yet but a Private Principle, to
become an Advocate for a part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Whole; his Name shews
him to be of <hi>English</hi> Extraction, and
I know none of his Neighbours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that Circumstance, who don't
reckon it a Privilege, that they may
still own <hi>Old England</hi> to be their
Country, and be owned by her,
though they are permitted to live
in <hi>Ireland</hi> if they please; what if they
are not hurt, and the nature of their
Complaint be such, as that it cannot
be thought to be within the Bounds
of Modesty and Submission? how
could he be so fond of his Project, as
to imagine that the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> would freely allow such an
Address, which impeaches their own
just Authority? They will never
think the publishing a Book to the
World, which is little better than
<hi>Sheba</hi>'s Trumpet of Rebellion, to be
a fair way of stating Grievances;
but that 'tis a part of their Business
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48019:27"/>
and their Glory, when they think
it worth their while, to call such
Authors to account for their Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>I begin now with his Book, which
as near as possible I shall follow in
order, and for the Authorities which
he hath quoted, I shall leave them
to him very little disturb'd, but take
them as he gives them, whether they
are right or wrong, only making
such Observations as may result there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
or from his own Reasonings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He begins with a very fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
again to the Parliament of</hi>
England, <hi>and then take upon him
to give them</hi> Due Information in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wherein <hi>(as he says)</hi> another
People are chiefly concern'd;<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> 
               <hi>and tells
them, that</hi> he could never imagine that
such great Assertors of their own, could
ever think of making the least breach
upon the Rights and Liberties of their
<hi>Neighbours,</hi> unless they <hi>thought that
they had Right so to do;</hi> and that they
might well surmise, if these Neighbours
did not expostulate the matter, and this
therefore, seeing <hi>all</hi> others are silent, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48019:27"/>
undertakes to do, (but with the greatest
deferrence imaginable) because he would
not be wanting to his Country, or indeed
to all Mankind, for he argues the cause
of the whole Race of <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 3.</note> Liberty
seeming the Inherent Right of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Now it seems, from Children of the
same Parent, we are become another
People and Neighbours; the <hi>Irish</hi>
may be said to be another People,
though they have not been very
good Neighbours to us sometimes;
but the <hi>English</hi> we may justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to be our own, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People; and we shall hardly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to be our Neighbours in
such a sense, as that we should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
with them in Matters of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
upon the same foot, and
at equal distance with our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of <hi>France, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. If they
expect this from us, I hope they'll
shew us the respect of sending their
Ambassadours to us, and do this
Champion of their Liberties the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to let him be the first. Can
he think the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48019:28"/>
will believe themselves to be civilly
treated by him, because of his fine
Words, when he is Suggesting to
the World as if they acted so unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
in their Councils, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon Surmises, and to take upon
them to do what they do but think
they have a Right to, when indeed
they have none at all. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Manking will ever have a higher
Veneration for those August Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
than to think them as subject
to be mistaken in these Matters, as
one presuming single Gentleman:
But he argues for <hi>Liberty, the right
of all Mankind:</hi> A Glorious Topick
indeed, and worthy of the utmost Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
especially from such great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors
of it as an <hi>English</hi> Parliament:
But if People should ask for more
then ever was their Due, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
a Liberty of acting every thing
they should think for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
thought it were to the Damage
and Injury of others; to grant this
would be an Injustice, and a sinful
Liberty may as well be pleaded for;
such Expostulations as these are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48019:28"/>
and to assume such an
equality with our Superiours as was
never granted us, is an Arrogance
that might rather have been expected
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Irish</hi> than an <hi>English</hi> Man.
And after all this, 'tis not enough for
a Man to say, <hi>If the great Council
of</hi> England <hi>resolve the contrary, he shall
then believe himself to be in an Error,
and with the lowest Submission ask Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for his Assurance; and he hopes he
shall not be hardly censured by them, when
at the same time he declares his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

they resolve for or against:</hi> Such

               </gap>le with the
Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bind up those

            <p>This is certainly a very odd sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Question: What need has
he now to enquire, since he knows
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48019:29"/>
already, how for the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> have thought it reasonable
to intermeddle? Another Blunder as
bad as this, is his Talking of Laws
made in their House: Dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he not
know, that our Laws are not made
without the Concurrence of Two
Houses, and the Assent of the King
also, as the Third Estate? But we
will take his Meaning to be, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
how far it may be reasonable
for the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and join Issue upon
that.</p>
            <p>Next he gives us fix Heads, from
which he undertakes to argue, that
they can have no such power.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> He pretends to give
us the History of the first Expedition
of the <hi>English</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
being to shew, <hi>That the first
Adventurers went over thither</hi> (yet
with the King's License) <hi>upon a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Vndertaking,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>in which they were
successful; but that afterwards, when
King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 2d.<note place="margin">p. 8.</note> 
               <hi>came over with
an Army, the</hi> Irish <hi>generally submitted
to him, and received him to be their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48019:29"/>
King, without making any Opposition,</hi>
from whence he seems to suggest
that <hi>Ireland subjected it self only to the
King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>but not to the Kingdom of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
But he should have consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Government of <hi>England</hi>
was a limited Monarchy, which was
sufficiently acknowledg'd, even by
<hi>William</hi> the <hi>1st.</hi> (commonly call'd
the Conqueror) in his Swearing to
preserve the Liberties and Privileges
of the People at his Coronation, and
confirming the same to them by his
Charter; and though he did indeed
afterwards violate them in a greater
measure than ever they had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or since, yet neither he nor his
Successors did ever take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be absolute Monarchs: The
great Power and Prerogative of an
English King then, can only be due
to them as to the Supream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and Head of the Kingdom, and
not in any seperate propriety annext
to their Persons, as distinct from the
Common-Wealth. If then <hi>Henry</hi> the
Second carried over an Army of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48019:30"/>
as the Army of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for it is held as a Principle with
us, that no King of <hi>England</hi> may raise
any Forces in this Kingdom, but what
are allow'd to be the Forces of the
Kingdom. I am not here arguing
whether ever any King did or did
not take upon him such an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but 'tis sufficient for me to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that he could not by right, and
according to this Authors own way
of arguing, what may not be done
of Right ought not to be argued, or
brought into President; if our Rights
have at at any time been invaded
and usurp'd upon, this Nation hath
had many Opportunities of Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, and we do not believe
that what we enjoy at this day have
been gain'd or Extorted from the
Ancient Authority or Just Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Crown, but that they
are due to us from the first Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and Time immemorial, and
that such Violations which have been
made upon our Constitution, by
means of what was call'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
or otherwise, have been justly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48019:30"/>
retriev'd; so that in respect of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which regard the Right and
Authority of the Kingdom, we may
judge according to what is visible,
and without Controversie admitted
at this day: The Right and Reason
of Things ever were, and ever must
continue to be the same; according
to these Principles then, can it ever
be admitted, that any acquisition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in <hi>Ireland</hi> by an English Army,
under the Conduct of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second, could be appropriated
to the King, distinct from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
We do indeed freequently find
in History, and we practice it no less
in our Common Discourse, that the
Name of the King is us'd by way of
Eminency, to signifie things done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Authority and Conduct as
Head and Chief, when it is never
intended to be applyed to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for if I should say, the King of
<hi>England</hi> took <hi>Namure</hi> in sight of the
<hi>French</hi> Army, every Body would
know that I meant the Confederate
Army, under the Conduct of King
<hi>William</hi> took it: In like manner we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48019:31"/>
say, such a King made such Laws,
when indeed the Parliament made
them: And if it will but be allow'd,
that the <hi>Irish</hi> submitted to King <hi>Henry</hi>
not out of fear to his Person, but for
fear of his Army, I can make no
doubt but that the Submission was
made to him as King, and Head of
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and not as
Duke of <hi>Normandy.</hi> If he should lay
stress upon their Submitting to the
King and his Heirs; that can import
no more than what the Words us'd
at this day, to the King, his Heirs
and Successors, do better explain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Argument is to shew,<note place="margin">p. 12.</note>
               <hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>may not properly be said
to be conquered by</hi> Henry <hi>the Second,
or in any succeeding Rebellion.</hi> I shall
not dispute with him in how many
differing Senses the Word <hi>Conquest</hi>
may be taken, I will grant to him
that <hi>Ireland</hi> was not Conquered by
<hi>Henry 2d.</hi> in such a sense as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
the People, or subject them to
an absolute Power, and yet for all
that, the Word <hi>Conquest</hi> (meaning a
forcible gaining) is much more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicale
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48019:31"/>
to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than to <hi>William</hi> the
First's obtaining the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
he had a pretence, and came
not to Conquer but to Vindicate his
Right; he was encourag'd to come
over, abetted and assisted by a great
Number of the People, who hated <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi>'s
Government; he fought against
<hi>Harold</hi> (who was not generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to by the People as a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King) and his Abettors, but not
against the Body of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
he pursu'd not his Victory like a
Conqueror, but receiv'd the chief of
the People that came to him with
Respect and Friendship; they chose
him for their King, he swore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Laws and Liberties, and
to govern them as their Lawful Prince,
according to their own Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
On the other hand, King
<hi>Henry</hi> had no such Pretence of Right
to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland;</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
was a prrfect Invasion; he was
not call'd in by the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and his Business was nothing else
than to Conquer and Subdue the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48019:32"/>
Kingdom: 'Tis true, the People made
no Opposition, but 'twas because his
Power was dreadful to them; what's
the difference between yielding to
an Invader without fighting, or after
the Battel, more than that one shews
want of Courage, the other of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess?
but are not both alike to the
Gainer, when he hath got his point?
The <hi>Irish</hi> made no Terms for their own
Form of Government, but wholly
abolishing their own, they consented
to receive the English Laws, and
submitted entirely to the English Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which hath always been
esteem'd as one of the greatest Signs
of a Conquest: But if he will be
satisy'd in what sense the People
of that time understood it, let him
but look again into his <hi>Giraldus Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brensis,</hi>
and see how he can translate
the words, <hi>Hibernia Expugnata;</hi> and
what's the Meaning of <hi>Qui firmissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 9.</note>
               <hi>fiidelitatis &amp; subjectionis vinculis,
Domino Regi innodarunt?</hi> But what
may put it out of all doubt, that the
Body of the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> made
an intire Submission to the Kingdom
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48019:32"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> in the Person of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">p. 10.</note> is his own Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
<hi>Omnes Archiepiscopi, Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,
&amp; Abbates totius Hiberniae, recepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
eum in Regem &amp; Dominum Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernieae,
jurantes ei &amp; haeredibus suis
fidelitatem, et regnandi super eos pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statem
in perpetuum, et inde dederunt
ei Chartaes suas, Exemplo autem Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,
praedicti Reges &amp; Principes Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae,
receperunt simili modo, Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
Regem</hi> Angliae <hi>in Dominum &amp;
Regem Hiberniae, et sui devenerunt, et
ei et Haeredibus suis, fidelitatem contra
omnes iuraverunt.</hi> And in another,
<hi>Nec alicujus fere in Insula vel nominis
vel ominis er at qui Regiae Majestati et
debitum Domino Reverentiam, non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiberet.</hi>
And yet after he hath made
these and more such like Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
'tis strange to see the same Man
come and say,<note place="margin">p. 17.</note> 
               <hi>From what forgoes, I
presume it appears that</hi> Ireland <hi>cannot
properly be said so to be Conquered by</hi>
Henry <hi>the Second, as to give the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of</hi> England <hi>any jurisdiction over us.</hi>
He makes out an entire Submission
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48019:33"/>
no Jurisdiction to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England.</hi> Let him shew us
if he can, by what Right a King of
<hi>England</hi> may take to himself a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Dominion over a Country,
brought into Subjection by the help
of an <hi>English</hi> Army, so as that it
shall be no way subjected to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
Authority of <hi>England:</hi>
But such arguing as this, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
render him very Ignorant of
the Constitution of our Government,
(which I believe he would not be
thought) or wilfully guilty of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
an Opinion destructive to the
Rights and Priviledges of the People
of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think him very much out, in
asserting the Rebellions of <hi>Ireland</hi> to
be of the same Nature with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
that have happen'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
However Historians may make
use of the word Rebellion, to please
the Party that's uppermost, yet there's
an easie distinction to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Rebellion and a Civil War;
when two Princes contend for the
Supream Government, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48019:33"/>
are Divided into opposite Parties,
they fight not against the Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Government of the Kingdom, the
Dispute being no more but who hath
most right to be in the supream ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of it: Or if the People
find themselves opprest, and their
Liberties and Properties invaded by
their Prince, and they take up Arms
to restore the Government to its right
Basis; in both these Cases it may most
properly be term'd a Civil War; and
of these kinds have been the Ruptures
in <hi>England</hi> which he instances: But if
People who live in a settled Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
where the Laws made or
consented to by their Ancestors are
in force, and Justice is duely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
shall take up Arms to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn
the Legal Authority plac'd
over them, to overturn the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and assume to themselves Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Priviledges prejudicial to
the Common Good, or to dethrone
a Rightful Prince, who hath go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
justly; this in its very Nature
is a Rebellion. I am not ignorant,
that all contending Parties pretend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48019:34"/>
to be in the right, and that they
take up Arms justly, and none will
own themselves Rebels, unle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s they are
forc'd to it; but yet 'tis evident that
there is a real Right and Wrong in
these things, and there have been
many Instances in which the Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
World could easily judge where
the Right lay. If it be not so, I leave
it to this Gentleman to furnish the
World with some other good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
why the Old <hi>Irish</hi> and Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>English</hi> have been so severely
handled in that Kingdom.</p>

               <note place="margin">p. 18.</note> What Title
Conquest gives by the Law of Nature
and Reason?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath shewn himself
a good Advocate for the <hi>Irish</hi> in what
forgoes, but if he had been a General
in the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, I see not what more

chosen, to stir them up to fight Valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the <hi>English;</hi> than by telling
them,<note place="margin">p. 18.</note> as in effect he doth here, <hi>That the
first Invasion of the</hi> English <hi>upon them
was altogether unjust; that</hi> Henry <hi>the
second was an Agressor and Insulter, who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48019:34"/>
invaded their Nation unjustly, and with

               <hi>If the</hi> Irish <hi>were Conquered,
their Ancestors assisted in Conquering
them, and therefore as they were descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from these Old</hi> English, <hi>they could
never be subjugated or brought under
the Modern</hi> English. This is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his own Discourse,<note place="margin">p. 21.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own Notions of <hi>the
Freedoms and Immunities to which all
Mankind has a Right,</hi> he might have
told them in consequence, that 'twas
their Duty to exert their own Rights
and Liberties, expel the <hi>English</hi> out
of the Nation as Invaders, and make
themselves and their Posterity as free
as any of the rest of the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48019:35"/>
Any one may judge of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Discretion, by his publishing
such Notions as these among the <hi>Irish,</hi>
with whom perhaps they may be
taking, but the People for whom he
designs his Discourse won't be so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
caught with his Sophistry.</p>
            <p>He grants us,<note place="margin">p. 25.</note> that <hi>the Practice of
the World may not come up to the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his Doctrines, but he is inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what Right they have to what they
do practice.</hi> Well we have the World
of our side at least, if after a Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of above 500 Years, we don't
now much trouble our selves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what Right <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> had
to Invade <hi>Ireland</hi> with an <hi>English</hi>
Army. I wish I could find out the
Posterity of those <hi>O</hi>'s or <hi>Mac</hi>'s, that
were heretofore the rightful Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of the Lands which this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
now enjoys in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and which
they never parted with for any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Consideration; only to see,
whether he would so much outdo
the rest of the World, as to practice his
own Principles, and very fairly give
up his Lands to them, as to the right
Heirs at Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48019:35"/>But to Dispute a little with him
about this Matter: The End of all
Government is for the Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
many Nations have been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and conquered for their own
good, and whoever hath been an
Invader that way, hath done them
Right and not Wrong: So did the
<hi>Romans,</hi> Conquer People from under
the Power of Tyrants and Oppressors,
Barbarism and Ignorance, to make
them Members of the best and freest
Government in the World, and to
Civilize them into good Manners and
Useful Arts; and thus is <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's
Invasion of <hi>Ireland</hi> to be justify'd
and commended: He began to rescue
the People from the Oppressions and
Violences of their own wild Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Blood and Rapine to
which they were frequently expos'd,
upon every Quarrel and Invasion of
so many Petty Monarchs, and from
which in process of time they were
totally delivered by the Authority of
<hi>England:</hi> He gave the People the
English Laws, constituted Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the English Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48019:36"/>
to this, by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
they freely submitted, and
doubtless they were convinc'd that
'twas for their Good: But no History
tells us, that he reserv'd not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the State to <hi>England,</hi> and
constant practice all along shews the
contrary.</p>
            <p>His plausible Arguments for the
Liberty and Right of all Mankind;
that Conquests cann't bind Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are wholly misapply'd in
this Case, and he abuses Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi>
or whoever was the Author of that
Excellent Treatise of Government, in
referring to that Book on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
for that Worthy Gentleman
doth therein argue the Case of
People whose just Rights are viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
their Laws subverted, and the
Liberty and Property inherent to
them by the Fundamental Laws of
Nature, (which he very accurately
describes) is invaded and usurp'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that when this is as Evident
and apparent as the Sun that shines
in a clear day, they may then take
the best occasion they can find to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48019:36"/>
right themselves. This is a Doctrine
that all good Men may assent to,
but this is in no wise the Case of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> they did as he owns receive
(and 'twas to their own Advantage)
the English Laws, and swear Fealty
to the King (that is, to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
of <hi>England,</hi> and did reciprocally
receive from him the Priviledge of
being admitted to be free Denizons
of <hi>England,</hi> whereby they evidently
gave up themselves to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into, and become Members of
the English Empire; and to this day
they remain to enjoy the Liberties
and Priviledges of Freemen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
unless there happen to be such
as have forfeited the same according
to the Municipal Laws of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
but he endeavours to
evade the possibility of their Forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by suggesting as if they were
to be considered as a <hi>Different,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
Nation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 23.</note> And therefore, <hi>'Twould
be unreasonable to put the Municipal
Laws of particular Kingdoms in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
between Nation and Nation in
the state of Nature.</hi> If a Nation that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48019:37"/>
once was distinct, consent to imbody
itself into the Government of another
that is more powerful, receive it's
Laws, and submit to its Constitution
without reserve, may they ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be lookt upon as in the state of
Nature, or shall they not rather be
esteem'd as a Member of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Body, and be held to obey all
such Ordinances as are calculated for
the Good and Welfare of the Whole?
If after this, without any Breach made
upon them on the part of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
they shall endeavour to withdraw
themselves from the Subjection they
have sworn to, and shall take up
Arms, and commit Hostilities upon
their Fellow-Subjects, may not this
be called a Rebellion in a settled Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth?
and have not the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws of the whole Empire
brought them under the Forfeiture

separated at a small or greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
by Sea, (as Islands must be)
seperate them from continuing Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Common-Wealth to
which they were once join'd? If
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48019:37"/>
these things are to be brought in

in inquiring into the state of Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Terms that Just or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just

for 'tis not in the Case.</p>
            <p>The Premises considered, methinks,
he should grant us that some of the
Disturbances the <hi>Irish</hi> have given us,
at least the Massacres committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Fellow Subjects, (of our
own Blood) should not be reckon'd
as fair warring between Nation and
Nation; but that they might very
well be accounted as Rebellious; and
then why may not our subduing
them, give us the Title of Rightful
Conquerors over them? and if upon
such delinquencies we had abridg'd
their Posterity in some of those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
granted to their Ancestors,
upon their first coming in to us in
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second's Time, we had
done no more than what he owns
Conquerors commonly do: And yet
we have not put any such hardship
upon the Posterity of those People,
for the fault of their Rebellious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
I know not that any Irishman,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48019:38"/>
               <hi>quatenus</hi> an Irishman, is at this day
deny'd any of the Privileges that an
Englishman can challenge; if he be

               </gap>quent, or a Roman Catholick,
he is us'd no worse than all English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that are in the same Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
If we have slain, executed
or banish'd the Persons of those that
have been actually in Rebellion, and
seiz'd their Estates as forfeited, this
is no more than what he himself
hath taken pains to prove may be
done by the Laws of Nature, or
the Municipal Laws of Kingdoms:
Where's then any room for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
or reason for his Elaborate
Arguments, on a Subject that does
not concern us?</p>
            <p>The Author by saying so much
that directly reflects upon what hath
been acted by the English in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
hath given me the Trouble to say
thus much for the Vindication of
them (and among the rest, I suppose
his own Ancestors) in their Conduct
towards the Irish, and to shew how
well they have kept to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Capitulation on their part: But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48019:39"/>
I cannot end this Head without take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

on his side:</hi> Why should he trouble
the World with Arguments, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
a Position that no Body ever
deny'd. But if the Progeny of the
Old English, that serv'd under <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second in the Conquest of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
have since joyn'd with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Irish in any Rebellion against
their Mother Country, their Crime
is greater than that of the Irish; and
yet would he have us still treat
them as Conquerors of our side, when
they are fighting against us? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this must forfeit all the Regard
that was owing to them for the good
Services of their Ancestors, and justly
entitle them to the same Treatment
that is due to other Rebels. Yet

               <hi>If he or any Body else</hi> (as

I know no body that will deny them
to him, if (as I said before) he be

of Capacity, and qualified as the Law
now requires: He may come here,
and even be a Member of our Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature,
(if he can procure himself
to be chosen) as many others of that

for ever hereafter remember, that
we receive them, and treat them all
as equal Members of the same Body
with our selves; and if it be at any
time requisite for the good of the
whole, that we should Enact any
thing binding upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> we do it
not in respect of their Persons, but
in regard to that part of the Empire
they live in; and if I my self (or
any other Englishman) should think
it for my Interest to become an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant

the Exorbitancy of his Power, he be

not obliged strictly to Observe those

            <p>I have shewn before, that he had

perhaps think me as impertinent in
this Repetition, but I do it to shew
that I have in this abbreviated about
nine of his pages, which offers no
more of Argument to the Matter,
than that <hi>Henry</hi> the Second <hi>settled

               <hi>That all Ranks and Orders of

and I know not what hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd

from them, than that they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to be so governed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 38.</note> It is manifest, that
there were no Laws imposed on the
People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by any Authority of
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> nor any
introduced by <hi>Henry the Second,</hi> but
by the Consent and Allowance of the
People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that both the
Civil and Ecclesiastical State were settled
there, <hi>Regiae Sublimitatis Authoritate;</hi>
not only this, but the manner of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parliaments also, to make Laws of
their own, (which is the Foundation and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48019:41"/>
Bulwark of the Peoples Liberties and
Properties) was directed and established
there by <hi>Henry the Second,</hi> as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
were resolved, that no other Person or
Persons should be the Founders of the
Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> but himself, and
the Consent of the People, who submitted
themselves to him against all Persons
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Was it fit for the King to have
carried a Parliament about with him?
or because he had not a Parliament
there, must it follow therefore, that
their Authority could never have any
concern in what was done? The King
was now abroad with the Forces of
the Kingdom, and 'tis not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
that his own Authority was
not sufficient to make Terms with
the Enemy if they submitted; we
do not pretend that the Power of
our King is limited at that rate, yet
whatever Submission is made to his
Person on such Occasions, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
virtually made as to the Supream
Authority of the Kingdom, and that
I believe every Body will allow to
be in our Constitution, the King,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48019:42"/>
Lords and Commons, in all whom
the Legislature resides, and not in
either separate from the rest. The
King may be said to be vested with
the Power of the whole, in the Civil
and Military Administration of the
Government, and yet whatsoever is
acted or acquired under his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as King of <hi>England,</hi> must doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
be esteemed to be for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Nation, and not in any
Propriety peculiar to himself. To
talk then, <hi>As if the Parliament had
nothing to do in this Transaction, and
that King</hi> Henry the Second <hi>acted in
it as if he were resolv'd that no other
Person or Persons, should be the Founders
of the Government of</hi> Ireland <hi>but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
is Language not becoming an
<hi>Englishman;</hi> and I wonder that this
Author could have so little Sense of
what he was about, when he said
this, for in the very next Paragraph
(but one) he gives us an Instance,
which shews beyond all Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that King <hi>Henry</hi> himself had no
such Opinion of his own Seperate
Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48019:42"/>And now he comes to the Matter,

<hi>and did so continue until the Kingdom
of</hi> England <hi>descended and came unto
King</hi> John, <hi>after the Death of his

about 22 years after his being made
King of</hi> Ireland; <hi>during which time,
and whilst his Father and Brother were
successively reigning in</hi> England, <hi>he made
divers Grants and Charters to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of</hi> Ireland, <hi>wherein he stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
Dominus Hiberniae, <hi>and in some</hi>

<hi>by which Charters both the City

               </gap>ers of our Kings
have at several Times granted out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48019:43"/>
Parcels of their Dominions to their
Sons or Subjects, and endowed them
with many Royal Privileges, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
as Feudatories of the Empire,
after the same manner, so much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
practised in most Kingdoms
of <hi>Europe;</hi> such have been in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> the
Counties Palatine of <hi>Chester, Lancaster</hi>
and <hi>Durham,</hi> and what was much less
considerable than these, the <hi>Isle of Man</hi>
was given with the Title of <hi>King in
Man,</hi> (which was more than King <hi>Iohn</hi>
had) which continues in the Earls of
<hi>Darby</hi> at this day. In like manner also
have Proprietoryships been granted
to the Settlers of Colonies in <hi>America</hi>
in our time; and such and no other
was this Grant of King <hi>Henry the
Second</hi> to his Son <hi>Iohn;</hi> but what is
very remarkable in this Case, is, that
this Grant was made in Parliament.
Did ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man so expose himself in
Print? what he hath been endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to prove, is, that the <hi>Irish</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so conquered by <hi>Henry the Second,</hi>
as to give the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
any Jurisdiction over them, and yet
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48019:43"/>
here he tells us, that this same King
<hi>Henry</hi> created his Son <hi>Iohn</hi> King of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> in a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi>
which to word it in the Stile of
this time, is to say, that about the
twenty third Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi>
an Act of Parliament was made at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> by which <hi>Iohn,</hi> the younger
Son of the said King, was Created
King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Is it possible to
think upon a greater Instance, in
which the Authority of a Parliament
over a People can be exerted, than
this of creating a King to rule them,
and that without ever asking their
Consent? and is it not plain from
this, that King <hi>Henry</hi> himself did
never esteem the Submission of the
<hi>Irish</hi> to have been made to him in
respect of his Person, (according to
this Author's New Doctrine) but
in respect of the Kingdom which he
govern'd? otherwise, why did he
not make a King of <hi>Ireland</hi> by his
own Authority, rather than thus
eclipse his Power and Right, (if he
had it) by submitting it to be done
in Parliament? and I think if I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48019:44"/>
should stop here, and give my self
no further trouble, to trace him
through the rest of his tedious, tho'
shallow Arguments, all impartial Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would be satisfied in these Four
Points, That the ancient <hi>Irish</hi> did
intirely submit their Nation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Member of, and be united
to the <hi>English</hi> Empire; That the
Parliamentary Authority of <hi>England</hi>
hath ever obtain'd over all the parts
of its Dominions; That they have
exercis'd this Authority over <hi>Ireland</hi>
even from its first Union to this
Kingdom; and, That the <hi>Irish</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
their Submission in this sense,
and paid Obedience to this Act of
an <hi>English</hi> Parliament without regret.
But since I have undertaken it, I
must go through with him.</p>
            <p>This Creation however, as barely
mention'd by him, is not Authority
enough for Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
positively,<note place="margin">p. 40.</note> that, <hi>By this Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
Ireland <hi>was most eminently set
apart again,</hi> (he seems then to grant
that 'twas at first united) <hi>as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and distinct Kingdom by it self from
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48019:44"/>
the Kingdom of</hi> England. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
no Record for this, nor any
authentick Authority; what he offers
like Proof for this perfect separate
Regality, is only the granting Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whilst his Father and Brother
were reigning, but that's no more
than what hath been commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd
by other Feudatorys, and proves
nothing of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s having an absolute
independent Jurisdiction. But he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
further, and tells us, <hi>The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
express words of the</hi> Irish <hi>Statute,</hi>

all manner of Kingly Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Preheminence and Authority Royal,
belonging unto the Imperial State and
Majesty of a King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto I have not disputed any
of the Authorities quoted by Mr.
<hi>Molyneux,</hi> but here he must Pardon
me, if I tell him, that if this will
pass for an Authority in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48019:45"/>
it will not with us: 'Tis only an
<hi>Irish</hi> Act of Parliament, made as late
as <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s time, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
that K. <hi>Iohn</hi> did enjoy all
manner of Kingly Jurisdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
without referring to any Record that
was extant for proving that Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
So that this <hi>Irish</hi> Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is at most but a Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Authority, and therefore he
ought not to think that we can be
so far impos'd upon, as without bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Proof than so saying, to grant
that King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and King
<hi>Richard</hi> the first, disclaim'd all Title
to the Dominion and Regality of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> as if the same had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
without any reservation,
vested in King <hi>Iohn:</hi> Besides, even
this Act of Parliament does not use
the words <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Independent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, though none of
these Proofs will stand good on Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi>'s side, I'le shew him, that

               </gap>hat King <hi>Iohn</hi> could

Lord, as I have said before. Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi> hath told us, that King
<hi>Iohn</hi> in his Charters could not use
any higher stile than that of Lord
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> can any Body believe, that
a Prince <hi>wholly and seperately vested in
a Dominion and Regality,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 41.</note> 
               <hi>absolutely
granted unto him without any Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
(as he says King <hi>Iohn</hi> was)
would content himself with any lower
Title than that of King, unless he
had been limited in it by a Superiour
Authority? and was not that like to
be this Act of Parliament? Can an
Act of Parliament be said to make
a King absolute and Indedendent,
when at the same time it keeps a
reservation of the Title? Is not this
an Evident Demonstration, that they
would not suffer him to be Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but that they laid that restraint
upon him, to shew, that they would
always retain in <hi>England</hi> the Supream
Imperial Power over <hi>Ireland?</hi> How
does Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> know what Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
Rent, or other Reservations
were made? doubtless all the Records
touching it are lost, and I presume,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48019:46"/>
he has nothing stronger for this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Assertion of his than the Old
Historians, <hi>Gir. Cambrensis, Rog. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veden,
Mat. Paris,</hi> &amp;c. and they don't
make out this Absolute Independent
Title, without any manner of Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
Is it Sense, to think that a
People should conquer, or intirely
subdue a Countrey to themselves,
plant a Colony there, and then but
five years after give it clear away
again, never to have any thing more
to do with it? I would fain know
what <hi>Regalia</hi> were granted to this
absolute King: The Kings in <hi>Man</hi>
may wear a Leaden Crown, I'm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
King <hi>Iohn</hi> was still but a Lord
in that respect too, and that he had
no Crown at all given him, else sure
Mr. <hi>Molyneux,</hi> if he could have found
any, would have told us on't. But
what's worse than all this, is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for one and the same Man to
be both an Independent King and a
Subject, at one and the same time?
It seems this Donation was not so
absolute, but that he was still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
a Subject (as indeed Feudato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48019:46"/>
must to the Sovereignty to which
they belong) to Old <hi>England,</hi> and
after all his absolute Kingship, 'twas
his Misfortune to be try'd by his
Peers, (not as King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but)
as Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> who found him
guilty of High Treason, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he was condemn'd, but at
the Intercession of the Queen their
Mother, King <hi>Richard</hi> gave him his
Life. I doubt this was enough to
loose his Independent Title to the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> for that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
unless Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> can find him out
another Creation, which I believe
could not be without another Act
of Parliament; but there happen'd
to be no need on't, for as he succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Crown of <hi>England, Ireland</hi>
came in again well enough in our
Sense. Yet further to put this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of all doubt, 'tis a Maxim
not to be disputed, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which grants, must always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
Superiour to that which receives
the Grant, and therefore the Feudal
Law determines that Homage and
Fealty is inseparably annext to all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48019:47"/>
such Grants: And though Mr. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux</hi>
professes himself very well
Learn'd in <hi>The Laws of Nature, and
Reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 117.</note> 
               <hi>and Nations, and the Civil
Laws of our Common-wealths,</hi> yet it
seems he is altogether unacquainted
with this Feudal Law; and if he
had been but as well read in the
Practice of the World as to these
things, he might have been convinc'd,
that the many Feudatory Princes still
remaining in <hi>Europe,</hi> are not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this Dependance: The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Hans Towns of the Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if they are by length of Time grown
up to a higher degree of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and do not so immediately depend
upon the Emperour, who in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Capacity was but Arch-Duke
of <hi>Austria,</hi> &amp;c. and but one of the
Eight Electoral Princes, yet they are
still subject to the Supream Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Empire, and the Imperial
<hi>Avacatoria</hi> reaches them: And thus
we see, that how great soever that
Jurisdiction was, which the King in
Parliament granted to his Son <hi>Iohn,</hi>
he yet remain'd no more than a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48019:47"/>
of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and
was treated accordingly, in his being
Try'd and Condemn'd by the Laws
thereof. Moreover it may be noted,
that upon his accession to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> whatever
Feudatory Royalty he had before,
became now merg'd and extinguisht
in his own Person, which by reason
of it's being Head and Supream, could
not at the same time be capable of
any Feudatory Subjection; so that
there was an absolute determination
of the Former Grant, which could
not ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in be reviv'd but by a New
Donation upon another Person. I
hope I have now so far remov'd this
main Pillar of Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that I may take the Liberty
as often as I shall have Occasion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
to deny positively, that King
<hi>Iohn</hi> was ever made absolute King of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> without any Dependance on
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> had brought
his Argument up to a pitch, and
concluded us under a perfect real
Seperation, and thus he puts it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48019:48"/>
us;<note place="margin">p. 42.</note> let us suppose, <hi>That King</hi>
Richard <hi>had left Issue, whose Progeny
had governed</hi> England, <hi>and King</hi> John<hi>'s
Progeny had governed</hi> Ireland, <hi>where
then had been the Subordination of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>to the Parliament, or even to the
King of</hi> England? <hi>Certainly no such
thing could have been then pretended.</hi>
But this is but a Supposition, and
fit for none but People of his size;
who take up Matters by Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Presumptions, and assume
the Confidence from thence to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
in their Assertions, giving no
allowance for the possibility of being
mistaken: But we need not suppose
in this matter, but may be confident,
that the Supream Authority over
<hi>Ireland</hi> must always have continued
in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as it
does at this day, and he hath made
nothing appear to the contrary. <hi>De
non apparentibus, &amp; non existentibus,
eadem est ratio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I cann't but remark how he
enjoys himself in this Supposition,
when he thought he had gain'd his
Point;<note place="margin">p. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Where then had been the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48019:48"/>
if any such there be, it
must arise from something that followed
after the descent of</hi> England <hi>to King</hi>
John; <hi>for by that descent</hi> England
<hi>might as properly be subordinate to</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>as the Converse, because</hi> Ireland
<hi>had been vested in King</hi> John <hi>twenty
two Years before his accession to the
Crown of</hi> England; <hi>Yes, and 'twas the
ancienter Kingdom too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it likely that King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who
had not before thought so well of
his Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> as to make
it his residence, but chose rather to
remain where he was but a Subject,
when he was now become a real
King of <hi>England,</hi> should be so far
taken with the Fancy of the ancientest
Kingdom, (if it were so) as to put
the greater, and by many degrees
the more powerful, more pleasant,
and more civiliz'd Kingdom, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to the less, which was then
of no Power or Consideration in
the World? and that he should be
better pleas'd with the Stile of Lord
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and King of <hi>England,</hi> than
that of King of <hi>England,</hi> and Lord
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48019:49"/>
of <hi>Ireland?</hi> or is it likely, that
<hi>England</hi> who in that very Age had
subdued <hi>Ireland,</hi> and added it to its
Empire, should now be contented to
submit it self, and become subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> so as that the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Government there
should direct the grand Affairs of
<hi>England?</hi> is not this perfect Jesting
and Fooling with Argument?</p>
            <p>But he tells us,<note place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>If perhaps it will
be said, that this Subordination of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>to</hi> England, <hi>proceeds from</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>'s
being annext to, and as it were
united with the imperial Crown of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>by several Acts of Parliament in
both Kingdoms, since King</hi> John<hi>'s time:</hi>
This is well acknowledged, for it
makes out clearly, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is a
Kingdom as firmly united to the
Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of both Kingdoms could do it:
If he would yet distinguish between
the Imperial Crown (as his words
are) and the Kingdom, I have shewn
before how there cannot be any such
distinction in <hi>England.</hi> But though
in the former Passage of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s being
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48019:49"/>
created an Independent King by Act
of Parliament, he shews himself to
be quite overseen and blinded, by his
depending so much upon it through
the rest of his Argument; yet he
perceives plainly, that a fair Inquiry
into this Annexing, will not turn to
account for him, and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he is not wanting to be very
particular and exact in his Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Quotations of other Authorities,
yet here he is cautious of imparting
any further Light into this matter,
than just to tell us, there are several
such Acts of Parliament both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Surely these <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Acts might be said to be binding
upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore too they
must be conceal'd, and we shan't have
one Word of them anon, when he
pretends to reckon up all those Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
that the English Parliaments
have made to affect <hi>Ireland:</hi> And I
cann't find that he meddles with it
any more,<note place="margin">p. 44.</note> tho' he says, that <hi>He shall
enquire more fully hereafter how this
operates:</hi> But for the present he only
tells us, <hi>That he conceives little more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48019:50"/>
is effected by these Statutes, than that</hi>
Ireland <hi>shall not be alien'd or seperated
from the King of</hi> England, <hi>who cann't
hereby dispose of it otherwise than in
Legal Succession along with</hi> England;
<hi>and that whoever is King of</hi> England,
<hi>is</hi> ipso Facto <hi>King of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and
the Subjects of</hi> Ireland <hi>are oblig'd to
obey,</hi> &amp;c. Doth not this strongly
assert the Parliamentary Authority?
If he had said, that it should not be
alienated or separated from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he had spoken English, and set
the matter right; but if he will insist
upon so fine a Conceit, as to divide
between the Political Capacity of the
King, and the Kingdom, if it be not
bad English, is however Language
that cann't be understood in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now he tells us of King <hi>Iohn's going
again into</hi> Ireland,<note place="margin">p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>about the Twelfth year
of his Reign of</hi> England, <hi>where above
Twenty little</hi> Irish <hi>Kings did again do
Homage and Fealty to him, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
the</hi> English <hi>Laws and Cust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s
among them, placing Sheriffs and other
Ministers, for the Administration of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48019:50"/>
to the People, according to the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<hi>Laws.</hi> This is a further Proof of
the intire Resignation and Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Irish</hi> to the Government of
<hi>England.</hi> He goes on, <hi>King</hi> Henry
<hi>the Third,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>his</hi> (King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s) <hi>Son,
in the first year of his Reign, granted
to</hi> Ireland <hi>one or two</hi> Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's,<note place="margin">p. 46.</note>
(but he owns that 'twas) <hi>by
the Advice of his</hi> English <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>
Let it again be Observ'd, that
this King did not transact this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by any seperate Authority, but
did it in his Privy Council, which is
exactly according to our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that being the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in which all the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England</hi> was directed, it
shews that those Kings govern'd <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in no other Manner than as a
Member of the <hi>English</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>We agree with him, that all the
Rights and Liberties of <hi>English-men</hi>
were granted to the People of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that they had the Privilege of
holding Parliaments, and in short,
that they had a Compleat Jurisdiction
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48019:51"/>
and Form of Government settled and
allow'd to be exercis'd among them,
as far as was requisite for the well-governing
and regulating the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Management of the affairs of
so considerable a People, that were
now become a Member of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Empire, and were seperated by
Sea from the Seat of the Supream
Government: Yet all this must be
understood to be no otherwise than
in Subordination to the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>England,</hi> which is Evident,
not only from the Reason of the
thing, but also from the Practice that
hath always been Observ'd. Can it
consist with Reason to believe, that
any powerful Government should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
another Nation much inferiour
to them in strength, place a Colony
of their own people among them,
make them Denizons and endow
them in all the Privileges of their
own Subjects, and yet because they
gave them their Laws, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the very same Manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
among them as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
by themselves, that therefore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48019:51"/>
they could not be in any Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Kingdom that thus far
subdu'd and settled them, but must
ever after be esteem'd as a People
fixt upon a distinct Foundation, and
as much seperated from them as they
were in the state of Nature? Sure
this is too absurd to be insisted on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But the constant practice which hath
been us'd in the Administration of
that Government, from the first times
of their becoming a Member of our
Empire, shews that the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
did never treat them as a Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their own, and distinct from the
Jurisdiction of this Kingdom; were
not these <hi>Magna Charta's</hi> (as his own
Authorities prove) given with the
Advice of the Privy Council of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
and have they not always had
Governours sent them from hence,
whether under the Title of Lords
Lieutenants, Deputies, Justices, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents
or otherwise, and that not
by the King alone, but nominated
in the Privy-Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncil? and have not
these Governours been accountable
to our Parliaments for any Male-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48019:52"/>
there. All the prime
Motions and Supream Managements
of their Government, are likewise
consulted and directed by the King
in his Privy-Council here, such as
the Calling, Proroguing, or Dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Parliaments, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
all their Acts, the Sending
over and Establishing what English
Forces shall be kept there, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
all Officers Military and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is this like a Separate King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
an Independent Government,
or a Neighbour Nation as free as in
the State of Nature? Can any Man be
so ignorant as to maintain, that the
Privy-Council of <hi>England</hi> may have
Authority, where the Supream Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature,
the Parliament, hath none?
Doth this leave room to say, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 55.</note> 
               <hi>though govern'd under
one and the same Supream Head, yet are
as seperate and distinct in their jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as are the Kingdom of</hi> England
<hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>at this day?</hi> The Privy-Council
of <hi>England</hi> never intermeddle
in the Business of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the King
transacts the affairs of that Kingdom
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48019:52"/>
through the Hands of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries,
who always attend him in
<hi>England;</hi> the Royal Family of the
<hi>Stuarts</hi> were their Lawful Kings, and
when our King <hi>Iames</hi> the First suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
as Right Heir to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> although he remov'd
his Residence hither, because this was
the much more Considerable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
yet no alteration could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be made upon their Jurisdiction,
but the Constitution of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
remain'd as entire within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as before; but this Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath sufficiently made out, that
the Accession of <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>England</hi>
was in such a manner, as totally abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
their former Constitution, (if
they had any) and subjected them
to become a Member of the English
Monarchy.</p>
            <p>I think I have said enough of these
Matters already, to set them in a truer
Light than this Gentleman hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
them, and shall not give
my self the Trouble to Remark di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Passages which result from
the same Erroneous Way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48019:53"/>
nor to meddle with his long
History of what English Laws, and
in what manner they were introduc'd
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> more than to argue
some few Points with him.</p>
            <p>He says,<note place="margin">p. 56.</note> 
               <hi>If we now enquire what
were those Laws of</hi> England <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
thus establisht in</hi> Ireland? <hi>Surely
we must first reckon the great Law of
Parliaments,</hi> &amp;c. Is it not the highest
Sanction of the Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that all the Subjects of the
Empire must obey its Supream De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees?
In receiving then this great
Law of Parliaments, were not the
People of <hi>Ireland</hi> for ever obliged as
well as to all its former Statutes, so
also to whatever it should for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
enact, concerning the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in which they now became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended?
But Mr. <hi>Molyneux means
that Law whereby all Laws receive their
Sanction, The free Debates and Consent
of the People, by themselves, or by their
chosen Representatives.</hi> His drift in
this is to perswade us, that because
it was granted to <hi>Ireland</hi> to hold
a Parliament within themselves, by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48019:53"/>
their own Representatives, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought not to be in any Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi>
wherein they have no Representatives;
and 'tis upon this Point that he mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
values himself in much of his after
Discourse, yet he cann't tye this Knot
so fast, but that it may well enough be
undone: This Parliament of theirs could
not be granted them further than for
the managing their own Affairs among
themselves; but the Supream Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the whole Body must be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and fixt in its Head, according to
the first Constitution, and cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
or granted away to any Member
or Members of the Body: Can any thing
grant away it self? A Father may grant
his Son a great deal of Liberty, but he
can never make any grant to divest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of his paternal Relation. But Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi> can have no Notion of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if a Man may be bound by Laws
whereto he hath not given his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
by either himself or his Chosen
Representative: A little Distinction
now will make us agree this Matter;
'Tis yet no Oppression upon him, if
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48019:54"/>
he neglects to constitute a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
when the Privilege of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is not taken away from him: If
a Man go abroad, and stay many years
out of his own Countrey, shall he
not be bound by the Laws made by
the Community in his absence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he gave no Assent, neither in
his Person nor by his Representative?
In like manner if a Colony be settled
abroad, shall not the Legislature of
their Mother Countrey bind them, if
they think fit to Enact concerning
them, because they had no Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
in it? Yes, very reasonably,
for that they are still Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Community, and if they
are permitted to live abroad for their
Convenience, the main Body of this
their Mother Country must not be
hindred from acting what they shall
find necessary for the Common Good,
because of their absence, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it should respect themselves;
and this without depriving them of
any their Just Rights, because their
Liberty and Privilege still remain'd
to them of choosing their Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48019:54"/>
to the Supream Legislature,
and they might have exercis'd it if
they had stay'd at home, and may
again, whenever they'll please to
come in place. They have indeed
an Authority delegated to them from
the Head, to Enact such Laws in
their Settlement, as may be requisite
for the Circumstance of that place,
but no such Privilege can ever be
extended to rescind and abrogate
their Allegiance and Subjection to
the Head of the Empire: But I shall
come to Enlarge further upon this
by and by. And now to go on with
Mr. <hi>Molyneux:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He speaks of two Acts made by
the Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 64.</note> viz. <hi>10th
Hen. 4.</hi> and <hi>29th. Hen. 6.</hi> wherein
it was Enacted, <hi>That the Statutes made
in</hi> England <hi>should not be of force in
that Kingdom, unless they were allow'd
and published there by Parliament.</hi> It
is not impossible, but that in those
days there might be some People
there who were of this Gentleman's
stamp, for assuming as much power
as they could, right or wrong, if they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48019:55"/>
could but colour it under the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretence of their Ancient Rights
and Privileges; and they might think
the Reigns of those two Princes a
Favourable Conjuncture for such an
Attempt. The first of them got the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> by his Sword, and
manag'd things as smoothly and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
as possible, and perhaps never
thought himself so secure as to exert the
utmost Authority of his Government,
on every Occasion that might offer.
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi> was a weak Prince,
govern'd and manag'd at different
times by the two Factions of <hi>York</hi>
and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> from whence arise Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars, and his own Deposing:
A better time could never happen,
than during the Troublesome Reign
of this King to attempt such Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.
But what if the Parliament
of <hi>Ireland</hi> did enact a Law, derroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from the Authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England,</hi> could this abate
any thing of that Right which <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had before? But 'tis plain, that
if they did any such thing, they did
but think that English Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48019:55"/>
could not in any case bind
<hi>Ireland;</hi> for 'tis certain, both from
the Reason of the thing, and former
Practice, that in some Cases they
might and did, and even in the Second
Year of this King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi>
(as he quotes it) the Staple Act, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
naming <hi>Ireland,</hi> was made;
surely the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
must consist of much more Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Men than the Parliament of
<hi>Ireland</hi> in those days could, and they
were most likely to know best what
they had to do: And it seems as if
the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> themselves had
no Opinion of the Validity of these
invalidating Acts, in Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s
Sense, because they did not plead
them in Bar of the Staple Act, in
the Case of the Merchants of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
which he gives us hereafter.
There is yet much more reason to
believe, that these Statutes were made
on the very Occasion which he hints,
to remove Scruples, or satisfie the
Judges in relation to some Laws for
the administration of Justice that
were extant in <hi>England,</hi> and they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48019:56"/>
might have some doubt, whether
they ought not also to obtain there,
since the generality of the English
Statutes were reciev'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
therefore the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> for
the clearing any such difficulty for the
future, might possibly declare that
such Statutes were not of force there,
'till they had been establisht by them.
And I may easily grant him, that the
End and Intent of the Institution of
a Parliament in <hi>Ireland</hi> was, that as
they were separated from <hi>England</hi> by
the Sea, they should have Authority
to make and adapt Laws among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
suitable to their own Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and fit for the well-ordering
of the Affairs of that Kingdom; and
therefore the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> did
not think fit to impose upon them such
Laws as were from time to time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
suitable to the Occasio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the
Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but left the People of
<hi>Ireland</hi> at Liberty to choose or refuse
such as they thought fit; and from
this Reason it must be, that so many
of the English Statutes as he instances,
have been introduc'd into <hi>Ireland,</hi> by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48019:56"/>
passing them into Laws in their own
Parliament. The generous English
Constitution doth not impose any
Laws of this Nature, or for raising
Taxes upon any of the Subjects of
their Dominions, without their own
Consent by their Representatives;
this is <hi>The Great Charter of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men.</hi>
And because 'twas thought
that the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> could not
conveniently send Representatives to
the Parliament in <hi>Englaand,</hi> they were
therefore authorized to hold Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
among themselves for the tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
such Affairs; we allow it to
all our Colonies in <hi>America;</hi> and
even <hi>Wales,</hi> after their submitting to
the Government of <hi>England,</hi> was not
Taxt, 'till they were admitted to send
their Representatives to Parliament.
This I speak of such Laws which
regard the administration of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative
Justice, regulating their own
particular Affairs, or raising Taxes.
But there is yet a higher kind of Law
inherent in the Constitution, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be call'd the Law of
Parliaments, or the Common Law, I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48019:57"/>
leave it to Men of more Judgment
in these Matters than my self to define
it, but I mean that which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the Subjects of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and must be of Authority to
ordain certain Regulations which shall
be binding upon the Whole in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Cases, where the well-being
of the Universality is concern'd:
<hi>England</hi> must be allow'd to be the
Head of this Empire, from whence
all its Members do derive their Being,
and must depend for their Support
and Protection, the Riches which
she attracts from the Benefit of her
Forreign Trade, is the only means
she hath to support her Power, and
maintain such Fleets and Armies as
are requisite for the Defence of all
her Territories, she must therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
all justifyable Methods for the
preserving her Commerce, and hath
the utmost reason to restrain her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
from any prejudicial interfering
with her in her Trade, because this
hath a direct Tendency to weaken
her Power, and render her incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of supporting the great Charge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48019:57"/>
of her Government: For this end
then, or the like Extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
those Laws have been made
by which the distant Dominions are
bound, and such have been the Acts
of Navigation, the Acts for hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Transportation of Wools from
<hi>Ireland</hi> to Forreign Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
though these Statutes are enacted
when the Occasion requires, yet
they are not so much to be lookt
upon as New Laws, (to use his
own Expression) as it were declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of the Supream Authority, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
inherent in, and inseparably
united to the Imperial Constitution;
and which hath been always exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
by this Kingdom, and all other
Governments that have had Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or Territories lying at a distance
from them. 'Tis only the Exercise
of this Supream Salutary Authority
that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to, and not to break in upon
the Just Constitution so anciently
granted, and ever since continued to
the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of Enacting all
such Laws by their Representatives
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48019:58"/>
in their own Parliaments, as they
think fit to be governed by, or may
be conducive to the well ordering
the Affairs of their own Countrey;
and therefore this Gentleman hath
no Reason to Tax us so often as he
does, with any Attempts upon their
Rights and Properties, breaking in
upon their old Settled Constitution,
and rendring them the most unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
of all his Majesties Subjects,
by weakning their Rights to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
degree than ever was done before.
If <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Law be some Check to
them, 'twas made in favour of the
<hi>English</hi> Interest in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi> finds no fault with it, but
that still leaves them at Liberty to
consent or dissent to such Laws as
the King in his <hi>English</hi> Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
may propose to them. The Rights
that were granted them, were large
enough to secure them in the full
Enjoyment of their Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
in the same Manner as if they
had liv'd in <hi>England;</hi> these we have
preserv'd to them inviolated, in as
large a manner as ever they were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48019:58"/>
granted; let him shew any Law from
<hi>England,</hi> that hath ever innovated upon
their Judicatories, their Persons, or
their Estates; his Exclamations can
no way be applicable to us, unless it
shall appear that we have wronged
them in such Rights as those: But
this Supream Imperial Authority was
never granted to them, nor can reside
any where as long as the Monarchy
lasts, but in the King, House of Lords,
and House of <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>England;</hi>
the absolute Separation he pretends
to in the Persom of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> proves
a Mistake, so that his many peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Conclusions drawn from thence
must fall, as having no Foundation.
The Progeny of <hi>Englishmen</hi> wherever
they live, (and are acknowledg'd to be
such) cannot be exempted from ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Allegiance to this Supream Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction;
'tis known, that it hath
Power to Command its Subjects out
of the Territories of any other Prince,
upon the highest Penalties, yea and
to desert its Colonies, and call home
the People, if Extremity shall so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
He that shall deny it these
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48019:59"/>
Powers, denies the very Essence of a
Supream Government; and how hard
soever this Doctrine may seem to
People that have liv'd out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and have never considered these
Notions, yet the Reason of the thing
must obtain upon every impartial
Man, and convince him, that other
Principles than these, would have a
Tendency to scatter and break to
pieces all Humance Societies, and bring
People back again into the State of
Nature. Men cannot therefore shake
off the Duty and Obedience they
owe to the Community, and say, that
an unbounded Liberty is the Right
of all Mankind, because this Liberty
was given from them when they
were in the Loyns of their Ancestors,
who consented to the Terms of the
Constitution, when they first entred
into Societies, and which must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
as long as that Society shall
have a Being. 'Tis plain then, that
all just Liberty must be bounded by
the Laws and Agreements of the
Community, and no Man ought to
challenge to himself more Liberty
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48019:59"/>
than that allows him. To apply
this then to our Argument: The
People of <hi>England</hi> may not go out
of the Kingdom, and settle themselves
in any other Country, in manner of
a Colony, without leave first obtain'd
of the King, (as Head of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
neither may they enter into
a New Society, and erect a New
Form of Government different from
that of their own Country, in any
such Settlement, but they must have
Directions and Authority from the
King, by his Charters, Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
or Commission, whereby he
grants them the Exercise of the Laws
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Power of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together their own Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
to Enact such further Laws
(not repugnant to the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
as shall be requisite for the
good Government of their Affairs,
in relation to which they are left
to their own Liberty and Free-choice,
and not interrupted by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England:</hi> If after all this,
the King in Parliament shall find
these People or their Posterity, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48019:60"/>
any thing in this Settlement,
which if it be not stopt, must prove
very prejudicial and destructive to
<hi>England:</hi> Will any Man pretend to
argue, that the Kingdom which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
assisted, and protected these
People in their Settlement, hath no
Authority left in her self, to restrain
them in matters that tend to her own
Hurt and Damage? And yet such
Restraint is not to be accounted an
Invading the Rights and Liberties of
Englishmen; 'tis only a limitting them
from acting or doing something in
the Place where they are, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
profitable it might be to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
would yet be very damnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the greater Body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
of which they are a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
neither is this Restraint any
more than in regard to the place, their
Persons are still free, and they may if
they please, return to their own Mother
Country, and practice the same thing
there, with as much Freedom as any
other of their Fellow Subjects. If
the Reader should think I have been
too tedious upon this Point, I hope
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48019:60"/>
he'll consider, that if many Words
be necessary at any time, 'tis then
when we are to perswade People out
of that wherein they believe their
own Interest and Profit greatly consists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I think the Report of the Case

            </p>
            <p>I shall now take the Liberty to
vary somewhat from the Verbal
Translation, and render it in that
sense that I think this Opinion of
the Judges of the Court of <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi>
may be taken: <hi>They say that the
Land of</hi> Ireland <hi>hath a Parliament
within it self, and Courts</hi> (of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<hi>every way like to those in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
<hi>and that they make and Change
Laws by</hi> (the Authority of) <hi>this</hi> (their)
<hi>Parliament, and</hi> (therefore) <hi>the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi>
(which are made to bind) <hi>in</hi>
England, <hi>do not bind them, because they
have no Representatives here,</hi> (in the
Parliament of <hi>England.) But 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be understood, that this</hi> (the
Laws made in the Parliament of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)
must only have relation to that
Country, and to such Matters as are
transacted</hi> (among themselves) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
But they</hi> (the People of <hi>Ireland)
are in their Persons Subjects of the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48019:61"/>
King,</hi> (and Kingdom of <hi>England) and
as Subjects, they shall be oblig'd not to
do any thing out of that Country, against
Statutes,</hi> (made in <hi>England</hi> to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
them) <hi>like as the Inhabitants of</hi>
Calais, Gascony, Guien, <hi>&amp;c. while they
were Subjects; and they shall be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Admiral of</hi> England <hi>in all
things done upon the High Sea: In like
manner also a Writ of Error upon Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given in</hi> Ireland, <hi>lyes from the
Court of King's Bench in</hi> England.
I Confess this Opinion is oddly word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but I shall make no further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon it here, having Occasion
to speak at large to it in another
place, where it will appear, whether
the Sense which I have put upon it,
may not be more agreeable both to
the passage it self, and to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which we shall afterwards find
the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook</hi> gave of
it, than to that turn which Mr. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux</hi>
hath given it. But he Notes
upon it, that upon a second Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this Case before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> the <hi>1st.
Hen. 7. Hussey</hi> the Chief Justice gave
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48019:62"/>
his Opinion,<note place="margin">p. 92.</note> 
               <hi>That the Statutes made
in</hi> England <hi>shall bind those of</hi> Ireland;
<hi>which was not much gain-said by the
other Iudges; notwithstanding that some
of them were of another Opinion the last
Term.</hi> And he is offended at this
Opinion, and suggests as if 'twas <hi>the
Presence of the Chief Iustice that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd
those other Iudges, which had
not been of the same mind:</hi> He Notes
also, <hi>That</hi> Brook <hi>in his Abridging this
Case, makes a Note upon it, intimating
thereby, that</hi> Hussey<hi>'s Opinion was not
reasonable.</hi> Yet this is no more than
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s Construction of this
Intimation; but if he had any such
Scruple, is it strange thing for
Lawyers not to jump in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in some Cases? yet it seems
those that were present with <hi>Hussey,</hi>
and heard the Arguments, were so
far convinc'd as to become of his
Mind, without saying much against
it: But I cann't believe that Judges
were so ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ily to be influenc'd,
contrary to their Judgments, by a
Lord Chief Justice then, more than
now, when we have seen Two of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48019:62"/>
them persist in an Opinion, against
the other Ten. He Comments also
upon the first Opinion in this Case,
and says, that those Judges were not
so concluding upon them as <hi>Hussey,
And they did almost seem to extend the
Iurisdiction of the</hi> English <hi>Parliament
over the Subjects of</hi> Ireland,<note place="margin">p. 93.</note> 
               <hi>only in
relation to their Actions beyond Seas:</hi>
Even this is handle enough for us to
lay hold on, for the doing whatever
we shall think requisite for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of our Commerce. But he
says, <hi>This will appear unreasonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by the same Argument</hi> Scotland
<hi>may be bound by</hi> English <hi>Laws, in relation
to their Forreign Trade, as they are the
King's Subjects.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the King, only as he is King
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and we have no pretence
to meddle in their Government; but
<hi>Ireland</hi> is upon another Foot, 'tis not
an Independent Kingdom; though it
hath a Parliament, it is not compleat
in its own Jurisdiction, but is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to <hi>England,</hi> and they can
transact nothing of weight in their
Administration, without Orders and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48019:63"/>
Directions from the Government of
<hi>England,</hi> all this I think is clearly
made out already. But he makes all
the advantage possible of the words,
<hi>Personae eorum sunt subjecti Regis,</hi> &amp;c.
and tells us, <hi>If being the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>'s
Subjects be a Reason why we ought
to submit to Laws, (in relation to our
Trade abroad) which have not receiv'd
our Assent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 94.</note> 
               <hi>the People of</hi> England <hi>will
consider, whether they also are not the
Kings Subjects, and may therefore (by
this way of Reasoning) be bound by
Laws which the King may assign them,
without their Assent, in relation to their
Actions abroad, or Forreign Trade; Or
whether they had not been subjected to
the King of</hi> France, <hi>if our Kings had
continued in the possession of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and then if</hi> France <hi>had been the
strongest, it might seem that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of</hi> England <hi>might have been bound
by Laws made at</hi> Paris, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What
a parcel of Argument is here? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
so much on't only to expose it.
'Tis evident, that the Judges in their
Opinion, by the Words <hi>Subjecti Regis,</hi>
mean the same thing, as if they had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48019:63"/>
said Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
for they say afterwards, that
while they are Subjects, they shall
be under the Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.
If they had said the King's Admiral,
could we have thought of any other
than the Admiral of the Kingdom?
Having Noted this Distinction, I will
say no more to the rest.</p>
            <p>He tells us,<note place="margin">p. 96.</note> that <hi>In the Reigns of</hi>
Edward <hi>the</hi> First, <hi>and</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi>
Third, <hi>Knights, Citizens and Burgesses,
were chosen in</hi> Ireland, <hi>to serve in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in</hi> England, <hi>and that they have
so served.</hi> What? and could <hi>Ireland</hi>
be then a distinct and separate King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
Surely our Ancestors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would
scarcely then have admitted them to
sit together with themselves in their
Grand Senate. I hope after this, what
I have before alledg'd of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
been always in the Condition of
a Member of the <hi>English</hi> Empire,
ever since its first accession, will never
more be doubted: They have been,
when the Circumstance of Time hath
made it convenient, admitted to send
Representatives to the <hi>English</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48019:64"/>
and may again, if our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
think fit.</p>
            <p>He admits of the <hi>Acts made in the</hi>

               <hi>of King</hi> Charles <hi>the First, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging

were made for their Good; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
when the Acts of Settlements were
made by the</hi> Irish <hi>Parliaments, these</hi>
English <hi>Acts were made of no force, which
shews that they have a power of repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such Acts made in</hi> England. From
hence 'tis apparent, that our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have not been ready to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
this Authority, but when the
Welfare of the Whole Body requir'd
it, and that they were then contented
to take no Notice of such Alterations
made by them, which might be needful
and of use to them, and he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

to them in this respect: But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
these <hi>English</hi> Acts were not

               </gap>st pretended to so much Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
but I hope the Body of the

Duty, and their own Interest better,
than to <hi>Offer at throwing off the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that the Kingdom of</hi> England

            <p>We are now come to his Fifth
Article,<note place="margin">p. 115.</note> 
               <hi>viz. The Opinion of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Laws, relating to this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
And he begins with the Lord
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48019:65"/>
Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> for whose Name
he bespeaks a great deal of Respect,
although he treats him but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
roughly; but this seems to be the
Gentleman's particular Talent.</p>
            <p>He says, the Lord Chief Justice
<hi>Cook</hi> quotes many Authorities to prove
that <hi>Ireland is a Dominion divided and
separated from</hi> England,<note place="margin">p. 116.</note> and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
the fore-mentioned Case of
the Merchants of <hi>Waterford,</hi> but he
finds fault with him for citing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully
and brokenly. The Chief
Justice doth indeed abridge it, (and
it seems by the alteration of the Words
as if he had cited it by Head, not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
it out of the Book) which is
a thing not unusual, nor to be esteem'd
a fault in such Authors, if they give
the passage its due weight, and that
I think he does, as to the matter for
which he quotes it; but what he
especially blames, is, that the Chief
Justice upon the Words of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<hi>That the Statutes of</hi> England
<hi>don't bind them,</hi> (Ireland) <hi>adds in a
Parenthesis, (which is to be understood,
unless they be specially named)</hi> and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48019:66"/>
that <hi>Herein he concludes magisterially,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 117.</note>
               <hi>so it must be, this is my definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
without giving any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not unusual for Men of this
Judges Authority, when they Note
their Opinion transiently, not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
upon it; if that be not the Point
they are directly handling, yet Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi> confesses,<note place="margin">p. 117.</note> that <hi>In another
place he gives this Assertion a Colour
of Reason, by saying, That tho'</hi> Ireland
<hi>be a distinct Dominion from</hi> England,
<hi>yet the Title thereof being by Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quest,
the same by Iudgment of Law, migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
by express Words be bound by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of</hi> England. But this doth
but make the Matter worse with
him: <hi>He hath before enquired how far
Conquest gives a Title: But he would
fain know what Lord</hi> Cook <hi>means by
<hi>Iudgment of Law;</hi> whether the Law
of Nature, and Reason, or Nations; or
the Civil Laws of our Common-wealths,
in none of which senses, he conceives,
will he or any man be ever able to make
out his Position.</hi> And now he gallops
away with this, that there's no stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48019:66"/>
him for two or three pages,
bespattering the Chief Justice all the
way; and though there is a great
deal of his sort of Reasoning in it,
yet I think it not worth the Readers
Trouble to repeat more of it, than
<hi>That he conceives my Lord Chief Iustice</hi>
Cook <hi>to have applyed himself so wholly to
the Study of the Common Laws of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">p. 119.</note>
               <hi>that he did not much enquire into the
Laws of Nature and Nations, else sure he
could not have been guilty of so Erroneous
a Slip.</hi> Nay, <hi>This Assertion of his is
directly contrary to the whole Tenour of
the Case he cites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 120.</note> 
               <hi>for that very Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
on which the Iudges debated,
and which they deemed not to be of force
in</hi> Ireland, <hi>does particularly name</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>so that here again Lord</hi> Cook<hi>'s
Error appears most plainly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, if he'll be but a little Cool,
we may deal well enough with
him in this Matter too, wherein
he thinks he hath so much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
But now after all Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>'s
Inquiries, he hath not said
enough to Convince me, that the
Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook</hi> is in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48019:67"/>
wrong, to believe that <hi>England</hi> hath
a Title to <hi>Ireland</hi> by Conquest:
Nay, I do believe further of the
Chief Justice's side, that that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
hath given her so just a Title
to all that Supream Authority which
she pretends to hold over <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
that by Judgment (or in Reason)
of Law, her Parliaments may bind
<hi>Ireland,</hi> if nam'd in the Law, and
that she is warranted therein by the
Laws of Nature, Reason, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(the Civil Laws of particular
Common-wealths I don't understand)
and also by the Fundamental Laws
of the Original Constitution of the
<hi>English</hi> Government, and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
endeavoured to make out this
Position so clearly, that I shall say
no more to it here, but leave the
Matter referr'd to the Reader's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Censure which he passes
upon so venerable a Person as the
Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> that he must
be very little acquainted with the
Laws of Nature and Nations, should
methinks but ill become a Writer so
little known in the World as Mr.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48019:67"/>
               <hi>Molyneux,</hi> especially when in this
first Essay of his he hath discovered
much more of his Assurance than
Judgment. But now to Vindicate
the Chief Justice from the gross Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
with which he Charges him,
we must look back again upon the
Opinion of the Judges in the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer-Chamber,</hi>
as he hath deliver'd it
in <hi>Page</hi> 90, 91. They were Consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whether the Staple-Act, made in
<hi>England,</hi> could bind the People of
<hi>Ireland;</hi> they argue after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>Ireland hath a Parliament of its
own, which makes Law's for the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Matters among themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Statutes made in</hi> England <hi>don't
bind them;</hi> by which they must mean
such Statutes which are made in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Terms, and for the particular Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of <hi>England;</hi> for 'tis plain, that
what they intend when they say, that
<hi>The People of</hi> Ireland, <hi>as Subjects of the
King, are oblig'd to act nothing out
of that Country against the Statutes,</hi> is,
of such English Statutes as name <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
for the Subject of their Debate
was about a Statute wherein <hi>Ireland</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48019:68"/>
was named. These Judges of the
Exchequer do here make two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
that seem contradictory:
First, They say our Laws don't bind
them, but that is in respect of things
transacted within themselves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> don't
meddle; but then in the Second Place,
They say, our Statutes did bind the
People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in Matters not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to what was done within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and therefore they Concluded
that this Statute did, because they
were particularly named, else there
had been no such Dispute about it,
and this reconciles both these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.
Soon afterwards (as is
aforesaid) when this Cause came to
have a Second Hearing before the
Judges in the Exchequer Chamber,
the Chief Justice <hi>Hussey</hi> declar'd, <hi>That
the Statutes made in</hi> England <hi>shall bind
those of</hi> Ireland, <hi>to which the other
Iudges agreed, without saying much against
it:</hi> But doubtless this Opinion is to
be understood of such Statutes only
which name <hi>Ireland;</hi> and as to this
Statute they all agree, that it had its full
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48019:68"/>
Effect upon the People of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
Where then is this Erroneous Slip
of the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook?</hi> In
repeating the Words of the first Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that <hi>Our Statutes don't bind them,</hi>
he Notes in a Parenthesis the Tenour
of the latter Opinion, (<hi>unless they
be especially named<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;)</hi> this is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but agreeable to both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Opinions, how then doth he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from them? indeed the first Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
says only, that they should be
obliged in matters done out of that
Country: But <hi>Hussey</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> take no
Notice of this Distinction, but give
their Opinion somewhat more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
<hi>Cook</hi> infers, that if <hi>Ireland</hi> be
specially named, our Statutes do bind
them, which still is not contrary to
the Case which he cites, for that entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agrees with him, excepting only in
this difference, he infers that <hi>Ireland</hi>
is bound, that asserts that the People
of <hi>Ireland</hi> as Subjects of the King are
bound, the Case stands stated alike
to both, 'tis <hi>if they are named</hi> in an
English Statute. If this Distinction
will do Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> any good, let
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48019:69"/>
him enjoy it, for me it sufficeth, if
I have shewn that the Lord Chief
Justice <hi>Cook's</hi> Assertion is not directly
contrary to the whole Tenour of the
Case which he hath cited: He Notes,
that the English Statutes don't bind
<hi>Ireland,</hi> unless they are specially na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
this Case shews, that because
<hi>Ireland</hi> was named in it, those Judges
were of the Opinion, that the People
of <hi>Ireland</hi> as Subjects were oblig'd
to pay Obedience to this Staple Act,
as far as it required; I see therefore no
contrariety to it in this his Assertion,
but a great deal in that of Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux,</hi>
where he says, <hi>'Twas the Vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Opinion of all the Iudges then in the
Exchequer Chamber,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 120.</note> 
               <hi>That within the
Land of</hi> Ireland <hi>the Parliaments of</hi>
England <hi>have no Iurisdiction, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may have over the Subjects
of</hi> Ireland <hi>on the open Seas.</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to the Words of the Opinion,
whether it denies, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England</hi> hath any (<hi>manner
of</hi>) Jurisdiction within the Land of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> there's nothing in it so positive;
if it says, that <hi>Ireland</hi> hath a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48019:69"/>
within it self, it Notes also, that
'tis only for ordering of Matters fit
to be transacted among themselves:
If it says, that the Statutes in <hi>England</hi>
don't bind them, because they have
no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Representatives there, it may
well be understood of such Statutes
that are directed for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Occasions of <hi>England,</hi> wherein
<hi>Ireland</hi> is not named; it doth not in
the least offer at the denying the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the Parliaments of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in naming <hi>Ireland;</hi> for it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
concludes them to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the King, which cannot be
meant in any separate Sense from
the Kingdom, because it says, they
shall be under the Obedience of the
Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and the King
hath no Admiralty or Navy distinct
from the Kingdom: Nay; their quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the lying of a Writ of Error
in the Courts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (after they
had own'd them to have such Courts,
as well as a Parliament, in the very
same manner as those in <hi>England)</hi>
from the King's-Bench in <hi>England,</hi>
could be he here to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48019:70"/>
than to shew that <hi>England</hi> had
Jurisdiction over <hi>Ireland</hi> in some Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and certainly where <hi>England</hi>
has any Authority at all, it cannot
be severed from the Supream Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature.
But since he lays so much
stress upon the Words, <hi>Ad aliquam
rem extra terram illam faciend.</hi> (though
it is to be noted by the way, that
this Deliberation was upon a Statute
respecting only matters to be done
out of the Kingdom) yet I'll do him
all the Reason possible, and if I should
take the Words in the strictest sense
he puts them, and grant that those
Judges at that time had not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Matter further, than to think
that the Jurisdiction of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>England</hi> did not extend to
enact Laws, binding within the Land
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he must yet allow that
Judges are sometimes mistaken in
their Opinions, and we do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their Sentences to have the force
of Laws, as neither will he himself
the Opinions of the Lords Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
<hi>Hussey</hi> and <hi>Cook;</hi> if then the
Reason of the thing, as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48019:70"/>
Practice, be quite otherwise,
(as I hope I have sufficiently shewn
in this Case) we may very warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
conclude this Opinion of these
Judges to be Erroneous, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it in the same sense which Mr.
<hi>Molyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ux</hi> takes it.</p>
            <p>He hath not yet done with the
Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook,</hi> but tells us,
<hi>That this Assertion is likewise incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with himself in o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her parts of
his Works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 121.</note> 
               <hi>where he says, that the Laws
of</hi> England <hi>had been granted to</hi> Ireland,
<hi>and thereby</hi> Ireland <hi>being of its self a
distinct Dominion, and no part of the
Kingdom of</hi> England, <hi>was to have Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
hold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n there as in</hi> England.
The Chief Justice might well say,
that <hi>Ireland</hi> had a distinct Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Parliaments within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
every Body must own it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because of their being divided
from <hi>England</hi> by the Sea, that they
might thereby be enabled to regulate
Matters among themselves as the
Circumstances of Time and Place
should require. May not the City
of <hi>London</hi> be said to have a kind of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48019:71"/>
a distinct Dominion, and a sort of a
Parliament held within themselves,
even after the Pattern of the Grand
Parliament of the Kingdom? the Lord
Mayor, after the manner of the King,
calls and dissolves their Assembly;
the Aldermen (after once Chosen)
have Right of Session for their Lives,
as the House of Lords; the Common
Council-men (resembling the House
of Commons) are chosen Annually
by the Respective Wards, (like the
Counties) all these assemble in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Council, and there Enact Laws
for the good Government of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
which the Grand Parliament
rarely, if ever, controul; and though
their Jurisdiction be much less than
that of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet it is a certain Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
so firmly establisht, as that
it's held that it cannot lawfully be
taken away, or altered, by any Power
in <hi>England,</hi> but the Supream Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature,
and that it must stoop to;
and the same the Lord Chief Justice
<hi>Cook</hi> says of this distinct Dominion
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> that notwithstanding it
hath a Power, Jurisdiction, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48019:71"/>
which is compleat within it
self, yet it must pay Obedience to
the Supream Legislature of <hi>England,</hi>
whenever any Extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
shall make it needful for that
to name it specially; and therefore
the Tenour of his Judgment upon
this whole Matter shews, that by his
terming them no part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> (because they have
such a distinct administration among
themselves) he does not in the least
intend, that they should be lookt
upon so separated, as to be out of all
Reach of the Supream Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>England;</hi> so that in all this
there appears no Inconsistency; he
never asserts what Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes,
that the King and Parliament
in <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Legislature equally as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
as that of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>England,</hi> and it must be very
unaccountable in any one to do so,
who knows that all Irish Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
must be approv'd in the Privy
Council of <hi>England;</hi> I'll warrant him,
they'll take care that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Enact different or contrary Sanctions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 121.</note>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48019:72"/>
so that he need not from this fear
the Consequence of <hi>Ireland</hi>'s <hi>having
two Supreams.</hi> He hath one Touch
more at the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook;</hi>
he quotes him,<note place="margin">p. 122.</note> saying, <hi>If a King hath
a Christian Kingdom by Conquest, (as
King</hi> Henry <hi>the Second had</hi> Ireland)
<hi>after the Laws of</hi> England <hi>had been
given them for the Government of that
Country.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>no succeeding King could
alter the same without Parliament:</hi>
Which by the way seems nothing
contradictory to all that Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>
hath quoted, of what he says
concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> but is a farther
Indication that his Opinion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
steady, that the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England,</hi> and not the King
alone, held the Supream Authority
over <hi>Ireland.</hi> And now he <hi>Hath done
with this Reverend Iudge,</hi> and I am
very glad on't, because I doubt I
have tyr'd my Reader with such an
abundance that I have been forc'd to
say for the Judg's Vindication; but to
make amends, I'll try to divert him
a little, by telling a short Story upon
my self: When I was a Boy, I thought
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48019:72"/>
once that I had espy'd a fault in a
performance of my Master's, and I
had the assurance to tell him on't;
he first fairly convinc'd me, that I had
not taken the thing right, and then
very gravely told me with a bent
Brow, that 'twas more like my
Boyish Confidence to find Faults
where none were, than the Solidity
of his stronger Judgment to commit
such.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Pilkington</hi>'s Case:<note place="margin">p. 122.</note> 
               <hi>The
King first grants a Patent for an Office
in</hi> Ireland, <hi>to be held by</hi> Pilkington <hi>or
his Deputy; but after this, the same
King grants the same Office to</hi> A, <hi>who
who sues for it, and pleads an Act of
Parliament in</hi> Ireland, <hi>that no Person
might execute any Office there but in
his own Person, on pain of Forfeiture;
he proves that</hi> Pilkington <hi>acted by a
Deputy; the Iudges thereupon decide in
favour of</hi> A. What's this to the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi>'s Jurisdiction
over <hi>Ireland?</hi> it shews no more than
that the Judges of <hi>Ireland</hi> were of the
Opinion, that the Kings Letters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
could not over-rule an Irish
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48019:73"/>
Act of Parliament. Indeed he tells
us,<note place="margin">p. 124.</note> that in the Pleadings 'twas offer'd,
<hi>That</hi> Ireland <hi>time out of mind had
been a Land separated and distinct from</hi>
England, <hi>and ruled and governed by its
own Customs, that they could call Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
within themselves,</hi> &amp;c. It seems
two of the five Judges held this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
void, and thô I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
(as it seems they did) about the
Word Prescription, yet 'tis well known,
that what Jurisdiction they had, was
granted them by the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>England,</hi> and I know no
Body denies it them, only we cann't
admit them to strain it, beyond what
was ever intended: It says further,
that <hi>Two of the Iudges affirm'd, and
the other three did not deny, that a

Ireland, <hi>except it be approv'd in

not what we Contest about, I never

Taxes upon any Members of her

            <p>As for the Merchants of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48019:73"/>
Case, we have both said enough
to that already: That of the Prior
of <hi>Lanthony</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> comes next;
<hi>He sues the Prior of</hi> Mollingar <hi>in</hi>
Ireland,<note place="margin">p. 125.</note> 
               <hi>for an Arrear of an Annuity,
and obtains Iudgment against him, both
in the</hi> Common-Pleas <hi>and</hi> Kings-Bench
<hi>in</hi> Ireland; Mollingar <hi>Appeals to the
Parliament in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
both Iudgments; upon this</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
<hi>removes all into the</hi> King's Bench
<hi>in</hi> England, <hi>but that Court would not
meddle in it, as having no Power over
what had pass'd in the Parliament of</hi>
Ireland: <hi>Lastly, He Appeal'd to the
Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>and it does
not appear that they did any thing in
it.</hi> What of all this? The Court of
<hi>King's-Bench</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> although
they had Authority to determine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Matters brought before them by
Writ of Error out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet
they did not believe, they had any
Power over the Parliament of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
Doubtless they were in the
right; but it seems 'twas then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that the <hi>English</hi> Parliament
had, else <hi>Lanthony</hi> had never Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48019:74"/>
but <hi>it does not appear that
they did any thing upon this Appeal,
the Petition only being entered at the
end of the Roll:</hi> Why? that's a plain
Sign, that 'twas the very last thing
of the Session, and the Parliament
was Dissolv'd, Prorogu'd, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
before they could go upon it,
or perhaps the Matter was agreed,
or the Prior's dead before next Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or fifty Reasons more that might
be offer'd against his sleeveless Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion,
<hi>That the Parliament of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>did not think themselves to have
a Right to enquire into this Matter,
because nothing more than the Petition
is found upon Record;</hi> but I'll tell him
a better Reason of our side, 'tis not
probable that they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the Petition, if they did not
believe they had Right to decide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>The next thing is about the Acts
of Recognition, and this he begins
with an ingenious Confession,<note place="margin">p. 127.</note> 
               <hi>That
the Kingdom of</hi> Ireland <hi>is inseparably
annext to the Imperial Crown of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>and the Obligation their Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48019:74"/>
lies under by</hi> Poyning's <hi>Act, makes
this Tye indissoluble:</hi> This is enough
to make out all our Pretensions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; 'tis strange to see a Man
writing a Book against the Natural
Consequences, when yet he so easily
agrees upon the Premises. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown of <hi>England</hi> denotes the
Supream Authority of the Kingdom;
the Material Crown is but a Badge
of this Authority, and is given to
the King, not as his own separate
Propriety, but as an Ensign of the
Authority which he enjoys, as Head
of the Kigdom; if any Body should
steal this Material Crown, and break
it to pieces, as <hi>Bloud</hi> did, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Authority of the King and
Kingdom remains entire and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated:
This Supream Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
resides in the Legislature, which
in our Constitution is inseparably vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the King, Lords, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
there can be no annexing to
the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Supream Imperial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Kingdom; if any Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
shall be annext to this Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48019:75"/>
Crown, it must become a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Empire, otherwise 'tis
no annexing; and because there
can be but one Supream Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
every Member or part of the
Empire must be in some Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that Supream Legislature,
whatsoever other Jurisdiction it may
retain, as necessary to its own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Regulations within it self; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it can be no Member, but
must remain a perfect Body of it self.
I think these are Positions that won't
easily be disprov'd, and we have a
compleat Instance of them in the
Kingdoms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
they stand related to <hi>England; Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is an ancient, distinct, and (saving
the old Pretensions of <hi>England</hi> upon
them) independent Kingdom, hath
an Imperial Crown of its own, worn
by a long Succession of Kings, whose
Posterity came to inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England,</hi> and remove their
Seat hither, yet 'twas not in their
Power to annex the Kingdoms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Joint Consent, so that they
remain an intire Sovereign Kingdom,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48019:75"/>
govern'd according to their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
without any Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>England</hi> to this day; and
therefore in the late Happy Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> had obtain'd the intire possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> they
did not pretend to that of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
'till the States of that Kingdom had
conferr'd it upon them by a free
Election. On the contrary; <hi>Ireland</hi>
(whatever it was anciently) was
no intire Kingdom, when the <hi>English</hi>
first took Possession of it, but divided
into many Jurisdictions, under Petty
Princes; it had never any Diadem
or Ensign of Royalty, that ever I could
hear of; it was entirely subdued, and
brought under the English Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Conquest, (as all Authors,
except Mr. <hi>Molyneux,</hi> agree) it was
brought into the form of a Kingdom,
and afterwards had that Title con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon it, and was endow'd with
Laws, and a Constitution of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the Authority of <hi>England,</hi>
who from the Beginning reserv'd and
exercis'd a Superiority over them; and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48019:76"/>
(Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> being quite mistaken
in the Grant made to King <hi>Iohn</hi>)
it was never separated from being
a Member of the Empire of <hi>England,</hi>
but (even as Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> confesses)
remains annext to it to this day.
The Supream Legislature of <hi>England</hi>
(then in being) presented the Title
of it to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
at the same time with that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
without asking the leave of the
People of <hi>Ireland;</hi> in like manner,
they have proclaim'd all the English
Kings with that Title at their first
Accession, and have, as he owns, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<hi>Ireland</hi> in all Acts of Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.
What if the Parliaments of
<hi>Ireland</hi> have also recogniz'd? 'twas
but to own their Allegiance; our
Kings were as effectually vested in
the Dominion over <hi>Ireland</hi> before,
by the Authority of <hi>England,</hi> and
double doing in such a Case can be
no harm; neither can this be any
Argument to prove,<note place="margin">p. 128.</note> 
               <hi>Their having all
Iurisdiction to an Absolute Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
or that they are not subordinate
to any Legislative Authority on Earth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48019:76"/>Now he tells us,<note place="margin">p. 128.</note> 
               <hi>As the Civil State
of</hi> Ireland <hi>is thus absolute within it
self, likewise so is the Ecclesiastical;</hi>
and just so it is, but that is without
any absoluteness in either. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of the Native <hi>Irish,</hi> and the
Old <hi>English,</hi> were doubtless very
averse to the Establishment of the
Reformed Religion, because they have
continued Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Catholicks ever
since; and yet this Reformation was
begun there by no other Authority,
than an Order of the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in <hi>England,</hi> to the Lord Deputy,
to Cause the Scriptures and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayers to be us'd there in the
<hi>English</hi> Tongue; from whence 'tis
evident, that they did not then think
their own Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction
so absolute, as that they could op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to the Authority of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He quotes a Record out of <hi>Reyley,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 129.</note>
               <hi>That</hi> Edward <hi>the Second, upon a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Parliament at</hi> Westminster,
<hi>had sent his Letters Patents to the
Lord Iustice of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that he should
Order that the</hi> Irish <hi>might enjoy the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48019:77"/>
Laws of</hi> England <hi>concerning Life and
Member:</hi> From whence he infers,
<hi>That the Parliament did not then think,
that they had Iurisdiction in</hi> Ireland,
<hi>otherwise they would have made a Law
themselves to this effect:</hi> Can this be
any more than an Instance of what
I have all along said? that our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
have always been willing
to leave the Peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
much as possible, to the Exercise of
their own Form of Government, in
Matters relating to themselves, and
not to interpose their own Supream
Authority, but upon Extraordinary
Occasions, wherein the Welfare of
the whole was concerned? But can
it be any Argument, that they thought
they had no such Authority, because
they did not think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to use it?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> finds, that the lying
of a Writ of Error from the King's
Bench in <hi>England,</hi> on a Judgment
given in the King's Bench in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
lyes heavy upon him, and therefore
he labours mightily, and turns it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way to get rid on't; first he says,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48019:77"/>
'tis <hi>The Opinion of several Learned in
the Laws of</hi> Ireland,<note place="margin">p. 131.</note> 
               <hi>that this is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on an Act of Parliament in</hi> Ireland
<hi>which is lost.</hi> How Learned soever
this Opinion may be, I am sure 'tis
not very Judiciously offer'd here; for
no Body will believe that the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature
of a Kingdom that thought
it self absolute, could do so foolish a
thing as to make a Law themselves,
that should put them under the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of another Kingdom, in so
high a point as the Controuling all
their Judicatures; and therefore if ever
they made such an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis not to be doubted but that
at that time they were very sensible,
that whatsoever Authority they had
among themselves, was all deriv'd
from, and in perpetual Subordination
to the Supream Authority of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Indeed he comes and says af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">p. 136.</note>
               <hi>That this Suit is made to the King
only, the matter lies altogether before
him, and the Party complaining applyes
to no part of the Political Government
of</hi> England <hi>for Redress, but to the
King of</hi> Ireland <hi>only, who is in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48019:78"/>
               <hi>That the King only is sued to,
the Law books make plain,</hi> &amp;c. for above
two Pages. Fine, very fine spun are
these Arguments, but withal so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light, that they won't hang
together: If the King was ever us'd
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it there in Person, was there not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
four English Judges constituted
in that Court, (whom the King in those
days could not remove at pleasure)
who had Authority to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King were present or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
Or does he think, that when
an Irish Appeal came before them,
these Judges could not meddle in it?
or if they did, whilst the King was
present, they were all on a Suddain
swallowed up, or consubstantiated
into the King? or if they acted in
his absence, an Irish Cause would
immediately transubstantiate them all
four into the real presence of one
King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in his proper Person?
But if this should be too gross to
put upon Mr. <hi>Molyneux,</hi> we must
e'en resolve it t'other way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that he thinks the Judges and
Courts of Judicature are no part of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48019:78"/>
the Political Government of <hi>England:</hi>
He hath abundance of other pretty
Conceits, how and which way this
Business of the Writ of Error might
come about, and in what sense it
may be thought to operate; but I'll
leave him in the quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Ridicule and Disdain than Argument:
He tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 142.</note> There remains another
pretence or two for this Subordination
to be considered; and one is founded on
Purchase: 'Tis said, that vast Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Treasure has been spent by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from time to time, for reducing
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which has given them a just

            <p>I am sorry that he has so little
sense of the great Benefit which the
Protestants of <hi>Ireland</hi> have receiv'd,
by the interposing of the English
Power in their Favour. 'Tis not to
be disputed, that the late King <hi>Iames</hi>
had all the Haereditary Right that
was entail'd upon their Independent
(as he terms him) King <hi>Iohn;</hi> and
although he had Abdicated the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> yet by this Gentleman's
Notions, he had still an undoubted
Title to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
which he came to possess, by the
assistance of a very considerable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48019:80"/>
from <hi>France;</hi> and (if Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>'s
Doctrine be sound) could any
body then blame the <hi>Irish,</hi> and Old
<hi>English,</hi> of his own Religion, to join
with him, in the asserting his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Right to that Kingdom? For my
own part, I must own, that I know
no other Reason that can justifie us
in our engaging in that War, for the
Recovery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than the Old
<hi>English</hi> Principle, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was
our own, as an inseparable Member
of the <hi>English</hi> Empire; and I am
sure, all the <hi>English</hi> Protestants of
<hi>Ireland</hi> were then glad to have us
assert that Right, or else their fair
Estates in that Country must have
left the greatest part of them to go
a Begging at this day, unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they could have reconcil'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by turning Papists; it being
well known, that they were so far
from valuing themselves upon their
own Strength, that (excepting that
Gallant and Resolute Resistance made
by the People of the North, at <hi>London-Derry</hi>
and <hi>Inniskilling</hi>) they gave up
all, and generally (meaning the People
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48019:81"/>
of Note) fled to <hi>England;</hi> (though
many are of the Opinion, that they
might have done more for themselves
than they did, if they had staid:)
Thus were their Estates lost to them,
beyond hopes of Recovery, but by
the strength of <hi>England:</hi> Indeed when
we had sent over an Army, some
of them went back again, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with those that remain'd in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> did expose themselves, and
acted a fair part in the War; yet all
they were able to do, was so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
in regard of the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the War, that I believe
it won't be pretended, that we were
made Masters of <hi>Ireland</hi> one day the

               </gap>ms, Artillery, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
Provision, Shipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
all this have we born, and paid for,
by raising Taxes upon our own Estates,
when we knew they were not able
to Contribute any thing themselves;
and after all this, what of a Man
can have the Impudence to dispute
with us, whether we have any
Right to the forfeited Estates in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48019:81"/>
If the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> hath
no just Jurisdiction over <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
will affirm, that the <hi>Irish</hi> were in no
Rebellion, but were in the Exercise
of the Natural Allegiance, and in
the Discharge of that Duty which
they ow'd to their Lawful King;
there was no Act of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to declare King <hi>Iames</hi> abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Throne vacant, neither
indeed was there any pretence for
it; because he came, and was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
present among them, and in the
full Exercise of his <hi>de facto</hi> Kingly
Power, as to them: But (as I said
before) the People of <hi>England</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Convention (which at
that time was the Representative of
the Nation) conferr'd the Crown of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all other
Territories and Dominions belonging
to the English Empire, upon King
<hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a Member of the
<hi>English</hi> Body, was as much bound
to submit to that Revolution, as <hi>New-England,</hi>
or any of the rest of our
Colonies; and therefore the Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48019:82"/>
made by the <hi>Irish</hi> against it, was
a perfect Rebellion, and render'd them
liable to all the Pains and Penalties
which the Municipal Laws of the
Kingdom could inflict upon Rebels:
This then justly forfeited their Estates
to the King, as he is the Head, but
not as in any separate Capacity from
the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> We know
however, what Authority the King
hath to dispose of these Estates, to
such as may have deserv'd well; and
if the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
therein, that's no Argument
that therefore they have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to intermeddle in that Matter,
and their former practice (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses)
hath shewn the contrary.</p>
            <p>He owns,<note place="margin">p. 143.</note> that <hi>In a War, the Estates
of the Unjust Opposers, should go to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
the Damage that is done; but theirs
do not resemble the Common Case of
Wars between two Forreign Enemies,
but are rather Rebellions, or Intestine
Commotions.</hi> And so we say. But,
he continues, <hi>If the Protestants of</hi>
Ireland, <hi>by the Assistance of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of</hi> England, <hi>and their Purse, do
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48019:82"/>
prove Victorious:</hi> A fine Turn indeed;
the Matter of Fact is, that the Army
of <hi>England</hi> prov'd Victorious, and that
without any thing that might reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
be call'd Assistance from their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
(as he, though somewhat assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly
in this case, calls themselves)
the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and yet
forsooth the Victory must be theirs:
No Man of Modesty, as this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would bespeak himself, could
dare to put upon the World at this
rate. Well, but he tells us,<note place="margin">p. 143.</note> 
               <hi>The
People of</hi> England <hi>ought to be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid;
but then the manner of their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in what way it shall be levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ought to be left to the People of</hi>
Ireland, <hi>in Parliament Assembled.</hi> He
owns the Debt, and that we ought
to be paid, but how, and which way,
and when, ought to be left to them;
a pretty New-fashion'd Priviledge
this Gentleman is inventing for his
Country; provided they own the
Debt, the Creditor must be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without any Security, without
any Terms, and (consequently)
without any Interest, how long so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48019:83"/>
he may be kept out of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
he ought to leave all that to the
Good Will and Pleasure of his Honest
Debtor; but I believe Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>
would be loth to pass for such a Fool,
in his own way of Dealing in the
World, and sure he must measure
us by an <hi>Irish</hi> Understanding, if he
thinks this sort of Reasoning will go
down with us. He goes on, <hi>And so
it was after the Rebellion of</hi> Forty
One; that's a Mistake, (though it
deserves a harder Word) for he tells
us, <hi>The Adventurers had several Acts
of Parliament made in</hi> England <hi>for
their reimbursing, by disposing to them
the Rebels Lands;</hi> so that it was not
then left at the Discretion of the
People of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 144.</note> 
               <hi>But after all, it was
thought reasonable, that the Parliament
of</hi> Ireland <hi>should do this in their own
way, and therefore the Acts of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Explanation made all the
former</hi> English <hi>Acts of no force, or
at least did very much alter them in
many particulars.</hi> Here'tis plain, that
Acts of Parliament were made in
<hi>England,</hi> for disposing the forfeited
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48019:83"/>
Estates of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which were be
liev'd to be of Validity, and a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Security to the Adventurers at
the time when they were made, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
People would not have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
their Money upon them; and
though I am no Lawyer, and don't
think it concerns me to look after
those Acts, yet from the Reason of
the thing, I cann't believe that those
Persons that advanc'd this Money,
could afterwards be legally depriv'd
of the Interests granted them by those
<hi>English</hi> Acts, by any after Authority
of an <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament: If any were,
I would advise them yet to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to an
English Parliament for Relief. 'Tis
true, there had happen'd a Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and perhaps some People that
had those Lands, might be lookt upon
as under Delinquencies to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that then came to be uppermost,
and we know that some of the Irish
Papists were very strangely restor'd
to their Estates, and the Possessors
put out; yet if some Injustice was
done, at such a time when many
things were carried by Extreams,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48019:84"/>
nothing will prove an invalidating
of those English Statutes, less than
either a total Repeal of them, and
that he seems not to stand upon here,
(though he suggested it in another
place;) for he only says, they were
made of no force, or at least were
very much alter'd in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
which is a certain Sign they
were not repeal'd: Or to shew that
they were so altered, as to take away
all the Lands that were possess'd by
any of those Adventurers, or their
Descendents, by Virtue of those Acts
of Parliament: If that cann't be made
out, (which sure he won't pretend
to) it will remain, that those Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Acts of Parliament did really
dispose of the Rebels Lands in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and if there be any after Settling
or Confirming them to the Safety
of the Proprietors, by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that cannot impeach
the Authority of the first Acts.</p>
            <p>Well,<note place="margin">p. 144.</note> he still allows, <hi>That we shall be
repaid our Expences; all they desire, is,
that in preservation of their own Rights
and Liberties, they may do it in their own
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48019:84"/>
Methods, regularly in their own Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And if the Reim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ursment be all
that</hi> England <hi>Stands on, what availeth
it, whether it be done this way or that
way, so it be done?</hi> A pretty loose
way of Talking this; he speaks as
confidently of reimbursing us, as if
that were a small matter, and they
had this way and that way, ways
enough to do it; and they are so
well prepar'd, that they desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but Liberty, to let them
do it in their own methods. I am
sorry we han't heard one word like this
offer'd in their Parliaments, 'twould
have lookt much better from them,
than from Mr. <hi>Molynellx,</hi> to have
taken Notice of this great Debt to
<hi>England,</hi> and to have at least declar'd
their Intent of paying it; but he is
a Member, and perhaps he knows
their Minds better than I do; and
because he proposes so fairly, I am
willing to strike a Bargain with him;
if he'll undertake on the Behalf of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> I'll undertake ont the part of
<hi>England,</hi> that if they are in good
Earnest, willing and able to pay us
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48019:85"/>
his Debt, the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
(and I hope my good Intention in
this matter, will obtain their Pardon
for my presumption) will leave them
intirely at Liberty, to raise it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Methods, as regularly
in their own Parliaments as he desires;
and this being (as he says) all they
ask, let him but publish himself
in Print once more, and engage to
pledge his own Estate (which by the
way he may value the less, by how
much he is indebted to me, and the
rest of the good People of <hi>England,</hi>
for what we have paid to redeem
it) to the Publick, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
I'll engage not only my Estate
(which is somewhat to me, if it be
not so great as his) but my Life
too, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
will assent, to give them what time
they please, for the payment of the
Principal, if they can but give Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for the payment of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
at 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> (though the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>Ireland</hi> is 10) and I believe
I might adventure to promise, that
upon the performance of such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48019:85"/>
they would make him as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
a King of <hi>Ireland</hi> as ever his King
<hi>Iohn</hi> was, and also give him a better
Estate to support that Dignity, than
was given to that Prince. I don't love
Banter, but how can a Man treat such
Discourse otherwise? is it not certain,
that we have expended more Money
(besides the invaluable Blood of our
People) in the Reductions of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
than all the Lands in the possession of
the <hi>English</hi> are worth? and yet we have
been so generous to them, as hitherto
not to ask for one penny of Reimburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from them. But see the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness
of this Gentleman, he hath been
so far overseen, in the saying any thing
that he has Thought could give the least
support to his unreasonable Argument,
as not only to scatter many pernicious
Notions, which the Irish may lay
hold on to the Prejudice of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish;
but here also he hath started a
Thought, that is capable of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
more to the Benefit of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
than to the advantage of his
own Country-men, (as he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es)
the English of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Is there
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48019:86"/>
not Reason, that those who receive
the greatest Benefit by the Publick
Expence, should contribute a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards it? The People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
receive but a distant advantage
by the Reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and yet
they have born the whole Charge;
the Protestants of <hi>Ireland</hi> have receive'd
an immediate Benefit, by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to very great and improving
Estates, and yet they have paid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
the Government of <hi>England</hi>
is extreamly in Debt, and the Taxes
will continue to lye very heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> where
the Means of Sustsistance is much
harder; but <hi>Ireland</hi> is recover'd into
a flourishing Condition, and through
the great Plenty and Cheapness of
Provisions, the People there by a little
abatement of their abundant way of
living, may spare Taxes much more
easily then <hi>England:</hi> What then if the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> should entertain
this Thought of his, and become of his
Opinion, that they ought to be repaid
their Expences; and that the People of
<hi>Ireland</hi> are now in a Condition to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48019:86"/>
something towards it? especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
since they are already become so Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish,
and retain so small a Sense of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for the great Support we have so
lately given them, as that not only
this Gentleman, but others also have
shewn their Readiness to fly at our
Heads, and even threaten us with
the Consequences of their Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for our only offering to Check
their Progress in a Manufacture,
which cannot be carried on there
but to the Ruine of <hi>England:</hi> I say,
if upon these Considerations, and so
extraordinary an occasion, they should
require a Certain Summ from the
People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I know not but
that it may well consist with that
Supream Authority, which (as I
have endeavoured to shew) must be
of the Essence of every Compleat
Empire; and that it would be no Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
upon that Constitution which
was given them, if our Parliament
should be content, <hi>That in preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their own Rights and Liberties,
they may have Liberty to raise it in
their own Methods, regularly in their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48019:87"/>
own Parliaments.</hi> Perhaps Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>
will tell us, that they have a
Negative upon us; but he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put us in mind of an Unlucky
Hank that our Admiralty hath on
them. I doubt the Gentlemen of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
won't be well pleas'd with me
for touching upon this Point, but
they must reflect upon their own
Advocate, but for whom it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come into my Mind; and they
ought not to be offended with me,
for answering him in such a Way
as his own Arguments require: I
never design'd them any ill Office,
and if any advantage should be taken
by this, I am as ready as Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>
himself, for my part in it, with
the lowest Submission to ask their
Pardon.</p>
            <p>What follows next may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
with a
<q>Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens,
cui lumen ademptum.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have an Example of this in
Point between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 144.</note>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:48019:87"/>
the Glorious Revolution under his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Majesty; <hi>Holland</hi> in Assisting <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
expended Six Hundred Thousand
Pounds, and the <hi>English</hi> Parliament
fairly repaid them: It would look oddly,
for <hi>Holland</hi> to have insisted on dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s, and other Estates,
by their own Laws, to reimburse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>An Example in Point; then <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
must once have Conquer'd <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and have ever since retain'd a
Title to this Kingdom, and exercis'd
an Authority over us, in directing
all the Principal Managements of our
Government: Neither can there be
any Semblance of their assisting us at
that time with Six Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pounds; that Assistance was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
wholly on the Credit of their
Stadtholder, the (then) Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and the Assistance we had
was only owing to him, who by
the Success of that Glorious Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
came to be Elected our King;
and then the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
considering, the Inestimable Benefit
<hi>England</hi> had receiv'd by that most
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48019:88"/>
Happy Revolution, thought it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to repay them the full Charge
which the States had advanc'd on
this Account: Besides, if the Fact
had been true, the <hi>Dutch</hi> knew we
were well able to repay them, and
they have had their Money to their
Content, but we knew that the People
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they would have beggar'd
themselves, could never have reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burst
us, and therefore we have not,
and perhaps (then) never intended
to ask them for it: May this be call'd
an Example in point too? After this,
can there be a more Odious Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
than what he infers, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had as much reason to insist
on the disposing Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s and
other Estates, as our Parliament had
to meddle in the matter of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
Estates of <hi>Ireland?</hi> I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
shewn how the Government
of <hi>England</hi> hath a Just Right to the
For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eited Estates in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Dutch</hi> cann't pretend to any
Right to Estates forfeited in <hi>England,</hi>
by our Municipal Laws; and it does
indeed look oddly enough in him, to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48019:88"/>
Controvert this with us, before we
are repaid one Farthing of a vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
greater Expence, and tell us,
here's an Example in Point for us:
Such Treatment as this would raise
the Blood of an Englishman, and
though a fitting Modesty and Regard
to my Reader doth restrain me from
venting the Resentment due to so
great an Indignity put upon the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Nation; yet I hope I may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd
to imprecate upon my self, if
ever I should discover so little Thought,
as to make use of Examples highly
reflecting upon my Superiours, and
yet no way agreeing with the Fact
in hand; may I be Censured for an
Eternal Blockhead, and condemn'd
to wear my Book affixt on my Back,
as a perpetual Badge of my Insolence
and Folly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am weary enough of this Head
of Purchase, and yet I will take the
pains to transcribe the last Paragraph
on't from end to end: He says,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 154.</note> 'Tis
an ungenerous thing to vilify good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I am far from doing it, but with all
possible Gratitude acknowledge the mighty
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48019:89"/>
Benefits <hi>Ireland</hi> has often receiv'd from
<hi>England,</hi> in helping to suppress the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
of this Country; to <hi>England</hi>'s
Charitable Assistance our Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
are owing: But with all humble
Submission, I desire it may be Considered,
whether <hi>England</hi> did not at the same
time propose the preventing of their
own Danger, that would necessarily have
attended our Ruine? if so, 'twas in
some measure their own Battails they
fought, when they fought for <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and a great part of their Expence must
be reckon'd in their own Defence.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> had had a due
sense of what he was saying, he
could never have so solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against the ungenerousness of
Vilifying good Offices, and yet in
the next Breath attribute no more
to <hi>England,</hi> in what she hath done
for them, than just her <hi>helping</hi> to
Suppress the Rebellions: Is not this
Vilifying with a Witness? after we
have Reduc'd <hi>Ireland,</hi> and put them
into the Possession of their Estates,
upon our own proper Cost and
Strength, to have it lessen'd to no
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48019:89"/>
more than a little Lending them a
Hand at a dead lift, and for which
they are very willing to repay us
(in Words)? Why, this is not worth
his acknowledging with all possible
Gratitude, the Mighty Benefits they
have received from <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.
But after all, this Mighty Hodge-Podge
of an Harangue is but to tickle
us into a good Humour, that he may
slyly usher in his Plea in Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Damages, and so pay us all
off with the Flap of a Fox-tail; <hi>It is
to be Considered, whether</hi> England <hi>did
not at the same time prevent their own
Danger, and consequently in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
fight their own Battels:</hi> We have
been pretty well us'd to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Complement from others of
his Countrey men, who have been
apt on all Occasions to reflect upon
us, that 'twas not for their sakes,
but our own, that we reduc'd <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
only Mr. <hi>Molyneux,</hi> like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
gives it us in finer Language:
What if we also have receiv'd some
Advantage by this Reduction? I
should think that a People who had
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48019:90"/>
any due sense of Gratitude, might
remain so well Content with the
great Benefit that accrew'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by the re-enjoyment of the
Estates which they had lost, as not
to upbraid us with any such reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Convenience which we might
draw from it, without Prejudice to
them. Can they think it had been
fit for us to engage in so mighty
an Expence, for no other Reason than
to recover their Estates for them?
Well, suppose we had thought fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fight our own Battails, and
when we had done, to have bridled
the <hi>Irish</hi> by strong Garrisons, and
had no reguard to have restor'd them
to their Estates; perhaps we might
have as well secur'd our own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
that way: However, the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we had for them, (how ill so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
some of them seem to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
it) would not suffer us to use
so Severe a Policy, which yet if we
had practic'd from the beginning,
and kept our own People at home,
would have turn'd to much better
account to us, than if we should at
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48019:90"/>
last be so far overseen, as to suffer a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
of our own to Contest with us for
our Trade. But yet I am for Complying
with Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> in this matter, and
I am content that a part of this Expence,
in proportion to the Benefit <hi>England</hi>
shall be thought to have receiv'd by the
Reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> shall remain upon
our Account; but then I hope the vast
advantage which immediately aocrews
to the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their Lands, and the fair time we
have spar'd them from Contributing
any thing, may be thought justly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
them to the far better part of this
Charge; and if Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> can with
as much Ingenuity find a way to pay
it, as he hath been ready to own it, he
will very much oblige the Government
of <hi>England,</hi> at a time when their own
Occasions do so much want it.</p>
            <p>So much for Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s feign'd
pretence of Purchase, which can be but
an Invention of some such pregnant
Brain as his own; for I never before
heard, that the People of <hi>England</hi> had
set up any pretention for their Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over <hi>Ireland</hi> upon that foot; such
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48019:91"/>
another is that which follows.<note place="margin">p. 145.</note> 
               <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing alledg'd against</hi> Ireland <hi>is
this; If a Forreign Nation, as</hi> France
<hi>or</hi> Spain <hi>for instance, prove prejudicial
to</hi> England <hi>in its Trade, or any other
way;</hi> England, <hi>if it be stronger, redresses
it self by force of Arms, or denouncing
War; and why may not</hi> England, <hi>if</hi>
Ireland <hi>lyes cross their Interests, restrain</hi>
Ireland, <hi>and bind it by Laws, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
these Laws by Force?</hi> He discusses
this Point very gravely, but since no
Body ever thought of making this any
Argument but himself, and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pretended to have so little to do
with them as with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
I'll trouble my self no further about
it, but let it pass for a Meer Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">p. 148.</note> 
               <hi>The last thing
he shall take Notice of, that some raise
against them, is, that</hi> Ireland <hi>is to be
lookt upon as a Colony from</hi> England:
Here he attempts to delude us with
a falacious Argument; but that is
very easily solv'd by an Obvious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
If he would not have <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
lookt upon as a Colony, yet I
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48019:91"/>
believe there can be no Notion of a
Colony clearer, than that the <hi>English</hi>
planted there, are so in the strictest
Sense, and that I shall undertake to
prove anon, although he calls it, <hi>The
most Extravagant of all Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them;</hi> and then without doubt
it must follow, that, <hi>As the</hi> Roman
<hi>Colonies were subject to the Laws made
by the Senate at</hi> Rome, <hi>so ought</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>by those made by the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at</hi> Westminster. I may add, or
any where else, where our Parliament
may sit to Enact Laws. But he would
not have this be thought <hi>To have the
least Foundation or Colour from Reason
or Record; does it not manifestly appear
by the Constitution of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that 'tis
a Compleat Kingdom within it self?</hi> I
say No, 'tis but the Form of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for since 'twas first subdu'd to
<hi>England,</hi> Governours have always
been set over it by <hi>England,</hi> and it
never had Authority of it self to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
a Legislature, but by Directions
from <hi>England.</hi> But now he's resolv'd
he'll confute us, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
stood in the way; <hi>Do not the Kings
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48019:92"/>
of</hi> England <hi>bear the Stile of</hi> Ireland,
(and why did he not mind the Arms
too) <hi>among the rest of their Kingdoms?
Is this agreeable to the Nature of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony?
do they use the Title of Kings of
Virginia, New-England, or Maryland?</hi>
Don't the Great Turk bear the
Title of a great many Kingdoms?
Yes, and some of them have a more
Compleat Dominion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
than ever we gave <hi>Ireland;</hi> are
they therefore all Compleat King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
within themselves? The Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> have so many Titles of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
that they have quite lost the
Knowledge where some of them grow;
they have us'd the Stiles of King of
the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and yet
their acquisitions there have been but
Colonies; <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> are not
Compleat Kingdoms within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
though they have that Title,
yea, and their Governours, have the
Style of Vice-Roys, and that's a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Feather than ever those of <hi>Ireland</hi>
wore, (I should have excepted their
absolute King <hi>Iohn:) The Kings of</hi>
England <hi>have never call'd</hi> Virginia,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48019:92"/>
New-England, <hi>or</hi> Maryland, <hi>by the
Name of Kingdoms;</hi> is there such a
deal of weight in that? The <hi>Potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez</hi>
gave the Style of a Kingdom to
<hi>Goa</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did to <hi>Brazil,</hi> thought it be much
the more Considerable Colony: And
now I think on't, we were once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
making our Dominions in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
into a Vice-Royalty, under the
Duke of <hi>Albermarle,</hi> sure then they
must have made as Compleat a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as <hi>Ireland;</hi> for they have as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
a distinct Dominion within
themselves, and I beleive, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with Authority for the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the Affairs of their own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as ample in all Respects as
<hi>Ireland,</hi> excepting only the Punctilio
of a Titular Kingdom, and the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of a Parliament, to the very
same thing that in the others is call'd
an Assembly: Are not all these things
done or not done, according to the
Humour or Fancy of Princes? Is
there any thing of Essence or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in them? If the English of <hi>Ireland</hi>
are in all other respects under the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48019:93"/>
Circumstances of a Colony of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
will any Body besides Mr. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneux</hi>
imagine, that this Title of a
Kingdom doth exempt them? But
he has more to say; <hi>Was not</hi> Ireland
<hi>given by</hi> Henry <hi>the Second, in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
at</hi> Oxford, <hi>to his Son</hi> John,
<hi>and made therby an absolute Kingdom,
separate and wholly independent on</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>till they both came united again
in him, after the Death of his Brother</hi>
Richard <hi>without Issue?</hi> No, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> and was
Try'd for his Life as such; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>England</hi> limited him from
using the Style of King: Can the
King of a Separate Kingdom be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
and yet his Kingdom remain
wholly Independent?</p>
            <p>He continues,<note place="margin">p. 149.</note> 
               <hi>Have not multitudes
of Acts of Parliament, both in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>declared</hi> ireland <hi>a
Compleat Kingdom?</hi> but never Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent:
<hi>Is not</hi> Ireland <hi>stiled in them
all the Kingdom or Realm of</hi> Ireland?
<hi>Do these Names agree to a Colony?</hi>
Yes, are not the Names of Colonies
agreeable to <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> because
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48019:93"/>
the Acts of State in <hi>Spain</hi> stile them
Kingdoms? <hi>Have we not a Parliament,
and Courts of Iudicature? Do these
things agree with a Colony?</hi> Yes, and
other Colonies have effectually the
same. Neither doth this involve so
many absurdities as he thinks, if we
do but consider what sort of a thing
a Colony is.</p>
            <p>When People began to multiply
in the World, and fill those Tracts
that were first inhabited, they were
necessitated to spread themselves far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and farther, for the better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of Living; and thus the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
Parts came in process of Time
to be peopled, with such as are call'd
the Aborigines of Nations: In the
first and innocent Ages of the World,
these liv'd in an undisturb'd Quiet,
contented in the Enjoyment of such
things as with their own easie Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation,
Nature plentifully bestow'd
in an abundance, sufficient for the
Support of all Mankind, 'till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and Enmity of the Devil, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
upon the deprav'd Minds of
Men, through the Curse entail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48019:94"/>
on them, for the Disobedience of our
First Parents, stirr'd up in them the
Unnatural Desire of living according
to their own Wills, without regard to
the Principles of Reason, and the
Laws of Nature, which God had
eternally stampt upon their Minds:
This soon began to break the first
Harmony and good Order of the
Creation, and came in time to change
the whole Face of Humane Affairs,
and introduce a very different kind
of Oeconomy among Men. Hence it
was, that the more powerful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
if they found their own
Borders too strait for them, would
not give them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elves the Trouble of
removing to distant uninhabited parts
of the Earth, but took the Liberty
to incroach upon their Neighbours,
and possess themselves of what
the Industry of other Men had made
their own just Right and Property.
These Violations of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
taught the more scatter'd People
to enter into Societies, and unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for their Mutual Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Invasions of others; and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48019:94"/>
for the Well-ordering of Matters,
and preventing private Injuries that
might occur among themselves, they
thought upon the constituting Laws,
for the defining of Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and executing Justice upon
such as should offend against them;
they apply'd themselves also to the
inventing of all such further Policies
as might be conducive to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and preserving the Good of the
whole Society; and whether they
thought best to commit the Chief
Conduct of their Government to one
Person as Supream, to rule them with
the assistance of subordinate Ministers;
or that they plac'd this Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to govern in several, with joint
Power, the end and intent was still one
and the same, to procure and conserve
the Good of the whole People, though
the Names were differing, as that
of Kingdom, Common-wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Those that institu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed the best Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and most suitable to their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
generally became the
most power<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul; a Sense of their
Strength, and an Opinion of their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48019:95"/>
Skill in Politick Managements, made
them Ambitious to gain Dominion,
and Rule over others: Some united
through Fear, or for Convenience,
and others were subdu'd by Force;
thus from small Beginnings grew up
Mighty Empires, who apply'd their
whole Power to bring and keep all
they could reach, under their own
Dominion; by which means the
Frame and Constitution of many
Kingdoms and Countries came to be
altered from their Original Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
There were yet another sort
of Invaders, whose Manner was only
to make room for the too Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Broods of their Off-spring, who
did as it were swarm out in huge
Multitudes, to take up new Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
where they lik'd best; with no
intent to erect any United Empire,
or to return again to their Native
Countries; these destroy'd, drove
away, or opprest the Aborigines, or
former Inhabitants, where they came,
and possess'd themselves of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.
Of this latter sort have
been the Ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Goths,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48019:95"/>
Vandals, Huns,</hi> and others of their
Descendents, branch'd out into many
other Appellations; but these may
by no means be said to settle Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
because they retain'd not any
dependance upon their Original Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
but erected New and Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Governments upon their own
Foundation. Of those that aim'd at
the gaining and keeping together of
a Mighty Empire and Vast Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the <hi>Romans</hi> were the last, who
grew to the greatest heigth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
all others in Power and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
and the present Kingdoms and
States of <hi>Europe</hi> retain many of their
Notions and Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to this day, though in many
places with a large Mixture of the
<hi>Gothick</hi> Constitution; but 'tis from
them that we have principal'y learn'd
the way of Settling and Managing
of Colonies, and to their Practice we
ought to have recourse in such Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as relate thereto: And though we
are not to expect, that the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of other Governments, and
latter times, were obliged to follow
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48019:96"/>
the <hi>Roman</hi> Pattern in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
yet I believe, upon comparing
them it will appear, that few have
trac'd it nearer than we did, in the
Subduing and Settling of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> had by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
or any other Means, brought
any Country under Subjection to their
Government, they then gave the
Country the Name of a <hi>Roman</hi>
Province, possess'd themselves of the
most Considerable Towns and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses,
wherein they plac'd Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Garrisons, and then withdrew
the Body of their Army, appointing
a Governour in Chief over them,
whom they at any time afterwards
recall'd, and sent another at their
Pleasure. Did not the <hi>English</hi> in
their subduing <hi>Ireland,</hi> so far imitate
this way of Management, as that the
Countrey became united to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
in the very Nature of a <hi>Roman</hi>
Province? As the Inhabitants of the
Countrey made more or less Resistance
against them, the <hi>Romans</hi> granted
them the more or less Liberty, so
that they put Considerable Tributes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48019:96"/>
or Services on some, and suffer'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to enjoy great Franchises and
Privileges': In like manner, the <hi>Irish</hi>
making little or no Resistance, had
the Laws and Liberties of English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
granted them. This is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Province, but a Colony is
yet another thing: If the <hi>Romans</hi>
lik'd the Province, and saw it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for them, they sent sufficient
Numbers of their own People to
settle in this Province, divided out
such Lands to them as had been
gain'd, to cultivate and manure for
their own Advantage, and the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
thereof to remain to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
the Exercise of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Laws was granted them, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
also they had a Senate allow'd
among themselves, who might enact
such things as the Circumstances of
their own Affairs did require; they
and their Posterity always remain'd
free Denizons of <hi>Rome,</hi> and were
always protected and defended by
her, as long as she had Power to
do it; but they were ever obliged
to pay an intire Obedience to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48019:97"/>
pream Decrees of the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and were subject to be call'd home,
if the <hi>Romans</hi> thought fit to dissolve
the Colony. Let the Reader apply
this to the Circumstance of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and consider whether it be not a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Example in point,</hi> than Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>
lately gave us.</p>
            <p>I have taken the pains to say thus
much on this Head, that if possible
I might open the Understandings of
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> and his Admirers, that
they may no longer lye under a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in this matter: If the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Countries and Nations can
be made up of no more than these
three sorts of People, Aborigines,
swarming Invaders, (if I may so call
them) or Colonies; (as I think 'tis
impossible to find more original Stems,
whatever Branches or. Unions there
may be). I am sure the English of
<hi>Ireland</hi> won't pretend to be Aborigines
there; neither can they reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be upon the same bottom with
the <hi>Gothick</hi> Excursions, for that was
quite out of Fashion, and the Practice
forgotten, Ages before they were born;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48019:97"/>
all these parts of the World were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
under Kingdoms and Polite Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
which with little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(I don't say in their Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,
but) by Conquest, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
except by Unions, continue
much the same to this day: They
have frequently needed Help, and
had been many times destroy'd, or
driven quite away, but for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Protection and Support they
have always had from their Mother
<hi>England;</hi> and they have ever receiv'd
a Governour, and Directions for all
the Principal Managements of their
Government from her; these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
can be no way agreeable to
an Original <hi>Gothick</hi> Settlement; and
since there's nothing else left, if Mr.
<hi>Molyneux</hi> won't let them be a Colony
of <hi>Old England,</hi> I see no room for
them to take up any where, but in
his Notion of the State of Nature,
and then there will be need of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
them again to Order as Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
And though I take the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to answer Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> after this
manner, no Body can imagine that I
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48019:98"/>
could think of such a Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Worthy English Gentlemen
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I am sure they will be
much more ready to agree with me
in the same thoughts of their Duty
to their Mother Countrey, which I
have Discours'd in <hi>Page</hi> 75, and
76.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> thinks,<note place="margin">p. 149.</note> he hath now
answered <hi>The only remaining Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are sometimes mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them,</hi> and so <hi>He proceeds to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
what he humbly conceives, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
the Iustice of their Cause;</hi> and
this takes up about twenty four pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to the end, in which he hath
summ'd up his Discouse; much of
which is a Repeating over again,
<hi>What are the Natural Rights and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of Mankind; That no body can be
bound without their own free Consent in
Parliament, quoting Mr.</hi> Hooker, <hi>&amp;c.
and telling us again, of the Concessions
made to them:</hi> But he might have
spar'd himself and the Reader this
Pains; we value Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and all
the rest that have written upon that
Excellent Subject, as much as he; we
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48019:98"/>
have maintain'd the People of <hi>Ireland</hi>
in the full Enjoyment of all that could
be granted them in the first Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
they act as freely in their
own Parliaments, in matters pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to themselves, as ever any Body
of Men in their Circumstances did
in the World; our Parliaments have
always shewn that regard to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature
which they own to be their
Right, as that we have rarely med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it, and never but upon
very extraordinary Occasions, either
to help them in the time of their
Distress, and when they were not
in a Capacity to act for themselves,
(as he confesses;) or when the Good
of the whole English Empire (of
which they are a part) did eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
require it, and which we should
have done as effectually if they had sent
Representatives to our Parliament, as
we have done it without them, and
as we do it to <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> in
restraining the Owling Trade, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they do send Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives,
who cannot hinder, if they
Vote against; and to be sure, if they
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48019:99"/>
Vote for those Laws, act against the
Confent of those that send them;
and then why may not they complain
of the Infringement of the Rights
due to all Mankind, by putting Laws
upon them, without their Consent?
but Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> may say, they have
Representments; what if they don't
consent? may not these People then
strongly insist, that they are not bound?
Yes, sure, if General Notions of Liberty
must be swallowed all in a Lump,
without distinguishing; but here's
a Majority in the Case, and that
Obliges; if it be ask'd further, why
should a Man be bound by ever so
great a Majority, so as to be restrain'd
from doing what he will with his
own, according to the Liberty inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in all Mankind, by the Law of
Nature? Because he that is not born
in the state of Nature, is effectually
bound by the Consent of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
to submit to the Constitution
of his Countrey, and that with us
determines that the Majority shall
bind. Publick Societies can never
be kept together, nor the Good of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48019:99"/>
whole conserv'd, without some such
binding, such Limitations of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as this; and this is what we
have reason to require from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are certainly a
Colony of <hi>England,</hi> sent thither by
us, bred up, cherish'd and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by us, in the Enjoyment of good
Estates and ample Privileges, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to preserve the intire Freedom
of their Persons and their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in all manner of Liberty and
perfect Enjoyment; excepting only,
that if they should presume to extend
it to such a Latitude, as would be
highly injurious and prejudicial to
<hi>England,</hi> and consequently to the
whole English Empire, by wounding
its Head; whereon also themselves
always have, and must relye for assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
so that in whatever they
weaken her, they work their own
Destruction: And the World will
easily judge, that as we have the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of Reason on our sides, so if
we are a perfect Government, we
must have sufficient Power residing
in our Constitution, to act upon all
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48019:100"/>
Extraordinary Occasions, whatever
we shall find absolutely necessary to
our Preservation, even to the binding
of all the Members of our Empire,
without being oblig'd to ask their
Assent.</p>
            <p>The rest is little more than dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon Conclusions, arising from
such Premises, which I hope I have
sufficiently refuted in my former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and therefore I shall meddle
no more with it, but to touch upon
two Passages: The one is, where he
tells us,<note place="margin">p. 166.</note> that <hi>It is against the King's
Prerogative, that the Parliament of</hi>
England <hi>should have any co-ordinate
Power with him, to introduce New
Laws, or repeal old Laws established in
Ireland:</hi> But his Argument upon this
is either false Printed, or down-right
Nonsense, or at least so Confus'd, that
I Confess I cann't unravel it, and
I'll begg the Reader, if he would
see it, to look for it in <hi>page</hi> 167.
for 'tis too long to Transcribe and
Comment upon, where any on't is
intelligible: But to take it in the
gross, 'tis no more than a weak at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48019:100"/>
to raise a Jealousie, about hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's Prerogative, when
yet nothing that he hath offer'd looks
like it, but rather shews the King's
Prerogative to be less there than in
<hi>England.</hi> I wonder Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>
should render himself so ignorant of
our Constitution, in magnifying the
Negative Vote, which their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath upon whatever Law is
sent to them from the King in his
Privy Council, as if that were a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Privilege than the <hi>English</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
has; whenas a little Inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these Matters would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him, that the King can, if he
please, bring a Bill into Parliament
here, and either House may reject it,
if they don't like the Law: But then
what Laws he sends to their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
must be first approv'd in the
Privy Council here, and doth not
that shew that an Authority inferior
to our High Court of Parliament,
hath a sort of Co-ordinate Power
with him in the Legislature of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
And is it not an evident De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
that the King doth not
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48019:101"/>
act any thing in relation to <hi>Ireland,</hi>
upon any distinct Prerogative, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and differing from what was
inherent in the Imperial Crown of
<hi>England?</hi> Nay, is not the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
exerted in a higher degree,
in the manner of his passing an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Law, where he comes into the
House of Lords, and exercises in his
own Person alone, (and without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Advice of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of either of his other Kingdoms)
one full Third Part of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Authority, and in Power above
one half, as having the Casting Vote,
by which he can deny against the
other two Estates? And when he
thus passes any Law, affecting <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
can any thing be more absurd,
than to suggest,<note place="margin">p. 167.</note> 
               <hi>That he thereby suffers
a precious Iewel of his Crown to be
handled roughly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last Passage I shall observe,<note place="margin">p. 172.</note>
is his Parting-blow, the last three
Pages, wherein he Cautions us two
or three times over, how <hi>Vnsafe it
may be for us to assume a Iurisdiction,
whereby the Lords and People of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48019:101"/>
               <hi>may think themselves ill used, their
Rights and Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erties invaded and taken
away, and they may be driven into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content;</hi>
from whence he hints, <hi>there
may be ill Consequences:</hi> We may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see his Meaning to be a Menace,
and though there may be some few
of them as inconsiderate as he is, yet
we have a better Opinion of the Body
of the English Protestants there, than
to believe that they will ever give
us Occasion to think, that we have
need of Exercising severe Methods, to
keep them in their due Obedience;
Nay, had we the least doubt of this,
it would behoove us not to suffer any
Gentleman, who hath an Estate in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to bear any Command in
our Army there, 'till he had given
us the utmost Assurance that he was
not tainted with Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
However, let me tell him,
that a Supream Authority ought
not to be set upon at the Rate he
does.</p>
            <p>And now I will take leave to shew
the Lords and Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
some of the ill Consequences that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48019:102"/>
may attend them, if Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s
Positions should gain an intire Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> If the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>
should be perswaded, that they ought
to look upon <hi>Ireland</hi> as a Distinct,
Separate and Absolute Kingdom, with
which they have nothing to do; they
might not think it unreasonable for
them, to demand a speedy payment of
all the Expences <hi>England</hi> hath been
at, in the many Assistances which
they have given them; and if they
shall refuse to pay it, whether it may
not be just to recover our own from
any Neighbour Nation by Force, if
we shall think our selves able to do
it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi>
belongs to the King as his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
distinct from the Kingdom of
<hi>England;</hi> if the <hi>Irish</hi> should at any
time hereafter believe that the King
of <hi>England</hi> could not be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
his Potestant Subjects there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Assistance of Men and Money
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om his English Parliament, and
should thereupon make another At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48019:102"/>
to drive them out, and seize their
E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tates; whether the Parliament of
<hi>England</hi> would think themselves
oblig'd to be at any further Expence,
to protect a People with whom they
had nothing to do, and who had
shewn so little Gratitude for what
had been done for them former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If <hi>Ireland</hi> be such an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
Independent Kingdom, by
virtue of the Conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ions formerly
granted to them by <hi>England,</hi> those
Concessions were made to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>Old English</hi> settled there;
all that Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath argued is
intirely their Case, and they alone
have Right to be considered, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with as the Body of that Kingdom;
but the Modern <hi>English</hi> Protestants
can have no Interest in these Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Grants; they are still our own
People, went thither with our leave,
and may not stay there without our
permission; if then the Governme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
of <hi>England</hi> should think fit to recall
them, (as they may those that are in
<hi>France, Holland,</hi> &amp;c.) Whether the <hi>Irish</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48019:103"/>
Papists could either have Will or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to protect or keep them from us?</p>
            <p>And now as I have been neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
upon several former Occasions,
to shew that Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many things, that may be made
use of to the Disadvantage of the
<hi>English</hi> of <hi>Ireland;</hi> so I think, I have
also demonstrated, that upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Considerations, his Notions, if
they should be thought reasonable,
so far as to obtain upon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> to believe that they
ought to quit all manner of Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of their Superiority over <hi>Ireland,</hi>
as amply as he desires; the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
must draw immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and Ruine upon them; which
I should think might sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Gentlemen of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath not deserv'd well
of them in writing this Book: And
I hope they will think, that I have
employ'd my time much more to
their Advantage, if it may convince
any that have been lead into his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
that 'tis the true Interest of
the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to remain
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48019:103"/>
constant and firm in their Loyalty and
Obedience to the King and Kingdom
of <hi>England,</hi> and to esteem it their
great Happiness, that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in so easie a Subordination, to
a Kingdom that is so well able to
protect them, and hath requir'd so
little from them; and never more to
think that their being restrain'd from
interfering with us in our principal
Trade, can be too great a Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the many Benefits and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Preservations which they have
receiv'd from us, especially since they
are in much easier Circumstances
than the People of <hi>England</hi> to live
without it; whereas the Robbing <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
of it, must inevitably introd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again. <hi>England</hi> hath been, and must
still continue to be at a mighty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to maintain her Navies, and
the Civil List, from all which they
receive the Benefit of being protect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
in their Estates and Trade, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48019:104"/>
being hitherto ask'd to pay one
penny towards it, so that they may
clearly see, that 'twill be much easier
for them to continue in such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination,
than to aspire to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of an Independent Kingdom,
which they cannot be able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>I have now done with Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux</hi>'s
Book, and since I have taken so
much pains with it, I hope I may be
permitted to give it such a Character
at parting, as I think to be in a most
peculiar manner agreeable to it: 'Tis
an abundance of Well chosen Words,
and Fine Rhetorical Turns to prove
nothing; 'tis a multitude of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Authorities, brought
together to confute its own Author;
and 'tis a promulgating of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
Notions, as would ruine
and undo the People, for whom it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to be a Zealous Advocate.</p>
            <p>If it should be thought by some,
that I have been too sharp in some
Expressions, there are yet others,
whose Judgment I have taken, that
are of the Opinion, that so In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48019:104"/>
an Argument merits no less; and I
think such a Discourse cannot well
be treated with that Coolness and
Indifference, which might become a
Modest Controversie: Subjects that
so rashly undertake to disturb the
Minds of People, and assail the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a powerful Kingdom, in
matters of so high a Nature, deserve
at least to suffer such a Correction,
that others may be deterr'd from the
like Bold Attempts; let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered,
that <hi>Salmasius</hi> was lash'd to
Death by a Pen, provok'd in (what
in those times he thought) the Cause
of his Country, and Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>
may be thankful, that we have no

and can have no personal Disrespect
for him; and if he'll give me leave
to distinguish, as nicely as he does
between the King and the Kingdom,
'tis his Book, not him that I would
expose; after all, if in regard to his
Person, I do with the lowest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
ask his Pardon in the End,
I hope I shall come off with as good
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48019:105"/>
Manners, as he does with the

my self, I ought to ask Pardon of
the World for what Mistakes I may
have committed; for I cannot think
so well of my self, but that some
may have slipt my own Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Reading hath not been my Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and therefore it may seem
somewhat strange, that I should have
undertaken to deal with a Book that

               </gap>ses so much; I was resolv'd
therefore to handle it in such a way
wherein I might be most safe. There

               </gap>d room enough for me to
shew, from undenyable Authorities,
that Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath very extra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
vagantly err'd and fallen short, in
his Representation of this Matter;
for there are many English Acts of

manner of Notice; which must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him either to have dealt very
disingeniously, or what will no less

               </gap>ant in Matters of Fact, for so
considerable an Attempt: But this
part being undertaken by a much

               </gap> Pen, I was resolv'd to let all

but what Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> hath
produc'd; and as far as possible to
admit of his own Arguments, and
only endeavour to turn the Reason,
which Naturally flows from them,
against him. Can there be a fairer
Opposition, than to fight a Man at

               </gap>e and there, as Occasion hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
asserted some things that may

so well as to be able to prove them

               </gap>e to say, that they

are become Principles to me; and
I think them so conspicuous, that
the reasonable part of Mankind don't
disagree about them: Besides, I was

               </gap>e any Authorities which might
with more advantage be used against
me. I had never medled in this
Matter, but that I saw Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>
was so egregiously out in it, as that
a Man of indifferent Reasoning might
undertake it, and 'twas that part
only that I was willing to attempt:
Neither did I resolve to go on with
it, when I was told that a very
Learned Gentleman had an Answer
in Hand, 'till shewing what I had
written to some Gentlemen of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
