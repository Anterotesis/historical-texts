            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Honour of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creature is to ſerve
him, who is the beſt

we communicate with Angels,
whoſe glory it is that they are
<hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1 14.</note> always behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the face of God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for this very purpoſe. How
diligent then ſhould we be to lay
hold on, and to improve all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of ſervice, ſeeing our time
is ſo ſhort, our work ſo great, and
<pb facs="tcp:44972:3"/>
our ſalvation nearer than when we
firſt believed? The Son of God
hath given us a glorious pattern
herein,<note place="margin">John 9. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>I muſt work the work of
him that hath ſent me,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt
Jeſus our Maſter improved all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
went up and down
doing good, filling all places where
he came with the favour of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Miracles, becauſe he
knew his time was ſhort, and the
recompence of reward at hand.
The ſerious thoughts hereof would
exceedingly ſpur us to a holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note>
eſpecially conſidering
that Heaven is a place not of
work but reward, where the Saints
will be diveſted of ſerving and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
God in many of theſe
ways, wherein now (through
grace) they are enabled to bring
much glory to his Name. Many
Graces, Duties, Gifts have here
their place, while we are <hi>Viatores,</hi>
but ſhall have no room when we
come to be <hi>Comprehenſores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44972:3"/>
And this is the deſign of the
worthy Author in this little Tract:
<hi>viz.</hi> to ſet before thee the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
thou haſt of ſervice to
God, while thou art on this ſide
Heaven, beyond what are to be
enjoyed there. Were this through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weighed, how would Holineſs be
promoted, Saints thrive, Families
flouriſh, Churches revive? we
ſhould not ſo paſſionately deſire
death meerly to be rid of all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
but ſhould prize life, if
with it Chriſt Jeſus might be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
It is glorious work that
God calls his Saints to 'ere they
get to Heaven. Is not ſuffering for
Chriſt, glorious work? is not the
exerciſe of Faith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 14.</note> Hope, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
glorious work? To do good,
and to communicate both to the
bodily and ſpiritual neceſſities of
Saints and others, is not this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
work? In a word, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
pure Religion, &amp; undefiled, to
the generations to come, is not this
<pb facs="tcp:44972:4"/>
glorious work? Why, herein are
the Saints on Earth priviledged
beyond thoſe in Heaven, where
there is no room for the exerciſe
of theſe Graces, and Duties.</p>
                  <p>Oh! who would not pray that
he might live to do God ſervice?
ſpin not out precious time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably.
Pray that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
be counted worthy of this
calling (which is indeed a high
calling) and fulfil all the good
pleaſure of his Goodneſs, and the
work of Faith, Hope, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
with power, that the Name
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may
be glorified in you, and ye in him,

ſo that his Children took heed to

Here was a Promiſe with a Condition.

in his Prayer (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3d) makes
mention of his fulfilling that Condition,
<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>David's</hi> Children muſt take

him, as <hi>David</hi> had done. For, ſaith
<hi>Hezekiah, Remember now, O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee, how I have walked before thee
in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp; have
done that which is good in thy ſight. As
much as to ſay, <q>Lord! I hope thou wilt
not cut me off, and leave the Kingdom
without an Heir of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi>
ſeeing thou did'ſt promiſe him that
thou wouldeſt not; provided that
his Children took heed to their way,
that they walked before him as <hi>David</hi>
did. And, through thy Grace, I have

ſo walked in my meaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I hope, thou wilt not take me

So that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (though a

yet not ſimply, but leſt the Kingdom
ſhould want an Heir of the Seed of
<hi>David.</hi>

his temporal diſpleaſure many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his own Children.<note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 30, 31, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>If his Children
forſake my Law, and walk not in my
Judgments: If they break my Statutes,
and keep not my Commandments; Then
will I viſit their tranſgreſſions with the

And he teſtifies it ſometimes in their
death, as he did in the death of the
Prophet that came out of <hi>Judah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21, 22.</note> and
Propheſied againſt the Altar it <hi>Bethel,</hi>
who was ſlain by a Lion for his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
the Word of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was afraid, that God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44972:6"/>
had ſome controverſie with him, and
he was loth to dye in God's diſpleaſure.
Peradventure, he was ſomewhat lifted up
with his miraculous deliverance from the
Hoſt of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Chapter: For God did wonderful
things, as you know, to effect that
deliverance, and this ſickneſs was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the deſtruction of <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib's</hi>
Army; for that happened in the
39th year of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> life, who lived
fifteen years after his recovery from his
ſickneſs, which two numbers make the
whole number of <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> years,
which were 54, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 2.<note place="margin">2 King. 18. 2.</note> So that
this ſickneſs of his fell out preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that great deliverance. And the
good Man was not ſo thankful (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
as he ſhould be, but ſomewhat
elevated. For this was his weakneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his recovery.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 25.</note> His heart was lifted
up, and he rendred not again accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the benefit done to him, for which
God was angry with him. What
the ſin was, I will not poſitively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
only I thus conjecture; but that
he apprehended God's diſpleaſure for
his ſin, is evident from the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before my Text, ſaith he, <hi>Thou
haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back.</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44972:6"/>
Therefore, it ſeems, his ſins lay before
the face of God, till his recovery, and
upon this account he was loth to dye.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He was loth to dye, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
fearing what ſhould become of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
For he knew what became
of <hi>Jehoſhaphat's</hi> though he left a ſon
behind him; and of <hi>Jehojadah's,</hi> though
he left a well-educated Nephew behind
him. Add hereunto, that he found
the Church in a very deplored conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when he came to the Crown. And
as for his preſent Reformation, it had
not laſted ſo long as his Father's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and Idolatry; and his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
had ſcarce taken root as yet;
therefore he was willing to live longer,
and not, as yet, to dye.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That which made him the
more unwilling, was the nature of his
Diſeaſe, which (by the Remedy, and
way of Cure, a lump of Figgs laid for
a Plaiſter upon the Boyl, <hi>Ver.</hi> 21.) I
ſay, which by the Cure, ſeems to have
been the Peſtilence: And he was not
willing to go to Heaven that way;
though good Men may dye of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
and many times have done. But
yet a Child of God would, for ſeveral
Reaſons, willingly decline that way of
dying, if it might ſtand with the good
will and pleaſure of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44972:7"/>
Thus you ſee the Reaſons why <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
was loth to dye.</p>
                  <p>Now then being recovered, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a leaſe of his life for 15 years grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, he writeth down his thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as much affected with God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
towards him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the Text read unto you, there is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. A Declaration of the ſtate of the
Dead, as to the loſs of all opportunities
ever to praiſe and magnifie God any
more, or to hope for his truth in this
world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, An Aſſertion of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> enjoyed by the living, thus to
praiſe God, and to make known his
Truth, that is, His Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in his Promiſes. For, I conceive,
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> hath here a ſpecial reſpect to
the Truth and faithfulneſs of God in
his Promiſe made to <hi>David</hi> and his
Seed, in the foremtioned Texts of
Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is very likely, that
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> made known this Truth and
Faithfulneſs of God to his ſon <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi>
who was twelve years old when <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
dyed. Though <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> (it
ſeems) did little mind it, or made
any good uſe of it. That Point of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44972:7"/>
Doctrine, which I ſhall inſiſt upon, is
this, That</p>
                  <p>Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are opportunities of ſervice to be
performed to God in this life, which are
not to be enjoyed after death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or thus,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The people of God may do that for him
in this World, which they cannot do in
Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> therefore makes an Argument
of it in his Prayer,<note place="margin">Pſal. 6. 5.</note> and ſad Complaint in
his Sickneſs: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in death
there is no remembrance of thee;</hi> (not
but that the Saints in Heaven do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
God, (for they ſee him there) but
they cannot keep up his memorial any

<hi>In the Grave who ſhall give thee thanks?</hi>
The like we have in the 30th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled,
<hi>A Song at the Dedication of the

'tis conceived) from his victory over

<hi>David</hi> endeavours to purge and

And in that Pſalm he ſheweth, how he

cryed to the Lord in the day of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when <hi>Abſalom</hi> roſe up againſt him, &amp;

                     <hi>What profit is there in my blood,
when I go down to the pit? ſhall the duſt

And dark deſerted <hi>Heman</hi> makes uſe

                     <hi>Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead? and

Shall thy loving kindneſs be declared in the

Shall thy wonders be known in the dark?
and thy righteouſneſs in the land of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs?</hi>
ſaith he, Thy people may
make known thy wonders in this life,
but not in the Grave.</p>
                  <p>But then,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> do not the Saints, when
they are dead praiſe the Lord?</p>
                  <p>Yes;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> But the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh not of

And all their ſervice that way is

                  <p>But what are thoſe ſervices that may
be done here,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> which cannot be done in

                  <p>They are many;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and let me begin
with theſe in my Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
thee. i. e.</hi> He ſhall praiſe thee before the
Children of Men in the Land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Now, this is a glorious ſervice,
containing as much as is imparted in the
firſt Petition of the Rule of Prayer, <hi>i. e.
Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> which, though
it be a ſervice done in Heaven, yet in the
preſence of glorified Saints only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any propagation of praiſe to the
Name of God, for that is the priviledge
of the Saints while they live in this
world, where they make the Name of
God known to them, that knew it not
before. This is the firſt and higheſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of all in our prayers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of greateſt concernment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is another ſervice in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
my Text, which cannot be performed in
Heaven, and it is contained in theſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44972:9"/>
words, <hi>The Father to the Children ſhall
make known thy Truth.</hi> And is not
this alſo a moſt bleſſed ſervice? for it
contains what is imported in the ſecond
Petition in the Rule of Prayer, (<hi>viz.)
Thy Kingdom come.</hi> For this is one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
way of advancing and enlarging
the Kingdom of God in this world,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) when Parents ſhall make known
the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God to
their Children. To which purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<hi>Pſal. 78. 2, 7. Deut.</hi> 4. 9. and
6. 6, 7. And this is the great ſervice
of the Saints upon Earth, both Miniſters
and People.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The things</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Epiſt. Ch. 2. Ver. 2.) <hi>That
thou haſt heard of me among many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the ſame commit thou to faithful men,
who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi> And
this is a ſervice, which cannot be
done in Heaven. For the dead Saints
cannot contribute ought to the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Kingdom of Grace in this
World; and as for the Kingdom of
Glory, there are but two wayes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
that, which are by the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Saints on Earth to Heaven,
and by the Reſurrection; in neither of
which doth God uſe the ſervice of the
glorified Saints at all.</p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44972:9"/>
The care therefore of the choiceſt
Saints hath been, not only for the time
of their lives, but for the Generations

God had done.<note place="margin">Joſh. 2 laſt Chap.</note> The time would fail

is a Book of the Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

Any need of examples for the glorified

                  <p>Indeed, if they could return to this

And Faith is a gift of Grace,
whereby God is much glorified; for it
empties and humbles the Heart, and
carrieth it forth to Chriſt, and glorifies
God in all his Attributes. Whereas in
Heaven the Saints have all in hand, and
therefore they live by ſight, and not by

                  <p>Secondly, It followeth hence, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this life the Saints do exerciſe
Hope, waiting for the good which is

(that is, the thing hoped for) <hi>that is

why doth he yet hope for?</hi> There is no
hope in Heaven (the Fathers to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

                  <p>Accordingly it followeth, That here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
in this life the Saints do exerciſe their

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it be thus; why have ſome of
the Saints mentioned in Scripture deſired
to dye?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44972:13"/>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of the Saints have done
ill in ſo doing, but others upon good
ground.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some of them have not done well
in deſiring death, for they have
paſſionately deſired it, and to their own
loſs, if God ſhould have anſwered their
deſires herein. For inſtance. 1. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
he was the meekeſt Man upon the
Earth, yet he ſeems to be in a paſſion,
when he ſaid, <hi>If thou deal thus with me,
kill me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 11. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>I pray thee, out of hand.</hi> Why?
was there no remedy, but God muſt
kill him, and preſently too, if the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the people lay a little longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him? This was a paſſionate expreſſion
and deſire of death. And had
he died there preſently, he had incurred
a double loſs (to ſay no more in it)
1. He had been cut ſhort of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of doing that eminent ſervice in
conducting the people through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.
For he lived 38 years longer, and
did much for God and his people during
that time. 2. If he had died then out of
hand, he had not dyed, and been buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo honourably,<note place="margin">Deut. 34.</note> as he was afterwards
upon Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> even by God's hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44972:13"/>
2. And though <hi>Job</hi> was a patient
Man, yet he paſſionately deſired death.
<hi>Oh!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 6. 8, 9.</note> ſaith he, <hi>that I might have my
requeſt, and that God would grant me the
thing that I long for: Even that it would
pleaſe God to deſtroy me, that he would
let looſe his hand, and cut me off.</hi>
Whereas God meant <hi>Job</hi> better than ſo,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) to turn his Captivity, and to
give him twice as much as he had loſt,
and the full number of his former Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and ſo, to double their number
alſo; ſhewing him, that his firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was not laſt. Moreover, he ſhall
yet live 140 years longer to ſerve and
honour God in this world. Again,</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Elijah</hi> was a Man ſubject to like
paſſions as we are, and being perſecuted
by <hi>Jezebel, he requeſted for himſelf</hi> that
he might dye,<note place="margin">1 King. 89. 4.</note> and he ſaid, <hi>It is enough
now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am
not better than my Fathers.</hi> Whereas
God intended better for him, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that he ſhould live yet longer, and finiſh
his Teſtimony againſt <hi>Ahab, Jezebel,</hi>
and <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and then be carried tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly
to Heaven in a fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot.
So</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Jonah</hi> would needs dye in a fret,
<hi>Oh Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jonah 4. 3.</note> ſaith he, <hi>Take I beſeech thee,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44972:14"/>
my life from me, for it is better for me to
dye, than to live.</hi> No, <hi>Jonah</hi> was not
in caſe to dye at preſent, God would
not take him at his word, but he muſt
live yet longer and repent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, As for ſome others of the
Saints, death hath been deſired by them,
and not impatiently, nor any way ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but very well, and upon good ground.
You know</p>
                  <p>1. Juſt and devout <hi>Simeon,</hi> when
he had taken up Chriſt in his arms, he
bleſſed God,<note place="margin">Luke 2, 29.</note> and ſaid, <hi>Lord now letteſt
thou thy ſervant depart in peace;</hi> and
the ground of this requeſt lies in the
words following—<hi>according to thy
Word.</hi> His Prayer, it ſeems, was grounded
upon a word from God. For as God had
told him,<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>that he ſhould not ſee death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had ſeen the Lord's Chriſt;</hi> ſo he
had promiſed him, that then he ſhould
dye, and ſo his Prayer was grounded
upon a Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>2. And as for <hi>Paul, He deſired to
depart, and to be with Christ, which</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>is far better,</hi> i. e. for me.
<hi>Nevertheleſs, to abide in the fleſh is more
needful for you. And having this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23, 24.</note>
                     <hi>I know that I ſhall abide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
with you all, for your furtherance and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44972:14"/>
joy of Faith.</hi> So that 1. When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to dye, he looked upon the benefit
thereof abſtractedly, and abſolutely, but
not comparatively. 2. When he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon it on compariſon with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of life, he was not ſo poſitive in the
deſire of death, but having done great
ſervice, and, that too, a long time for
Jeſus Chriſt (for then he was <hi>Paul the
aged,</hi> Philem. ver. 9.) and being then
in priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> he hung for a time in
<hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> mid-way between two, till
at laſt the Scale turns to a deſire to live,
further to ſerve Jeſus Chriſt, and his
Church and people. For though <hi>Paul</hi>
was then in priſon, yet he did very much
good there, which had been loſt, had
he then gone to Heaven.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 12.</note> For his <hi>bonds
furthered the Goſpel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note> And they ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Brethren, and wrought upon
ſeveral <hi>in Caeſars Palace.</hi> And there be
converted <hi>Oneſimus;</hi> and there he wrote
his Epiſtles to the <hi>Galatians, Epheſians,
Philippians, Coloſſians,</hi> and the ſecond
Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> and that to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
In all which are many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Points of divers kinds, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conduce to the Churches edification:
And better a thouſand times that <hi>Paul</hi>
had been kept 20 years out of Heaven,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44972:15"/>
than that the Church ſhould have
wanted theſe Epiſtles.</p>
                  <p>But is it not lawful then in any caſe,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
to deſire to dye?</p>
                  <p>Yes;<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> with ſubjection to God's will,
in caſe eſpecially there are appearances
that a Man's work is at an end. For a
Child of God may live ſo long, that his
faculties may be impaired, his ſtrength
decayed, his ſpirits ſpent, and he may
be full of pain too, and ſo ſhut up, that
he can do little good. And as <hi>Job</hi>
ſaith,<note place="margin">Job 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>A ſervant that hath wrought hard
all the day, and is weary, earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the ſhadow.</hi> And ſo it is with a
Child of God in this caſe. The weary
body naturally deſireth the bed. And
ſometimes God makes a clear diſcovery to
ſome of his ſervants, that their work is
at an end.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 6, 7.</note> Thus it was with <hi>Paul, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be offered up, and the time of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
is at hand; I have fought a good
fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have
kept the Faith.</hi> And it is with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Souls; as with the Fruit of the Tree,
which when it is ripe, drops naturally
from it. There is a Spiritual inſtinct,
inclining the Soul of a Believer Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when the Fruit is ripe: So that
they come to their graves, as a ripe Shock
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44972:15"/>
of Corn cometh in its ſeaſon. And a
deſire to dye in ſuch a caſe is ſtill the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when it proceedeth from a longing
to be freed from ſin, and a deſire to be
with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23.</p>

They cryed, ſaying, <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> that is,

It is meant eſpecially of Chriſt as King,
Chriſt and his Kingdom. And we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> but thus
we pray for Chriſt, who prayeth for us
every day, or elſe we ſhould be in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <p>And truly, if the Kingdom of Chriſt

And yet if we can do little or nothing

Covetouſneſs, Pride, Paſſion, Anger,

inordinate affections, and ſomtimes groſs
omiſſions of duty either to God or Man.
Here now are opportunities of doing a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

witneſſing for him, ſo as you cannot do

conſider your duty, and what the

or I am afraid to ſpeak, and it will be
ill taken, or I ſhall do no good by teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or I ſhall be accounted a buſie-body;
but attend your duty, and leave the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

is profitable to direct: And however a
Reproof take, or ſpeed, yet you have
done a better ſervice for Chriſt, than any
Saint in Heaven can do. I know, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that ſuch teſtimonies for Chriſt
are ſoldom well taken, but that ariſeth
from the pride of Man, and however,
that muſt not hinder your duty, for I
am ſure, that the with-holding ſuch
teſtimonies, when you are called to give
them, is very ill taken by Chriſt; and if
he take them well, let proud ſpirits
take them as ill as they pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>The like I may ſay as to the oppoſing
of Error and Hereſies, according to your

the ignorant, when a ſeaſon is
offered, and of warning the unruly, &amp;c.
And you know not, but you may do
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44972:27"/>
much good in ſuch caſes, and your

however your rewerd is with the Lord,

                     <p>There are other good and gracious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Offices to be diſcharged, which ceaſe
when you are dead. I did briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſome of them in the Doctrinal part.
Let me now exhort you to attend them
alſo; As to pray one for another, which
Duty ends with our Lives. For (as I

                     <p>Oh! what a trade did <hi>Paul</hi> drive
this way? I have ſometimes thought,
what a Catalogue of Churches and Saints
he had to commend to God in his daily
prayers. How many Churches did he
uſually pray for? ſaith he to the Church
at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>God is my witneſs, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

he prayed for the Church at <hi>Coloſſus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 2, 3.</note>
The very ſame for the Church at <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,
We give thanks to God always for
you all, making mention of you in our

your work of Faith, labour of Love, and
patience of Hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—
And doubtleſs, had he written Epiſtles
to all other Churches, we ſhould have
heard of his prayers for them. Neither
did he pray only for Churches, but alſo
for ſeveral Saints in particular; For he
ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 3.</note> that he prayed for <hi>Timothy night
and day;</hi> that is, Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the whole put for the part. And
as for <hi>Philemon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Philem. v. 4</note> he ſaith, <hi>That he made

What a Catalogue then had <hi>Paul</hi> of
Churches and Saints to recommend to
God in his daily prayers? For it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
likely, that he prayed for many
more, than we find in his Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p>And as he prayed for the Churches,
ſo he deſireth to be remembred in their
prayers. For, as I ſaid, he drove a holy

as greatly backſliden from the Faith:
And he would not trade with broken

another, and trade together as you ſhall
ſee occaſion. Yea, you muſt pray
ſometimes for ſuch as never deſired it.
So likewiſe, if you do hear of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
condition of ſuch and ſuch of the

ſympathize with them, to pray for
them, and (to your power) to help

                     <p>And think it not enough, that you pray
for Saints, but perform the like ſervice
for ſinners alſo; for your prayers may
contribute much to their converſion, as
Chriſt's prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. did to

<hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Stephens</hi> prayer

                     </p>
                     <p>And be ſure to pray for Children, and
Childrens Children, that they may live
in the ſight of God, and bear up his
Name in their generations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither reſt in particular perſons,

of the Holy Ghost, be multiplyed. <hi>And
this is to</hi> pray for the peace of Jeruſalem.
<hi>And when you hear of a Church bereft

<hi>If need be,</hi> becauſe we are not to caſt our

muſt take up, but not make a Croſs.
But when the providence of God, and
his Word calleth us to witneſs for Chriſt
to the loſs of ought that is neareſt and
deareſt to us, let us remember, that this
is one of the ſervices, which termineth
with our lives, and cannot be performed

hitherto to eſcape thoſe ſufferings,
which many of our brethren have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone.
But have we been ſufferers in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
Have we been prepared for the
Croſs? Or, have we not been among
the fearful? And have we ſympathized
with our Brethren in their ſufferings?
and have we accounted them happy that

works that he hath done.</hi> Here</p>
                     <p>1. Are ſuch as are worthy of the name
of Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> who tranſmit to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the Truths of God contained in the
Scripture, ſo as theſe here did, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

                     <p>2. Here is the only infallible ſort of

to the Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy men
of God, and is now contained in the
Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>3. From theſe words we are taught,
that the godly in every age ought to have
the ſame care to tranſmit the Word of
Truth to their poſterity, as their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors

ſo to pay the debt which they owe to

And if you deſcended not from ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

is your duty, out of love to God, to

therefore what followeth in the ſame
Pſalm.<note place="margin">Ver. 5, 6.</note> 
                        <hi>For God eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony

which he commanded our Fathers, that
they ſhould make them known to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that the generation to come might
know them, even the Children which
ſhould be born, who ſhould ariſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

this tranſmitting of the Truth and true
Religion to Poſterity, is God's love and
Teſtimony, becauſe it teſtifieth and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
for God, and againſt us, if we
break it. And this Law and Teſtimony

the Law and Teſtimony is,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 26, 27—13. 14.</note> to tranſmit

Let ſuch Parents and Maſters look to
it, who have been negligent in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

handing of Religion from Parents to
Children, &amp; from the Living to the next

while to live? <hi>Hezekiah</hi> indeed had no
ſon at this time, but he reſolveth here,
that if God ſhall give him one, he will
make known the Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God to him; for he looks upon
it as his duty, when he ſaith, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Children ſhall make known thy
Truth.</hi> And what is the reaſon, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44972:36"/>
many are ſo ignorant this day, but becauſe
they wanted Family-inſtruction from
Parents and Maſters? For it is not
enough, that ſuch do live under the
preaching of the Goſpel, if they want
inſtruction in the Families wherein they
have lived; the want whereof makes
the Miniſters Plow to go ſo heavily.
Oh let not the Children and Servants
riſe up in judgment againſt you, and
charge their ignorance and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the neglect of your duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Conſider with whom God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
hath betruſted the Goſpel and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>1. He puts his Miniſters in truſt with
it.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 4</note> For, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of God to be put in truſt with the

we muſt be faithful in the diſcharge of it;
and you muſt not be offended if we deal
plainly with you.</p>
                     <p>2. He betruſteth all his people with
his Goſpel and pure Religion, expecting
their diſcharge of this truſt by their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
endeavors to tranſmit it to poſterity,
as you heard but even now from that
Text, <hi>Pſalm 78. 3,—7.</hi> For he doth
not, as I ſaid, put the truſt into your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44972:37"/>
hands for your ſelves only, that you
ſhould make uſe of it during your lives,
and then dye, and let others that ſhall
come after you ſhift for themſelves; for
this were to be cruel, like the <hi>Oſtriches</hi>
in the Wilderneſs, who leave their Eggs
in the Earth, and warm them in the duſt,
forgetting that the Foot may cruſh them,
and the wild Beaſt break them; but he
expecteth and requireth your faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and utmoſt care and labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the ſame Religion to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Servants that live with you.
And what ſaith <hi>Solomon? My Father
taught me,</hi> and ſaid thus and thus to
me, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 4. And my Mother alſo
taught me, and ſhe ſaid ſo and ſo to me,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31.—But how have you taught
thoſe that are under your care? and
what have you ſaid to them? And
where is the Altar <hi>Ed,</hi> that you have built
for them, as a witneſs and memorial of
the true Religion and Worſhip of God,
which you have commended to them?
No marvel that Religion decayeth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Families, when their Governours
have wrapt up their Religion in a Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin,
and profeſſed only for themſelves,
and not for them that ſhould come after
them. You that are guilty in this part,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44972:37"/>
will have a ſad reckoning to make, when
you ſhall be called to give an account of
your diſcharge of that truſt, which is
commended to you, and have never an
<hi>Ed</hi> to witneſs your care of conveying
the Truth to the generation to come.
Know therefore, that it is your duty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this truſt committed to you,
to turn and wind your Religion for
God's Glory &amp; the advantage of poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which, if you neglect, take beed you

ſlothful ſervants, and have your porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>Conſider the common care of Parents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to bequeath their Houſes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 14</note> Lands,<note place="margin">Pſal. 49. 12</note> and
Goods to ſuch as are to ſucceed them.
<hi>They leave their ſubſtance to their Babes,</hi>
ſaith the Pſalmiſt. <hi>And the inward
thought is, that their houſes ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

all generations, and they call their
Lands after their own names.</hi> That is,
they are thoughtful for the upholding of
their Families, and the continuing of
their names from one generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But as for the Goſpel, which
they profeſs, and the Religion which
they own, they have little or no care at
all. They leave their Earthly ſubſtance
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44972:38"/>
to their Children, but that which is the
moſt ſubſtantial thing of all, they leave
it not to them; and they leave their
names to their Children, but the Name
of God and Chriſt they leave not, nor
have they any care, that Chriſt's Name
be named upon them, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make them Chriſtians indeed,
according to their duty,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. <hi>ult.</hi>

                        <hi>If thou wilt give unto thine

way of dedication, common to her

to this duty by the Law of Nature, and
by many commands in the Word of
God, which I have already mentioned.
<hi>Train up</hi> therefore <hi>a Child</hi> (or Catechize

                        <note place="margin">Prov. 22 6.</note> So did
<hi>David</hi> deal with <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 5.</note> as you have

with Timothy,</hi> and ſo the godly

you have heard, a Teſtimony and a
Law in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And when you brought
your Children to Baptiſm, you did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly
engage unto this duty. For the
Covenant which gave your Children
right to that Ordinance, and which
ſealed it to them, ſtrongly obliged you
to give them up to God in the uſe of all
ſuch means as he hath appointed.</p>
                     <p>And therefore you are a Covenant-breaker
in the neglect of this duty,
which is the ruine both of many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Families,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 23. with 3. 13.</note> as of <hi>Elie's</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and yet <hi>Eli</hi> did reprove his ſons,
but did not do his utmoſt. And this is
the reaſon why many Children of godly
Parents prove lewd and vicious, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44972:39"/>
their Families at laſt, loſe all power of
godlineſs, if they grow not looſe and
prophane. For it is with Children, as
with the Flowers in your Gardens,
which without care and culture will ſoon
degenerate. Remember therefore your
Covenant, and attend the terms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which concern you in relation to
your poſterity. And ſay, I am not
only naturally, but alſo federally bound
to uſe all means to train up my Children
in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord, and to ſerve the purpoſe of God
as to their Eternal Salvation.</p>
                     <p>For do you think it enough, that you
breed them up to live in this world?
And is it enough that you provide Meat,
and Drink, and Apparel, Portions, and
Trades, aud ways of livelihood for
them? Or, that you give them civil Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and teach them how to carry
themſelves as men? will you love their
bodies, and neglect their ſouls? Do you
know the price of your own ſouls, and
not of theirs too? Or, are not theirs as
precious as yours? Or, is it all one to
you where you ſpend your Eternity,
and whether you go to Heaven or Hell?
In the mean-while, where is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
where your love of God, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44972:39"/>
Godlineſs? Where your Conſcience as to
your Covenant? Or, what care have you,
that Godlineſs may flouriſh in the next
generation, who take not the courſe that
it may thrive in your own Family? Take

<hi>Manoah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Judg. 13. 12.</note> when the Angel told him, he

                     </p>
                     <p>And ſeeing you are a Covenanter with
God, and have given up your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to him,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 20, 21.</note> who hath accepted of them,
and ſealed the Covenant to them; you

well as yours, as he expreſly calleth
them. And he puts them out to you to
Board and Breeding, and you muſt give
an acount to him, how you have bred
them up for him.</p>
                     <p>And what? will ye rob God of his
Children, and beſtow them upon the
world, or ſacrifice them to devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and cauſe them to paſs through the
fire, as God challengeth thoſe Parents
in the aforeſaid place of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> I mean
to be devoured of that roaring Lion,
and (not to paſs through the fire, but)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44972:40"/>
to dwell with devouring fire, and with
everlaſting burnings. Doth not Nature
teach Men to propagate their kind? And
doth not Grace teach them to propagate
the Truth, and true Religion? without
the firſt, Mankind would periſh; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to uphold the World, than to propagate
the Goſpel of Chriſt's Kingdom? if ſo,
you are no better than a Man or Woman
of this generation.</p>
                     <p>I perceive, there are many Bills pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
for prayers in behalf of ungodly
Children. It is well, if their Parents
have not been wanting in their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. If they have not, let them
not deſpond as to the ſucceſs of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.
I have lived to ſee the bleſſed
fruits of pious Education, and that
though Children ſo Educated have gone
aſtray for a while, yet they have been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
reduced at the laſt, &amp; made their
Parents joyful. And I think, it is not
uſual, that a Father ſhould be a true
fearer of the Lord, and one that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
diſchargeth his duty towards his
Children, and yet all of them ſhould
prove ungodly, and none of them be
converted ſooner or later, but periſh
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44972:40"/>
in the uncircumciſion of their hearts.
Perhaps Parents may not always live to
ſee it, but it is well enough if their
Children come to Heaven after them.</p>
                     <p>I have inſiſted the more upon this

The Pſalmiſt was now an old Man, one

For ſaith he, <hi>Hitherto have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

to do more, and therefore (ſaith he)
<hi>Forſake me not, until I have ſhewed thy

Laſtly, There are ſuch, who though
they are not called <hi>Fathers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 4. 4.</note> yet are
called <hi>Elders, viz.</hi> the Members of the
Goſpel-Churches. And they are ſo
called, not in reſpect of age, but of ſtate
in theſe Goſpel-times, wherein the
Church is paſt her non-age, and is now
in an Elderly ſtate, requiring more
Knowledge, Wiſdom, Strength, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
Gravity, and Solidity in the
things of God. How ſhould ſuch, as
theſe walk before others, ſo as to anſwer
the Character of Elders? Let ſuch take
heed then of carrying it below their
ſtate. It is not for Elders to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
like Children. I have thought
many times of that deſcription of the
Goſpel-Churches in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and
how little it is anſwered this day by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that relate to ſuch Societies. Take
heed then of ſcandals, anſwer your
State, live up to your Priviledges, ſhine
in Holineſs, that you may adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of God and our Saviour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and commend your State, Examples,
and holy Lives unto the Generation to
come, that they may attain to the
knowledge of the Truth, by your
walking in it; and ſay, Theſe Truths
and Ways of holy Walking were
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44972:44"/>
made known to me by the Gracious,
Grave, and ſerious Lives of <hi>ſuch as did
relate unto the Churches of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Exhortation hitherto hath been to
do all the good we are able, during our
abode here below, ſeeing death will put
end to all our opportunities. And I have
propounded to you ſeveral Particulars
wherein to be exerciſed this way.</p>
                     <p>Now before I proceed to any further
Uſe of Exhortation, Let me mind you
of that which may conduce to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of this Duty, and that is, an heart
enlarged unto publick ſervice. For that
which greatly hinders the proſecution
of this work, is the narrowneſs and
ſtraightneſs of the Spirits of Men, whoſe
concernments are commonly bounded
within themſelves. Therefore you muſt
endeavour to abound in love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the glory of God. For
this was at work in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> heart,
when he ſaid, <hi>The living, the living, he
ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> This was uppermoſt,
this was the firſt thing that was in his
Eye, in his deſire of prolongation of life.
For indeed, it is the chief good of Man,
whom God made for himſelf, and who
therefore is to have this end continually
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44972:44"/>
in his aim,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> and to be often thinking,
What ſhall I do to glorifie God? <hi>For of
him, and through him, and to him are all
things, to him be glory for ever, Amen.</hi>
And all is loſt that ends not in him that
is <hi>Omega,</hi> to whom you may well afford
this honour, when you conſider that
he is <hi>Alpha.</hi> He that is the firſt, muſt
be the laſt. Take heed then of a narrow
ſelfiſh Spirit, which never looks ſo far as
to this end; and that makes many ſo
unactive for God, and his Glory. You
muſt therefore believe more, and love
more, and then you will act to this end
more, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your love to the glory of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
God muſt extend to the Generations to
come. You muſt not therefore limit it
to the preſent Generation, and never
be concerned that God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in future Ages, even to the Worlds
end: But your deſires herein muſt
reach to the very end of the World. For
note the words of the Apoſtles <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>To
God be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus,
throughout all ages, world without end,
Amen.</hi> His love to God's glory ran
through all Ages even to Eternity. And
ſo ſhould your love do, or elſe you do
not ſincerely love it; neither indeed can
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44972:45"/>
you love that his Glory be upheld du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your own time, and not love
the continuance of it to the Worlds
end.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch was the love of the Saints in
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Pſal. 79. laſt.</note> to the praiſe and glory of
God; ſay they, <hi>We will ſhew forth thy
praiſe to all generations.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                     <p>1. They deſired the continuance
thereof to the Worlds end.</p>
                     <p>2. They would alſo endeavour it.
<hi>With my mouth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal 89. 1.</note> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>will
I make known thy faithfulneſs to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſ. 102. 18.</note>
And this hath been their
care ſtill, That the <hi>people which ſhall be
created may praiſe the Lord.</hi> Thus you
muſt love God's Glory both Intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Extenſively.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As you muſt love the Glory of God, &amp;
that it may be extended to future Ages;
ſo likewiſe you muſt love his Kingdom,
or elſe you will never attend this great
work unto which you have been exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
God's Kingdom, Power, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
muſt go together in your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p>And this was much upon <hi>Hezekiah's</hi>
heart, when he ſaid, <hi>The Father to the
Children ſhall make known thy Truth.</hi> For
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44972:45"/>
he doth not ſay, I will make known thy
Truth to my Children, though he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
ſo to do, but <hi>the Father,</hi> that is,
every Father that feareth God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in my time, but in the generations
to come. Thus muſt your love be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the Kingdom of God, and,
<hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> muſt be always
in your deſires and endeavours. <hi>Come;</hi>
how long? even to the end of the world,
and never ceaſe coming, till Chriſt
himſelf come. Now if this be upon
your heart, and if you love that Chriſt
ſhould reign in the world, you will do
your utmoſt to promote it, in your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
in attending to the ſeveral Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
propounded.</p>
                     <p>As you love God's Glory and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
ſo muſt you love his Goſpel. For
it is the <hi>Word of the Kingdom;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 19</note> That is,
The Word whereby God's Kingdom is

It is that in which, and by which our
Lord Jeſus doth reign in the world, <hi>viz.</hi>
as to his Spiritual Kingdom therein, of
which I now ſpeak eſpecially. And
you ſee in my Text, <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> love
to the Truth, and to the making

whereas the Goſpel is the

a myſterious Truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a great Truth, that we uſe
to ſay, As true as the Goſpel. Now if
you love this Truth, (as you have

thing that may tend to the publication

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As you muſt love God's
Glory, Kingdom, and Goſpel, ſo you
muſt love Souls. <hi>The Father to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhall make known thy Truth.</hi>
Therefore the Father muſt love the
Souls of poſterity, and have a zeal for
the ſalvation of them that ſhall ſucceed.
And this will quicken your endeavours
to the ſervice of your Age, when you
ſhall look upon the Souls of ſucceſſours
as of equal value with your own,<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 13, 15.</note> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ranſom given for all Souls is the

                     <p>And it is a bleſſed thing to be a lover of

whoſe love to Souls ſhines in his own

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44972:46"/>
God our Saviour towards Man appeareth.</hi>
His kindneſs and <hi>Philanthropy, i. e.</hi> love
towards Man. For God and our Saviour
are great lovers of Men; ſo ſhould we be.
And <hi>Chriſt's delights were with the ſons
of Men from eternity.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 31.</note> We ſhould not
therefore terminate our love in Men's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
we ſhould love the Jewel far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

looking upon Mens Souls.</p>
                     <p>1. In compariſon with our own, and</p>

                     <p>3. In relation to Eternity; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Souls of ſuch as are near to us.
And the enlargement of our affections
this way will amplifie our endeavours.
In Heaven we ſhall love Souls that are

they may be ſaved; A work which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth
in Glory.</p>
                     <p>Now all this requireth a publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and an heart carried far beyond our

embraced and improved all

ſupplyed the outward wants of the Saints
according to your ability, how you have

you have improved thoſe Gifs of Grace
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44972:48"/>

the Sufferings, nor the Duties and

to be compared with the glory
which ſhall be revealed in us. But our
Eyes are too ſeldom upon the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of reward, nor do we conſider
what God hath prepared for them that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44972:49"/>
love him: Whereas, did we ſeek for
Glory, Honour, Immortality, we ſhould
continue patiently in well-doing. But
few that fear God have Faith enough to
take in the exceeding eternal weight of
Glory that is prepared for them. If glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Saints were to return to live again
upon Earth, they would double and
treble their duties beyond what they did
in former times. For, what do they
think when they are entring into the
joy of their Lord? what? All this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
all this Joy, an Heart full, and a
Heaven full, and to Eternity alſo, and
that for ſo few imperfect ſervices? And
muſt I now ſpend Eternity in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and do none of thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
any more for him, which were
proper and peculiar to my temporal life?
And muſt I be on the receiving hand as
to all this Glory for ever and for ever?
Certainly, if it were poſſible, This
would make the Saints repent in Heaven,
that they had done no more for Jeſus
Chriſt on Earth. But if ſuch thoughts
were incident to glorified Saints, they
come too late, when once they are in
Heaven: Now is your time to be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that ineſtimable reward. When
therefore you come to God, you muſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44972:49"/>
have a full perſwaſion, not only of his
Being,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> but Bounty, that he is a reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of them that diligently ſeek him, as
the Apoſtle ſpeaks. But remember that
it muſt be <hi>diligently.</hi> And be you never
ſo diligent, he will abundantly reward
it. And if Saints could but look into
Heaven, and ſee how 'tis there, before
they come thither, they would ſoon
double their diligence, and work their
fingers to the ſtumps for Chriſt. But
many want Faith to believe ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
or to apply it to themſelves, as
that which God will certainly beſtow
upon them after their work is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Conſider yet further, That the good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
you do upon Earth may encreaſe when
you are dead; and as that encreaſeth,
ſo ſhall your glory ſtill be enlarged. For
though the leaſt Glory above is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
and the words there ſpoken <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 4.</note>
yet there are aboundance of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations
in Heaven, and the ywho
at their firſt entrance, wore but ſingle
Crowns,<note place="margin">Jer. 17. 10.</note> after a while wear double ones.
For it is ſaid, <hi>God will give to every
Man according to his wayes, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to he fruits of his doings.</hi> So that, if
their former doings on Earth do fructifie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44972:50"/>
after they are dead, God will reward
them according to the Fruit thereof.
For not only <hi>their works,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13</note> but <hi>the fruit</hi>
of them alſo doth follow them. And ſo
do the evil works of wicked men follow
them, as <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> did for above three
hundred years together after his death;
for that at laſt he felt a ſevenfold Hell
for what he did at firſt. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it is conceived, that <hi>Dives</hi> deſired
<hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> to go and
preach to his five brethren, that they
might avoid that place of torment; why?
is there charity in Hell? no, it was not
out of love to his brethren, but to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
becauſe he had corrupted them
with his wicked life, and left a bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
behind him, which they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
therefore he deſired, that they might
(if not be ſaved, for that I think a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Soul cannot deſire, yet that) they
might not for his cauſe and example be
brought into that place of torment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this would be the encreaſe of his
torment too. In like manner on the
other hand, the glory of the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
encreaſe as their labours and pains
are fruitful, as Divines ſay of <hi>Paul's</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
One Heaven is too much for the
beſt Saint that ever lived, were not the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44972:50"/>
reward of Grace, and yet your Heaven
ſhall multiply according to the fruit of
your good doings which you left behind
you.</p>
                     <p>And this will be inſtead of doing
good in Heaven, when the Saints leave
that behind them, which keeps fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
after they have left this world.</p>
                     <p>Why?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> what is that which they may
thus leave behind them?</p>
                     <p>Their good Works and Words,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and
Examples, and holy Lives, their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
Exhortations, Counſels, Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
their remarkable Actions
and Sufferings for Chriſt. By all which
they act and ſpeak <hi>even after death.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note>
And there is no other way that I know
whereby to do good when you are in
Heaven. And in this way ſhall the
glorified Saints know in Heaven, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the good works which they left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them do fructifie, for they ſhall
find and feel it in their enlarged Crowns,
further Augmentations, and additional
Glories. And then they ſhall break
out into new Songs of praiſe to God and
the Lamb, for helping them to ſow their
Seed on Earth, which ſtill fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after they are gone to Heaven. And
in this way a Father may convert his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44972:51"/>
Child, or Children after his death, as
(as I doubt not, but) many have done.
And then he heareth of it in Heaven,
two wayes.</p>
                     <p>1. By his additional Glory.</p>
                     <p>2. By the joyful Acclamations of
the Angels for the converſion of a

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore let us endeavour ſo to live
here a little while, that our good
Works may live when we are dead, and
act when we are at reſt, and ſpeak
when we are gone down into ſilence, and
bring forth fruit unto holineſs, when
we are in endleſs happineſs; and bring
Souls to Heaven after us to tell us that
our good Works, and Words, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,

Counſels, ſufferings, Graces, are yet all
alive and well, and like to yield a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Crop and Harveſt of Joy and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to them that ſowed them before
their death. Oh, it is a bleſſed thing,
and the Wiſdom of Saints to leave a
ſtock of good Works behind them,
whereby to have a Trade going here
on Earth, which will afford them freſh
Incomes of Glory, whil'ſt they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<hi>The living, the living he ſhall praiſe thee.</hi>
Thus when once the ſwift Shuttle of your
life is come to a Thrum, then you will
ſee the value of Opportunity, and cry,
<hi>The living, the living,</hi> &amp;c. and reckon
till the morning, and ſay, There is but
one day more between my life and
Eternity. And it may not be long ere
that Morning or Evening cometh. For
little did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a few dayes before
think that he had been ſo near unto
death, being now but thirty nine years
old, and God having wrought ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
for him in his late preſervation
from <hi>Senacharib:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> For ſaith he, <hi>Behold,
for peace I had great bitterneſs.</hi> God
lately deſtroyed the Hoſt of the King of
<hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and gave me peace, and I ſaid,
I ſhall now now dye in my Neſt, and
multiply my dayes as the Sand, but
I little thought of ſuch a ſickneſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue

                     <p>It ſeems he was ſurprized; and ſo
may you be, if you look not well to it,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44972:52"/>
for God now gives fair warning of it.
They that will not prize Opportunity,
ſhall have an opportunity to prize it: If
they prize it not living, they ſhall prize
it dying. Wherefore manage your
ſeaſons for the beſt ends while you have
them, and fill up your dayes with duty,
and be not ſo eager upon the World,
and the things thereof. Opportunity
is a golden Mattock to dig for Heavenly
Treaſure; do not wear it out, as many
do, in digging for Pibbls, and at your
latter end become a fool.</p>
                     <p>Beware therefore of idleneſs on the
one ſide, and cumbring your ſelf with
Worldly Occaſions on the other;
but conſider, wherefore hath God given
you life and time, but to be ſerviceable
in your day, and to work for him in
whom you live. He did not give you
time to play the Truant, and deſign
and labour to be rich, and to grow
great in the World, and to arrive at
ſuch a Revenue, and proportion of
worldly Eſtate; but he ſent you into
the World to do his work, and to
improve your Time and Talent for
him.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, when the World, or
the Fleſh is putting ſuch Employments
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44972:53"/>
upon you, which will devour much
time, and divert you from the one thing
neceſſary, tell them; That you muſt
give an account of your time, and you
muſt not rob your Lord and Maſter of
his hours, which he ſent you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
in his ſervice, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And certainly it is an undervaluing
alſo of Heaven, to think to go thither,
and to do little or nothing for God upon
Earth, though yet the recompence of
reward is purely gracious, or of meer
Grace, let our Labours for the Lord
be never ſo many; for what are all our
Studies, Works, Sweat, and blood, and
Spirits, and Coſt; and Care, and Time
expended upon Chriſt, in compariſon
with an exceeding Eternal weight
of Glory? Prize therefore and improve
your times.</p>
                     <p>Here are ſeveral of you that are
young,<note place="margin">1. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</note> or in your middle age, or about

but little for God, and what will
turn to a comfortable account. What
then, if God ſhould now lay you (as
he did <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) upon your ſick Bed,
and threaten to cut off the Thrum of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44972:53"/>
your lives? Would you not with him
turn your faces to the wall, and weep
ſore? And yet I tell you, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had
done a great deal of Work for God, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of his Reign unto this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
He loſt no time, but fell hard to the
Work of Reformation in the firſt moneth
of the firſt year of his Reign.<note place="margin">2 Ch. 29. 3.</note> And he
did a great deal during his fourteen years
before his ſickneſs,<note place="margin">Iſa. 38. 3.</note> and he did it alſo <hi>in

                     </p>
                     <p>But ſtill, what have you done, if you
were now as near the gates of the grave, as
here he was? And to theſe Gates you
muſt come at laſt, and paſs through them
alſo to the higheſt Tribunal, to anſwer
to this Queſtion, <hi>What haſt thou done?</hi>
How haſt thou improved time, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
with thy Talent, filled up thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
maintained good Works for
neceſſary uſes, been active for the higheſt
end?</p>
                     <p>Peradventure you will plead your
ſmall capacity,<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> and that you are but
of mean degree, an obſcure perſon, and
ezerciſed in Low Employments, and of
weak parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but ſtill what ſaith <hi>Hezekiah?
The living, the living he ſhall praiſe thee.</hi>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:44972:54"/>
And are not you living? Are you not
alive? For any Man or Woman living
may praiſe the Lord, or elſe <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
ſaith not well; But it is true what he
ſaith, for any Man living may do his
his generation-work. Is your capacity
than ſuch, that you cannot praiſe the
Lord?<note place="margin">Pſal. 148. 11, 12.</note> what ſaith the Pſalmiſt? <hi>Praiſe
ye the Lord;</hi> who? <hi>Kings of the Earth.</hi>
Yea, they are in a capacity indeed. Such
as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> may do much that way,
they are great Men, and have great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities.
But what followeth?
<hi>Kings of the Earth, and all people:
Princes and all Judges of the Earth. Both
young Men and Maidens, and old Men
and Children. Let them praiſe the Name
of the Lord.</hi> Men and Maids, old
and young, all may; and all muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the ſervice, none excepted.</p>
                     <p>And therefore plead not your mean
capacity,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> but ſerve your age according
to your Talent. For he that had but
one Talent, doth not ſay, Lord, I had
but one, and what can a Man do with
one? My fellow-ſervants had, one five
Talents, the other two, and they might
well employ and improve them.
No, he ſaith not thus; He was convinced
that one Talent might be improved to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44972:54"/>
advantage as well as five, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is bound to be Trading for God
with what he hath given him; for, ſaith
the Text,<note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>He gave to every Man according
to his ſeveral ability.</hi> So that all of

                        </gap>
One had a five-fold ability, another a
two-fold, another a ſingle. And he
that had but a ſingle capacity, was called
to an account for his unprofitableneſs, and
caſt into outer darkneſs. The meaneſt
therefore among you hath ſome ability,
and woe be to him, if he doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it. A young Man, a Servant, a
poor Man, a mean Man, may do many
things in tendency to God's Glory, and
the good of others, whil'ſt he is living,
<hi>and the living, the living, he ſhall praiſe
thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You that are ſtricken in years,<note place="margin">2ly.</note> you
have much to account for. For you have
lived lon, and perhaps are now grown
old, but have you been old Traders?
Yes, as to a worldly account: Yea, but
there is another, and a better Trade, &amp;
what have you done therein? God will
call you to a reckoning for your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trade, and eſpecially for your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
You have gained thus much in
the world, he will ſay, but what
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44972:55"/>
redounds to my ſhare of all that you
have done? This is the great Queſtion.
Think ye; Oh how many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

For though it is as impoſſiibe, that your
former individual opportunities ſhould
return, as that you ſhould grow young
again, yet God may pleaſe to miniſter
new occaſions to you upon your repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
whereby to bring forth fruit in
old age. It ſeems, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was
an old Man when he came to Chriſt by
night;<note place="margin">John 3d.</note> For, ſaith he, <hi>Can a Man be
born when he is old?</hi> As much as to ſay,
<hi>As I am.</hi> But when he is converted, he
thrives apace, and comes to Chriſt at

                     </p>
                     <p>Now therefore beſtir your ſelves, and
redeem loſt time by improving what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
to the utmoſt, and ſee what
you can do with a little remnant of life,
and whether you cannot grow as faſt as
Old <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did. Project improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

now that your light is near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing.</p>
                     <p>Make up in affection what may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

cauſe enough to do ſo, in that God hath
given you to live ſo long, who have
done ſo little. If our Servants ſhould
work no better for us, than many have

lived to ſee <hi>Joaſh</hi> married, and after
that the Temple repaired. And he died
not long before <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who reigned but
forty years. But few men lived ſo long
in thoſe dayes, and yet he did a great
deal of good ſervice unto the laſt. And
when he died, they buried him in the
City of <hi>David</hi> among the Kings, becauſe
he had done good in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

that it is your mercy, if they dye full

was ſuch, as to threaten an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>Yet God threatneth to be avenged on

and not Gods; (<hi>Ver.</hi> 3.) But though
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be overthrown, and
the Temple burnt, and the Temple-Worſhip
aboliſhed; yet the Lord would
have a care of his Church, and make
way for the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and expoſe the Truth and Way of his
Worſhip to the open view of the <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> from Eaſt to Weſt.</p>
                  <p>For the Truth and Way of God's

as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (the Seat of

now all ſhould be laid open before all

this here is ſignified by an Allegory of

Hill being put for the reſt) in the
mid'ſt towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> and towards

not the Earth only, but alſo Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;

                  <p>Only, whereas it is ſaid, <hi>And the

Of the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
to ſet up his Goſpel-Kingdom, whither his
Elect ſhould be gathered unto him their
Head: But laſtly, and chiefly of Chriſt's
ſecond coming, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſpeaking of the coming of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all his Saints.<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 3. laſt.</note> For
this Chapter leads us ſo far, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44972:66"/>
remaineth but this laſt and great
coming of Chriſt, unto which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
cannot forbear to look, and he
looketh at it with much Faith and
Joy.</p>
                  <p>1. In that he applyeth the Lord God
to himſelf. <hi>The Lord my God ſhall
come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In that he turneth his ſpeech unto
him. <hi>And all the Saints with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly as for the Chapter, it begins
with the deſtruction of the Old <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
and endeth with the erection of
the New.</p>
                  <p>And whereas there is a Day ſpoken of,
ſo and ſo deſcribed as in my Text, It is
the day or the time, that lyeth between
theſe two <hi>Jeruſalems,</hi> Old and New. It
is not a Natural or Artificial day, for
ſuch a day cannot ſuite with the ſcope
of this Prophecy; Nor was there ever
any ſuch day, wherein it was lighter
in the Evening than in all the day before.
And therefore by <hi>Day</hi> here, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
underſtand a large tract of time,
for ſo Day is many times taken in the
Scripture, particularly the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
is called the <hi>Day of Salvation.</hi> And
it is called <hi>that Day,</hi> ſixteen times in this
and the two preceding Chapters,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 2.</note> which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44972:66"/>
treat of the laſt times, wherein ſuch work
is to be done, as will take up many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, as you may ſee if you conſult
the Chapters at leaſure.</p>
                  <p>And you ſee here when this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
(<hi>viz.</hi>) when the Goſpel was firſt
publiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> about the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the Old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before it, and continueth to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of the New.</p>
                  <p>Let me then put all the deſcription of
this day together into one Point, and
it is this.</p>
                  <p>Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Goſpel-times, unto the converſion of
the Jews, are one day intermixed with
Light and Darkneſs, known to God, in
the evening whereof it ſhall be light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Day here is plainly meant of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the times of the Goſpel, till the dayes of
the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For you find this
Day again, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8. and again, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. &amp;
ſo, till you are led to the converſion of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ver.
10, 11. to the end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This day is one day. 1. A <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Day. 2. One.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:44972:67"/>
A Day. And that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>1. In that it hath light in it all along.
For Chriſt and the Goſpel run through it.
And theſe carry light with them where
ever they come. It is true, there is a
mixture of darkneſs in it, yet it is not
called night; but, becauſe it hath light
in it, therefore is called <hi>Day;</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part carries the denomination.</p>
                  <p>2. It is a Day in compariſon with the
dark times under the Law, eſpecially the
times immediately preceding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt, when beſides the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of Ceremonies, there was great
darkneſs of ignorance.</p>
                  <p>3. It is ſuch a Day, as is diſtinguiſhed
with remarkable periods, (<hi>viz.</hi>) of
Seals, Trumpets, Vials, even as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
day is with hours, and diſtinct di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.
This we ſee at large in <hi>Johns</hi>
Revelation.</p>
                  <p>4. It is a Day, in that it hath in it a
bleſſed opportunity of working, <hi>Luke
19. 42. Joh. 9. 4. &amp;</hi> 12. 35.</p>
                  <p>5. A Day, in that it hath a Morning,
and an Evening. The Morning began
with the riſing of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when the day-ſpring from on high
did viſit us, and the people that ſat in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44972:67"/>
darkneſs ſaw great light. And the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lies in my Text, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Jews converſion. Thus it is a
Day.</p>
                  <p>It is <hi>One day,</hi> i. e. one and the ſame
from Morning to Evening. And 'tis ſo
upon two accounts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In that every part of the day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
is mixt with light and darkneſs, though
not equally mixt, for ſometimes it is
more light, ſometimes more dark, but
more or leſs light and dark always. And
ſo the day is one and the ſame for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of light and darkneſs, though
not for the equality of both.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, One and the ſame, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
like to it ſelf, becauſe there is in it but
one and the ſame Covenant, and way of
Adminiſtration according to what God
hath promiſed, ſaying, <hi>Yet once more I
ſhake not the Earth only,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 26, 27.</note> 
                     <hi>but alſo Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And this word, Yet once more, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the removing of thoſe things that are
made that thoſe things which cannot be
ſhaken may remain.</hi> The Legal Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
was ſhaken and removed at
the coming of this day, but the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
ſhall remain to the very end of it.
And hence it is, that the Church ſtill
appears in all the Periods of this day,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44972:68"/>
under the ſame form to the very laſt,
<hi>viz.</hi> of four living Creatures and twenty
four Elders.<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 4. 11. 16. 14. 3. 19. 4.</note> And thus it is <hi>unus idem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
dies,</hi> One and the ſame day from
firſt to laſt. This is the <hi>Second</hi> Branch
of the point, 'tis One day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is ſuch a Day as is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with Light and Darkneſs, ſo that
it is neither Day nor Night, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. But
why then is it called a Day in the ſame
<hi>Verſe?</hi> The meaning therefore is, that
it is neither perfect Day, nor perfect
Night; but yet ſuch, as may well be
called a Day for the reaſons aforeſaid,
onely with intermixtures of Light and
Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>But what is the Light,<note place="margin">Qu.</note> and what the
Darkneſs?</p>
                  <p>The Light is the light of Truth:<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> for
theſe two go together;<note place="margin">Pſal. 43. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Send out thy
Light and thy Truth.</hi> And the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is the darkneſs of Ignorance, Error,
Hereſy, Idolatry, and Superſtition. And
ſuch a mixture there hath been in this
Day, and will be to the very Evening
of it.</p>
                  <p>The cleareſt part of this Day was in
the Morning thereof, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
lived; yet even then there was a
mixture of this Darkneſs. The Churches
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44972:68"/>
in <hi>Galatia</hi> were infected with the leaven
of falſe Teachers, mingling Law and
Goſpel in the point of Juſtification.
And ſome in the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi>
denied the Reſurrection of the Dead;
and others held that it was already
paſt,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 17.</note> (as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi>) and
their word did eat like a Gangrene. And
ſome ſuch there were that turned the
Grace of God into Laſciviouſneſ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> give us a ſad cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of them. And in <hi>John</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">1 John 2. 18, 19</note> there were many Antichriſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
from the Faith, and many falſe
Prophets were then gone out into the
World, who denied that Chriſt was
come in the Fleſh. And Pride and
Ambition began then to appear in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 1, 2.</note>
And falſe Apoſtles we meet
with ſeveral times;<note place="margin">3 Joh. 10.</note> and with <hi>Balaamites</hi>
and <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> in the Church at <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> and the woman <hi>Jezebel,</hi> a falſe
Propheteſs, and a Seducer in the Church
at <hi>Thyatira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee the Morning of this Day,
red and lowring, preſaging foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
throughout the remainder of it.
In the times ſucceeding the Apoſtles,
aroſe the <hi>Simonians, Menandrians, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians,
Cerinthians, Ebionites, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44972:69"/>
Apollinarians,</hi> &amp;c. which did
ſomewhat darken the Primitive Day,
wherein yet there was a comfortable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Light held forth by <hi>Ireneus,
Lactantius, Tertullian, Juſtin Martyr,
Cyprian,</hi> and others. Afterward aroſe
the <hi>Arrians,</hi> (who denied the God-head
of Chriſt) greatly obſcuring the Day,
but were oppoſed by <hi>Athanaſius, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary,</hi>
and ſeveral others, and condemned
by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. Not long after,
the Hereſy of <hi>Macedonius</hi> (who denied
the Perſonality of the Holy Ghoſt) was
condemned by a Council at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi>
And ſo was the Hereſy of <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
(who held that Chriſt had two
Perſons, as well as two Natures) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and condemned by a Council at
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> not long after the ſame time.
Oppoſite to this Hereſy was that of the
<hi>Eutychians,</hi> who held Chriſt to have
but one Nature; confounding his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> had divided his
Perſon. For thus we find moſt of the
Primitive Hereſies to be about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Perſon of Chriſt, the great
Light of the World, which the Prince
of Darkneſs endeavoured to extinguiſh,
that ſo he might turn this Day into
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44972:69"/>
Night. But ſtill you will find that
there was Light in oppoſition to his
Darkneſs. And when afterwards the
Devil ſtirred up <hi>Pelagius</hi> to aſſert the
Freedome of Mans Will, God raiſeth
up <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to oppoſe him.</p>
                  <p>Onely what ſhall we ſay about the
cloſe of the <hi>Sixth Century,</hi> when the
bottomleſs Pit was opened, out of which
there aroſe a ſmoak,<note place="margin">Rev. 9. 2.</note> as the ſmoak of a
great Furnace, inſomuch that the
Sun and Air were darkened by reaſon
of the Smoak. Where now was the
Light? and where was the One Day in
my Text? Yea, and as the <hi>Centuries</hi>
encreaſed, ſo did the Darkneſs, by a
continual ſucceſſion and <hi>ſeries</hi> of Errors
and Hereſies, for many Hundreds of
years together. And you know what
dark Lights the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> were in their
Generations, who did rather obſcure
than illuſtrate <hi>Theology.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things are true; And a man
had need of a great deal of knowledg in
Church-Hiſtory, and the <hi>Centuriators,</hi>
to give particular ſatisfaction in this
point, and it would alſo require a large
Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore give you ſome general
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44972:70"/>
grounds of Proof, that ſtill the Light
did run through the darkeſt Times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt promiſed that the gates
of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt his
Church,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18 28. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                     </note> and that he would be with it
to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is held by ſeveral Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> That the <hi>Seven</hi>
Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had their Antitypes,
one after another, throughout the
day of the Goſpel in my Text. And
then, ſurely there was alwaies Light
in the Candleſticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When Chriſt began to ſhew
<hi>John</hi> things to come, the Firſt thing
that he ſhewed him, was God ſitting
upon his Throne, with the Church
round about Him, and ſo deſcribed, as
you know, <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. For in ſhewing
<hi>John</hi> things to come, at ſo great and vaſt
a Proſpect, God muſt needs ſhew him
great and dreadful things, as. He did
under the Seals, Trumpets, and Vials.
And therefore at the very entrance of
this Diſcovery, God ſecureth to <hi>John</hi>
the ſafe condition of the Church in all
times, and let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him ſee that his Eye was
ſtill upon that, as ſtanding round about
his Throne encompaſſed with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times ten thouſand of Angels, that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44972:70"/>
ſo what ſights ſoever <hi>John</hi> ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſee, he might be aſſured, that
the Church was ſafe enough. For God
is before, and his Angels behind the
Church. And hence it is that ever and
anon the Church puts up her head in
ſuch and ſuch <hi>periodical</hi> times, and
daies of danger and darkneſs in the
Revelations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When God intended great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Mutations in the World, He made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for his Church and People; ſo
that the four Angels muſt not hurt the
Earth, nor the Sea, nor the Trees, till
the Servants of God were ſealed in their
Foreheads;<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 1, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> and the number of the ſealed
was 144000.</p>
                  <p>And when the <hi>four</hi> firſt Trumpets
ſounded, though there followed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
a ſore judgment,<note place="margin">Rev. 7.</note> yet ſtill a third
part eſcaped under every one of them;
And with this agreeth that of <hi>Zechary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 13. 8.</note>
                     <hi>Two parts ſhall be cut off and die, but
the third part ſhall be left therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when again the <hi>fifth</hi> Trumpet
ſounded, and the mouth of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Pit was opened,<note place="margin">Rev 9. 4.</note> out of which a
dreadful ſmoak aſcended, and Locuſts
out of the ſmoak, they had not power
to hurt the graſs of the Earth, nor any
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44972:71"/>
green thing, nor any tree, but onely
thoſe men, which had not the Seal of
God in their foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 4</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If we come to the <hi>Sixth</hi>
Trumpet, which began to ſound about
the Year 1300. when the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Power aroſe, which yet continueth to
this day; it was a very dark and diſmal
time, yet not void of Light. For the
<hi>Waldenſes</hi> and their Followers were up
long before that time, and <hi>Wickliffe</hi>
aroſe ſomewhat about the ſame, and
(as I take it) <hi>Bernard.</hi> Afterwards
<hi>John Huſs</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague.</hi> But
ſeeing the time was ſo doleful, and that
it might well be admired, what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the Church, and where the
Light was to be ſeen; our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt cometh down from Heaven, in
the form of a mighty Angel, clothed
with a Cloud, and a Rainbow upon his
Head, and his Face ſhining as it were
the Sun. For this was in the dark times
of the <hi>Sixth</hi> Trumpet, when although
Chriſt was much clouded to the World,
and little of him ſeen, yet the Sun did
ſhine through the Cloud, even in thoſe
times; for he was mindful of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,<note place="margin">Rev. 10. 1, 2.</note>
ſignified by the Rainbow. And
moreover Chriſt had in his Hand a little
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44972:71"/>
Book open; ſo that there was ſome
Light ſhining in thoſe very dark times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When Antichriſt was at
his greateſt height, a little before the
Light ſo brake forth, that ſome Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
began, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
the Lamb of God, appeareth ſtanding
on Mount <hi>Zion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 1.</note> and with him an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
and <hi>forty four</hi> Thouſand, having
his Fathers name written on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads:
ſhewing us, That Chriſt had
his Church in the times of the greateſt
Apoſtaſie, and that there was not
wanting Light in Darkneſs. The ſealed
Number (<hi>Rev.</hi> 7) ran through (about)
a <hi>thouſand</hi> years, and at laſt lifted up
their heads upon Mount <hi>Zion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Suppoſe the riſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
ſhould commence (as it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended)
between the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi>
Centuries, you know the riſe of the <hi>two
Witneſſes contemporates therewith; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
which they continue their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying,
during <hi>One thouſand, two huu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
and <hi>ſixty</hi> Daies, a day put for a
year. And ſo too, upon this account,
the darkeſt Daies did not want the
Light of the bleſſed and everlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;
yea, ſo much Light, as to uphold
the denomination of a Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:44972:72"/>
But ſince the <hi>Second</hi> ſpring of the
Goſpel, ariſing from the Light intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by <hi>Luther, Melanchton,</hi> and the
<hi>German Theologues,</hi> it is viſible to the
eyes of Adverſaries, how the Darkneſs
hath declined, and the Light ſhined
more and more to this very day. And
thus it will be light and dark, light as
to Truth, and dark as to Ignorance,
Error, Hereſy, Idolatry, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
more or leſs unto the very Evening
of the Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In this day there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Light and Darkneſs in another
reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> Trouble mingled with
Tranquillity, and Perſecution with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
You know the ſad times under
the Seals, by the rage of the <hi>Roman</hi>
power againſt Chriſtianity. Yet ſome
liberty was now and then enjoyed, and
ſilence in Heaven for half an Hour.
You have heard alſo of the <hi>Arrian</hi>
Perſecution under <hi>Conſtantius, Julian</hi>
and <hi>Valens,</hi> yet all liberty was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.
For though Perſecution and
Liberty in their height are inconſiſtent,
as light and darkneſs, the one in its
height expels the other, yet there was
an interchange by the ſucceſſion of one
to the other ſometims, if not an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44972:72"/>
of both as to a moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
For though Perſecution and
Liberty have not ſtood together in one
and the ſame time and place in their
height, yet as for the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and Truth thereof, that hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhined in ſhowres of Perſecution,
like as we have now and then ſeen the
Sun to ſhine, and the Rain to fall at
one and the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee how the Day of the
Goſpel hath all along hitherto been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed
and interchanged with light
and darkneſs. The light of Truth and
the darkneſs of Errour, the light of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the darkneſs of Perſecution.
And thus much for the third Particular
of the Point in hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This one day thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
is known to God. In ſome
reſpects it is known to us, and hath
been known to others before us, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
that there is ſuch a day, and thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
as aforeſaid. But it is known to
God, ſo as it is not known to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is known to him as the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of it. As it is ſaid of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
day,<note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 16</note> 
                     <hi>The day is his, the night alſo

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44972:73"/>
and create Darkneſs;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iia. 45. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>I make Peace, and

The Lord is the Former of it, who

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This day is known to God,
as being wholly in his power to order all
things in it after the Counſel of his own
will. He knew the end from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and what lyeth in the Womb
of this day, from the Morning to the
Evening of it. He knew what light, and
what darkneſs there would be in every
period of the day, whereas we know not
what a day may bring forth; and little
did we think a year ago what Light of
Liberty we ſhould now enjoy, nor do
we know what darkneſs of trouble and
confuſion may ariſe again ere long. We
look ſometimes, for good, and lo, evil
cometh, and we wait for Light, and
there cometh darkneſs. For it is not for
us to know the times and ſeaſons,<note place="margin">Job. 30. 26</note> which
the Father hath put in his own power.<note place="margin">Acts. 1. 7.</note>
We cannot make a Divine Almanack,
and define what day (in this great day)
it ſhall be calm, &amp; what day tempeſtuous,
what day it ſhall ſhine, and what day
rain. We know not the Ordinances of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44972:73"/>
Heaven, nor can we ſet their Dominion
in the Earth; we cannot lift up our voices
to the Clouds, that abundance of Waters
may cover us; neither do do we know
the way where the Light dwelleth, and
as for Darkneſs we know not the place
thereof. Known unto God are all
things.</p>

therefore this day is ſo known of the
Lord,<note place="margin">Jun. Trem.</note> that it is regarded and cared for
by him. His Eyes are upon it, that
nothing falls out in it, but by his ſpecial
Providence. And though darkneſs hath
ſometimes increaſed, and far prevailed
in this day, yet the Light was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
nor ever ſhall: He hath ſtill
preſerved a Lamp, as he did in the
Kingdom of <hi>David,</hi> at the loweſt ebb
thereof. About one hundred and fifty
years ago, when darkneſs lay upon the

light to ſhine out of darkneſs,
which hath continued and encreaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

God, in reſpect of the termination of it,
which we know not. For what great

                  </p>
                  <p>We know in the general, that this
Day ſhall have an Evening, and that in
the Evening it ſhall be light: But when
this Evening ſhall be, we know not; we
cannot take the Light and the Darkneſs
at the bound thereof. But God doth
perfectly know the Epocha of the reign
of the Beaſt, and his Number, 666. And
thus this day is known to the Lord, and
to the Lord only.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, What is this Evening? It
is the darkeſt part of this Day, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there was ſtill more or leſs
Darkneſs intermixed with Light, as you
have heard, but now at the Evening-time
there ſhall be more darkneſs than
in any of the preceding parts of the Day:

                  <p>But how can it be,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> that the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:44972:74"/>
1. In ſome reſpects it ſhall be the
darkeſt part of the Day,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> for it will be
a time of very ſore Troubles, Wars,
and rumors of Wars, and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.
For I cannot tell where to
fix this Evening, but under the <hi>Sixth</hi>
Vial, which ſhal be poured out upon the
great River <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 12</note> 
                     <hi>That the waters

which words is held forth (as our beſt
Interpreters hold) the converſion of the

Spirits, like Frogs, ſhall go out of the

working Miracles, and going forth
to the Kings of the Earth, and of the

of the great Day of God Almighty.</hi>
And that muſt needs be a very ſad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
eſpecially in reſpect of trouble,
great oppoſitions and commotions. For
there ſhall be as terrible Signs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In ſome reſpect therefore,
it ſhall be the moſt lightſom part of the
Day hitherto. And indeed it will be the
light of the Evening, that will very much
occaſion the Darkneſs of it: I mean the
Light of the Truth, that ſhall then ſhine
forth, ſhall darken the Kingdom of the

their very Tongues for pain.<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 10</note> For that

Antichriſt be greatly conſumed with

in this reſpect, it muſt needs be a

                  <p>Thus you ſee what a time the Evening
ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall this Evening then determine

It is true, One would little

more light than in the Day before. But
ſuch an Evening-time is this, after which
ſhineth the greateſt Light that ever was

                  <p>You ſee then what this Evening is.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly;</hi> What is that Light, that

                  <p>Anſw. <hi>It is the ſame in kind and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

neither for brightneſs ſhall the Moon give

there will be a very great light of

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In that Day there ſhall be
the Light of Comfort; for this will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
neceſſarily from all the former; and
the Conſolation will be both External
and Internal, <hi>viz.</hi> When the Spirit of
God, the Comforter, ſhall be poured
out ſo plentifully, and when the Spirit
ſhall have his Day, as the Father and
the Son had theirs. And when Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Holineſs, and Peace ſhall abound
on the Earth; when <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi>
and all that oppoſe the Kingdom of
Chriſt ſhall be deſtroyed, and Satan
bound and confined to the bottomleſs
Pit, during the <hi>Thouſand</hi> years. I ſay,
This muſt needs be a very comfortable

of many Generations, when violence

when they ſhall come and ſing in the

there hath been alwaies a mixture of
Light in the obſcureſt times, and there
the true Church hath been. There have
been Witneſſes to the Truth ever ſince

therefore we remit the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to their

and this true Church hath been viſible at
all times to them that are of the Light.
(For what can men in darkneſs ſee?)
The Day, you hear, hath been one all

things that are reproved (or diſcovered)

And therefore the true Church hath

                        <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy Light
is come, and the glory of the Lord is
riſen upon thee.</hi> And ſeeing the day
ſhortneth, and the ſhadows of the
Evening begin to be ſtretched out, let
us expect no more Dayes of Tranquillity
and Peace, but Wars, and rumours of
Wars, Nation lifting up Sword againſt
Nation, and learning of War, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
noiſe of Battle, and Garments rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in blood; For the Man upon the
red Horſe is gone forth, to whom pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is given to take Peace from the Earth;
and nearer the Evening ſtill the darker.
That which concerns us, is to be in a
Poſture of Humiliation and Prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
for the reception of theſe dark
Diſpenſations. Here is the Faith and
Patience of the Saints.</p>

God's ancient people, the Seed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though you want the
Light of Peace, be thankful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Light of Truth. For it is a
mercy that we have this part of the Light,
though we want the other; and of the
two, it it is far the better, ſeeing we
ſhould part with Peace for Truth, but
not with Truth for Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Text ſaith, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs
in that day, that the Light ſhall not be
clear nor dark;</hi> or (as after the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
<hi>not be precious nor thickneſs,</hi> which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44972:80"/>
ſheweth us, that the Light of Truth is
precious, and though that of Peace is
ſo likewiſe, yet not of equal value;
for Chriſt came not to ſend Peace on the
Earth, but the Sword, by the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Truth; which was of ſo
great eſteem with Him, that He bore
witneſs to it to the Death, even when
He witneſſed a good Confeſſion before
<hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> concerning the truth of his
Kingly Power and Government, which
the Apoſtle adjureth us to attend, as of
great moment, though <hi>Pilate</hi> ſlighted it,
ſaying, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> For he did
not propound that queſtion for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
in that he ſtayed not for an
anſwer, but ſhewed thereby, that he
looked upon truth, and particularly
that truth, concerning the Kingly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and Government of Chriſt, as a
pittiful Cauſe whereon to hazard the
Life of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Oh! The Truth there confeſſed by
Chriſt, is a precious Truth, a very great
Truth, and the Foundation of many
Truths, which Chriſt ſealed with his
Blood, which therefore we are adjured
in the ſight of God, who quickeneth all
things, and before Jeſus Chriſt, who
before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> witneſſed a good
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44972:81"/>
Confeſſion, to keep without ſpot, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukeable
until the appearing of the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Let us then love the Truth, and this
Truth, and improve it.</p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Seeing the Goſpel-day is not
equally lightſome in all the periods of it;
how thankful ſhould we be, that we
were born in a Time and Place of Light?
For great was the Darkneſs, and little
the Light, about <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven-ſcore</hi>
years paſt, when <hi>England</hi> lay under
the Darkneſs of <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Ignorance;
ſince when, it hath been turned from
the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Valley of Viſion. This heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the account of the Land we live in,
for the enjoyment of ſo great a mercy,
as no other Nation this day hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the like, eſpecially as to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Light that hath ſhined in it.
And though it will not be accompanied
with outward peace, yet it will not
want inward, if we keep cloſe to the
Light, and live up to it in this our
Day.</p>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Day being thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed
with Light and Darkneſs; Let
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44972:81"/>
us not wonder, nor be offended, that
there are ſuch varieties of Perſuaſions,
differing one from another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all of them cannot be of the Light,
whatever is pretended by them that do
profeſs unto them; but the Light hath
influence upon ſome of them, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon ſome other. So that God's
Heritage is unto him as a ſpeckled Bird,
which the Birds fly round about againſt
her: But however let us not fly one
againſt another, leſt we fly againſt our
ſelves, whiles we have our ſeveral fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and colours in this one Bird; but
let us bear with one another as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Light and Darkneſs, ſo long as
we are all enlightened with the ſaving
Knowledg of the Truth.</p>
                     <p>We ought not indeed to be <hi>Scepticks</hi>
in Religion, but every one to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
in his own mind, yet in ſome
things peradventure thou art in the
Light, and I am in the Dark; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Day perhaps ſhineth unto
me, and not to thee. Let us yield to
the Diſpenſation of the Day, and keep
the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of
Peace; and if in any thing we are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
minded, <hi>God ſhall reveal even
this unto us: Nevertheleſs, whereunto
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44972:82"/>
we have already attained,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>let us walk by
the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</hi>
For thus there are ſome in the Viſible
Church, who are be-miſted, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are enlightened, and yet all agree
in Fundamentals, who ought to live in
Unity, and the Stronger to exerciſe
Charity towards the Weaker; that
God, who hath begun to enlighten them
in other things, will acquaint them in
due time with thoſe Truths, whereof at
preſent they are ignorant: For it is
God alone who revealeth the Light unto
us. And He that formeth the Light,
and createth Darkneſs, may in ſome
things make it Day to one man, and
night to another. We are all (who
truly fear the Lord) Children of the
Light, and of the Day, and not of
the Night, nor of Darkneſs, as to our
ſtates, yet as to particular apprehenſions
in Truths of an inferiour nature, it may
be Day to one &amp; Night to another. And
thus it will be till the Evening cometh,
but then there ſhall be one heart,<note place="margin">Zech. 14. 9.</note> and
one way, <hi>one Lord, and his Name one.</hi>

                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Uſe 5.</note> What hath been held forth,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44972:82"/>
adminiſtreth a word of Comfort, <hi>That
this Goſpel-Day is known to the Lord,
from the Morning to the Evening of it.</hi>
He knoweth the Light and alſo the
Darkneſs, and who are in the one, and
who in the other, and how far. And
therefore He knoweth what is done by
the Children of the Night to introduce
Darkneſs, and to obſcure the Day of
the Goſpel. For the Day is his, and
the Night is his, He formeth Light and
Darkneſs, and therefore he ordereth
the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this
world, that no more either of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Error, Hereſie, Superſtition,
and Idolatry on the one ſide; or of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,
Perſecution, and hoſtile Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Truth and Peace on the
other, ſhall prevaile further than He
hath determined. And whatſoever He
hath appointed to be the portion of this
Day, as to the darkening of it, yet it
is our Comfort, that the Day is known
to the Lord, and that He will have a
care of it. For he ſeeth the Darkneſs as
well as the Light of the Day, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and the light are both alike to Him.
He hath ſeen the Day from the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to this moment, and hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and diſpoſed of the darkeneſs of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44972:83"/>
Ignorance, Error, Hereſie, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and likewiſe of Affliction and
Perſecution in it, in times of Pagan,
<hi>Arrian,</hi> or Antichriſtian oppoſition.
And his care of this Day is no leſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Evening of it, nor his love to
to it, &amp; abilitie to ſee to it, any leſs than
in the Morning, or Noon of it. He that
ſaid, <hi>I have ſeen I have ſeen the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of my People which are in Egypt,
and have heard their cry, by reaſon of
their Task-maſters; for I know their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;</hi>
knows all the Sorrows and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of his People in this Hour of the
Goſpel-day. It was a very dark Night
with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when God ſpake
theſe words to <hi>Moſes;</hi> for then was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in the Truth, what was ſignified
to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Type, when an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of great Darkneſs fell upon him.
And yet,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 12</note> I have ſeen, I have ſeen, and
I know, ſaith the Lord, in the midſt of
that horrid Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>And therefore however the Day
prove, and Clouds and darkneſs ariſe,
as perhaps they may do, marvel not at
the matter, for he that is higher than
the higheſt regardeth. Men and Devils
may be high, but God is higher, yea,
higher than the higheſt, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44972:83"/>
above the Superlative. God hath a
care of his Church and Goſpel, &amp; of ſuch
as Preach it, and profeſs it, only it is our
duty to be humbled for the ſins of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Miniſters, Profeſſors, which may
otherwiſe the more darken and imbitter
the Day that we are now entring into,
which calleth us to Prayer, Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Mourning, and Reformation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
if God aſſiſt us, it ſhall be well in
the end; <hi>and though weeping may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for a time, yet joy cometh in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For it ſhall come to paſs, that at
Evening-time it ſhall be Light.</hi>
