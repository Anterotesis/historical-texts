            <title>A measure of the times: and a full &amp; clear description of the signes of the times, and of the changing of the times; and of the reign of Antichrist, who hath long reigned, and of his down-fall, which is at hand; and of the kingdom of Christ which is now setting up in the earth. Shewing unto all people in all nations, what the state of things hath been in ages past, and what the state of things are at this present day. ... And also, here it is manifest, concerning the teachers of this age, and the root from whence they sprang, who are manifest to be of that stock of false prophets, which Christ prophesied of should come, and which the Apostles saw was coming in their dayes, and how that the night of darknesse hath been upon all, for many generations: ... And also, the restauration is described, which shortly cometh, wherein Christ shall reign, whose right it is, and shall change laws and decrees, and the lamb shall be the light of all nations, ... and their King shall possesse the uttermost parts of the earth. By one who hath measured the times, who is come to the day that hath made all things manifest. Edw: Burrough.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Hearken, and conſider, and let your eares be open to inſtruction; For the word of the Lord is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that your hearts may underſtand the things that belongs to your peace, now in your day, before the time come that they be hid from your eye, and your eye be darkned, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more to perceive, but you left to periſh, and to die with the uncircumciſed.</p>
               <p>Behold! and give eare, ye Inhabitants of the world; ſee, and conſider, in what time you are fallen, even in a time of darkneſſe and Apoſtacy, wherein thick darkneſſe covered all the world, and a vaile of ignorance the faces of all people; Death hath reigned King over all, and the Cloud of thick blindneſſe hath laid on the hearts of all men. O how hath darkneſſe, blindneſſe, and ignorance, covered all men, even
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118826:4"/>
as a cloak and a garment? How hath the eye been blinded, the eare ſtopped, and the heart hardned? So that the Lord God, and his way, his truth, and ſalvation, hath not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly known, heard, nor felt, nor witneſſed; for ages and generations: the words thereof have been profeſſed, but the power and life thereof hath not been enjoyed. But men have been deceived with the forme of Godlineſſe without the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and cheated with a likeneſſe of things without life; and have ſought the living among the dead, and worſhipped Idols which have been without ſence and underſtanding; and with lying imaginations, and feigned likeneſſes, hath the carnall part (which ruled in people above the ſeed of God) been fed, and with ſhadowes, and outward appearances, and the ſoule hath been ſtarved.</p>
               <p>Alas, alas! woe is me becauſe of theſe things; my heart within me is broken, and I am perplexed. The ſhadow of death hath been the lodging place of all people, and the vaile of ignorance hath been a covering, and the darkneſſe of heart hath been followed for a Law, and a blind underſtanding have been the guide, for ordinances and ſtatutes: and Death in the beaſtly power hath ruled as King, in all the dominions of the earth, and in all mens hearts; and men hath been without the wiſdome of God, even every eye blind, and every eare deafe, and every tongue dumb, and every heart corrupt, and void of underſtanding, and every foot lame, and all men have been altogether imperfect; for the living God hath been as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unto the children of men, leſſe known by men then the owner to the Ox, and leſſe perceived then the crib by the aſſe, and all fleſh hath corrupted its way before the Lord.</p>
               <p>Woe is me! when I conſider, how man who was planted with the choiſeſt vine, even Gods image, and was a noble plant, is degenerated into the plant of a ſtrange vine, unto God, and brings forth wilde grapes, and ſoure grapes, which the Lords ſoule loathes; and thus have the vineyard, and the plants thereof, rewarded the husbandman, with fruit of a bitter taſt, and with the reward of corruption; And man is condemned in his tranſgreſſion, for want of the knowledge of God, more then the Oxe, and the Aſſe.</p>

Pride, covetouſneſs, luſt, and envy, backbiting, lying, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, whoredome, theft, murder, and all manner of evill, and ſin againſt God, more then can be expreſſed, is abounding, and ſupera bounding among men in this Generation. Iniquity is grown to the full, the meaſure is up, and the number of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is ſealed, that the Lord may ariſe, who hath been preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as a cart with ſheaves; and now is the Lord arifing, and he hath ſaid, Ah, I will eaſe me of my adverſaries, and be avenged on my oppreſſors. And vengeance belongs to him, and he will repay, and will deſtroy the vineyard with the plants and fruits thereof, and the bryers and thorns ſhall be conſumed, and he will lay waſt, and devoure, and confound all his enemies in a day, when his indignation goes forth, and his ſword is made bare, and his purpoſe cometh to paſs, in rooting out the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſeed of evill doers, which hath filled his habitation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhould dwell, with curſed children, and a brood of evill births.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, was the hand and power of the Lord felt, and the Lord gat himſelfe a name and a glory; and he cauſed his marvelous light to ſpring forth, and his day to dawn, and the day was manifeſt, that many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and wiſe men had deſired to ſee, but was not in their time ſeen by them, and his power was made known, and his arme was made bare in the ſight of many Nations; and in that day his glory was ſpread abroad, and his truth and way was exalted, and his glorious Goſpell was declared through the earth, and the ſound of his marvelous works went forth into all the world; judgement and mercy was known, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and peace was witneſſed among men, and life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity was brought to light through the Goſpel, and the word of life by which all things was created, and by which they ſtand, was handled, ſeen, felt, and taſted, and the Lord God in that age was known to dwell with his people, and to walk in them, and his Covenant was eſtabliſhed with many, and his promiſes was fulfilled; redemption, deliverance and ſalvation, was revealed, even Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, the Prince of peace; And righteouſneſſe was made manifeſt in the ſons of men, and revealed in many who ſaw Gods glory, and was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

And many went forth into the world and declared through Nations the things of Gods kingdome, which was come to them, and was diſcovered within them; and the Lord God ſpake from Heaven by his Son unto them, and they were filled with the holy Ghoſt, and with power. And the Lord was with them whom he called, and made them wiſe, and their word powerfull, and their meſſage effectuall, and their weapons were mighty through God, and ſtrong holds were ſubdued, and the powers of death and darkneſs were ſubjected, and the hearts of thouſands were turned to God, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was preached in power through the world, and many were brought to God, out of darkneſſe into light, and from Satans power unto God. And the earth was filled with Light, and the mighty and the wiſe were confounded, and the bonds of cruel oppreſſions were broken, and they that ſet themſelves againſt the Lord and his way were confounded, and ſcattered, and brought to naught, though they were many in that generation.</p>

him, and his powerfull word, through the mouth of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; whom he ordained, and called, who were fiſhermen, and ſuch like, who were choſen to fullfill his will, and to doe his worke, and not many wiſe men of the world were called, but God choſe the fooliſh things to confound the wiſe, then as he doth now; and ſuch were honoured by the Lord, and bearers of his name, and of his meſſage, and glad tideings, though they were contemned of men; yet unto ſuch he gave the authority to overturne the wiſe, and to outreach the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world, for they were learned of the father, and had the knowledge of his wayes though they were unlearned in the arts, and crafts of men, which ſtands more in pollicy, and ſubtilty, then in the feare, and wiſdome of God; and in that day the Lord was with his people, while his people was with him, and he loved them while they ſtood in his counſell, and he gave them dominion over all their enemies; and they were a terrour to the whole world, while the churches ſtood in the dread, and terrour of the Lord of hoaſts, yea all bowed under them, and their feet trod upon the high places of the earth, and they were bleſſed of the Lord, above all people; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till they waxed fat, and were increaſed in treaſures, and thought they had need of nothing, and then they forgat God, and rebelled againſt him, and became perverſe in their wayes, and grew into ſtrange Idolatries, and errors, and left the way of truth, and caſt Gods Law behinde them; and the power of godlineſſe ceaſed, and the forme grew, and it was exalted more then power, and love waxed cold, when iniquity abounded; and men became lovers of themſelves, more then of the Lord; and the Lord, and his marvellous workes which had been brought to paſſe were forgotten, and hardneſſe of heart, and unbeliefe entered, and then the falſe prophets, and antichriſts came in, which Chriſt had propheſied of, and eſtabliſhed the forme of godlineſſe, without the power, and ſubverted many (even whole houſes, and Countries) from the ſimplicity of Chriſt Jeſus; ſo that many became inſenſible, and grew paſt feeling of the power, and operation of God, and their minds became blinded, and their eares ſtopped; and God was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who had brought up children, and they forgat him, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118826:6"/>
rebelled againſt him; for the Churches became corrupted, and loſt the life, and power of God, and the holy ghoſt; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Idolaters, and worſhipers of Idolls, and as you may read <hi>Paul</hi> propheſied that many ſhould depart from the faith, and give heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and to the doctrine of Devills; and grievous wolves ſhould enter, not ſparing the flock, but ſeeking to devoure it, and would make havock, and merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of ſoules, through coveteouſneſſe, and filthy lucre, and perilous times would come, wherein their ſhould be a forme of godlineſſe, and not the power; and in that generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſoone after his deceaſe, this came to paſſe, and was fullfilled; and as you may read in the revelations the churches grew into ſuperſtitions, and Idolatries, the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had loſt her firſt love, and her candleſtick was to be removed, and ſo it came to paſſe; and ſome in the church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> were in the blaſphemy, ſaying they were Jewes, and were not, but were the ſinagogues of Satan; and the church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> ſome among them held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and to eat things ſacrificed to Idolls, and to commit fornication, and ſome held the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which God hated, and againſt them would the Lord fight with the ſword of his mouth; and the church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> ſuffered that woman <hi>Jezabell</hi> to propheſie, and to teach, and ſeduced the ſervants of the Lord to commit fornication, and to eat things ſacrificed unto Idolls; and ſhe, and her lovers was to be caſt into a bed of torment, and her children ſhould be killed with death; and all the churches ſhould know, that God ſearched the reines, and the hearts, and every one ſhould receive according to their deeds; and the church of <hi>Sardis</hi> had only a name to live, but was dead, and her work was not perfect before God, and upon them would the Lord come as a thiefe, and they ſhould be in darkneſſe, and not know what houre he would come. And the church of the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> were luke warme, and neither hot, nor cold, and the Lord would ſpew her out of his mouth, for ſhe was wretched, and miſerable, and poore, and blinde, and naked, and the ſhame of her nakedneſſe did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; and if any had an eare to heare, they might heare; theſe things were ſpoken by him that lives for ever, the firſt,

and the laſt, the beginning, and the Amen; ſo that hereby the Lords ſoul was vexed, and his ſpirit grieved, and his wrath was ſuddenly kindled againſt them, who were revolters, and backſliders from his way of ſalvation, which he had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to them, through the mouth of his ſervants; ſo that his fury went out againſt them to overthrow them, and to break them to pieces; and they being turned from his Law, and from his ſtatutes, he gave them up unto their own hearts deſire, and brought in the heathen upon them, to confound them, who broke them aſunder, and trod down many of their Cities, and gained great Ports of their dominions, and made them ſlaves by multitudes, and overthrew their worſhip, and ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their power; even the Turks, and baſe uncircumciſed people made a prey upon them, and poſſeſſed their habitations, and ſet up abominable Idolatries in the place where Gods honour had dwelt; and their dominions, and treaſures without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſpoyle to the teeth of devourers; for they having loſt the terrour, of the Lord, he brought up the heathen to be a terrour unto them, whoſe power was mightier then they, and overcame them, they being without the power of God; and this juſtly came upon them, according to the purpoſe of the Lord, becauſe of their backſlidings; And others of them, who was not ſo given up to the will of an outward enemy, yet were they given up to ſtrange Idolatries and ſubverſion, and ſetting up images, and worſhiped that which is not God, but abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him, to this day; ſo that the holy City, which had been full of glory, was given to the Gentiles to be troden downe; and under their poluted feet hath it been ſtamped, and to their mouth hath it been a prey, for ſuch a time, even ſince theſe things came to paſſe, unto this day; as you may read, and the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, hath ruled in oppreſſion, and the great whore hath made all Nations drunke with the wine of her fornication; All the great men, and Princes, and nobles, and all the people upon earth have been made drunke by her, and touched her uncleanneſſe, and ever ſince the day wherein the backſliding entered, ſhe hath fit upon nations, and kindreds, and tongues, and people, and hath been decked in divers colours, to deceive the hearts of all people, and all

Nations have been deceived by her, and the beaſt and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe dominion hath been great, hath upheld wickedneſſe by a Law, and eſtabliſhed Idolatry by decrees, and all have been out of the way, and wandring in blindneſſe, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, even the whole world have worſhiped the Beaſt, and gone after the falſe Prophet, which ſits upon the Beaſt, and his power protects him, till they be both overthrowne into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and caſt alive into the Lake, which now the Lord is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to doe in power, and dominion: and great <hi>Babylon</hi> is coming into remembrance before the Lord, and as ſhe hath done, ſo ſhall it be done to her, her children is daſhing againſt the ſtones, and her offſpring is withering away, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is vaniſhing, and the Sun is appearing, and the beaſtly power ſhall be ſubdued, and the falſe Prophet confounded, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the old Dragon ſhall be bound, and chained, never more to deceive; for the Beaſt hath had a long reigne with his falſe Prophet, who have propheſied lies, and falſe divinations, and led away the minds of all people.</p>
               <p>For marke; and conſider, Chriſt Jeſus who came into the world, with glad tidings of good things, even with peace, and ſalvation: he ſaid the glorious day was come, and even that day which many Prophets and wiſe men had deſired to ſee, but had not ſeen; the earth was filled with light, as I have ſaid, yet he farther propheſied, and ſaid, that the night would come when no man could work, and that in the laſt dayes falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould ariſe, and deceive many, and ſhould come into the world, and ſhould cry loe here, and loe there is Chriſt, and and if it were poſſible ſhould deceive the very elect; and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his time, who had been an eye-witneſſe of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and had handled, and taſted, and felt the word of life, and had been with Jeſus, and bore a true teſtimony unto him; in that very age, and generation, he ſaw the falſe Prophets, and antichriſts come, and coming in, and aluded to the very ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, by this we know ſaid he, that it is now the laſt time, for there are now many falſe Prophets, and antichriſts gone out into the world, they were not of the true Apoſtles, but went out from among them, (being gone out from the light in their own particulars) and beguiled the hearts of the

ſimple, by good words, and faire ſpeeches, and went in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> way for gifts and rewards, and in <hi>Caines</hi> way to envy, and murder, as you may read in the Scripture; ſo that in <hi>Johns</hi> time, the falſe Prophets which Chriſt foretold off, were come, and they did deceive many according as Chriſt had ſaid, and they drew many from the wayes of God, and ſubverted many from the truth, and made havocke of the flock, and were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wolves, according as <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, and truth began to perriſh from among men, and the power thereof ceaſed, and the apoſtacy came in, and the forme was ſet up for a ſeaſon; ſo that <hi>John</hi> farther ſaw, and ſaid the whole world went after the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, whom he ſaw before was come, and worſhiped the Beaſt, and his image. But a few whoſe names were written in the book of life; and as I have ſaid the holy City with the outward Court, was troden down by the Gentiles foot, and darkneſſe ſurprized all, and wickedneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded more, and more; and the night came upon all, as Chriſt had propheſied, and the Beaſt grew in his dominion: till there was hardly any man left to beare witneſſe in the truth, and in the power of God, unto the name of Jeſus; but all was ſubverted into dead formes, and ſhaddowes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes without life, and the Lord left the earth, as it were, and covered himſelfe in the darkneſſe; and became a ſtranger in the world, and did ſcarce openly ſpeake by viſion, nor dream, nor Prophet, but all were left in the darke, and ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, and ſuperſtition was exalted; the Saints ſpirit, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Pope he is a head, and the others they have a head, which every one bowes down under his own head; the Pope will not bow to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants head, nor will the Proteſtants bow to the Papiſts head, the Preſbiterians, and Independants, and Anibaptiſts, and the reſt, every one of them bowes to their own head, and will not bow to anothers head. and all theſe with their hornes puſhes one againſt another, to rend one another; and all theſe are from Chriſt, and knowes not him the one head of the whole body, and the one horn of Gods ſalvation, unto all people: for Chriſt which is but one is the head, and the horne, which all the Saints, who are now gathered out of this apoſtacie, and dark night, unto whom the Light againe is riſen, worſhips Chriſt the one head, and knowes him the one horn, which puſhes againſt the Devils Kingdome, which hath long been ſet up, and ruled in the earth among all theſe, who have many heads, and many hornes, who are all of them (the very chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt) but in the night fallen, in the apoſtacie, and darkneſſe, ſince the beginning of the reigne of the Beaſt, and the comi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were taken of the earth, ſome by cruell death, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was baniſhed, then they ſprung in more fully, and grew through all Nations; and to this day hath the Beaſt, with his many heads, and hornes, ruled in Nations, and been worſhiped, and his falſe prophet hath ever ſince been defended, and riden on the Beaſt, through Nations, and hath deceived the Nations with vanity, and errour; and at this very day the Nations, and people are deceived, and lies under darkneſſe, in the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and bondage, under the authority of the Beaſt, and ſubject to the doctrine of his falſe Prophets.</p>
               <p>And as I have ſaid darkneſſe hath been over all, and fancies, and likneſſes without life have been bowed under, and the power being loſt, the forme hath been ſet up, one after this ſort, and another after that, according to mens vaine conceits, and apprehenſions upon the Scriptures, and not according to the manifeſtation of the Spirit of God, which fulfills the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and brings to live the life of them.</p>
               <p>So in divers colours, and in divers appearances, and Robes, in ſeverall formes, and ſhapes of garments hath the great whore been decked, who hath ſit upon the Beaſt, haveing the falſe Prophet ſerving as a boy, or ſervant, to doe whatſoever the whore liſteth. And the falſe Prophet, this ſervant to the whore, under the power of the Beaſt, hath moved, and turned as the Beaſt would. And according as the whore hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her ſelfe into other garments, and colours; even ſo hath the falſe Prophet changed his doctrine, and prayers to pleaſe the whore, and to keepe people under the goverment of the Beaſt. It's knowne in this our day, that ſome who preached, and prayed for the King, and Biſhops, doe now preach, and pray for others, even for them who deſtroyed King, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; ſo the falſe Prophet with all his children, is but the whores ſervant, who hath made drunk Kings, and Princes, and great men, and people, and Nations, with the cup of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and abomination, in the ſeverall ſects, and formes of worſhips, which hath been ſet up, without the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe;

for the Babtiſme of the Spirit being loſt, and not known, then from the letter by imaginations, were ſeverall ſorts of Baptiſme brought forth, as ſprinkling of infants, that darke folly, and vaine vanity, which all theſe Nations have been deceived withall, by the exerciſe of the falſe Prophet. And when the gift of the miniſtery, through the holy ghoſt, which the miniſters of Chriſt had, was loſt, and not any more received.</p>
               <p>Then began men to make Miniſters, by naturall learning, and artes, and languages, and humane pollicie, and when the gift of preaching by the eternall Spirit was loſt, through the coming in of the Apoſtacie, then began men to ſtudy from Books, and writings, what to preach, and ſay, not having the holy ghoſt received in them, which none is a miniſter of Chriſt without, (marke that) and when men had, loſt through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, the knowledge of God dwelling in them, and that their bodyes was his temple, and that he dwelled and walked in his people, then began they againe to build Temples with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and to ſet up their falſe worſhips in them; for having loſt the ſenſe of Gods true worſhip, which the Saints worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in, in the Spirit, and in the truth. Then they began to worſhip in ſet dayes, and ſet times, and ſet places, and outward obſervances, which is not the worſhip of God in the Spirit, and in the truth, but ſuperſtitious, and Idolatrous; and when the word of God was not received immediately from his mouth, nor the Goſpel by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, as it was in the dayes of the Apoſtles, then (darkneſſe being come in) they uſed their tongues when the Lord had not ſpoken to them, as the falſe Prophets did before Chriſts time; and long have they ſaid the letter is the word, and that the letter is the Goſpel, and that it muſt be received by the Scriptures, and by naturall learning, and artes, and that none can be miniſters of Chriſt, but ſuch who are learned in the languages, and knowes the originall of Scriptures, Latine, and Greek, and Hebrew, not any of theſe have received the Goſpel, by revelation, or the word of God from his mouth. And when ſinging in the Spirit, and with underſtanding was ceaſed, and not knowne then began people to get the forme of ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences

in rime, and meeter; and when the pure power of godlineſſe was loſt, which was in the dayes of the Apoſtles manifeſted, and known, then in the Apoſtacie, the deceit grew into the forme of every thing, which the Saints had enjoyed in the power; and ſo was ſhaddowes ſet up inſtead of ſubſtance, and death inſtead of life, and the forme without the power, which in many branches ſprang forth, ſome into one appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſome into another; but all under the power of the Beaſt, with his many heads, and hornes defended; and untill this day, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, thus it hath been, and thoſe very teachers, and ſuppoſed miniſters, which now are in this, and other Nations, are of that very root which ſprang forth in the dayes of the Apoſtles; and they are under the dominion of the Beaſt, and moveable like unto the great whore; and this may eaſily be proved that they are of that generation of teachers, and falſe Prophets, which Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of ſhould come, and which the Apoſtles ſaw was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their dayes, and of thoſe which <hi>John</hi> ſaw the world to run after; for Chriſt ſaid by their fruites they ſhould be known, and the Apoſtles they deſcribed their fruits, and them by their fruites; And ſo we ſeeing their fruit to be the very ſame now, which the Apoſtles deſcribed was the fruit of them, that then was come, and coming; from whence we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude according to ſound judgment, that theſe very teachers are of the ſame generation, and branches of the ſame root, which ſprang forth then. And in <hi>Pauls</hi> writeings you may read, ſuch they were, whom he ſaw, of whom he bad people to beware, and ſaid perilous times would come, and men ſhould be lovers of themſelves, covetons, proud, blaſphemers, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to parents, unthankfull, unholy, without naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, falſe accuſers, fierce diſpiſers of thoſe that are good, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, high minded, lovers of pleaſures, more then lovers of God, having a forme of godlineſſe, but denying the power, and ſuch of whom people were ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; for people were laden with ſins, and led away with divers luſts; and theſe did reſiſt the truth, as <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> who withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likeneſſes without life, and they were men of corrupt

minds, and reprobate concerning the faith. Now it is plaine that theſe teachers in this generation are of that very ſtock which <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes, ſuch he ſaw would come, and ſuch we ſee are come, and by their fruits we know them, as Chriſt ſaid; and <hi>Pauls</hi> words are fullfilled, for theſe teachers are lovers of themſelves, and covetous, and proud, this is plaine to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and blaſphemers, who denyes Chriſt to have lighted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that comes into the world, and therefore they deny Scripture, and ſo are diſobedient, and unholy men, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naturall affection, who many of them have cauſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent to be impriſoned, and ſome have dyed in Priſon, and they the chiefe cauſe of this, and this is without naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the creatures; and they are falſe accuſers, and liers, and fierce in their books and preaching, as is manifeſt through all this Nation; and they greatly deſpiſe thoſe that are good, and prepares war againſt ſuch, as doth not put into their mouthes; and they are heady, and high minded, and lovers of vanities, and pleaſures, this is evident without proofe, and they have a forme of godlineſſe; they ſay all ſhould be taught of God, but when any comes to witneſſe it, and denyes their teaching, they cry againſt ſuch as Heriticks, and thus they have the words, and the forme, but denyes the power; and they are ever teaching twenty and fourty yeares, and more, but none able ever to come to the knowledge of the truth by them, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Now theſe teachers are of that ſtock which is departed from the true faith; for they are without true faith, and reprobate concerning it, who are in iniquity, and ſin, and the workes of the world which are evill; now faith purifies the heart from all this; but their hearts are not puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but poluted with covetouſneſſe, and preaching for hire, and perſecuting, and envy; and therefore they have not faith, and ſo are of that generation which departed from the faith, after the Apoſtles times, which they ſaw would come; and theſe doth ſeduce, and their doctrines are of the Devill, who denyes the truth which the Scripture beares witneſſe of; and ſaith ſprinkling infants with water, when they are two or three days old is Baptiſme into the faith of Chriſt; this is the doctrine of the Devill, and lies they ſpeak in great numbers, and in hypocriſie, and writes them forth to the world in great hypocriſie, with feignedneſſe, and pretence of holineſſe; and its plaine many of their conſciences are ſeared; how doe many of them cauſe the poore people to ſuffer grievous impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſpoyling of their goods, to the ruine of families al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, for their maintenance, as tythes, and ſuch like, which if their conſciences were not ſeared they could not doe; alſo ſome of them cryed to the rude wicked people, in their Idoll Temples, fight lads for the Goſpel; and many who have borne witneſſe to the truth, and againſt their deceits, have been beat, and abuſed, and knocked downe as for dead in their preſence; and their conſciences are abſolute ſeared, elſe they would tremble at theſe things.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſaw falſe Prophets would come in, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. And falſe teachers, who would bring in damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them; and many ſhould follow their pernicious wayes, and through cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe with feigned words, they would make merchandize of people; and they would walke after the fleſh in the luſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118826:11"/>
of uncleaneſſe, and deſpiſe government, and be preſumptuous, and ſelfe willed, and not afraid to ſpeak evill of dignities, and they would ſpeak evill of things they underſtand not, and their hearts are exerciſed with covetous practiſes, and were curſed children, and they ſport themſelves with their own deceivings, and theſe had forſaken the right way, and are gone aſtray fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who loved the wayes of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and theſe are clouds that are carryed with a Tempeſt, and they ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity, and while they promiſe to others liberty, themſelves are the ſervants of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And ſuch were ſcoffers, and mockers which would come after the Apoſtles dayes, and they would walke after their own luſts.</p>
               <p>And now according to this propheſie of <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaw falſe teachers coming in, he gave theſe characters of them, whereby it doth plainly appeare that this generation of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers are they, and of that ſtock which then came in; for theſe brings forth the very ſame fruits, which they did, which he ſpoke of, and we knowe them by their fruits, as Chriſt hath ſaid; for theſe have filled the world with damnable hereſies, as holding forth that ſprinkling infants with water is baptiſme into the faith of Chriſt, and that a ſleeple-houſe is the church, and that ſinging <hi>Davids</hi> experiences in the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wicked people in rime, and meeter, is ſinging to the praiſe of God, and theſe are damnable hereſies, even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Lord that bought them; for they deny the light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt given to every man to be the only tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and the only guide of man, and they that doe deny the light of Chriſt with which every man that comes into the world is lighted to be ſufficient to lead to Chriſt, and to the Kingdome of God (as theſe teachers in this age doe) they deny the Lord that bought them; and many, even whole Nations, all the world as <hi>John</hi> ſaw in the revelations have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their pernicious wayes, and run after their Idolatry, and pernicious wayes of ſuperſtitions, and they doe make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of ſoules, through covetouſneſſe with their feigned words; for where they can make their bargaine to have the moſt money, there they will preach, and no where elſe, and if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118826:11"/>
any will give them more the next yeare, they will ſell that people, and goe to another, for very covetouſneſſe, by feigned words, and they doe walke after the fleſh, in the luſt of pride, and covetouſneſſe, which is uncleaneſſe of the fleſh; and they deſpiſe the Saints government and order; for they will not ſuffer the Saints to propheſie one by one in their aſſemblies, according to the Saints government, but doth deſpiſe that, and perſecute it by the government of the Beaſt, unto whoſe government they are ſubject, and not to the government of Chriſt, and the Saints; and thus they are preſumptuous, and ſelfe-willed, preſuming to afflict, and cauſe the children of God to be caſt into priſon, and ſuffering them to be beat, and abuſed by their flock, out of their wicked ſelfe wills, and they are not afraid to ſpeak evill of dignities, and doth ſpeak evill of the wayes of God, and of his truth which they underſtand not; and their hearts are exerciſed with covetous practiſes, and are curſed children; for they make poor people that hath but ten eggs give them one, and that hardly can get any fewell for the fire, pay them a penny for the ſmoake; with ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other exceeding covetous practiſes, as ſuing men two hundred mile to anſwer for three ſhillings claimed by them for tithes.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſport themſelves in their vanities, in their own deceiving, and when they have oppreſſed people for their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and makes people pay them for whom they doe no work, and forces wages from them that never hired them, which is unheard of, covetous practiſes; they ſport themſelves in their pride, and luſtfullneſſe, and they are out of the right way, and gone aſtray from the wayes of God which are holy, and are in the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who went after unrighteous wages, who ſought for enchantment againſt <hi>Jſrael,</hi> as theſe doe; and theſe loves unrighteous wages, by taking maintenance from people by force, unto whom is nothing oweing by them, and theſe are carried with a Tempeſt of every wind, according as the powers of the earth blowes, theſe are carried ſometime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a government, and ſometime againſt it, and ſo are clouds carried about, and are unſetled on the foundation, and they ſpeak great words of Chriſt, and God, and the Scriptures,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118826:12"/>
which are but words ſtolen by them, becauſe they are not ſpoken by the Spirit of God, but by a lying Spirit, and they promiſe to others liberty, that they ſhall receive the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God after death, and that Chriſt hath taken away their ſins, with ſuch like promiſes of liberty, but themſelves are the ſervants of corruption, living in pride, and hatred, and covetouſneſſe, and theſe ſerve ſin, and are ſervants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they are ſcoffers, and mockers, and walkers after their own luſts, as it is evident in all mens ſight. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgment of truth, we judge theſe teachers of this generation, to be of the ſame root which then ſprang forth; for theſe brings forth the ſame fruites, as they in that time did; and in the apoſtacy they have over-ſpread the whole world; and alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> gave a deſcription of them, according as <hi>Peter</hi> had done; he ſaw certaine men creeping in, who turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe, and they were filthy dreamers, and knowes nothing, but what they know naturally, as bruit Beaſts, and in that they corrupt themſelves; and they have gone in the way of <hi>Caine,</hi> and run greedrly after the errour of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and they are trees whoſe fruit withereth, rageing waves of the Sea, foaming out their own ſhame, wandering Starres, they are murmurers, and complainers, walking after their own luſts, having mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in admiration, becauſe of advantage, and theſe ſeperate themſelves ſenſuall, having not the Spirit; and of this ſort which <hi>Jude</hi> deſcribeth are theſe teachers in this generation, whoſe fore fathers crept in, in the Apoſtles dayes, and theſe are their curſed children, which now abounds in theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at this day; and they are filthy dreamers, ſtudying for what they ſpeak, and dreaming without the Spirit of God an houre in a Pulpit, and what they know it is naturally, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall learning, and naturall arts, and in that knowledge they are alſo corrupted, in pride, and vaine glory, and vanities, like bruit Beaſts in their apparrell, and practiſes, and not like miniſters of the Goſpel nor Saints; and they are in <hi>Caines</hi> way, in envy, and murder, and wrath, abounding; no people like them, and they doe run greedily after <hi>Balaams</hi> errour, for gifts, and rewards, and unrighteous wages, which they run
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118826:12"/>
after greedily; and they are trees who brings forth theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed fruits, which will wither, and fade away; and they are like raging proud waves of the Sea, foaming out their ſhame in lies, and ſlanders, and curſed ſpeaking, in publick, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and they have no habitation in the firmament of God, but are wandering Starres, and ſometime in one opinion, and ſometime in another, but the blackneſſe of darkneſſe is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for them, and the judgment of the great day; and they are murmurers, and complainers, and they can never have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but ſeekes for their gaine from their quarter, as the falſe Prophets did in <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> time, and they have mens perſons in admiration, becauſe of advantage to themſelves, bowing, and worſhiping mens perſons, who will advantage them in their wages, or hire, and maintenance, begging favour of the Magiſtrates, and having their perſons in admiration, that they may have their advantage in oppreſſing poor people in tythes, in this, their wickedneſſe is hard to be expreſſed; and theſe have ſeperated themſelves, into ſelfe ſeperation, ſome into one forme gathered, and ſome into another, but all ſenſuall, and in the wiſdome which is from below, and without the Spirit of God,</p>
               <p>And thus it is proved that theſe teachers of this age are of the ſame ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eration, in their practiſes, which <hi>Jude</hi> deſcribeth to be creeping in in his time. And farther the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> 1. epiſtle 4. He ſaw that the falſe Prophets, and Antichriſts, which Chriſt propheſied of to come, was come in his dayes, and ſaid many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world, which is the Spirit of Antichriſt, whereof you have heard, ſaid <hi>John,</hi> and even now already is it in the world, and they were of the world, and the world heard them; and ſo are this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of teachers, who ſucceeds them that went forth into the world then; theſe are of the world, in its wayes pride, and wickedneſſe, covetouſneſſe, and envy, and all evill, and they that are in the evill of the world, in wickedneſſe heareth them, and maintaineth them; ſo that according to <hi>Johns</hi> deſcription, theſe teachers of this age are of that ſame flock which came in then; and <hi>John</hi> further ſaw that all the world was gone after them, and worſhiped the Beaſt which was then riſen,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118826:13"/>
and run after the falſe Prophet, which then came in, and fat upon the Beaſt, and its plaine that the world is all run after them, untill this day, which is a day of bringing back againe from the falſe Prophet, and from under the power of the Beaſt, and the Beaſt, and his image; and the falſe Prophet, and his divinations muſt down to the ground; and according as <hi>John</hi> further propheſied, the holy Citywhich had been troden down under the Gentiles feet, for ſuch a time ſhould againe be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Saints ſhould have the dominion, and the old Dragon ſhould be chained, and Chriſt ſhould reigne, and his Kingdome ſhould be ſet up in the earth, and the Tabernacle of God ſhould be with men; and this is the day that the Lord is reſtoring againe the way of peace, which long hath been loſt, and the power of God is againe witneſſed, which hath not been known for generations.</p>
               <p>So that of things ſpoken this is the ſum of truth, and the word of the Lord God to all people on the earth; that in the dayes of Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, it was a glorious day of light, and life, and power, and the Lord gathered a people which honoured his name, while they ſtood with him, and in his counſell walked; but ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, hath been an Apoſtacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and darkneſſe over all, and a ſubverſion upon all, and night have been over all, wherein no man could work as Chriſt ſaid, and formes without power have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the pure way of God hath not been known in its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that this time wherein all are fallen, is a time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, of the reigne of the Beaſt, which all the world hath wandred after, and a time wherein the Gentiles feet hath tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down the holy City, and a time wherein all the world runs after the falſe Prophet, and are deceived, and made drunk with the wine of the whores fornications. I ſay this is the time wherein all the men of this generation are fallen, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fulfilled, the night wherein no man can work is upon the world, and further this is the time of Antichriſts dominion, which hath exalted himſelfe in the ſeat of God, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be God; and long hath he reigned with the Beaſt and the falſe Prophet, ever ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles; and theſe ſame teachers of this generation which now are in the

world are manifeſt by their fruit, to be of that generation of that ſeed, and flock of falſe Prophets, which Chriſt propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſhould come in the laſt time after his dayes, and which moſt of the Apoſtles ſaw coming in, in their dayes, by their fruites I ſay they are known, for theſe brings forth the ſame fruites, and beares the ſame markes which they deſcribed thoſe did, in their time; ſo we ſee Chriſts propheſie is fulfilled, who ſaid they ſhould come; for they are come, and the Apoſtles deſcriptions are fullfilled on theſe; for theſe teachers are ſuch as beares the ſame characters as is proved, as they ſaid they ſhould beare that would come; and long hath the Nations been deceived, and kept under the worſhip of the Beaſt, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the falſe Prophet; and we ſee <hi>Johns</hi> propheſie is fulfilled, who ſaid that the holy City was given to be troden under the feet of the Gentiles; for ſo we ſee it hath been for many generations, and alſo we know the time is now approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, that the dominion of the Beaſt is near an end, and the holy City ſhall the Saints poſſeſſe, and the Gentiles ſhall be driven out of it, according as <hi>John</hi> ſaid, who wrote the laſt of any of the Apoſtles, and gave full teſtimony of theſe things which I have declared of, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of an Apoſtacy, and reigning of the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, and a ſubverſion from the wayes of God; and this hath been, and come to paſſe; alſo he propheſied of the gaining of the holy City, in again to the Saints, and of a reſtoration, wherein new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be made manifeſt from heaven, and ſhould againe be adorned, as a bride for her husband, and the Saints ſhould inhabit it, and the Tabernacle of God ſhould be with men upon earth, and the Lord would dwell for ever with his people; and this day is approaching nigh at the doors, for the fig tree hath bloſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and we know it is near at hand, the ſummer wherein the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed unto all Nations, and they ſhall know that he is the Lord God Almighty that will take vengeance upon the great whore, who hath made all drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p>And now after the long night of Apoſtacy, and darkneſſe which hath been upon the face of the earth, is the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and his day dawning, and his light breaking forth as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118826:14"/>
the glory of the morning, and the Kingdome of God is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and his dominion is ſetting up, after the long reigne of the Beaſt, who hath had his power, and his ſeat, and his great authority from the dragon, after whom the whole world hath wandered, and him hath worſhiped, who have been ſaying who is like unto the Beaſt, who is able to make war with him? his mouth for many generations hath been opened in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, and his name; and he hath made war with the Saints, and his power hath overcome them (marke) overcome them, and then himſelf hath reigned, and the reigne of Chriſt for many yeares hath not been known, but over kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and tongues, and Nations hath the Beaſt had power, and over them hath reigned for many ages, and all that dwell upon the earth hath worſhiped him, whoſe names are not written in the book of life; the earth hath been cauſed, and them that dwell therein to worſhip the Beaſt, and by his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, and as many as would not worſhip the Beaſt and his image, the Beaſt hath had power that they ſhould be killed, and many hath he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who would not worſhip him, and are perſecuted; and both ſmall, and great, rich, and poor, free, and bond, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the marke of the Beaſt, and the number of his name, which is the number of a man; he that reads let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; theſe things hath come to paſſe, and been fulfilled ſince the Apoſtles dayes, in this night wherein no man could worke, which Chriſt ſaid would come; but now the fourty, and two monthes, which time the Beaſt, and his image was to continue, and ſo long was his power to remaine to make war, and to overcome the Saints.</p>
               <p>I ſay the time is well nigh expired, and finiſhed, and the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb is ariſen to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Beaſt, and his image, who hath reigned over the Kingdomes of the world, and the judgment of the great whore cometh, who hath ſit upon the Beaſt, and drunken the blood of the Saints, and with whom the Kings of the earth (ſince the Apoſtles dayes) have committed fornication, and all the inhabiters of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication; and all the merchants of the earth hath been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118826:14"/>
made rich through the aboundance of her delicacies; and ſhe hath ſit upon the ſcarlet coloured Beaſt, and her cup in her hand hath been full of abominations, and filthineſſe of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and her name is miſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots; and all the Kings of the earth hath given their power unto the Beaſt, and committed fornication with the great whore; and ſhe hath ſit over people, and multitudes, and Nations, and tongues (ſince the Apoſtles dayes) and even ſome who have hated the whore, and fulfilled the will of God, and made the whore naked, yet they give their power alſo to the Beaſt, untill the word of God be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Conſider theſe things you that hath an ear to heare; but now the mighty day of the Lord, and the judgment of the whore is approaching, wherein ſhe ſhall be rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her works, and double ſhall be given her into her cup, and as ſhe hath loved blood, ſo ſhall blood be given her to drinke, and the merchants of the earth ſhall lament her, whom they have waxen rich by, who hath glorified her ſelfe, and lived deliciouſly, and hath ſaid in her heart, I ſit as a Queene, and am no widow, and ſhall not ſee ſorrow; but now the one day is dawning, wherein her plagues ſhall come, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhe ſhall utterly be burned with fire; for ſtrong is the Lord that is riſen to judge her, and the Kings, and merchants, and all the inhabiters of the earth ſhall lament her, and ſhall cry, Alas, alas! and now are they beginning, for the hour is come that her judgment cometh, and all her merchants, who have trafiqued with the ſouls of men ſhall partake of her plagues, who have partaked of her ſins, and lived deliciouſly with her, and the fruites that her ſoul luſted after ſhall depart from her, and all things that are dainty, and goodly, ſhall depart from her, and ſhe ſhall find them no more at all, when her judgment cometh and in an hour all her riches is come to nought, and her merchants at land and Sea ſhall lament her; even her that hath ruled over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſit as a Queene for many generations, ever ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles, untill this day; yea all that have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after her, even the whole world ſhall lament, and bemoan her; and ſuch as have ſerved her, and made ſlaves of the ſouls

of men, by merchandize, and trafique ſhall bewaile her, and their gaine ſhall ceaſe for ever, for in one hour ſhall ſhe be made deſolate, and her glory ſhall fade, and her beauty ſhall wither, and the Beaſt that hath carried her ſhall utterly faint, and the falſe prophet that hath wrought miracles in their ſight, and deceived the Nations ſhall be caſt into a bed of torment with her, and the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet ſhall be taken, and caſt alive into the Lake of fire to be tormented for ever day, and night, world without end; and the whore in whom hath been found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were ſlaine upon the earth, and the Beaſt who hath cauſed all that dwell on the earth to worſhip him, and his image, for many ages, and the falſe Prophet who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the whole world, and all Nations, and made them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the power of the Beaſt, by his miracles which he hath wrought in the ſight of men; theſe ſhall be plagued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and tormented together; for the falſe Prophet, and the Beaſt hath ſent forth their uncleane ſpirits, like frogs unto all the Kings of the earth, and unto the whole world to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to battell with their Armies to make war againſt him that ſits on the white horſe, even the Son of God; and this is the falſe Prophet which Chriſt proheſied of to come, which long ſince came, and hath ſerved the Beaſt, and the great whore; for many generations, and many even all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been deceived as Chriſt ſaid, and led aſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bewitched by him; And as I have ſaid theſe teachers of this generation are of them, of their Root, and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring which long hath flouriſhed on the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>But the day is at hand, that the heaven, and the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Prophets ſhall rejoyce over the whore, and over the falſe Prophet; for the Lord comes to avenge us on her, and as ſhe hath done, ſo ſhall it be done unto her; now in this day wherein <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be builded againe, and the holy City which the Gentiles have trod under foot, for fourty and two monthes, which time is expired, and near a full end, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting from the dayes of the coming in of the Apoſtacy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day, if any have an eare to heare let him heare; this I

And the glory of the Lord is riſen, and his day is breaking forth more abundantly, and the Lambe is given for a light, and all Nations that are ſaved ſhall walke in the Light of the Lambe, and the King of righteouſneſſe, (who hath been long fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> while <hi>Herod</hi> the Beaſt, which hath ſought his life, and driven the woman into the wilderneſſe, hath reigned) ſhall againe be ſet upon the holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, and trample upon the necks of all his enemies, the Nations hath not for many ages been ruled by him.

evill for evill, and ſought occaſions of evill one againſt another, and vexed one another through the pride of your hearts; Therefore now is the Lord riſen to make warre againſt you all, and to daſh you to peices; the feller comes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, he that will not ſpare to ſſay, and to devoure, who will not be affraid of your lofty lookes, he will ſpoile you of your treaſures, and lay waſte your ſtrength; all ye kingdomes of the earth, and your gathering together againſt him is but as briers, and thornes, for he will exalt his owne Kingdome over you all, and all yee Kings of the earth ſhall know that that the Kingdome of the moſt high muſt rule in your Kingdomes, and your lawes ſhall be changed, and the poor ſhall no more be opreſſed; for he is come that proclaimes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty unto the Captives, who will remove opreſſion far away, who will change times, and worſhips and ordinances, and there ſhall be no Law but the Law of God, nor no light, but of the Lamb, nor no worſhip but the worſhip in the ſpirit, and in the truth; for all your worſhips which the nations are full of, is nought but vanity, and a lye, immitations, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, brought forth in hypocriſie, and not in an upright heart; vanity of vanities hath abounded both in civill, and ſpirituall affairs; The root in which you ſtand is wholy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and no good fruit ſprings from it, but curſed fruites which muſt be hewen downe, and caſt into the fire; ye have been evill, and could not bring forth any good, you are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and your fruit is of a bitter taſte, a day of ſorrow, of lamentation, and miſery is coming upon you all; ye that have been high, and lofty and ſtout hearted, fearfulneſſe ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you, and the terror of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall compaſſe you about; I am moved to ſalute you all with this as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and when it comes to paſſe remember you have been told; ye that know not the kingdome of the moſt high ruling men, but are ſaying in your hearts this hath my hand done, in a moment ſhall you be ſmitten, and know there is one above you which muſt rule, for it his right to rule over all nations, and there ſhall be no King, but Jeſus the anointed of God, nor no government, but the government of the Lambe, there ſhall be no more warres, but war againſt the Dragon, who hath

               <p>All you Rulers in the world, I warne you all, take heed how you perſecute ſuch as comes to warne you, who brings this meſſage to you, leaſt you add ſin to ſin, till there be no place found for repentance; for ye ſhall all know our God is the true God that made heaven and earth, before whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence all fleſh muſt come to judgement.</p>
