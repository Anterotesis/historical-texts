            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this ſmall Tract I have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſet forth the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to improve your Recreation
in the <hi>Art of Fowling,</hi> that it
may truly be ſaid to be a Pleaſure,
ſeparated from the extraordinary
fatigue and toil, ſome put themſelves
to, on this occaſion: I have not only
there inſerted my own Experience,
but with them have laid down the
Experiments of the moſt cunning
and dexterous Proficients.</p>
            <p>There is beſide Pleaſure, Profit
in this Exerciſe, the Air affording
<pb facs="tcp:35973:4"/>
you various Dainties to furniſh
your Table with, that the Earth
and Water ſeem to conſent you ſhould
feaſt to your contentment, if you
will be induſtrious in taking what
in great plenty they afford: This
Exerciſe moderately uſed, is alſo
very much conducing to Health, by
being up early, and breathing the
freſh Morning Airs, and the
Earths aſcending Fragrancy.</p>
            <p>I have gone through this Subject
in all its parts, not only to direct
you how to take the Fowl of the
Water and Land, but what Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
you muſt order and make to
that purpoſe, with the exact way of
managing them to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
not to fail of ſucceſs. Nor is
this all.</p>
            <p>I have herein treated of Singing
Birds, and the ſeveral Diſeaſes
incident to them; alſo their Cures,
for want of which Knowledge many
fine Birds have been loſt, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
<pb facs="tcp:35973:4"/>
of the Owners. I have done
the like in relation to domeſtick
Poultry, with a ſpeedy way to fatten
Tame and Wild-fowl, and that ſuch
as buy them alive or dead, may not
be impoſed upon or cheated. I have
likewiſe ſet down unerring Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to know their Age or Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Newneſs or Staleneſs, and
whether with Egg or no; ſo that
in this only you may in one Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſave more than the Price of the
Book: And becauſe nothing ſhould
be wanting to make it compleat, I
have added to it the way to deſtroy
all ſorts of Vermin in Houſes,
Barns, Fields, or ſuch as afflict
the Bodys of Men. So hoping it
will not fail to pleaſe, I humbly

FOWL, and their

            <p>
               <hi>FOWLING</hi> is not only
a pleaſant but profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Recreation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
to the Health
of the Body in its Exerciſe, and
furniſhing the Table with
Dainties. Seeing then moſt are
unskilful in the true method of
it, I have thought neceſſary, for
the accommodating Gentlemen
and others, to lay down ſuch
Rules and Directions in ſo eaſie
and intelligible a manner, as
cannot but be pleaſing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35973:6"/>
to all Perſons who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be skilled herein.</p>
            <p>As for the Haunts of Wild-Fowl,
though it is more uſual
in one place than another, yet
they are not always certain;
though they have eſpecially at
Seaſons their Day-haunts and
Night-haunts; for particularly
the greater ſort, ſuch as are
called Game, and worth taking,
retire in the day-time to ſome
place where they may ſecurely
reſt; in the evening they take
their beſt feeding, particularly
Water-fowl, who are the
watchfulleſt and ſhieſt of all
others; and theſe then are moſt
uſually found at ſmall green
Streams,, to which in the day-time
they reſort not, unleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
hard Weather, or want
of Food elſewhere, compel
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35973:6"/>
Theſe Water-fowl are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
thoſe that are called Web-footed,
though there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort that much frequent
Marſhes and watry places which
are not ſo, as the Bittern, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But though theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
delight in Fiſh, which
makes them reſort where they
are moſt likely to find them,
they ſwim not as the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooſe,
Duck, Widgeon, Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> who delight in Rivers
and large deep Waters, and in
Winter where the Currents or
Springs deny acceſs to the Froſt;
and ſo watchful are they, that
they have their Scouts on all
the Avenues, to give the whole
Body notice of any ones ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and ſpeedily being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed,
they take wing and fly
to ſuch places as they ſuppoſe
of more ſafety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35973:7"/>
It is the nature of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fowl
to keep in Flocks; and
when at any time you ſee a
ſingle one, or a couple flying,
there you may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
they have been ſeparated
from the reſt by ſome great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment,
and will hardly reſt
till they have rejoined them:
And this ſeparation often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
by the beating of the Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
and Wild-hawks upon the
Banks of the Rivers and other
Waters, purſuing them as they
riſe, which cauſes this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But to come nearer to the
purpoſe, I now enter on the
ſubject matter.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35973:7"/>
               <head>The ordering of the Net
to take large Water-fowl.</head>
               <p>IF you deſign to Net for the
Water-fowl of any largeneſs,
conſider that your Nets be
made of ſtrong firm Pack-thread
well twiſted and dried, the
Maſhes or Squares large, the
better to intangle them; but
take this caution along with
you, That they be not ſo wide
as to loſe the Fowl by its creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through.</p>
               <p>This Net muſt be about two
fathom deep, and ſix in length,
and with neat ſtrong Cord
verge it on each ſide, at either
end extend it with long Poles,
that the lower ends of the Poles
may be faſtned with a piece of
Line to two Stakes well driven
into the ground, that they may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35973:8"/>
not give way; and this muſt be
done where you obſerve the
feeding-places and morning-haunts
of ſuch Fowl: Place
your Nets about two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their uſual time of coming;
then at about two or three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
beyond the Net, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
line from the Stakes, faſten
one end of the Cord, that the
upper part of the Net is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to or upon, whilſt the
other end you hold in your
hand, being about ten or twelve
fathom long, that when the
Game approaches within the
compaſs of your Net, on a ſwift
or ſudden pull, you may eaſily
caſt it over 'em. The Net muſt
be flat on the ground; and the
better to prevent its being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
cover it lightly over
with ſhort Graſs or Sedge; then
make a hiding-place for your
ſelf of Fern, Reeds, Flags, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35973:8"/>
ſuch as the place affords, that
the Fowl ſeeing ſuch-like things
elſewhere about them, may be
the more familiar with it, and
approach the bolder. As for
your Stale, if you have any
that is a tame one, or one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
made of the kind you
moſtly Net for, it is moſt proper
to place it within the verge of
the Net, for the better encreaſe
of your Sport: And this you
may continue till the Sun is
riſen about an hour, or ſome-longer,
but not much; for then
their feeding in thoſe places is
over, till a little before Sun-ſet
again.</p>
               <p>If your Net deſign'd for great
Fowl be very large, you cannot
conveniently have a pair of
Draw-nets, unleſs ſome one help
you; for one will be as much as
you can manage and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

               <p>IN Netting for the ſmaller ſort
of Water-fowl, they muſt be
in length proportionable to the

in, and about two foot and a half
deep: This may be of ſmaller
Maſhes than the former, and the
Pack-thread ſomewhat leſs, that
neither the Fowl can get thro'
the Squares, nor break its way;
and line this Net on either ſide
with falſe Nets, whoſe Maſhes
may be 18 inches Square; ſo
that the Fowl ſtriking and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

This Net muſt be ſtaked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the River, or Pond, and
the bottom plummed ſo, that it
may ſink about ſix Inches under
water, and the upper part by
ſtraining be ſlantwiſe againſt
the Current, where there is one

Water, and faſten the String
that guides the upper part of
the Net to a ſmall yielding
Twig, the better for its giving
way when the Fowl ſtrikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Net, ſo that ſhe may
the more intangle: You may
have ſeveral of theſe Nets pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at
a convenient diſtance on
a River, and if the Fowl fall
near them, you cannot miſs of
Game: And where the Fowl
lie remote from your Nets, you
may drive or ſcare them to that

noiſe with any loud Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

thoſe Marſhes or Pools to the

               <p>Theſe are the propereſt ways

               <head>Land-fowl their Haunts,
and how to take them
with Nets.</head>
               <p>LAnd-fowl are not ſo ſhy
as Water-fowl, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener
ſeeing Men; yet are they
cunning enough to avoid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Thoſe that are properly

taking, are found in Woods,
Copices, Heaths, Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35973:11"/>
where they have their ſeveral
Haunts, according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or the Seaſon of the Year;
and they principally are Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants,
Partridges, Rails, Quails,
Pouts, Heath-cocks, Wood-Pidgeons,
Black-birds, Field-fares,
Stares, Thruſhes, Larks,
Puffins, Wheatears, and the
like; and thoſe or theſe, or other
ſorts that gather in Flights, may
be taken in the day-time with
Nets.</p>
               <p>In ordering this Affair, you
muſt conſider what Food they
moſt delight in; for it will be
proper to bait the place, as
well to decoy them into the
compaſs and danger of your
Net, by a Stale or Bird of the
kind you moſtly lay in for. The
Maſhes of your Nets muſt be
proportionable to the Fowl,
that is not big enough for them
to eſcape, nor ſo little, that there
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35973:11"/>
will be difficulty in their intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and about an inch or a
little more, in the ſquare will do.
Let the Net be about three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
in length, and one in depth,
verged on either ſide with a
ſufficient Cord, and the Net be
in all things as the figure,
<hi>pag.</hi> 9. deſcribes. Theſe Nets
muſt be of a very exact ſize;
and the beſt time for this Sport
is from <hi>Auguſt</hi> to <hi>November,</hi> tho'
in an open Winter it may be
indifferently us'd till the middle
of <hi>February,</hi> or the time the
Birds begin to couple.</p>
               <p>You muſt in this caſe be an
early riſer, and have your Nets
placed before they are well come
abroad from their night rooſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and this muſt be ſomewhat
before the Sun is up. The most
ſucceſsful places are on ſhort
Barley-ſtubble, green Lays, or
even Meadows that are dry; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35973:12"/>
in Champion ground far
from any Villages or reſort of
People; and where the ground
proves uneven, you muſt uſe
your endeavour to reduce it to
an evenneſs, that the Nets ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the ſhort graſs or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and part of it coming thro
the Maſhes, it may appear as
hid, and very little to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
and likewiſe on plain
ground the Nets in drawing
will cloſe ſo even, that being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
the Birds may not flicker
or creep through them.</p>
               <p>The Nets thus placed, ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and corded, as has been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
that at the ſmart and
ſwift motion they may fly up
and cloſe even; there remain
Directions to allure the Birds to
you; and to do this, ſtick Poles
in the ground, if the place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
affords not advantage,
that by their playing and noiſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35973:12"/>
they draw the Birds to wonder

               <p>The next thing to be done, is
to place your Stale; to do this,
drive a ſmall Stake into the

Having thus prepared things
for the Sport, the next thing is
to be vigilant; and for your
Seat you may dig a hole in the
ground knee-deep, and caſt up
ſome of the Earth before you,
to ſhelter you as much as may
be from the ſight of the Fowl;
and if they are ſuch Fowl as
are very ſhy, you may lie along,
and cover the greateſt part of
you with Graſs or Stubble. Your
Drawing Lines may be twelve
or fourteen yards: Lay the
main Draw-line with a ſtrong
Button of Wood in it, made faſt
to your Thigh; and when you
pull over, do it with both hands
ſwiftly and nimbly.</p>
               <p>If you want living Stales, or
that they prove too troubleſom
to keep, you may ſhoot a Lark,

may be intangled between
both. The upper edge of this
Net muſt have Iron or Horn-rings
put on a ſtrong Cord;

in each Maſh a kind of a

               <p>The proper times for this

move off, and take a Circle

               <p>Always as near as you can,
ſhoot with the Wind, for it
carries the Shot much the ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and farther; come not, if
you can avoid it, in the face of
the Fowl to ſhoot, unleſs you
are very cloſely covered, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take her turning ſide-ways,
ſo that ſhe will be ſure to be
diſabled, if not killed; in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35973:28"/>
Tail or behind is not ſo well,
the Shot being apt to glance
over.</p>
               <p>Water-fowl, as well the
web footed as the cloven, are
of all moſt ſhy; and therefore
you muſt uſe great Policy to
come near them: If there be
no Banks you can creep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Flags, Ruſhes, or Buſhes to
cover you naturally; You muſt
make artificial Blinds, where
their Haunts uſually are; as
near as may be cover your ſelf
exceeding cloſe, and have a
Reſt to ſtake in the ground, for
your Gun to level between two
Forks, that kneeling you may
hold it more ſteady and level,
without moving the muzzle in
the leaſt; for this is required
if your Piece be very heavy,
left the ſhaking your hand, or
moving your head, when you
have taken aim, ſtir the muzzle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35973:28"/>
of your Piece; for the motion
of half an inch from a true le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
is five yards wide of the
Mark in forty: and the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments
happen, by either
moving the Piece too high or
low, for never ſo little alters
very much at a great diſtance,
ſo that the Shot will ground
too ſoon, or fly over the Fowl,
affrighting, but not hurting.</p>
               <p>The true level on the Ground
or Water, is to have the ſight
of the Piece equal with the
head of the Fowl, and keep
your open Eye (for with
one you muſt wink, or you will
never take a true level) ſo ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and the but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-end ſo faſt to
your ſhoulder, that when it is
gone off, it may remain not
moved a hair's breadth; and by
this means you will ſee what
you aim at fall, if within reach;
and if two of you ſhoot her, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35973:29"/>
there be a flock of Fowl, it will
be the beſt for one to take them
on the wing, juſt riſing, if any
eſcape the ſhot on the ground:
and then your level muſt be
three yards from the ground,
a little enclining to the way you
ſee their heads ſtand: but then
you muſt take a true time for
firing, which is as ſoon as ever
he that ſhoots on the ground
has pulled his Tricker, and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
in the Pan, or at leaſt if
you are very near, as ſoon as
you hear the report of his Piece.</p>
               <p>If you are to ſhoot flying at a
Flock, meet them if you can in
the face the way they fly, and
raiſe the muzzle of your Piece,
ſlaunting or riſing by degrees
upwards, that you may take
the undermoſt, and ſo ſhoot
ſlauntwiſe through them, ſo
that the Shot that goes free, if
any do, may fly higher than the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35973:29"/>
rear of the Birds: but if you
muſt take them on the ſide, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
whether the Fowl fly
even in a line, make off, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, or fly higher or
lower: and in this caſe whether
it be a Flock, or ſingle Fowl,
you muſt conſider when you are
within diſtance, and raiſe your
Piece ſo, that it may be equal
with her flight: but if ſhe be
at a good height, or conſiderable
diſtance from you, fire as at a
mark about ſix yards before
her, and then the Shot will take
her as ſhe is paſſing, for if you
aim directly at her ſide-ways,
or underneath her, ſhe will be
paſt away, before the Shot can
reach her.</p>
               <p>For making a Shot at the
Tree, Buſh, or Bank, thatched
Houſe, or the like; the beſt
way is to ſhoot at the centre
or middle of the Flock, if there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35973:30"/>
be many, and let the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Bird you there aim at be hid
with the muzzle of the Piece,
and ſo you will come juſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them</p>
               <p>There are many Birds that
as ſoon as they light on the
ground, fall a running, and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtand ſtill on it, as Field-fares,
Thruſhes, Stares, Lap-wings,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> You muſt in this
caſe obſerve which way they
bend their courſe moſt; and
when they have gathered from
their ſpreading, if you cannot
come conveniently in their face
or rear, fire with a level aim
at the higheſt part of thoſe
foremoſt that are next to you,
and the others running on, will
fall in with the Shot, if not
ſlow, ſo that you cannot miſs of
a good ſhoot.</p>
               <p>Though this is properly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Recreation, yet if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35973:30"/>
well managed, it requires much
Toil and Induſtry: for if you
can get no ſhelter, you muſt lie
flat on your belly, often creep
on your hands and knees: and
if you have not a Dog, eſpecially
to fetch your Water-fowl, you
may loſe them, unleſs you will
venture into Rivers, Lakes,
Brooks, Marſhes over-flowed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> your ſelf: alſo in Land-fowling
a Dog well-managed
to fetch and carry, is exceeding
neceſſary to fetch them out the
Buſhes and Briars, whether
they will flicker or run when
wounded, and be very difficult
to find; and therefore a well-managed
Dog is very neceſſary,
to ſave you abundance of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and retrieve your Game,
that would be otherwiſe loft.</p>
               <p>There is one thing mainly
neceſſary to the Piece-fowler,
and that is a Stalking-horſe to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35973:31"/>
ſhelter him in his approaches to
a due diſtance, which may be
an old ſtaid Horſe that will not
ſtart at the firing: and though
he be uſeleſs for other matters,
and may be bought for little or
nothing, with a little training
be active at this: and you muſt
guide him with nothing but a
String of a Graſs-colour, or in
Snowy weather white, about his
nether Chap, about two or
three yardslong: teach him to
walk gently on the Banks of
Brooks and Rivers, or in open
Fields, in a grazing poſture:
guide him with your String,
and a low Voice, towards the
Game, who being uſed to ſuch
Creatures, will not mind him,
if you keep your body very cloſe
behind him, and altogether out
of ſight, ſo that being within
ſhot, take your aim under his
neck rather than belly, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35973:31"/>
on one knee, ſuffering the
foreleg and ſhoulder of the
Horſe to cover your body. If
you carry a Dog with you to
fetch the Fowl, you muſt leave
him at couch among the Flags
and Ruſhes, or any coverture,
till you whiſtle for him, and
that then he may come ſpeedily;
for all Water-fowl, and moſt
Land, are naturally affrighted
at the ſight of a Dog, though
very little at the ſight of any
other Land creature, and then
ſet him in to fetch the Fowl
you have ſtruck. Theſe Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are very good to approach
Land-fowl with, if they are not
on high Trees, for then at your
near approach they will diſcern
you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:35973:32"/>
                  <figure/>
For want of ſuch a live Horſe,
you may cut out the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of one in Canvas, or
Match-paper, paſted together
a ſufficient breadth and length,
with Ears, Legs, a Tail, and all
the Parts proportionable, which
you may paint to the lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a Horſe, and ſomething
like Graſs at his noſe, his head
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35973:32"/>
being ſtooping as grazing: and
this may be done either flat or
ſtuffed, but the firſt is moſt
eaſie to carry by two ſtraps,
through which you may thruſt
your left arm: Under the feet
muſt be ſharp Pegs to ſtick it,
in the ground, when you come
to take your level, and make
your ſhot. And when this is
grown common, and you have
often diſturbed them, ſo that
they perceive the deceit, you
may change the Figure to an
Ox, Cow, Stag, Aſs, or other
large Creature, haunting or
uſing thoſe with which the
Fowl are familiar: And this
may make the Sport laſt longer
than other ways it would, the
change putting a new deceit
upon them.</p>
               <p>There are other things that
are uſed for ſhelter in this caſe,
as in Marſhes and Rivers, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35973:33"/>
deceive Water-fowl; moving
Blinds may be made of Flags,
Bents, Ruſhes, or ſuch things as
grow there, wattled together
with pack-thread or ſmall cord,
like Flags, Bents, or Ruſhes
for Chimney-backs.</p>
               <p>In Fields, woody places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
a Buſh may be ſo ordered and
proportioned, by the addition
of more, to a bigneſs, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
it in one hand, you may
ſhelter your whole body with
it: Alſo a Hedge may be made
of Oſier-twigs, and others, long
and light, eaſily portable: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a Tree, behind whoſe
paſtboard body painted you
may ſhelter, the top being ſtuck
with Twigs and Branches like
a Tree. But theſe being unuſual
to motion, you muſt move with
them exceeding ſlowly, or the
Bird will take fright, and be
gone.</p>

               <p>Peices of old Lead may be

a Crucible, or Iron melting
Ladle, and when it is melted

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:35973:36"/>
enough, if it has
tails, put more till it will do.</p>
               <p>This done you muſt have a
Copper-plate ſquare, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
thin, and the ſides that
ſtand up like a Pye thick, in the

round holes drilled, lay Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal

two Bars of Iron over a Tub

the Lead, and dropping thro'
the holes into the Water, it
will become round, if it cool on
the Plate blow the Coals, and
taking off the cooled Lead,
melt it over again, and pour on

will make the Fowl in ſight
come to them, ſwoop among

and any of the twigs be miſſing,
ſend out to the Water, Marſh,

placed in the Water than on
the Land, in ſhallow places, the

Water, ſo thick that the Fowl
may not eaſily creep between
them, fixing a Stale or two to
decoy them thither; let your
Rods for this be green, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Haunt fails, you muſt remove to
another.</p>
               <p>In Winter time when no

you muſt prick down large Rods

anſwers as the Bridge does in a

Swickle or Loop; faſten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an inch and a half of the bent
Plant, a little Tricker, broad
and thin, as is uſual to a Mouſe-Trap,
then lay your Loop of
Hazle croſs the Tricker, and
hang the bow-end of it on a
Hook or Peg driven into the

the ſtalk or other end of it, you
