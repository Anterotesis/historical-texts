         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Religion:</hi> Neither doe I wonder that hee ſhould make ſuch a queſtion: For hee that with ſo good judgement did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelfe to the reading of all things worthy to bee read, was not ignorant with what skill that matter hath beene handled by <hi>Raymond Sebund,</hi> after a ſubtile Philoſophicall manner; by <hi>Iudovicus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ives,</hi> in divers Dialogues; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with moſt learning and eloquence, by their famous <hi>Mornay.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi> of them into the vulgar tongue, was more for uſe, than for <hi>making</hi> any new worke: Whereof, what other men will judge, I know not, but this I am perſwaded will ſatisfie him, if I tell him, how that reading, not onely thoſe Authors above men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned; but alſo the writings of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for their old <hi>Iewiſh,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for our

               </gap>eedome to my minde, which my body wanted when I writ that worke. For it ſeemed to mee moſt ſitting to contend for the <hi>truth</hi> only with <hi>truth,</hi> and that alſo with ſuch <hi>truth,</hi> as whereof I was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fully in my owne minde. For I know it were but a vanity in mee to goe about to teach others to credit thoſe things that I could not bee perſwaded of my ſelfe: Therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch arguments as in my judgement were of leſſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as alſo the authority of thoſe bookes which either I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew, or juſtly ſuſpected to be forged and counterfeit, I have made choice of ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons both out of ancient &amp; later writings, as may bee beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of. And as for thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23419:12"/>
which pleaſed me beſt, the ſame I did both methodically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe, and alſo expounded as plainly as I could, diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them by certaine verſes, whereby they might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter committed to memory.</p>
            <p>For my purpoſe was to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit all my <hi>Countrey-men,</hi> but ſpecially <hi>Sea-faring-men,</hi> that they might not (as too many doe) loſe and miſpend their time. Wherefore beginning with the commendation of our <hi>Countrey,</hi> which for skill and diligence in <hi>Navigation</hi> excels the ieſt, I exhorted them to uſe that art, not onely for their owne proper gaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, but alſo for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of true <hi>Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For neither is there wanting <hi>matter</hi> for ſuch their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, ſince that they might try their fortunes abroad in farre diſtant-forren <hi>Countries,</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23419:12"/>
make incurſions either upon the <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſuch as live in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Guinea;</hi> or upon the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans,</hi> as thoſe under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Turke,</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> or laſtly, upon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and ſuch as at this day are profeſſed enemies of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorow the moſt parts of the world. Neither are there wanting ſuch <hi>wicked men,</hi> as doe (ſecretly for feare) harbour the poyſon of errour, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſame unto the weaker ſort, when they ſee fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Againſt which <hi>evils</hi> my deſire is we may be well fortified with <hi>truth;</hi> And that ſuch as are furniſhed with learning, would endevour according to their ability to confute <hi>errours:</hi> and in the meane while let others beware that they be not ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe that are enemies of the <hi>truth.</hi> For which end, that

any thing, neither had it power to be before it was; therefore it followes, that the ſaid things had their beginning from ſome other thing different from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Which may be averred not onely of ſuch things as now we ſee, or ever have beheld, but of ſuch alſo as gave originall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe, and ſo upward untill we come to ſome <hi>prime cauſe</hi> which never beganne to be, and which (as we ſay) hath its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence <hi>by neceſſity,</hi> and not after any <hi>conting nt</hi> manner: And this, what ever it be, (whereof by and by wee ſhall ſpeake) is <hi>that</hi> which is meant by <hi>divine power or Godhead.</hi>

thoſe <hi>parts of the world</hi> which were anciently knowne, or thoſe that are lately found out, whereſoever there is (as we have ſaid) any <hi>reliques</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, there certainly is <hi>this truth</hi> acknowledged, as well by ſuch <hi>Heathens</hi> as have any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and wiſdome, as alſo by thoſe that are of a more dull and ſtupid diſpoſition: The former whereof queſtionleſſe could not all bee deceived; neither is it likely that theſe later ſo ſi ly and ſimple ſhould any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe how to <hi>deceive</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Neither let any man here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that in ſundry ages there have beene <hi>ſome</hi> moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which either could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or elſe would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe they beleeved <hi>that there was a God.</hi> For inaſmuch as the number of ſuch <hi>Atheiſts</hi> was but ſmall, and in regard that

ſtraight way upon the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their <hi>rerſons,</hi> their <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> generally was ſet at naught; thence it appeares, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, not from the uſe of <hi>right reaſon,</hi> which is common to men; but either from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of ſingularity, ſuch as was in him that would needs demonſtrate the <hi>ſnow to bee blacke;</hi> or from a corrupt mind, like as when meats to a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered palate doe taſte otherwiſe than indeed they are.

               <p>As touching that which ſome men pretend, becauſe they <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee God,</hi> therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>beleeve that he is;</hi> if they ſee any thing, they ſee enough to convince them; for if this were <hi>truth,</hi> what an indignitie were it for a man to beleeve hee

               <p>Beſides, the multiplication of thoſe particular things that are of the ſame nature, proceeds from the <hi>exuperancy</hi> and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the <hi>cauſes</hi> whence ſuch things more or leſſe are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated: but of <hi>God</hi> there is neither beginning nor any <hi>cauſe.</hi>

All which being duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it muſt needs follow (as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23419:51"/>
the <hi>Iewes</hi> have confeſſed) that theſe workes proceeded from a more than naturall or humane power, that is, from ſome good or evill Spirit. That they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not from any <hi>evill Spirit</hi> may be proved, becauſe that the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation whereof theſe workes were wrought,) was quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and contrary to bad <hi>Spirits.</hi> For it prohibits the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of <hi>evill Angels,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades men from all unclear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of affections and manners, wherein ſuch <hi>Spirits</hi> are much delighted. And this is alſo plain, for that whereſoever the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell is received and eſtabliſhed, there followes the ruine and downfall of Idols, the contempt and deteſtation of magicall arts, together with a ſerious hatred of all diabolicall worſhip, as being a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and repugnant to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

of the onely, <hi>true GOD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is it, to bee thought that any wicked <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and fooliſh, as to effect and often bring to paſſe things that are cauſes of its owne hurt and diſgrace, and no way conducing to its honour or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Beſides it ſtands no way with the wiſdome or goodneſſe of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe to ſuffer ſo harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and innocent men, ſuch as feared him, to bee deceived by the <hi>deluſion</hi> of <hi>devils:</hi> and ſuch were the firſt followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as is plaine by their innocent life, and by the many calamities which they endured for conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if thou affirme that thoſe workes of Chriſt proceeded from ſome <hi>good Spirits</hi> which are inferiour to <hi>God;</hi> in ſo ſaying thou doſt confeſſe that the ſame workes were well pleaſing unto <hi>God,</hi> and

did tend to the honour of his name; foraſmuch as <hi>good Spirits</hi> doe nothing but what is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and glorious unto <hi>God.</hi> To ſay no more then, ſome of <hi>Chriſts</hi> works there were ſo miraculous, that they might ſeeme to have <hi>God</hi> himſelfe for the <hi>author</hi> of them, and could not have beene done but by the immediate fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an <hi>omnipotent power,</hi> as ſpecially, the reſtoring divers perſons from death unto life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>God</hi> doth not produce any miracle, nor ſuffer any ſuch wonders to bee wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt cauſe: For it becomes not a wiſe <hi>Law giver</hi> to forſake and depart from his owne <hi>lawes,</hi> unleſſe upon ſome good and weighty reaſon.

               <p>BEſides the miracles that <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought to confirme his doctrine, another argument may be taken from his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>reſurrection</hi> to life againe, after that he was crucified, dead, and buried;</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all ages and Countries alleage the ſame, not onely for a truth, but alſo as the moſt ſtrong ſortreſſe and chiefeſt foundation of their <hi>faith;</hi> which could not be, unleſſe thoſe that firſt taught <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> did perſwade their auditors that the thing was ſo for certain; And yet they could not induce any wiſe man to the beleefe hereof, unleſſe they could verily affirme, that themſelves were eye-witneſſes of this matter. For
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23419:54"/>
without ſuch an ocular teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny no man of wiſdome and judgment would willingly give credit thereunto; ſpecially in ſuch perillous and dangerous times as then were. But that this was their conſtant aſſertion, both their owne bookes, and other writings doe teſtifie. For out of their bookes it appeares, that they appealed unto five hundred witneſſes that had beheld <hi>Ieſus</hi> after he was riſen from the dead. Now it is not the faſhion of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and diſſemblers to appeale to ſo great a number of witneſſes: Neither could it poſſibly ſo fall out that ſo many men ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and conſpire together to beare falſe witneſſe.

Neither could they hope for any <hi>wealth</hi> and commodity, becauſe this profeſſion was oftentimes puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the loſſe of goods and poſſeſſions: or if it was not; yet the <hi>Goſpell</hi> could not bee taught by them ſincerely, unleſſe they omitted or neglected all ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and anxious care for <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commodity.</hi> Neither could the hope of any other <hi>worldly profit</hi> move them to fit or utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths; ſeeing that the very preaching of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to labours, hunger, thirſt, ſtripes, and impriſonments.</p>

they could tell by experience what troopes of men were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to death for this <hi>profeſſion</hi> which without juſt cauſe to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was no better than plaine robbery or murder.</p>
               <p>But if wee ſay, they beleeved that this <hi>Religion</hi> was moſt true and the very beſt, and altogether to be profeſſed, and that after the death of their <hi>Lord and Maſter:</hi> why ſurely, that could no way bee ſo, if their Maſters promiſe concerning his reſurrection had deceived them and not proved true.

               <p>Moreover, all ſorts of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſpecially <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> altogether prohibits lying and bearing of falſe witneſſe in divine things: wherefore they could not for the love of <hi>Religion,</hi> principally ſuch a religion, be induced to tell

untruths.

Nay, there were none among theſe primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (whereof wee ſpeake,) who did not ſuffer grievous torments for profeſſing that <hi>Ieſus was riſen:</hi> and many of them were put unto moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite paines of death for bearing teſtimony of the ſame. Now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is poſſible for ſome man out of a wilfull pre-conceived o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, to endure ſuch miſery; but it is utterly incredible and unlikely that any one, much leſſe ſo many ſhould bee willing to ſuffer ſo great calamity for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving an untruth; and that which they knew to bee ſuch an

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:23419:68"/>
bravery to vaunt and triumph in the ſlaughter of <hi>Nations,</hi> as in ſome glorious exploit? Yet ſuch was the cuſtome anciently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that none was dignified with the title of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honour, unleſſe they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and purchaſed the ſame in warres, which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were apparantly unjuſt, as themſelves confeſſe of the wars againſt <hi>Sardinia and Ciprus.</hi> And indeed generally amongſt the <hi>heathen</hi> it was accounted no diſgrace, no crime or offence to pilfer and ſpoile thoſe that were not within their owne domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as wee finde it recorded by worthy <hi>Hiſtorians. Ariſtotle and Cicero</hi> made the deſire of reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a part of vertue.

them: But the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had better lawes and more holy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, though notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>they</hi> bare a mortall hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt all thoſe that differed from them in opinion, as at this day appeares by their prayers that they make againſt us <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet againe, <hi>their law</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to render like for like, and to have equall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for any hurt offered: and <hi>thereby</hi> any man was permitted in his owne perſon to kill, or bee revenged upon him that had ſlaine any one of his kindred. But the <hi>Commandement</hi> and law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> forbids us to revenge any kinde of injury whatſoever, whether it be offered in word or deed: that ſo we may not ſeeme to allow that wickedneſſe in our ſelves, which we condemne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <p>A rare example of this true and unfained <hi>liberality</hi> we finde in the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſent releefe out of <hi>Macedonia and Achaiah</hi> to ſuccour them that lived in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> as if the whole world had beene but one family.

were flatterers of <hi>Princes,</hi> others addicted to <hi>bawdery,</hi> and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, &amp; a third ſort to mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part boldneſſe. A great argument of a generall <hi>envy</hi> among them was <hi>their contention</hi> about words and matters of ſmall or no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In their devotions they were cold and heartleſſe: For thoſe that did beleeve there was one <hi>God,</hi> neglected his honour, and worſhipped ſuch things as they knew were no <hi>Gods;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that onely the <hi>rule</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi> which was commonly received and practiſed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.

               <p>
                  <hi>Mahumet,</hi> another Author of another <hi>Religion</hi> farre diſperſed in theſe times, throughout his whole life was inclined to luſt, and ſenſuality, as his owne fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

               <p>But above all theſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is moſt honourable; in that neither his countrey-men, nor any other could ever convince him of <hi>ſinne.</hi> For whatſoever hee commanded others to obſerve, the ſame did he obſerve and performe himſelfe, and the Commandements that <hi>God</hi> gave him, he faithfully ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, leading a moſt <hi>pure</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right courſe of life; being alſo moſt <hi>patient</hi> in ſuffering wrongs and abuſes, as was manifeſt at his <hi>death</hi> upon the <hi>croſſe;</hi> yea ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate was hee towards his very <hi>enemies,</hi> that he prayed <hi>God</hi> to pardon even thoſe that put him to death.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>reward</hi> which hee promiſed unto his Diſciples, wee verily beleeve that himſelfe is made partaker therof after a moſt

any man that of his owne power makes <hi>lawes</hi> bee thereby hundred from making the contrary.</p>
               <p>That which they object of <hi>Gods immutability</hi> is nothing: for wee ſpeake not here of <hi>Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and eſſence, but of his <hi>works.</hi> Light is changed into darkneſſe, youth into old age, ſummer into winter, and all by the <hi>worke</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>God</hi> at the beginning gave <hi>Adam</hi> leave in Paradiſe to eat of other apples, but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to eat of the fruit of one tree: Why? even becauſe it ſo <hi>pleaſed him.</hi> Generally hee prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited men to commit <hi>murder,</hi> yet he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his ſonne.

                  <hi>holy men</hi> of thoſe times, lod a more <hi>holy life</hi> than thoſ <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> required.

which notwithſtanding was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the <hi>law.</hi> The reaſon of all this chiefly is, becauſe thoſe <hi>lawes</hi> were accommodated to the greater part of that people: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſtate and condition they were in, it was meet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould bee <hi>kept had</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which afterward might be <hi>perfected,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>efficacy</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> was to chuſe unto himſelfe a <hi>peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> out of all nations.

               <p>This objection cannot bee put off, unleſſe <hi>Mahumet</hi> ſay, (as he doth) that the <hi>bookes</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of <hi>Chriſts</hi> diſciples have not remained as they were at firſt; but have beene <hi>corrupted.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee have-confuted this <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> before in the third booke.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that in the fourteenth chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where mention is made of ſending the <hi>comforter,</hi> there had beene ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred concerning <hi>Mahumet,</hi> which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have razed out.
