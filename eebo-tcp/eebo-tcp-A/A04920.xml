            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath done to many ages be fore vs) not to
esteme this a small and common blessing of God
that we haue not onely his trueth, but also the
effect and operation of the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed to vs
by experience of all ages. Great &amp; infinite is that
benefit of God, and rightly can it neuer be wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed,
when so euer he doth offer his trueth vnto
the world. But such is either the dulnes of man
orels his extreme ingratitude, that he will not

so bryght. The ingratitude of the Iewes, is
hereof vnto vs a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witnes. For albeit that
lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they did looke for the Messias and Sauior
promised, yet neuertheles, when he came with
wonderous signes &amp; workes super naturall,<note place="margin">Matt. 27. 38.</note> they
did not onely not know him,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 23</note> but also refusing
and vtterly denying him, they did hang him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wext
two theues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a crosse. The cause hereof
in some parte we know to be the carnal libertie
which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually they did thirst after, and their
preconceaued opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of worldlie glorie: which
because Christe Iesus appeared not to satisfie ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording

did they conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteously refuse him, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with

that because the reason of man can not attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

and that with great sobrietie we oght to
contemplate &amp; beholde that incomprehensible
mysterie of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption. But yet I say, that the
doctrine of gods eternal predestinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to the Church of God, that without the
same,<note place="margin">The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of gods eternall predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> can faith neither be truely taught, nether

ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he be rauished in admiration of gods eternal

And therefor we feare not to affirme
that so necessarie as it is that true faith be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in o<hi rend="sup">r</hi> har tes: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be broght to vnfined

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8568:6"/>
of gods eternall predestination. For first there
is no way more proper to buyld and establish
faith, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we heare and vndoubtedly do be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue,<note place="margin">The sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of faith.</note> that our election (which the Spirit of God

but in the eternal and immutable good plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure
of God. And that in such firmitie that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
not be ouerthrowen nether by the raging stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the world, nor by the assaultes of sathan,
nether yet by the wauering and weaknes of our
own fleshe. Then onely is our saluation in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we fynd the cause of the same in the
bosom and counsell of God. For so do we by
faith apprehend life and peace manifested in
Christe Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> that by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and guyding
of the same faith we looke farther: to wit, out
of what fountaine, life doth procede. In Christe

he is made vnto vs of God, wisdome, &amp; righteou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>snes and sanctification and rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption: and in the
promes of his Gospel is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the stabilitie of
our saluation. But yet we haue a ioy which, far
surmounteth this.<note place="margin">Ro 1. 26</note> For albeit that we should
heare that the mercies &amp; the graces of God we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
offered vnto all men, and albeit also that we
should fele that our heartes were somwhat mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
to beleue, yet onles the very cause of our
faith be knowen, oure ioye and comfort ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
be full. For if we shall think, that we beleue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
haue embrased Christe Iesus preached because
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8568:6"/>
our wittes be better then the wittes of others,
and because that we haue a better inclination
and are of nature more tractable then be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sorte of men, sathan (I say) can easely ouer
throw all comfort buylded vpon so weak a
ground. for as the heart of man is vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable,
so may it be, that those that this day
be tractable and obedient, hauing also som zeale
toward godlines, yea and also bothe sense and
feling of gods mercie, such (I say) may shortly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
after become stubborn in some cases, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in maters of greate importance, tempted
with lustes, and finally they may be left so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
that rather they shal tremble at the sight of
gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they can reioyse in the
free adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his children. And therefor (I say)
that except our comfort be grounded vpon that
foundation which neuer can be moued, it is not
perfect.<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouable ground of faith.</note> And that ground is this: That when we
vnderstand that presently we beleue in Christe
Iesus, because we were ordeined before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of all tymes to beleue in him:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29</note> as in him
we were elected to the societie of eternall life,
then is oure faith assuredly grounded,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 14</note> and that
because the giftes and vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance.<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 13</note> and he is faith ful that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vs.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 2. &amp; 20</note> his infinite goodnes which moued him
to loue vs in an other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our selues, that is in
Christe Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29</note> according to his free beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
whiche he had purposed in him, is to vs a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8568:7"/>
of refuge, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> satan is neuer able to ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gates of hell shall neuer preuail against
it. For how so euer we be changeable, yet is God
in his counsel stable and immutable, yea how
weak, how feble, how dull that euer we be, yet
is there nothing in vs (euen when we be in our
owne iudgement most destitute of the Spirit of
God) which he did not se to be in vs before we
were formed in the wombe, yea and before the
beginning of all tymes, because all is present
with him. Which imperfections, infirmities and
dulnes, as they did not stoppe his mercie to elect
vs in Christe Iesus, so can they not compel him
now to refuse vs. And frome this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine doth
flow this our ioye, that with the Apostle we are
bolde to crye: who is able to seperate vs from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
loue of God which is in Christe Iesus?<note place="margin">Rome. 8</note> for seing
that the father, who hath giuen vs for a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
inheritance to his onelie Sonne, is so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that owte of his hand is none able to take vs
away, what danger can be so great? what sinne
is so greuous, or what desperation so depe, that
is able to deuoure vs? for seing it is God him
self who will absolue vs from all iniquitie: and
seing that Christe Iesus his So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne wil aduowe vs
to appertein to his bodie, what is he that dare
ryse against vs to condemne vs? The comfort
hereof doeth none fele except the chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of God, and that in the daye when mans iustice
faileth, and the batt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lle of their conscience is

most greuous and fearefull. Therefore as faith
springeth frome election, so is it established by
the true knowledge of that doctrine onely
which this day is moste furiously oppugned, by
those who do not vnderstand the same.</p>
            <p>And frome that same doctrine floweth
the verie mater of trew humilitie. For while
we beholde the condition of those whom natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
hath made equall to be so farre diuers the one
from the other, it is vnpossible but that the
children of God in their own heartes vnfeined<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
shalbe humbled. For whither so euer they
shall directe their eyes, they shall behold feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
examples of blyndnes and of such iniquitie
as all men iustly oght to abhorre: but when
they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider them selues to haue receaued light
in the midst of such dareknes, and them selues
to be sanctified in the midst of so wicked a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
from what fountaine can they say that
this procedeth? who hath illuminated their
eyes, while that others abyde in blyndnes? who
doth brydle their affections, while that others
do follow the same to perdition? yf they say
nature, their own conscience shall conuict
them: for nature hath made vs all equall:
by nature are we the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wrathe as wel as
other: Ephes. 2. If they say education, reason, or

that as humilitie is the mother of all vertue: so
it is also the roote of all godlynes. But how is it
possible,<note place="margin">What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is</note> that that man shalbe humbled, that can
not abyde to heare the former miserie in the
which he was borne? neither yet the means by
the which frome the same he was delyuered? If
a begger being promoted to greate honours by
the liberalitie of a king, should be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred of
his former condition: and for declaration of
his gratitude he should be commanded to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
the embassador, or herauld that thus should
say vnto him: Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber and call to mynde how
wretched, poore, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d miserable somtymes thow
wast, and praise the goodnes of the king, by

stomake that his pouertie should be so often ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iected
vnto him, who wold saye, that either he
were humble, either yet thankfull to the king?
No more can it be said that such as can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde

which excedeth all measure. To wit, that we be

desire this article to be buried in silence, and
wold that men should teach and beleue, that the
grace of gods election is common vnto all, but

it not, procedeth either from the obedience or

God. As touching the opinion, we are falsly and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
burdened therewith: for we imagin not a necessi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
which is conteined within nature by a perpetnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of natural causes, as did the Stoiks, but we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
and menteine that God is Lord, moderator and Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernor
of all things, whom we affirm to haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the beginning according to his wisdom what
he wold do, and now we say, that he doth execute accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that not onely the heauen and earth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

of men are gouerned by his prouidence, so that they te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
and are led to the scope and end which he hath purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
He procedeth further answering the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
may be made, saing: what then, is there nothing done by
fortune and chance? I answer. That wel and godly it is
written by Basilius called the great: That fortune and
aduenture are the wordes of paynims, the signification
whereof oght in no wise to enter in to the heart of the
faithfull. For is all prosperitie be the benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God,

the fortune in such things as come to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Retract. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> And further
to the end of that section he bringeth furth the mynde
of Augustine concerning fortune, whereof parchance
we may after somwhat speake. This one sentence is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uict bothe your master and you of malicious

onely Iohn Caluin, and we all with him abhorre from the

the sterres and in their oppositious, that impossible (they
affirmed) it was to change or auoyd that which by their
constellation and influence was appointed to come. In so
much that they helde, that Iupiter him self (whom they
called the great, and supreme God) could neither alter
nor stop the operation of the sterres and the effectes that
should folow therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and so they affirmed, that the mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gdomes the honors of some men, the deiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

togither in the power of the sterres. Against this pestilent

that Cyrus should first distroy Babilon, and after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame

did lead them to that end? or do we not rather most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirm, that the aeternall counsel of God, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable

most perfect rule of all iustice and equitie) did bring all

what we vnderstand by Prescience, Prouidence, and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,
which termes do so offend you, that ye can

               <p>When we attribute prescience to God,<note place="margin">Prescie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that all things haue euer bene and perpetually aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

nothing is bypast, nothing to com, but all thinges
are present, and so are they present that they are not as

conceaued imaginations or formes and figures, whereof
other innumerable thinges procede (as Plato teacheth
that of the form and exemple of one man, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes
of men are fashioned) But we say, that all things
be so present before God, that he doeth contemplat and
beholde them in their veritie and perfection. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
it is, that the Prophetes often tymes speak of things
being yet after to com, with such certentie, as that they
were alreadie done. And this praescience of God do we
affirm to be extended to the vniuersall compasse and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite

of the same.</p>
               <p>Gods prouidence we call,<note place="margin">Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> that souerane empire and

attribute to God, that with the Apostle we fear not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that in him we haue our being, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that willingly they tend and incline to the end, to
which they are appointed by his. What comforte do
the sonnes of God receaue in earnest meditations hereof

               <p>Predestination (whereof now this question is, we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8568:12"/>
call the eternall and immutable decre of God, by the
which he hath once determined with him self, what he
will haue to be done with euerie man. For he hath not
created all (as after shalbe proued) to be of one condition.
Or if we will haue the definition of Predestination more
large: we say, that it is, the most wise and most iust purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of God, by the which before all tyme he constantly
hath decreed to cal those whom he hath loued in Christ,
to the knowledge of him self and of his sonne Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
that they may be assured of their adoption by the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of faith, which working in them by charitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
their workes to shyne before men to the glorie of
their father, so that they (made conforme to the image of
the sonne of God) may finally receaue that glorie, which
is prepared for the vessels of mercie. These latter partes
(to wit of vocation, iustification of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the effect
of the same) haue I added, for such as thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k that we imagin
it sufficient, that we be predestinate, how wickedly so
euer we liue. We constantly affirme the plane contrarie:
To wit, that none liuing wickedly, can haue the assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
that he is predestinate to lief euerlasting. Yea althogh
man and Angell wolde beare record with him, yet will his
own conscience condemne him, vnto such tyme as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feanedly
he turne from his wicked conuersation. These
termes I thoght good in the beginning to explane, to the

God were a tyrant, that appointed things to be done not

affirme, that God iested or did sporte in the maters of

iustice of God shyneth in his workes what so euer they
be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mouthes of all men may be stopped, and glorie
may be geuen to him alone. And therefor the Prophet
rehearseth iust causes of this destruction (meaning of
the destruction of Tyrus) that we shall not thinke that
God doth any thing without reason. Those of Tyre were
ambitious, proude, auaricious, lecherous, &amp; dissolute.</p>

blessed vs with all spirituall blessing in heauenlie things

either ignorantly orels maliciously do after alledge, but
to his beloued congregation of Ephesus who with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

summarely to restore all things by Christe bothe those

to the purpose of him by whose power are all thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
made, according to the decree of his will, that we
should be to the praise of his glorie. Here the holie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
as it were of set purpose, forseing mannes vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
vseth wordes not only moste propre, but also most
vehement, and often repeteth the same, to beat doune all
pryde and arrogancie of man presuming to arrogate any
thing to him self in the mater of his saluation. He first
saieth: God hath pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoght as you folowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Papistes, do now blasphemously
affirme that so he did in respecte of our worthines, of wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes,
or faith, in one sentence he secludeth all which is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
Christe Iesus and without him self, sayeng: he hath
predestinate vs to adoptate vs in children by Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
in him self, according to the good pleasure of his will.
If Christ Iesus, yea if God the Father, his aeternall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel,
his decree and purpose, be other then our worthines, our
faith, our qualitie, or our good workes, then neither for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8568:16"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor in respect of any of them were we chosen to lyfe.
For plainly he affirmeth that by Christe in him self accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
to his good pleasure which he had purposed in him
self, were we adoptate to be children yea and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the purpose and decre of his will. Here haue you
the same and mo wordes then we vsed. For here are those
wordes: the purpose of his good will, that he hath purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which wordes do most liuely expresse that which we affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me.
But yet perchance ye lacke the proofe of this parte,
that God in his immutable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell hath once chosen. For
after, I perceaue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this doeth much offend you. I trust ye
will not reiect the testimonie of S. Iames, for ye seme v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and perfect gift is frome aboue, discending from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
of light, with whom there is no variablenes, neither
shaddowing by turning, he hath (saieth he) of his owne will
begotten vs by the worde of veritie. If with God, as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
there be no variablenes, then must his counsell
be immutable. If in him there be not, now dareknes and
now light, but that as he dwelleth in the light which is inac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessible,
so are and euer haue ben all thinges present in
his sight. Then in his eternall counsell there falleth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorance nor repentance: and so what he once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that he faithfully will perfourme to the praise of
his own glorie. But if ye will not admit my reasons, then
must I bring vnto you plain scriptures. That God hath
chosen before the foundations of the world, that he hath
predestinate, purposed, and decreed, to adoptate vs in chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is befor proued. The Prophet I saiah from the fortie
chapter of his prophecie to the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the same, intreateth
chefely these two argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, vpon the one part to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
the afflicted, and dispised church (which then was sore
oppressed and after was to be led captiue to Babylon.)
Vpon the other part to threaten iust vengeance aswell
vpon the contemners of grace offered, as also vpon the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8568:16"/>
cruel ennemy. The estate of the churche was such, that
all hope of libertie, redemption, and comfort was taken
from them. They were as dead carions, buried in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
against the which the Prophet continually
fighteth, calling them frome the contemplation of the
present miseries, and frome the sight of such impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as to them appered to stop their libertie, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
promes of God, and to his counsell, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
to be constant, and to his loue which is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And therefor so often doeth he repete. It is I the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
who hath created the heauens, and hath laid the

vengeance is not taken? The certentie no doubt of his
promes, which he hath made to his churche in Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
his onelie welbeloued. The montanes we se in all te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes
and stormes do kepe their place, they do not flitte,
neither yet are they shaken with the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But if they should (saieth the eternall) my goodnes
shall not leaue thee (ô mercie without measure) neither
shall the couenant of my peace shake nor wauer. Thus
I suppose, that the godlie reader doth perceaue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d se, that
we lack not scripture (as ye affirme) to proue, that gods lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
and counsell towardes his elect is stable, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is grounded vpon him self and not vpon vs, as,
(to your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, if by tymes ye repent not) ye fals<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
imagin. But yet lest that ye shall complain that these
scriptures be not plane yhough, I will bring in yet one,
and so end this parte: Heare me ô house of Iacob, and all
you residue of the house of Israel,<note place="margin">Isaia. 46.</note> who are borne of me
frome the wombe, and borne of me from the birth: and
euen to the aege I am he (the same God) and euen to the
whyte heares I shal bear, I haue done, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d I shall bear, yea
I shall bear and deliuer. What wordes can be more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and more plaine to proue, that the loue of God can
neuer change from his elect? For that is his conclusion
which he collected vpon the former partes, Saing, I shall
bear, and I shall d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you. Is this a good reason: that God shall delyuer becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that he hath once born? How so euer it seme to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist,
it semeth good to the holie Gost. And Dauid
and Iob did with the like remembrance comforte them
selues in their greatest tribulations. The one saying,
Thow art he that hast drawen me furth of my mothers
wombe.<note place="margin">Psal. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

breastes: vpon the was I cast from the birth: frome
my mothers wombe thow art my God. In these wordes
Dauid did arme him selfe against the horrible tentations,
which did assault him in those moste greuous persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8568:18"/>
which vnder Saul he susteined. For so must not that Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
be interpreted of Christe and his passion, that Dauid
had no portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it: by the which when to his own iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and to the iudgement of all men also, he appered to
haue ben oppressed, he gathered new strength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefits of God, which before he had receaued.
And so he concludeth here: Thow that art the author of
my life, thow that didst norish and preserue me euen in
the midest of darknes, wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> continue my God still and so
shalt thow deliuer me. What is the reason of this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
Dauid him self doth expres it saying: O Lord thy
mercie is euerlasting, thow shalt not leaue the workes of
thyne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des.<note place="margin">Isal. 138.</note> In which wordes Dauid frome the midest of
troubles is lift vp to the contemplation of gods nature:
who as he chuseth of fre mercie and bestoweth his giftes
vpon his children, before that either they can deserue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or yet know them, so doth he continue the same moste
constantly to the end vnto the membres of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and vpon this same ground alone stayed the faith of
Iob in his most extreme anguishe for in these wordes he
doeth as it were complayne to God. Thy handes haue ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

                  </gap>t is

                  </gap>t him by reason of
his paines intollerable. And in his battell he apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
this holde: God hath begon to shew mercie vnto me
which in many things I haue felt, and I still depend and
hang vpon the same, therefor my God may not dispyse
the workes of his handes. And so farre procedeth he in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8568:18"/>
this disputation, till that he maketh this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion (which
God after did approue.) I know (saieth Iob) that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger
liueth, whom I shall se, yea my n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cis shal se him,
and none other. Vpon what ground I say did this faith of
Iob stand? No doubt vpon this, that gods counsell is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and that his loue is immutable towardes such as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
he had taken in to his sauegarde. And if ye doubt that
this is rather our collection then the plaine sentence of
the holie Gost, conferre oure proposition with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
wordes of Isaiah, and let it be iudged by them. And
if that yet ye crye that we haue broght furth no plaine
scripture affirming that the counsell of God is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then heare what the same Prophete saieth. It is I (sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he (that frome the beginning shew the things that be
last and from the beginning those thinges that be not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
It is I that do speak and my counsell is stable.<note place="margin">Isaia. 46.</note> and
what so euer I will, that I do. Consider and beholde
that the Prophet affirmeth the counsell of God to be sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yea to be so immutable, that neither could the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the ennemies neither yet the former sinnes of
the people, neither yet their present vnthankfulnes stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
God from shewing his mercie. Becaus that his infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
goodnes founde awaye euen in the midest of death
to manifest his own glorie. Such as by malice be not
altogither blinded, hauing any exercise in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of God, may easely perceaue, that I haue wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
no parte of the Prophetes mynde. For continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one thing doth he beat in their eares, to witt, that
God will shew mercie, will deliuer, and will be Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
vnto them for his Names sake for his promes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
to Abraham, and for the glorie of him self. But now
shortly let vs heare two or three places of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
spoken to the same purpose, and so let vs put
end to this part. Our master Christ Iesus plainely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that all which the father gaue him, shoulde co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
vnto him, pronouncing that who soeuer cometh he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him life. For this (saieth he) is the will of the Father that
hath sent me, that I shall lose nothing of all those which
the Father hath giuen to me, but that I might rayse them
vp in the last day. for this is the will of him that hath sent
me, that all that seeth the Sonne and beleueth in him,
may haue life euerlasting. Of those wordes of our master,
it is euident, first that the Father hath geuen some to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Sonne Christe Iesus, yea and also that some be, that are
not giuen. But of that after. And sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndarely that it beho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth
the same to come vnto him, for so he affirmeth say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.
All that my father gaue vnto me, shall come vnto me.
He leaueth it not in doubt, but planely affirmeth they
shall come. Thirdly the end a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fruicte of the commi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is
expressed: to witt, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they obteine life euerlasting. Which
to them that of the father are giuen and of the Sonne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
is so sure, that Christe Iesus him self pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oute of his handes is none able to plucke them awaye.
Plaine it is, that the counsell of God is stable and his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
immutable towardes his elect, becaus (al other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
set aparte) Christe affirmeth, that the life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
perteineth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are giuen by God, and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by him in protection and sauegarde. But more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
doth he speake in that his solemne praier:<note place="margin">Ioan. 17.</note> for after
that by diuers meanes he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted the sorowfull hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
of his disciples, he giueth comfort to the whole chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che:
Affirming, that he did not pray onely for those that
there were present with him, but also for all those that
should after beleue (by their preaching) in him. These
wordes he added for our singuler comforte: I haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnto them the glorie which thow hast geuen to me, that
they may be one as we are one, I in them a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thow in me,

shoulde we prostrate oure selues before oure God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
with vnfeined teares giue thanks for his mercie. Three
things in these wordes are to be obserued, first that the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8568:19"/>
same glorie which God the Father hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
the same hath he giuen to such as beleue in him: not
that either Christ Iesus had then the full glorie, as he was
man (for as yet he had not ouercome the death) neither y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
his elect at any tyme in this life can atteine to the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same, but that the one was as assured in gods
immutable counsell as was the other. For as the head
shoulde ouercome the bitter death, and so triumphe ouer
sathan the authour thereof, so should his membres in the
tyme appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, as he doth further expresse, sayinge: I wil
(Father) that where, that I am, there also be those which
thou hast giuen vnto me, that they may se my glorie.
The second is that so stre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ere is the coniunction
and vnion betweixt Christ Iesus and his membres, that
they must be one, and neuer can be seperated. For so did
Christe pray, Saing: That they all may be one, as we are
one. I in them a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thow in me, that they may be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
in one. Let the coniunction be diligently marked:
for much it serueth to our com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ort. As the Godhead is
inseparably ioined with the humanitie in Christ Iesus our
Lord, so the one that is the God head, neither could nor
can leaue the humanitie at any tyme. how bitter that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the stormes appeared: so ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not Christ Iesus leaue his
dear spouse the Church, neither yet any trew membre of
the same. For that he includeth vnder the generall word
(all) for any accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, how horrible that euer it be, that ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
to passe in their life. And albeit that this appere stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
and also a doctrine that may seme to giue libertie to
sinne, yet may not the children of God be defrauded of
their fode, becaus that dogges will abuse the same. But
of this we shall (God willing) after speak. The third thing
to be noted, is, that the loue of God towardes his elect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to Christe is immutable. For Christ putteth it in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
ballance with the loue by the which his Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him. Not that I wold any man should so vnderstand
me, as that I placed any man in equall dignitie and glorie
with Christe Iesus touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his office. No that must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
wholly and onely to him self: that he is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8568:20"/>
beloued, in whom all the rest are beloued: that he is the
head, that onely geueth life to the bodie: and that he is the
souerane prince, before whom all knee shall bowe. But I
meane, that as the loue of God the Father was euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
towardes his deare Sonne, so is it also towardes the
membres of his bodie, yea euen when they are ignorant,
and enemies vnto him,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> as the apostle witnesseth Sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: God
specially commendeth his loue towardes vs, that when we
were yet sinners, Christ died for vs: much more being iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
now by his blood, we shall be saued by him from w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.
For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to
God by the death of his Sonne, much more we being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
shall be saued by his life. To some, these wordes
maye appere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to oure purpose, for they make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of a reconciliation, which is not made, but where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is enemitie and dissention. But if they be righteously
considered they shall most euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proue that, which we
affirme, which is, that God loued the membres of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
bodie, euen when they are ignorant, when they by
them selues are vnworthie and ennemies. For this is his
first proposition, that we being iustified by faith, haue pea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
with God by our Lord Iesus Christ. Where he maketh
mention of peace, he putteth vs in mynde of the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and warre which was betwext gods iustice and oure
sinnes. This enemitie (saieth he) is taken away, and we
haue obteined peace. And le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t that this comforte should<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sodenly euanish, or els that men shoulde not depely
wey it, he bringeth vs to the eternall loue of God, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that God loued vs when we were weake. Where
we must obserue, that the apostle speaketh not vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of all men, but of such as were and shoulde be iustified
by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had the loue of God poured in to their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
by the holie Gost which was giuen vnto them. To such
saieth he. if God did loue vs when we were weake and his
ennemies, muche more must he loue vs when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
and begin in faith to call him father. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
affirmeth, that oure reconciliation proceded from
gods loue: which thing sainct Iohan more planely doeth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8568:20"/>
witnes in these wordes: In this appereth the loue of God
towardes vs, that God hath sent furth his onely Sonne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world that we should liue by him. In this I say is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 4.</note>
not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, and hath
sent his Sonne the propitiation for our sinnes. so that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
those apostles in plaine wordes do speake, that which
before I haue affirmed to witte, that God loued the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
of Christ Iesus euen when they were enemies aswell
touching their knowledge and apprehension, as also tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the corruption of their nature, which was not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.
And so I conclude as before, that the loue of God
to vardes his electe is stable and immutable, as it which
beginneth not in tyme, neither dependeth vpon our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines
or dignitie: which trueth is contrarie to that which
I perceaue ye holde and affirme. Thus far (I trust) we haue
sufficiently proued, and that by plain scriptures, and by
no patched vnreasonable reasons (as the author of your
booke accuseth vs.) That God hath his electe, whom in
Christ Iesus he hath chosen, and that of decreed purpose,
to giue them life. Which purpose, counsell, and loue of
God is sure stable, and immutable. Now resteth to proue,
that God hath reiected some, and also to note the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which folow vpon your doctrine, and so shall I not be

if I shall seme to excede modestie, let the godlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider,
that thy horrible blasphemies are intolerable. And first I
call the heauen and earthe, the insensible creatures, and
the iudgement of reasonable men to witnes with me, how
beastly be thy cogitations of the eternall God head: when
thou saiest. <hi>God must loue his birthes, becaus he hath giuen a na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall
inclination to all beastes to loue their birthes.</hi> If thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be good, then must God forget some of his birthes
in their youth, and reiecte all care of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that same
nature giueth God to som fowles, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> book of Iob doth
witnes in these wordes (speaking of the Estrich) which
leaueth his egges in the earth and maketh them hote in

or that the wilde beast might breake them. He sheweth
him self cruell vnto his young ones as they were not his
and is withoute feare as if he traualed in vain. For God
hath depriued him of wisdome and hath geuen him no
parte of vnderstanding. If thy reason I say be good, God
must loue his birth, because he causeth all other beastes
loue their birthes. Then I say, it must also folow, God
shall forgett, and hardly intreat som, for such nature and
inclination hath he giuen to som of his creatures as is
plainely proued.<note place="margin">What the aduersary will saye.</note> I do mean (thow wilt say) of loue onely:
but the scripture (which either ignorantly, orels mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8568:22"/>
to the miraculous restauration of the church whiche then
was most afflicted, that thow doest alledge to make God
haue like asrections with brute beastes. And that neither
thou nor any other shall haue occasion to reporte, that
I accuse the wrongfully.<note place="margin">Isaia. 66.</note> I will recite the hole wordes of
the Prophete, who thus speaketh: Before she hath traue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

hath neither respect to the naturall inclination of
beastes, neither yet to any common loue that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to his creatures. But to that incomprehensible and
vnchangeable loue which he beareth to his churche:
the multiplication, the ioy and felicitie whereof, he
will at once bring furth in such sort that his elect shall
neuer remember to their grief that they susteined any
passion or paine: Let the indifferent reader compare
this interpretation with the plane wordes of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:
and so let thy self iudge, how irreuerently thow
doest abuse the moste confortable wordes of the holie
Gost, to establish thy error. But let it be, that thow didst

so bolde, and impudent, that thow darrest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
God, to the law, lymites and boundes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re?
To speake the mater more planely. I ask of the
first if thow wilt denie the loue of God to be perfecte
except that he do for all maner of men that whiche
beastes naturally do for their birthes. Secondarely if
thow filthie earth darest burden God in his presence with

crueltie) as now thow doest in thy blind raige, if he hath
not created and made all men of equall estate condition
and dignitie. Thirdly if thow shalt stand in iudgement,
and lay iniustice to his charge, if he shew mercie to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he will, and also indurate a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d make hard who he will. For
all these thre,<note place="margin">The wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes of God can not be subiect to our reason</note> will I planely proue, that God doeth, first
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth not for his dearest children to our iudgement,
that which beastes naturally do for their birthes, I trust
thy self will easely confes. For the Tygar, the bear, the
Lyon and others do so tender their whelpes, that euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the strength of man (were he neuer so valiant)
will they fight for defence of their young ones, but we do
se that God comonly doth so permit his dearest children
to the cruel appetites of the most wicked men, that for a
season he appereth to haue forgotten them, and to haue
turned his face and countenance frome them. And shall
we therefor think, that gods loue is not perfect or that
his power is diminished or his good will towardes his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

but that God should reprobat any man whom he created to his

not say that he is enforced so to do) his dearest children
most cruelly to be handled, which no beast willingly will
do. Now let vs wey your seconde reason. <hi>man</hi> sayeth your
book <hi>is, the birthe, and child of God created to his own image
and similitud (as the Prophet saieth) wherefor God loueth his
own birth (that is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) Then did he not reprobate and cast away
man afore he was: for that were a proof that he hated and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.</hi>
Omitting your ignorance by the whiche
ye applie generally to all men those promesses which
the Prophete Malachie spake to the people of God.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> Let
it be granted vnto you that as all men were created in
Adam,<note place="margin">Malac. 2.</note> so God som maner of way is their father: what will
or can ye thereof conclude. That God loueth all say you.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8568:23"/>
If you vnderstand and affirme that equally God loueth all
because all were created by him, the common experience
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the diuersitie of gods giftes shall reproue your vaniti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vnto one man we see greater giftes giuen then vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
som we se verteouse and others giuen to nothing but
to iniquitie. If you say, he loueth them in that he offereth
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his grace which when they refuse, then beginneth
he to hate them, you haue proued nothing of your intent,
and further the plain scripture confuteth this your error.
and first I say that before ye can proue your conclusion to
be good, ye must proue that all men stode, do stand, and
be born in the same perfection that Adame was created
in. For it doth not folow, that God still loueth all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loued Adam (created to his own image and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.)
The reason is. Adam did fall from that image, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
rebellious inobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and slaue to the deuill. And in
the same damnation wrapped all his posteritie.<note place="margin">What we haue in Adam.</note> So that
now from Adam we can clame nothing, but sinne, wrath,
death, and hatred, as the apostle affirmeth, that of nature
we were all the sonnes of wraeth. If ye alledge that the apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle
speaketh in that place, of man as he is corrupted in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
and so iustly depriued from gods fauor, then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of you (if man doth yet sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in Adame) which if ye
confesse, the holie spirit shall conuict you of alie. For by
the mouth of the Apostle he affirmed that by one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

as he had chosen his elect before all beginning in Christe
Iesus his Sonne, so hath he placed these giftes in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Adam alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that of his fulnes we may all receaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
grace for grace. And thus ye may easely perceaue,
how vane be your arguments which you iudged most
strong. Your first, drawen from nature and naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
proueth nothing, becaus that God who is alwaies
fre, can not be subiect to the lawes of nature. Albeit that
for our weaknes he some tymes vseth similitudes taken
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8568:24"/>
from nature. Your second is like vaine, seing that neither
Adam him self did stand in his perfection, neither is any
of his corrupted sede as he is the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Adam borne in that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dignitie: But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie wise, we must refuse fle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>she,
and blood, nature and our first Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if euer we shall be
partakers of life. This onely were sufficient to confute,
bothe your vnreasonable reasons. But that, here after ye
shall haue no accasion to complain of obscurite, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet that we relent in any parte, I will first simply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what we teach and beleue, and there after by gods
grace euidently proue the same.<note place="margin">Error of Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes.</note> You make the loue of

by gods scriptures. How sure is the probation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part, let the indifferent reader iudge by that which
is all ready spoken. Let vs now come to the second.
And that ye shall not think that I shall more depend v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
argumentes and reason then vpon scripture,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> I will
begin with scripture, and let argumentes and reason ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
onely in stede of hande maides, which shall not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

and that the contrarie vices had taken place and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
in the heartes of bothe these miserable creatures,

How <hi>can it be proued, that this was his eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell?</hi>

this reason be sufficient or not in answering to your

to be obserued, whether it was the will of God or not to
make a difference betwext man and man. Plaine it is that
before his face as touching the first birth, there standeth
but one lompe, or masse (as saint Paul termeth it) and yet
from the same are two sedes appointed to spring, which
are the two churches: The elect conteined vnder the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

comprehended vnder the name of the serpentes sede.<note place="margin">The chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che of Christe and the serpente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the one is promised victorie, to the other is denounced
by the irreuocable sentence of God the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> broosing of the
head, which is destruction and confusion. I think ye will
not say, that he was constreined ther to by any force ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
as we speake, seing he is the eternall which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
not, euer abiding Lord ouer all creatures, who may
and doth performe what so euer he will in heauen and
in earth. Then of necessitie it must folowe, that this
battell is appointed by his will. And that do the wordes
plainely beare. For he saieth not I know that there
shall be a battell, or I will suffer and permitt [as you v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
to interprete such places] a battel to be, but he plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
saieth, I will put and stablish the battel and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
declaring thereby, that as he was the force,
strengthe, and the conductor to the sede of the woman
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8568:25"/>
so wolde he most assuredly giue victorie to the same.
Which thing S. Augustine diligently did note, and godly
admonished.<note place="margin">De bono perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> Affirming, that our condition in Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

of Adam in his own fre will. For that, that he had
non other strength, but that which might be and was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
But we haue the strength that is inuincible because
it is the power of the eternall. This one place I say doeth

of God. for it is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in respect of the faith wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes
and obedience of the one, and in respect of the infide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie
vicious liuing and inobedience of the other. Your

of God appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto his sede: in these wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des:
In thy sede shall all the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the earth be blessed,
I will blesse the a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d multiplie thee, such as blesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, shall I
blesse, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d such as curse the shall I curse. In w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wordes is no
les the battell, then the benediction established. For as al
nations were pronounced to be blessed in his sede (which
as the Apostle doeth interprete was Christe) so is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
that there shalbe some that shall curse, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor
shall be accursed of God. Yea it is plainely spoken
that foure hundreth yeares should his sede a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d posteritie be
euill intreated in a strange cuntrey, neuertheles the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom they shall serue shall I iudge (saieth the lord).
So haue we agane the difference plainely confirmed by
the voice of God. But yet God procedeth one degre fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in Abrahams sede he maketh difference. For in
Isaac (saieth he) shall thy sede be called, by the which voice
he did seclude bothe Ismael, and the rest of his carnall
sonnes from that honour: affirming that from none of
them should the benediction come, but onely from Isaak
which was the sonne of promes (and not of nature onely).
But that difference was most euidently declared in Isaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
two sonnes, being yet in their mothers boson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before
they had done either good or bad, as the Apostle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.
It was said by the voice of God, the elder shall serue
the younger. By which voice of God reueled, did Isaak a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
Rebecca plainely vnderstand, what was the cause of the
battell which the mother felt in her bosom a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wombe: to

counsell to elect for his peculiar people, the other to
reiect, and to leaue them in the common corruption as
the other nations: as the sequel in processe of tyme did
euidently declare. For the Edomites discending of Esau

for sede. And so to proue that which before he had
affirmed, to witt, hat all were not Israelites that came of Is<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rael,
he added these wordes. Not onely this, but also whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Rebecca had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of one, our father Isaak, while the
children were not borne, while they had neither done

now restreined and made proper to one head, and to the

and the other was refused. The one by grace, and of the

one remained the benediction, of the which the other was
depriued. In this maner, I say did bothe Isaak, Rebecca,

but none of all these thinges made them to be of God,
in such sorte as Christ denied them to be of him. For
all these thinges may the reprobat haue commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the

they apperteined to God more then others, is before said.
He further declareth what he had done vuto them,<note place="margin">What Christ did for his.</note> what
they also had done. And what he did and wold do to the
end for them, he had opened vnto them the name (that is
the mercie goodnes, constant trueth and perfect iustice)

the purpose and will of God being eternall, can not be
moued by our workes, or faith which be temporall. And
that if the purpose of God be stable and sure, that then can
not our workes being vnsure, be the cause thereof. But to
auoid prolixitie and tediousnes, I will by plaine scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
proue, that of fre grace did God electe, that of mere
mercie doeth he call and of his onelie goodnes without
all respect had to our dignitie (as to be any cause first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

And for the proofe of the same, let vs take Abraham and
his posteritie for example. Plaine it is, that he and his sede
were preferred to all the nations of the earth, the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was established to spring frome them, the promes
of the land of Canaan was made vnto them, and so were
they extolled to the honour a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dignitie of gods peculiar
people. But let vs consider what either faith or obedience
God found in them which might haue moued him thus to
preferre them to other na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if the posteritie of Abraham did not obteine the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the land of Canaan for any iustice that was in them?
yea if God did not choose them neither to the temporall
nor eternal felicitie, but of loue and fre grace onely, as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8568:32"/>
Moises doth witnes, how shall we thinke, that the Eternall
inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or gods election to the ioy and life euerlasting,
dependeth vpon any qualite within vs. Wonder it is, that
the Apostle sainct Paul intreating this mater of gods fre
election, was ignorant of this cause, if it be sufficient. For
by that meanes in few wordes he might haue put silence
to many dogges which then(as men do now) bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
against this doctrine. For if he had said: God hath
chosen afore all tymes to the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life a certein
nomber, because he foresaw that they should be faithfull
obedient to his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and holie in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation:
and vpon the other parte he hath reiected and reprobate
others, because he foresaw that they should be vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and vnclean of life, this I say (if those cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
had been sufficient) had ben a sensible maner of doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:
But the Apostle alledgeth no such reason but first bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
doune the pryde of man (as before we haue touched)
and there after brusteth furth in this exclamation. O the
hieght of the riches of the wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and knowledge of God,
how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehensible are his iudgements, and how vnsear
cheable are his wayes? This exclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I say) had bene vai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,
if either workes or faith foresene had bene the cause
of gods electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. S. Augustin doeth mock the sharpe sight

accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the purpose of his good will, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that in Christ

assembled when they shall receaue the promissed glorie,
is expressed in these wordes of the 24 elders,<note place="margin">Apoca. 4. &amp; 5.</note> who casting
their crownes before him that sitteth vpon the throne, do
say. Worthy art thow (o Lord a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our God) to take honour

and by thy will they are and were created. And after they
fall before the lambe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sing a new song saying: Worthie

that all thinges are in that perfecte state which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen
shall possesse, is attributed to his will. The death of the
lambe is assigned to be the cause of the redemption, yea
of that great dignitie to which they are promoted. I am ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly

the holie Gost, who is authour of all iustice, wold not haue

wold that none shoulde be borne to miserie, why did he

stay that venom and corruption in our first father, why

shift that here can serue you. For if you say, God was pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoked
by the sinnes of the posteritie, which he did forese
to be in them, so to do: I answer, that he foresaw nothing,
which his eternall and infinit power might not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued

Master (say they) who hath sinned, whether this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that any man could sin so greuously before he was
borne, that for the same he should be punished with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
blindnes during his life. And that he should suffer
such miserie for the offences of his Parentes, appered to
them to repugne to gods iustice, and to that sentence
which before he had pronounced by the Prophete Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel
affirming, that the son should not beare the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

giueth to you a profitable lesson if ye can receaue it:
affirming, that neither he, neither yet his Parents had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that so he should be borne, but that the glorie of God
should be manifested in him. If gods glorie be declared
and made manifest euen by the miseries which som crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures

you make a bold promes to proue the same by plain

not well grounded vpon these scriptures which ye alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.
Thus ye write: <hi>If God hath ordeined the most part of the

               <p>To the Maior I haue answered before, that falsly ye

that if God condemne mo then he shall saue, that

Or if you think (as some alledge vpon Origene that)
becaus gods mercie is infinit and extendeth vnto all his

that the wraith of God abydeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full,
that their fyre shall not be quenched, and that their

hath nothing which they receaue not of mercie, and that
the punishment of the reprobate is most iustly deserued,<note place="margin">Howgods mercy is greater then his wrath.</note>
you shall not mesure gods mercie and his wraith by the

that where none is worthie of gods mercies by their own
merits, yet hath it continued from the beginning and shal
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue vnto the end, euer extending the self to gods chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren

all wraith and iudgement: for where the wraith of
God once kindled against sinne oght to haue consumed
and deuoured all, mercie preualeth, and delyuereth those
that iustly might haue bene condemned. And in this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
(say we) that gods mercie far surmounteth his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
which interpretation if you admit not, we will

For before demnation there cometh a change in
man, so that he of verie good, became extreme euill, and
so gods iust iudgements found nothing but that which is
euill to condemne. You forme your reason, as that God
had so created ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good, that he by no meanes after could
be made euill, which last part is fals, and so you are decea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued.
If ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not se iust causes why God should make that
thing verie good which after should becom exttreme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
accuse your own blindnes, and desire of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres
in you that presumption and pryde, which against
the eternall Sonne of God you haue conceaued,<note place="margin">Why God treated ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theles to fall.</note> and so
your eyes shalbe illuminated and you shall se first that
becaus the creator is infinitly good, that therefor it beho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth
the creatures in their original creation to be good.
And so I doute not was the deuil created good, but in the
veritie, he stood not. And seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>darely that because the iust
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God were no les to shyne in the damnation
of the reprobat: then his infinite mercie was to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the vessels of honor, it behoued the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be innocent and good in their creation. For if the
original had bene euill, God iustly could not haue after
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned that which he had made no better. but so we must
confesse that it was good that (yet willingly corrupting
the self) ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made away to the most iust executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods
eternal cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell. And last that the eternall purpose of God
might in tyme be notified vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was that God wold
bestow greater liberalitie, shew greater loue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mercie in
the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustly damned then that he did in his
creation. Of nothing he did creat him (for his corporall
substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was made of the dust (which somtymes was not)
to his own image and similitude, to him he gaue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of all creatures, these were documents of a true
loue. But if they be compared with that loue, which in
Christ Iesus we receiue and that of fre grace, they are no
thing. For what is the dominion of earthlie creatures in
respect, that we shall reigne with Christ Iesus for euer?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8568:39"/>
what were the pleasures and fruites of Paradise in compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rison
of those heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie ioyes which sainct Paul affirmeth
can not enter in to the heart of man? If man had stand per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petually
in Adam, neither had the loue of God so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously
bene notified vnto vs, neither yet had place ben
gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to his fre grace a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mercie, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we receiue in Christ

cheif comfort of gods children is, that as they fell in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
so are they new transferred in an other that is in
Christ Iesus, to whom they are giuen, and who (as before
we haue proued) hath so receaued them from the hand of
his Father that he shall giue lief euerlasting to so many
as the Father hath giuen him. If ye (I say) can not admitt
these reasons, why it behoued ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be created good, and
yet after to fall in to sin and merserie, accuse your selues,
storm not against God. for he will not be subiect to your

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>As no man of hole iudgement did euer denie that
in Adam we did fall, so I think you a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your sect set a part
there hath ben none that euer did affirme that in Adam we
were predestinat to lief euerlasting. True it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we stood
in Adam, created in his loynes, but I suppose that ye will
not hold that the children had greater priuiledge then had
the father. Adam did not so stand, but that he was subiect
to the law, the transgression where of made him dettour to
death. To speake the mater more plainely, Adam did so
stand that he might (and did) fall as the euent declared. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
were his children so elect in him that they could not fall:
so ye appere to conclude. For thus ye reason: if we did all
stand then were we all predestinate to lief, for as our fall
here is to damnation and death, so is our sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and lief. Assuredly these reasons appear meruelous,
stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to me, and principally that which ye bring furth of
falling and standing: for it hath in the self plain contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
for if we fell in Adam to death, how can we stand in
him now vnto lief. If you had said as that our fall was to
damnation and death, so should our standing haue ben to
saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and lief, ye might haue had som probabilitie. For
your error had onely stand in this,<note place="margin">The gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und of the Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes error.</note> that ye do not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Adam was not created to stand for euer in him
self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and much les his posteritie in him. But when ye say as
our fall is to death, so is o<hi rend="sup">r</hi> standing vnto lief, you plainely
speak, what so euer ye think, that yet either in Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either
in our selues we both fall and stand. But this do we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abhorre, for we fear not plainely to confesse that we ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
no assurance either of standing either yet of lief but in
Christ Iesus alone in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be ingrafted, and with out w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

sense of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will approue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first part of this my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
for who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think that any disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of Adam by his
meanes could haue greater libertie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self had? And

cam death. But eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him descended death vnto all.
How then could any stand in him to lief? Let reasonable
men consider.</p>
               <p>To proue that all were predestinat and chosen in Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

laid, that this election ye should affirm to be made in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.
If you obiect that you specifie not Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I answer that
is all a like: for of your former argumentes it easely may
be espied whom ye vnderstand. For when thus ye reason
we did all stand in Adam, erg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> we were all predestinat to
lief, what is he that clearly may not perceaue that your
meaning is, that we were all predestinat to lief in Adam.
For els you had said nothing to proue your own purpose.
For we affirm that we were elected before the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the world was laid. But the controuersie standeth, in w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom.
We affirme and most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly beleue, that in Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste
Iesus the eternall Sonne of the eternall Father, were
we elected before all tymes. This ye can not abyde and
therefor ye seke all meanes to obscure the glorie of him
to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father hath geuen all power in heauen and in
earth: somtymes ye say (as now I haue declared) that this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> election was made in Adame: But whill that this will not
serue you, ye run to an other shift alledging that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaketh here of a generall election of the hole
world, and a not of any certen election which should abyd

               <p>Ye instantly require that we will shew any testimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie
of the scripture that hath reprobate any before the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dations

ye shall require no place more plaine, nor more euident
then the same, which most ignorantly, orels most mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously

in the same perished? And contrarie wies how many haue
bene wickedly broght vp, and yet by grace atteined to an
holie conuersation. If the cause of this diuersitie (I say) shal
be inquired and soght, it shall not be found in nature. for
thereby were and are we all borne the sonnes of wraith: if
in education and vp bringing, we se how ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that faileth.
The cause thereof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be of necessitie without man.
To make the mater yet more plaine by an exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, Paule
preached Christ Iesus, to be the onely Sauior of the world
both amongest the Iewes and gentiles, to som his prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching
was the sauour of lief, and to others it was the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of death. from whence commeth this diuersitie?
from the obedience, will, and faith of the one, say you.
and frome the stubborne inobedience, and infidelitie of
the other: you say somewhat, but not all. for true it is
that faith and an obedient will, is that which we call
Causam propinquam, that is the next cause to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension:
but what is the cause that the will of one
is obedient, and the will of the other stubborne,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8568:43"/>
that the one doeth beleue and the other doeth blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me:
How so euerye do shift,<note place="margin">The cause is not in nature of our faeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce.</note> the holie Gost in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
plainely affirmeth the cause not to be in nature nor
yet to procede of man, nor of his fre will, but to be the fre
grace of the caller, as Christ Iesus doeth witnes: None can
com vnto me excepte my Father draw him: No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can se
the kingdom of God except he be borne againe, and that
neither of blood neither of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God. who toucheth and openeth the
heartes of so many as he hath ordeined to lief, to aduerte
and beleue the thinges that be truely preached: As those
that be the shepe of Christe Iesus, who heare his voice and
know the same. These and many places mo, do most plai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely
declare,<note place="margin">What is the cause that some beleue and some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull.</note> what is the cause that some beleue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

som are left in nature, som are shepe, &amp; som are goates.
the heartes of som are touched and opened by the finger
and Spirit of God, as it was said to Peter: flesh and bloode
hath not reueled this vnto the, but my Father which is in
the heauen, and the heartes of others left in their own
blindnes and hardnes. If ye demand how is it then, that
God respecteth not the person of man? I answer if ye did
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a right what is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by acceptation of persons,
or what it is to respect persons ye should not doute in
this behalf.</p>
               <p>Acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of persons is when an vnworthie person
is preferred to a worthie,<note place="margin">How God respecteth not perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> either by corrupt affection of
those that do preferre him, either yet for some qualitie or
externall beautie that appereth in man. As if to the office
of a king or of a bushope, should one be elected, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath godlynes, knowledge, wisdom, nor yet the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of gouernement, because he is riche, noble of bloode,
fare and lustie: and the persons hauing giftes much more
excellent should be contemned: this is called acceptation
of persons.<note place="margin">1. Sa. 16.</note> As Samuel seing Eliab and considering his
beautie, and stature doeth boldly pronounce in his own
heart, assuredly before the Lord, this is his anoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Such
acceptation of persons is not with God. for neither loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8568:43"/>
he to blood, riches, nobilitie, vertue, strength nor
beautie temporall in his eternall election, but onely to
his own good will, and eternall purpose by the which he
hath elected vs in Christe Iesus. If ye shall consider the sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me
place depely ye shall find that none within the hole scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptures
of God more confuteth your error then it doeth.
For as God respecteth not the person<note place="margin">That God hath not respect of persons most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth the error of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saries of gods prede<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stination.</note> of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so respecteth
he nothing, that is or can be within man, as the chief cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of his election. For what can God forese, consider or
know to be in man that good is which floweth not from
his fre mercie and goodnes, as it is written: we are not
sufficient of our selues to think any thing that good is
but all our sufficiencie is of God, who worketh in vs
bothe to will and performe. Then if all vertue what so
euer be in vs, be the work of God, can the work folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be the cause of gods eternall purpose? If the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
and the effectes<note place="margin">The cause and effect are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.</note> proceding of the same, be things diuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se,
then are our vertues and fruites not the cause of gods
election, but are the effect and fruit which of the same
procede, and spring as the Apostle doeth witnes saing: God
hath chosen vs that we should be holie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without blame
And Christ Iesus: saieth you haue not chosen me but I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
chosen you, and haue appointed you to go, and to
bring furth fruite. This I am compelled oft to repete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
in it most shamefully ye erre, arrogating to your sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uses
that which is proper to gods onely mercie and fre gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce.
If you vnderstand this former place of scripture which
affirmeth that God hath no respect of persons as your
book doeth witnes, to witt, that God careth a like for all,
that he no more loueth the one, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, except that
it be for their obedience, the hole scripture of God doeth
witnes against you. Was the loue of God no greater to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
and to his posteritie, then it was to the rest of the
nations? Moises and Dauid do witnesse the contrarie: Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
he hath not done so to any nation, and his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts

all nations and people, that be vpon the face of the earth,
that thow shouldest be vnto him a peculiar people. And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8568:44"/>
what was the cause of this their dignitie and prerogatiue
before we haue declared, to witt, no vertue, no obedience,
no good qualitie that was in them, but onely his fre loue,
fre grace, and vndeserued mercie, as he hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self doeth plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
affirme?<note place="margin">Rm. 9.</note> I will haue mercie vpon whom I will haue
mercie, and saint Paule: it is neither of the willer, neither
yet of the runner, but of God that sheweth mercie to such
as pleaseth him. And thus I say you can not iustly nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>htly
conclude, that God hath neither chosen nor reproba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
any man, becaus he hath no respect of persons. for as
before I haue said, his eternall election dependeth neither
vpon man, neither yet vpon any thing that is within
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Neither was nor is in vs, any thing whereby we should deserue to be elected</note> but is purposed in him self, and established in Christ
Iesus, in whom we are elected, becaus that in our selues
there neither was neither yet could be any worthines, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
could merite or deserue such honour and dignitie.
And so God respecteth not the persons of men, their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
nor qualities in their election, but finding them all
equall in creation, and corruption maketh difference
betwext them, according to his eternall purpose, respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Christ Iesus and not their merites. How that euer
the prowde and vngodlie storme at this, I nothing doute,
but the children of God do thereof receaue moste singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

all trembling and feare, they stoupe before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,

do craue of his mercie such a puretie of lief as becometh

               <p>To your scriptures which ye alledge from the book

the booke of wisdom, neither yet Ecclesiasticus, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet Esdras in these places that be alledged do intreat
any thing of election, or reprobation, but the writers in
all those places which ye alledge do studie to amend the
corrupt maners of their aeges, and to impose sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the
wicked tongues of many. of whom som accused God as
author of sinne which entred in by malice of the deuill,
who did corrupt the good creature of God created to his

not se but that this writer, who so euer he was, reteineth
him self, within the reache of mannes vnderstanding, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
to conuict their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science which maliciously im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puted

and that therefor they should suffer their iust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The argument which ye gather of the nynthe chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
of the same book, and wold seme to confirm by the
wordes of Christe spoken in the seuenth of Mathew, hath
no greater force then the former, for the writer defineth
not what God had determined in his secrete and eternall
counsell, but what he hath expressedly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
charge by his law, and by his holie Spirit speaking in
his Prophetes, and that him self doeth plainly witnesse.
For after that he hath asked wisdom righteously to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
the people committed to his charge he thus speaketh:
what man is he that knoweth the counsell of God or that
can comprehend in his mynd, what God wold? The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations

that thow shall giue wisdom and from the hiest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
shall send thy holie Spirit: for so the wayes of those
that dwell vpon earth haue bene directed, and they haue

pleaseth you, that because man was made lord ouer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in earth (for that is the veritie of the text) to reule
the world in holynes: That therefor there was no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated,
and he writer will answer for him self and will
affirme, that he searcheth not what God hath determined
in his eternall counsell, and what shall become of euerie
man, (for that confesseth he to be incomprehensible), but
he declareth what God commandeth in his law, and what
he hath expressed by his holie Prophetes. To the which
if man be found inobedient resteth no excusation (seing
that gods will is manifestly declared) as Moises saieth in
these wordes. The secretes appertein to the Eternall our

               <p>Your argumentes which ye think most strong ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
of these wordes in the 7. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d 12. of Mathew are most
weak and vaine. For as we do not denie that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
iust, so do we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly affirme that in iustice he stood
not, but became altogether vniust, and therefor God did
not condemne man before he was giltie, as you falsly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our doctrine. Wonder it is, that ye se not degrees
and iust causes which com betwext the purpose of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
and the iust condemnation of man. This is your
argument: God purposed to reiect man before he was crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted.
Ergò he did damne him before he was criminall or
glitie. Your consequent is fals far no part of gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
was put in execution before man did sinne. for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
was offered to Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his fall: Cayn was admonished

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8568:46"/>
in their furie, and finally all flesh had corrupted their
waies befor that gods vengeance and most iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were poured furth and put in execution against the
rebellious and vnthankfull world. If you be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
that the sentence of death was executed vpon Adam
before he offended, or that Cayn was accursed by gods
mouth before he had murthered, then hath your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
som apperance. but if the iust causes of condemnation be
found in man, and so founde in man that God in vowies
can thereof be accused: then oght you to be ashamed to
burden vs with that which ye your selues most folishly
collecte. And further ye shall vnderstand that as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
putteth certen degrees and causes which are sensible
vnto vs, betwext the eternall election of gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

none did stand to the end in that image, but all fell
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death in Adam: that therefor neither in Adam nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

go about to proue by our opinion the ordinance of God

his ordinance in the creation and so consequently God to
be a transgressor and inconstant, ye declare your self not
onely ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vaine and foolishe, but also irreuerent and
blasphemous against gods maiestie. for ye (so far as in
you lieth) spoile him of his Godhead making him to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
his counsell, purpose, and ordinance euen so oft as the

a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not to escaip any viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your dartes by a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
solution (as ye alledge) but by the plaine scriptures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
we do affirme that as our God is eternall incompre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hensible,

And therefor we say that neither in his election before

ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that all the posteritie of Adam should be saued.
And so can ye not proue that God destroyed any thing
which he had builded. Albeit to note one thing by the
way: Paule wold not haue bene so bold, as to haue made
him self check mate with God, he did not (I say) accuse
God of inconstancie, neither did he appoint him to be a
transgressor althogh he builded the ceremonies vnder
the Law, and destroied them againe. But to our purpose.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I say destroied nothing which he had builded. True
it is that man destroied that image which God had buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8568:47"/>
but that building of God was but temporall, and for
a tyme onely, but the perfect building of his churche was
in Christe Iesus, builded before the foundations of the

shall destroy, but shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>summate the work to the praise
of his holie name. To him be glory.</p>
               <p>In your hole reasoning of the wordes of the Apostle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
you do erre in this point, as before I haue noted, that ye
make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all, that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holie Gost maketh pecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liare
to gods elect. for ye must first proue all to be saintes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
by vocation,<note place="margin">All be not Saintes nor blessed with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</note> all to be blessed with spirituall benediction,

of the Prophetes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Apostles before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye be able to
proue that all were elected and predestinate in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
before all tymes. That we are created in Christe Iesus
vnto good workes, is not to be referred (as ye think) to
the common creation of all men in Adam, but to the new
and spirituall regeneration which gods children haue in
Christ Iesus: for the which Dauid did pray, saying: a clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heart creat in me (ô God) which is no lesse called the crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of God, then was the first creation of man. for as man
in his creation, neither wroght, neither yet could deserue
to be created so honorable as he was, but did suffer the
power of God to worke euen as it pleased his wisdom to
perfourm the work. So in our new creation vnto good
workes the onely grace and power of God worketh not
onely the beginning,<note place="margin">Oure rege<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neration to good workes is by the gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of God.</note> but also bringeth to perfection, so
that what so euer be good, holie, or iust in vs, is gods crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
and not our worke. God open your eies that ye may
se that neither in Adam neither yet in our selues, were we
created to good workes, but in Christe Iesus alone. And
then I think ye will not so much boast of your fre will.</p>
               <p>Your last, as after ye do reason is a plain Paralogis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that is a Sophisticall and fals argument: for it sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
on foure termes against the vse of all good and solide rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soning.
For thus ye procede: Saing, we be elect and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Christe Iesus, and seing there is no condemnation
to them that be in Christe Iesus, then is there no damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8568:48"/>
neither in the election nor creation. Here be plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
foure termes. for in your Maior that is in the first
part of your argument ye say not, we were elected and
created in our election, and in our creation, but we we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
elected a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d created in Christ Iesus. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is most trew to witt that there is no conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation to them
that be in Christe Iesus, to such as walk not after the fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>she.
but what can ye conclude hereof, that no damnation
(say you) is in election nor in creation? I say your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is fals and vaine for you cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge your termes, putting
in the last part these two wordes: Election and creation,
where ye oght to haue rehearesed these wordes: Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:
for thus you may well procede, we be elected a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
to good workes in Christ Iesus, but to them (saieth the
Apostle) that be in Christ Iesus there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation,
Ergo to such as be elected and newly created in Christe
Iesus there is no damnation. This argument is formall
and true. but omitting your foolishnes which oftener I
am compelled to shew then gladly I wold, I go forward
with your wordes.</p>

them which com at the first calling to renounce father a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
mother, wief and childe with all other earthlie thinges, yea and
them selues also. This is the secounde election where there depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an innumerable multitude which will not forsaik such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

and that mo do either seme to haue no thirst to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

such as did trauale and were burdened w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sinne: such I say
he confesseth him self to call to repentance. But to such as

so yet once agane I affirme that the scriptures of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

but mention of one Election to lief euerlasting. I am
not ignorant that Saule was elected to be king ouer Israel

to the lief euerlasting in Christe Iesus, before that they
did offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (for so you affirme) I remitt you to your proofe.

               <p>It may appere to some that in heaping of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emples
and histories,<note place="margin">To the 5.</note> which ye adduce for your especiall

and obey the same. But these whom ye rehearse, did heare
the voice (as ye alledge) but neither did they know nor
obey it, Ergo they were not the shepe elected and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
chosen. if thus I say any man should reason, prepare
for your answer. And farther how ye be able to proue that
Sardanapalus, Croesus and Tarquinius the proude can be
placed in this rank of your especially elected, I can se no
good reason. for except that calamitie and gods iust ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
did folow their insolencie, filthie lief, and pryde, I
fynd in histories no speciall message sent vnto them from

Althogh we do not greatlie feare the force of your

lief nor death, thinges present nor to com seperat and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer
vs from the loue of God which is in Christe Iesus.
That this foundation is stable the Lord knoweth his own:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
and therefor shall euerie one that incalleth the name of
the Lord depart from iniquirie. for we are not called to
vncleannes but vnto sanctification and holynes by the
power of that Spirit who raysed from death Iesus the great
Pastor of our soules, which holie spirit frely by faith (w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
also is the gift of God) doeth so reule and reign in our
heartes, that albeit the flesh lusteth against the spirit yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
we assured of victorie by the onely power of him, who
hath ouercom the world. This is our doctrine, faith and
professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But you affirme as after plainely ye write, that
none is so elected in Christ to lief euerlasting, but that he
may fall, becom a reprobate and finally be condemned,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary waies, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none is so reprobate in gods eternall
purpose, but that he may becom elect a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so be saued. That
in God there is neither election nor reprobation but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to mannes disposition: so that when men haue

and write their names in the book of lief, but when they
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and turne to iniquitie he doeth reprobate them and

hole seuentie whom he sent to preach or others who for

adde. That by the mercie of God it cometh to passe tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we abyde not in wickednes. Therefor sei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that naturally
we all labor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a like sicknes. These onely receiue health
and amend to whom it hath pleased the Lord to put to his

Neither yet from any where els doeth it com that
som continue to the end, and others fall in to the curse
which was begonne. for because that persuerance it self
is the gift of God, which is not commonly giuen to al:
but he frely giueth it to whom it pleaseth him. If the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of the difference be soght, why som constantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and why others fall away by instabilitie, none other
cause may be assigned, but that the eternall God sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthneth the one sort, by his own power, that
they perishe not, and vnto the others he giueth not the
strength, that they may be docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and witnes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

ye answere education w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> som Philosophers do, that will be

will, we procede demanding who giueth the good will, if
ye alledge man him self, the scripture proueth you liers
saing it is God that worketh the will and the perfourman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
if God be granted (as he can not be denied) to be the
onely author of all goodnes, then ask we, why giueth he
the good will to the one, and not to the other. If ye answer
becaus the one receaueth grace and the other doeth refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
it, ye haue said nothing to the purpose. for we still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
if God may not (if so it pleased his eternall wisdom)
frame and forme the will of the one to as great obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
as the will of the other: fret and fume as ye list: this ye
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not denie, except that ye will be blasphemous deniers
of his omnipotent power. Now of this manifest diuersitie
which we se in mankinde, we conclude that God hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
his elect whom of mercie he calleth, by faith iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
and by his holie Spirit sanctifieth, and in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him self and of his Sonne Iesus preserueth to the
end, and so in the end shall he glorifie them: as also that
he hath his reprobate, whom for iust causes he leaueth to
them selues to la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gwish in their corruption, to passe from
iniquitie to iniquitie, till that they com to perdition, as
they that are prepared vessels of wraith. If this ye be not

for our reasons do stand as I haue shortly rehearsed
which you be neuer able to moue.<note place="margin">De eterna Dei proede<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stinatione</note> Trew it is that Iohn
Caluin thus writeth: Inter electos &amp; reprobos mutua est

forged. Becaus ye wold not forgett your merie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
of your Iew,<note place="margin">To the. 2.</note> ye boldly denie that gods election hath
respect to his contrarie reprobation. But when ye should
come to the plaine demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stration thereof, ye are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to flie to this shift: There is no such word or phrase
in the scripture. if such a reason should be made before a
reasonable man, I think it iustly might be reiected. for if
this be a good reason: Election hath no respect to his con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarie
reprobation, because the wordes nor phrase are not
in the scripture, then is this reason good also: Lot sinned
not committing incest with his daughters: for in the hole
scriptures there is neither such worde nor phrase, that in
plaine wordes affirmeth: that Lot sinned commiting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
with his daughters. Consider the vanitie of your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and be ashamed. Ye can not denie, but this word E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
is redde in the scriptures: And so oft I say can ye
not denie except that willingly ye will corrupt the mind
of the holie Gost, but that it hath respect to his contrarie
reprobation, as by the phrases which ye impudently denie
to be in the scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ures is most euident. As when Paul sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
hath God then reiected or refused his people? God
forbyd.<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> God hath not refused his people whom he knew
before. And so alledgeing the like to haue bene in the
daies of Helias, he saieth: euen so in this tyme there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
a residue or a few nomber left according to the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of grace, that is according to the fre election, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
vnto workes. And after he saieth that which Israel
seketh, it hath not atteined vnto: but the election hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
vnto it: but the rest were blinded, whether that this
phrase doeth not plainely proue that election in this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
hath respect to his contrary, reprobation, let the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
reader iudge. The election (saieth saint Paule) hath
atteined (vnderstanding the illumination which God did
promise) but the rest were bli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. If ye will not suffer that
this blinded rest: whom God iustly had reiected, shall be
called reprobat, studie ye for a more ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle worde. for we
must vse such as the holie Gost hath taught vs. But
yet one phrase or two mo: I shall haue mercie, saieth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:8568:57"/>
God to Moses, vpon whom I will haue mercie. And Paul
feareth not to adde his contrarie saing: and whom he will
he maketh hard hearted. And agane what if God willing to
shew his wrath and to make his power knowen hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
with long patience the vessels of wrath made redie
to damnation: and that he might declare the riches of his
glorie on the vessels of mercie which he had prepared vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
glorie. If mercy, lief, the vessels of mercie, and glorie
haue contrarie, respect to seueritie, to destruction, to the
vessels of wraith, and of dishonor, then can it not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that election, (from the which all these former
graces flow to the elect) hath contrarie respect to reproba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.
I omitte the rest of the phrases which be common in
scripture and make plaine difference betwext the elect
and reprobat, because before I haue noted diuerse and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
must be compelled to repete the same. How sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly

of the simple, I will prepare my self to answer with
greater modestie then your malice deserueth. I haue said
before that this patch, vpon the which ye gather your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie
is none of our doctrine. for we haue neither writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
nor yet taught: that where so euer is election, there
must also reprobation be. of the same kynd: but simply
we say that election hath respect to his contrarie reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But to grant you somwhat, and not to hold you so
streit, let it be that so we had written, what should right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereof folowe? that there must be mo Christes, of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
som must be reprobate, say you, becaus that Christ is
called the elect of God, I answer in this your argument,
ye vse two fallaces, that is fals and deceatfull apperances
of a trueth, which are but manifest lies. The former, you
change the termes, putting elect and reprobate in the mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor
and in the conclusion, where we put election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
in the Maior, which is not lawfull in a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
for where we say (as ye affirme) where so euer is
Election, there must also reprobation be ye infer, Christ
is the elect of God, Ergo there must be mo Christes, of
whom som must be reprobate. Who seeth not here the
changing of the termes. Let your argument procede in

God of one masse that is of Adam, hath prepared som

appoint a head to reule, and giue lief to his elect, that is
Christ Iesus our Lord, whom he wold in tyme to be made
like vnto his brethren in all thinges sinne except. Who in
respect of his humaine nature is called his seruante, the

for twelue legions of Angels, and yet he might haue praied as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
saieth him self. Of this it is manifest that notwithstanding the for
knowledge of God things may com to passe otherwiese then
they do. Wherefor it foloweth that Gods foreknowledge causeth
no necessitie. Pilate had power to crucifie Christ, or to let him go:
which Christ denied not, but rather affirmed it saing he had that

he might haue done it. Ananias solde his possession,
and yet he might haue not sold it: he broght a parte of the price
thereof to the Apostles, which he might haue reteined to him.
as Peter witnesseth that the price therof was in his own power,
Many such other exemples may I bring furth whereby it should

how the creatures and their willes without compulsion, do
serue gods purpose and counsell. for sathan was neither
sent nor commanded of God to tempt man: but of malice
and hatred did most willingly and gredely runne to the
same: the will of man being fre before, was not by God
violently compelled to obey sathan: but man of fre will
did consent to sathan and conspire against God. And yet
was the fall of man not onely foresene and fore knowen
of God, but also before decreed for the manifestation of
his glorie. Let vs yet take an other exemple that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may be more euident. The death of Christe Iesus for
mans redemption, was decreed in the eternall counsell
of God before the foundations of the world were laid as
we were elected in him, and as he was the lambe killed
from the beginning, which death also was decreed in the
same counsell of God to be in a certein time appointed:
And that so certenly that neither could the malice of any
creature preuent the houre appointed of God thereto: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet could any policie or chance impede or transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the same to any other tyme. For how oft Christ was afo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
assaulted, the Euangelistes do witnes: But alwaies his
answere was: my houre is not yet come. And what impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentes
did occure immediatly before his death, is also
euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The feast of Easter was instant, the fame of Christ
was great, the fauor of the people, with publick voices was
declared, and the counsels of the hie priestes and seniors
had decreed that to auoid sedition his death should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
till after that feast: But all these were shortly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
and Christ did suffer in the verey tyme appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as he before had forespoken. But now to the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
which serue in this mater, and whether they were
compelled by God or not. Iudas we know was not one

witnes, to witt his auariciousnes. The scribes, Phariseis,
Priestes and Seniors and people, led, som of malice and

they did serue to gods purpose and most iust will, then
fulfill their most wicked willes: then will you cry blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and say that I deliuer the deuill, Adam, and all the
wicked frome sinne, of the which I make God to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
To the first I haue answered before, that as I sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

that he worketh all in all thinges according to the

no violence, neither in compelling his creatures, neither
constreining their willes by any externall force, neither

iustice, vsing them as he knoweth most expedient for the

done to their willes.<note place="margin">When vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lence is do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the will of a creature.</note> For violence is done to the will of

choose som to saluation,<note place="margin">Themynd of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the 9. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

condemnation. Secondarely, that of this his fre Election
there is none other cause, nor foundation, but his mere
goodnes, as also his mercie, which after the fall of Adame
doeth without all respect, had to their workes receaue and
embrasse whom it pleaseth him. Thirdly that God in this
his fre election is bound to no necessitie to offer the same
to all indifferently, but contrarie wies he passed by such
as it pleaseth him, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaseth him he receaueth.
These propositions (I say) are so euident in Paules wordes
that they neuer can be moued by your malicious and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
wresting of the text: for in euerie one of Paules
sentences, he striueth directly against your error. for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
he saieth: Rebecca conceaued of one, that is of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Isaak, he secludeth al cause that might haue bene by
accidentes, which come in tyme, either in the father or in

might abide according to election, not of workes, but of
the caller &amp;c, is plainely denied merites, dignitie, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
to com, to be any caus of gods fre election. For if he
wold haue persuaded men to haue beleued that God had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8568:68"/>
elected som in respect of their good workes to com, and
had reiected others for their euill workes onely, which
he foresaw that they should do: Paul had not so vehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and after with his kingdome. But the plaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

from contemplation of him self, to God, to his fre

was it no thraldome, that with crying owling, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d furious

that the heades should be secluded, that are ye neuer able

the Prophete, after the reduction of the people frome the

and so to grow to som stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth within the citie, and

and vnthankfull vnto God. the people were slothfull:
and the priestes, who should haue prouoked the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the remembrance of those great benefites, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
euen like to the rest. The Lord therefor did raise vp

his Prophete Malachie (who was the last before Christ)
sharply to rebuke and plainely to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uict this horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
of that vnthankfull nation, who so shamefully
had forgotten those so great benefits recently bestowed
vpon them. And thus beginneth he his prophecie: I haue
loued you (saieth the Lord) in which wordes he speaketh
not of a common loue which in preseruing and feding all
creatures, is commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the which he had sanctified and seperated them from the
rest of nations to haue his glorie manifested. But becaus
they (as all vngrate persons do) did not consider wherin
this his loue towardes them more then towardes others
did stand: he bringeth them to the fountein, demanding
this question: was not Esau brother to Iacob (saieth the
Lord) and neuertheles Iacob haue I loued and Esau I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
hated, and this he proueth not onely by the diuersitie
of the two cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis, which were giue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to Iacob and to his posteritie, reducing them againe after
long captiuitie, declaring him self as it were ennemy to
Edom, whose desolation he wold neuer restore, but wold
distroy, that which they shoulde go about to build. Let
now the godlie reader iudge whether that the mynd of the
Prophete was to seclude Iacob, in his person from the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
of God, and Esau from his hatered: or that it was not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to rebuke the vnthankfulnes of the people, who did
not consider that vndeserued loue, which God did shew
to their first father, whiles he was yet in his mothers boso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
for where he saieth, was not Esau brother to Iacob, he
wold put them in mynd that Iacob had no prerogatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
Esau, yea that the was inferior to him as co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cerning
the law of nature, and therefor that he oght to haue bene
subiect vnto him: but God of fre grace did preferre the
yonger to the elder, which loue and preferment he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
did kepe to his sede after him.</p>
               <p>This I am assured can no godlie man denie to be
the verey meaning of the Prophete. Trew it is that he
doeth include both the peoples, the one loued, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

hated. But what reason is it that the heades shall be
secluded? seing that the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of the diuersitie did first
appere in them, and the Prophete plainely saieth: Iacob
haue I loued, and Esau haue I hated. Now to the mind of
the Apostle you say that these wordes: afore the children
were born, are not to be referred to the sentence which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
Iacob haue I loued, Esau haue I hated: and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
ye add as we before haue declared. I answer that the

blindnes oght to admonishe all men to examin them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
with what conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they go to intreate gods secrete

oght not to be referred to these wordes: Iacob haue I lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Esau haue I hated, I pray you to what wordes og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht
they to be referred? Did the Apostle speak the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
without respect to any thing folowing? I trust ye
will grant asmuch as God spak, to witt that before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
wer born God said, The elder shal serue the yonger.
and then I pray you answer whether ye think, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
of Iacob to Esau proceded frome loue or frome
hatred? or if the subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Esau to his brother was not a
declaration of gods hatred? If you denie, yet will the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
condemne you, as before we haue proued, ye can
not escaip with the solution which a writer defending fre
will giueth, which is this: That there mention is made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
of temporall and carnal benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ment vnder the
name of loue, and of pouertie with barrennes of grounde
vnderstand by the name of hatred, which solution is so col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
that it perisheth in the self for I think no man to be so
blynd, but that he seeth the mynd of the Apostle to be be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
vpon the spirituall benediction, as in his hole disputation
is euident. But let it be that the corporall benediction (w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich

yet that neither helpeth him nor you. for where so euer
gods establyshed loue is, there is lief, where so euer his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
hatred is, there is death: but vpon Iacob and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his sede (spiritual I mean) was established the loue of
God, as the Prophete affirmeth, and our Apostle most pro

foundely alledgeth: and vpon Esau, and vpon his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was established and confirmed the hatred: Ergo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ioyneth this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: as it is written, Iacob haue I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but Esau I haue hated. In which wordes the holie
Gost agreeth together the wordes of the Prophete, and
the wordes of God spoken to Rebecca, and maketh the
one to interprete the other. for where God saieth, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and where he pronounceth dominion to the yonger,
that the Prophete explaneth sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: Iacob haue I loued. And
when did God thus loue the one, and hate the other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the one to be Lord and the other to be seruant?
While they were yet (saieth he) in their mothers wombe,
and before they had either done good or bad. Denie now if

yet neuertheles wold repair and build it vp againe to such

intreath an other as before is said, the one can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

Wo to be to him that striueth with his maker, the
vessel of clay with the Potter of clay,<note place="margin">Isaiah. 45</note> Shall the clay say to
his potter: what makest thow: In which wordes (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Apostle folowing his phrase, represseth the pryde of man,
who compared to God is much more inferior to his
maiestie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> clay compared to the Potter. For God hath
created and made man when he was not, which thing the

ouer man, then hath the potter ouer clay. This I doubt
not to be the mynd of the holie Gost, in bothe the places.
In which similitude, is further to be considered, that as
the Potter doeth no iniurie to the clay, what forme soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he giueth it (for the matter and substance of it,<note place="margin">God doeth<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Wrong to none of his creatures, how soeuer he maketh them.</note> he

that are they of nature. Where that ye say, that it is not

doeth make anie man to destruction: none of vs doeth

cruelly affirme gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be the cause of damnation. I wold

of those thinges, which to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and know is neither
lawfull neither yet possible in this life. The apperance
of knowledge in such thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, is a kynd of madnes. These

                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:8568:79"/>
him we must confesse, except that we wold in concealing
the trueth declare our selues to be vnthankfull, that we
all haue receaued comfort, light and erudition, as from
gods good instrument. who yet thus further procedeth
There be thre thinges (saeth he) in this mater to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
first that the eternall predestination of God by the
which he had decreed what should becom of all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kynd,
(yea and of euerie man) euen befor that Adam fell, was
sure and appointed: Secondly, that Adame for his defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was iustly adiudged to death, and last that in the
personne of him that then was lost, was damned his hole
posteritie. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet neuertheles God did frely choose of the
same such as vpon whom it pleased him to bestow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of adoption, and yet after in the same place he saieth
when we speak of predestination, I haue constantly
taught and this day do teach, that frome thence we oght
to begin, that iustly are all reprobat left in death, who were
dead and damned in Adame, that iustly they perishe who
by nature are the sonnes of wrath. And therefor that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
hath cause to complein of gods rigorous seueritie,
seing that all do bear the cause of damnation within them
selues. for if we shall com to the first man we shall find
that willingly he fell, and so by his one faule, he broght
perdition to all his posteritie. And albeit that Adam fell
not, but that God both knew and ordeined thesame, yet
serueth that nothing, nether to extenuat and excuse his
crime, nether yet to wrap God in societie of the same: for
alwaes must we looke to this, that he spoiled him self
of the righteousnes which he receaued from God, that wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lingly
he made him selfe seruant to sinne and to sathan,
that without compulsion he cast him self headlong in to
destruction and death. yet resteth one excuse, to witt
that he could not auoid nor flie that which was decreed
by God: but his voluntarie transgression is sufficient to
his condemnation, nether yet is the secrete counselle of
God the proper and naturall cause of sinne, but the fre
and plaine will of man. And there for seing that man fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8568:79"/>
in him self the cause of his miserie, what shall it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt
him to seke it in the heauen. And after albeit that
men by long compassing about, purpose to delude them
selues, yet can they neuer make them selues so bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishe
and dull but they shall fele the sense of sinne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in their heartes. Therefor in vaine is it, that vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
goeth about to absolue man, whom his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
damneth. In so far as God willing and knowing
permitted man to fall, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cause may be secrete and hid,
but vniust it can not be. And yet he further writeth, this
saieth he is to be holden without all controuersie, that
sinne was euer hatefull to God, for most rightely doth this
commendation, wherewith of Dauid he is commended
aggre to him: that he is a God that wold not iniquitie, but
rather in ordeining the fall of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and purpose was
good and most right,<note place="margin">The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of god in mannes fall.</note> frome the which the name of sinne
abhorreth. howbeit I say that so he hath ordeined the
fall of man that I vtterly denie him to be the author of sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne.
Let the indifferent reader iudge with equitie: if iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly
we be accused of that blasphemie, which so openlie we
abhorre. but yet in the same book he bringeh furth a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of Augustine who thus writeth, These be the
great workes of God (saieth Augustine) broght to pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
in all his willes,<note place="margin">Enchi. ad Lauren. cap. 1</note> and so wisely broght to passe that whill
the nature of Angell and man had sinned, that is, had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
not that which he that is God wold, but that which the
self (meaning the creature) wold: yet not the les by the
same will of the creature, by the which that was done,
which the creator wold not, did he fulfill that which he
wold, he being infinitely good, vsing well those thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges that
were euil, to the damnation of them, whom he iustly had
appointed to paine, and to the saluation of those
whom mercifully he had predestinate to grace. In so far
as to them perteined they did the thing which God

they might by no meanes haue done that, for euen
in that, that they did against the will of God, the will
of God was done in them, and therefor great are the

workes of the Lord (broght to passe in all his willes) that
by a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous and vnspeakable maner, that thing should

                  </gap> it should not be done if he did not suffer it. And of a
trueth he suffered it not vnwilingly, but willingly. And
a litil before saint Augustin saieth, it is not to be doubted,
but that God doeth well, permitting those thinges to be
done which are euil. for he suffered not this, but in his iust
iudgement. Albeit therefor that these thinges which be
euill in so far as they ar euill, are not good, yet neuertheles
it is good, that not onely good thinges, but also that euill
thinges be. for if that this were not good that euil thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
should be, by no meanes should they be permited to
be by the omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good, to whom no doubt, it is a like
easie not to suffer the thing which he will not to be, as to
do that thing which he will: except we beleue this, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of our faith is indangered, by the which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
our selues to beleue in God the father almighti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And in the end to answer to these calumnies which
ye haue taken furth of Pighius that papist, Iohn Caluin
concludeth, if euer I had said that it came to passe by the
instruction or motion of the spirit of God, that the first
man did alienat him self frome God, and not that rather
I haue in al places defended, that man was pricked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by instigation of the deuill and by the motion of his
own heart, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meritably might Pighius and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices
haue railed agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st me. But seing that I remouing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God
the verey cause of the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, do also remoue from him all
crime, so that man onely is subiect aswell to the crime as
to the punishment: wickedly and maliciously is this laid
to my charge that I should say that mannes defection and
fall is one of gods workes. But yet lest y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one thing should
appere to lacke of our full doctrine, I will recite his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
which he writeth against the libertines in the 14 chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
of that worke, we do not deny (saieth he) but that all
thinges are done by the will of God. In so much that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we declare wherefor he is called omnipotent, we geue to
him an effectuall power in all his creatures, and we teach
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8568:80"/>
that as once he created the vniuersall world, so also that
he gouerneth the same. And that his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is alwaies at the
work, that he might kepe all thinges in their estate, and
dispose them after his will. And to the end that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

guided by the hand of God. And also when we se the cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
of earthlie thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, all thinges are to be ascribed to God.
The creatures are to be estemed but as instruments in his
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which he applieth to the work, euen as pleaseth him.
The scripture doeth often make mention of this vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
prouidence, that we may learn in all his workes to gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
glorie vnto God. But chiefly in vs doeth God comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
this his power, that we shall know it in our selues, to the
end that we may be purged of arrogancie, which sodanly
vseth to arise in vs, how son we forgett our selues to be in
his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. Hereunto apperteineth that, which Paul said to
those of Athenes: It is he in whom we liue, are moued, and
haue our being. By the which he wold admonish vs, that ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept
God vp hold vs by his hand that vnable it is for vs to

The second maner by the which God worketh in
his creatures is that he appointeth them in obedience of
his goodnes, iustice, and iudgement, somtymes to help
his seruantes somtymes to punishe the wicked, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

what so euer the Ethnicks and ignorant did attribute
to fortune, we assigne to the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God. Not onely
to that vniuersall operation, of the which we haue before
spoken: but to his especiall ordinance by the which he go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerneth
all, as he knoweth it to be most expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable:

the scripture most euidently declareth, for as it prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unceth
that God will whissill, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blow as it were the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet

betwext thework of God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thework of the wicked
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God vseth him in stede of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

the wicked affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mynd, and the mischeuous end
which he looketh vnto: and therefor iustly is it iudged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
but God altogither hath a contrarie respect: to witt,
that he may exercise his iustice, to the conseruation of the
good to vse his fauor and gentilnes towardes the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that he may punish such as haue deserued. Consi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
how we must make difference betwext God and man,
that vpon the one parte we shall behold his iustice, his
goodnes, and his iudgements: and vpon the other part we
shall consider in the self same work the malice and enuie
of the deuill and of the wicked. Let vs take a bright and
clear glasse in the which we may behold these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges. W<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen
the message of the losse of all his goodes came to Iob,<note place="margin">An exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the sodan death of his sonnes, and so manie calamities, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
all at once fell vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. He doeth acknowledge that
he was visited by God saing: The Lord gaue all these thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
and it is he that hath taken them away, and no doubt
so it was. But in the mean time, do we not know, that the
deuil procured all these thinges? and did not he vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
by narration of his seruants that escaped, that the chaldeis
had driuen away his bestiall and flockes? Did he comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
those brigandes and spoilers? or oght we to excuse the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?
becaus that all these calamities proceded from God.
Not so, for bothe we and he do, and did vnderstand that
there was a great difference betwext their purposes: And
therefor he (yet damning the euill) said the Name of the
Lord be blessed. The same may we say of Dauid: but at
this tyme it sufficeth, that God so worketh by his creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and so doeth vse them to his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
by the which he worketh, ceaseth not to be euill.
And albeit that he conuert the malice of the deuill and of
wicked men to good, yet they therefor are neither excusa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble,
neither yet clean from sinne: and their workes are
wicked, and to be damned. for all workes take their quali<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
of the purpose and the will of the author. Who so euer
maketh no distinction betwext these thinges, maketh an
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8568:82"/>
horrible confusion. And such be the libertines, who as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is said, do not onely ioyn the deuill, in societie with
God, but also, do transforme him in to God: iudgeing his
workes worthie of praise, vnder this coulor, that he doeth
nothing, but that which is appointed by God: But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

as they were directed to this or that end, so are they to be
iudged either good or euill: and yet God gouerneth
and doeth moderat all things, and guideth them also
to a right end. He turneth the euill into good: or at least
God working by the goodnes of his nature, draweth as
it were by violence som good, furth of that which in the
self is euill. So doeth he vse the deuil that he doeth not
mixe him self with him, neither to be in felowshipe
with him, neither yet with his wicked fact, neither that
his iustice shal put away the nature of the deuil. for as the
son sending furth his beames,<note place="margin">A similitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of the son.</note> and heat to the carion, and

that it remaineth stincking and corrupt: so doeth God so
work by the wicked, that the iustice, which is in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth

produceth no good frute. for our iudgement is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
our will rebellious, euer redie to euill: and finally
our hole nature is nothing elles but a lompe of sinne. And
therefor not onely can we not applie our selues to any

It is he therefor that worketh in vs both to wil and to per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forme:
he doeth illuminate vs, and lead vs to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

we must consider, that of nature, we haue both will, and ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction:
but because they are both depraued, by sinne, the

we therefor be apt to discerne, that we haue a will, that we
do this or that, this is a naturall gift: but that we can chou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se,
desyre, or do nothing but that which is euil, that cometh
of the corruption of sinne: that we thirst to do good, that

and newly born to a better and more godlie life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
then what God worketh in his children: first putting

by his holie spirit, in obedience of his wil. But these dron<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken
or rather furious libertines crying, that al things are
wroght by God, do make him author of euil. And further
euen as the nature of the euill were changed, when it is clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked
vnder the couerture of gods name, they affirme it to
be good. in the which they do greater iniurie, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tume
lie vnto God,<note place="margin">The liber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tines.</note> then that they should transfer his power and

assuredly the God of these men is an Idole, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
to be more execrable, then all the idoles of the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
And so furth to the end of that chapter he proueth that
God committeth no sinne in none of the wicked of the

who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before I haue alledged: Touching the workes which
we committ, the will of God is to be considered, as he
him self hath declared it: for in vaine hath he not giuen
his law, by the which he hath discerned good from euill.
As for exemple when he commandeth no man to be hurt,
no man to be iniuried, but that equitie and iustice be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
kept to all, that no man steal, defraude his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
that none committ adulterie, fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or filthynes,
but that euerie man kepe his own vessell in sanctification
and honor. Here is the will of God euident and plaine.
What further pleaseth him, in these cases oght no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
inquire. for we know, that if we do these, and other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, and do abstein from all things that
be forbidden,<note place="margin">Aboue that which we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded by God we oght not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre.</note> that then we obey the will of God. And if
we do not that, we can not be acceptable to him. If that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man shall steall, or committ adulterie, and shall say
that he hath done nothing against the will of God, he
lieth most impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. for in so far as he hath transgressed
the commandement of God, by the which he was taught
what was gods will, he hath done against his will. Let all
men now iudge, if that we giue occasion to man, to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him self in sinne, and to think, that when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
iniquitie against the expresse commandement of
God, that then they obey his holie will. If any demand,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8568:84"/>
whether that any thing can be done against gods will:
that is, if God may not, if he wold stay and impede the
sinne of man: before I haue answered by the mowth of
Augustine, and now again by Iohn Caluine that nothing
is, nor can be done, which he may not impede, if so it
please his wisdom, yea vtterlye we must eschew, that we
inquire not of his prouidence,<note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the question is of our duetie no man may be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue of gods secre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> which is hid frome vs,
when that the question is of our duetie. His word decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vnto vs what he approueth, and what he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
with that we oght to stand content, and by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
oght we to reule our liues, leauing the secretes to
God, as by Moises we are taught. To make the mater
more plaine, the case supposed, that I be tempted with
concupiscence, and lust a nother mans wife, in the which
I long striue, and in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fathan obiecteth to me this

And this one and other work of God is most iust,

               <p>Yet can it not be said, that those euill instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/>

his sede vnto Moloch to defyle my Sanctuarie and to pollute my

Moloch to defyle the lordes sanctuarie and to dishonor the Name

followed their condemnation. By these places and many others,
we may vnderstand the phrase of scriptures: That they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
to damnation whose end is condemnation, which they
receaue not by the will of God, which wold all men to be saued,
but as a iust reward for their sinnes. As the traitor which

And so because you conclude directly against the holie

But to giue an answer more full and large, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
the partes of your gradatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I will shew your er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the cause thereof. first you say: seing God suffered
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8568:90"/>
them with greate pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he is sorie for them. here I say
in your first foundation lieth your error, and the cause
thereof is, that altogether ye are ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of gods nature,
in whom nether falleth such sufferance,<note place="margin">Painfull passions fall not in God.</note> such pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor
such sorow, as you grosly imagin. God is omnipotent,
and is compelled to suffer nothing, which he hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in his eternall counsell, he is a Spirit, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fre from
all such passions, as creatures be subiect vnto. for in his
eternall Godhead, there is nether pacience subiect to
paine, nether yet sorowe annexed with angwishe and
grief. But when such passions be attributed vnto God,
it is for the weaknes of our vnderstanding, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Gost doth subiect him self in langage, and tongue to
our capacitie.</p>
               <p>Ye take libertie to your self in dyuers other phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to explaine them as you please, yea euen against the
plaine scripture. And why will ye not permitt, that such
phrases be so vnderstand, as nothing be iudged vpon
gods Maiestie, which doth not aggre, with his godlie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
ye do far abuse the mynd of the Apostle: for he
doth not inferre as you foolishly and wickedly do, that
becaus God did suffer with great pacience, therefor he
was sorie, but saieth, he did suffer the vesselles ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to destruction, that vpon the one sort his wrath and
power, and vpon the other (that is, vpon the elect) the
riches of his glorie might be knowen. This were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to put silence to your folie. But yet somwhat to
instruct the simple, I will som what trauale to make the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
wordes of the Apostle sensible and plane.</p>
               <p>He had before concluded: that God wold haue
mercie vpon whom he wold haue mercie, and whom it
pleased him, those did he harden. As this sentence far
surmounted mannes capacitie,<note place="margin">The place of Paul explaned.</note> so might it engender som
doubtes, in the heartes of the verey godlie. For they
might haue reasoned if that God will finally destroy all
the reprobate, to what purpose are they now permitted
to triumphe, and to trooble the elect of God? In answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8568:91"/>
to which doubt, the Apostle assigneth three reasons,
why God with great pacience,<note place="margin">Thre cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses why God suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the wicked re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>probate.</note> suffereth the vesselles of
wrath. To witt that his power, his wrath, and the riches
of the glorie of his mercie more euidently may appere &amp;
be knowen. For if God should sodanly from the bellies
of their mothers, take away the reprobat, or if he should
in the beginning of their malice so break downe their
pryde, that they could not procede against him, nether
should his power appere so great, nether yet his wrathe so
iust and so holie. But when he doth suffer them, as he did
Pharao, from one mischief to procede to an other, often
remouing his plagues, and so declaring him self easie to
be entreated, euen vnto such tyme, as their malice and
raige do carie them, as it were openly to dispyse God, and
his power, when then, I say, in one moment God potent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth ouer throwe the force &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of his ennemies,<note place="margin">Exod. 14 Isaiah. 37 Daniel. 5.</note>
as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did of Pharao, Senacherib, Balsasar, and of others.
then is his godlie power, and most iust wrathe more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
knowen, then that he should ether haue repressed
them in the beginning, ether yet haue taken them away,
before their malice began to budde. For hereby doth he
not onely admonish others of the certen destruction
of all those that continue in crueltie, but also giueth to
his Churche most singulare comfort, letting them se that
his prouidence, and power watcheth for them, euen when
the raige of the ennemie appereth to deuore al. And so do
they se what is gods mercie towardes them. Further whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the elect aduisedlye do consider what be gods seuere
iudgementes against the inobedient, and do consider how
prone and redie they them selues be of nature to rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
against God, except they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted by his spirit, they
com to a more liuelie feling of gods fre mercie &amp; grace:
by the which onely they are exempte frome the rank and
societie of the reprobate. Albeit that these endes &amp; causes
of gods long suffering, of the vesselles of wrath, do not
satisfie you, yet I doubt not but gods afflicted childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil,
and do take comfort of the same. you thus procede in

their blyndnes, yea and after their horrible falles and
offenses with great lenitie and gentlenes, to the end that
afterward they may repent, I do aggre with you. for
so he did with Dauid, Manasses, Paule, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

with the repetition of the same. The wordes of Ieremie w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
ye alledge, can haue no such sentence, as ye do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
for he doeth not speak of any passion, that was in
God, as touching his eternall Godhead: but onely doeth
appeall to the conscience of the people, how oft God had
not onely rebuked, but also from time to time corrected
them, euer calling them to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, and suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their

Let the first chapter of Isaiah be commentarie to this

is written in the 13.<note place="margin">The place of S. Luke in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes. 13. chap.</note> chapter of the Actes of the Apostles.
The light whereof is so clere, that you be neuer able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
the same. And therefor I will not spend much tyme
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation of your vanitie. for the simple trueth of the
historie shall disclose the same. Paule comming to Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in Pisidia did vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sabboth e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter in to the Sinagoge
of the Iewes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therein preached a sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most profound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
most effectuall, and most comfortable. In the which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8568:95"/>
by plaine scriptures he proued that the same Iesus which
was crucified at Ierusalem, was the Messias promised, and
the onely Sauior of the world. At which doctrine many
of the Iewes being offended, and yet som embrasing the
same, Paule the next Sabboth preached to the hole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Iewes and Gentiles assembled together: But w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen
plaine contradiction was made by the Iewes, who did
blaspheme Christ Iesus, Paule and Barnabas taking bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
said to the Iewes: first it behoued to speake to you the
word of God, but becaus ye reiect it, and iudge your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
vnworthie of the life euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, behold we are turned
vnto the Gentiles. for so hath the Lord commanded vs.
At which wordes the Gentiles reioysed, and glorified the
word of the Lord, and did beleue (saieth the text) so many
as were ordeined to the life euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. Who is be so blynd
that doeth not se, that in these wordes the holie Gost assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth
the plaine cause, why some do beleue, and others do
blaspheme, and remaine vnfaithfull? The cause why som
beleue is, becaus they are ordeined to the life euerlasting,
as they that are the shepe of Christ Iesus:<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> therefor they hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re,
and beleue his voice, the others as they are left in the
power of the deui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ll (as they that are neuer giuen to Christ,
to the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that they may receaue life) remaine in blyndnes,
and so by contradiction and blasphemies, declare them
selues, whose chilren and generation they are. None of
vs do, nor yet euer did deny, but that the elect of God do
willingly receaue and obey the trueth, and that the spirit
of God so worketh in their heartes, that not onely they
beleue, but that also they are made frutefull, yea and that
frome iustice, they procede to iustice. But as the hole prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of this we giue to God, arrogati<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g no part of it to our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
so we constantly affirme that nether faith, neither
workes, neither yet any qualitie that is, or that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw,
to be in vs, is the caus of our predestination or electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to life euerlasting, as before we haue sufficiently proued.</p>
               <p>Ye are so inconsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,<note place="margin">To the 2.</note> now granting predestination to
be the fre and mere gift of God, without any condition of
our workes: and immediatly after ascribing it to our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8568:96"/>
and walking in the way, that leadeth to life. In this
your inconstancie, say, I can not tell how to handle you
One thing I se, to my great comfort, that the glorie of
Christ Iesus, is so manifest, and the power of his trueth so
inuincible, that he will reigne, in the midest of his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The deuilles them selues must acknowledge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
confesse, that he is Lord, and the onely Son of the
liuing father: and the aduersaries of his trueth, euen when
they fight most outrageously against the same, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led,
to giue testimonie to it, as you do here in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye say, it foloweth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> because we must wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, that leadeth to life, that therefor, for walking
in the way of saluation, we are chosen (and as you write) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
But because (I say) that your inconstancie doeth
streight carie you to denial of this, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the les credit, that
this be a trew confession proceding from an vnfeined
heart: but rather that it is the mightie power of the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which (will ye nill ye) compelleth your mowthes, to
giue witnessing vpon her part, against your selues. God
grant I may be deceaued, in this my iudgement. for him I
take to record, that I am no otherwies ennemie to any of
you, then in so far, as ye declare your selues manifest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fre grace of God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the glorie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternal
So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eternal father of Christ Iesus our Lord a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d onely
Sauiour.<note place="margin">To the 3</note> Becaus there is nothing in this your last part, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I
haue not before at large declared in diuerse places, I wil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
note those thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges in the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we do not aggre with you.
First we vse not to call predestinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fre gift of God,
but we call it the eternall and immutable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of God,
in which he hath purposed to choose to lief euerlasting,
such as pleased his wisdom in Christ Iesus his Son.</p>
               <p>Secondly we say, that ye are neuer able to proue by
the parable of the talentes, that any reprobate was chosen
in Christ, to life euerlasting.</p>
               <p>Thirdly that we fynd neither contract neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
betwext the louing Father,<note place="margin">To the 4</note> and the prodigall son
in his admission to his former dignitie, neither do we so
vnderstand the parable, as that the said son newly recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

to mercie, wold after, of stubbornes, vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from his father. But rather we think, that as he had
felt what miserie he susteined, by folowing his own coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selles,
he wold in tymes comming with all diligence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the counselles of his father.</p>
               <p>Your mynd is dark to vs and your writing obscure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
where that ye say before we haue faith, or by hearing of
the worde, can haue faith, no spirituall commandement is
giuen vnto vs. and also the wordes of saint Paule, appere
not to be well applied: for there he entreateth no thing of
election, but onely affirmeth, that in the dispensation of
that ministerie committed to his charge, he knew him self
giltie in nothing &amp;c. but because these be of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
I onely put you in remembrance of them.</p>
               <p>Last your similitude betwext your Phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

and kepe it, at his pleasure, and so recouer healthe,
and preserue his life, orels reiect and break it, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

(say you) being our Phisition, offereth healthfull phisike
vnto vs all, and therewith prescribeth our diett, which if
we do not obserue, the phisike shall not auale vs &amp;c. This
similitude in one respect doeth altogither mislyke vs. For
it taketh from our soueraign Lord, his chief glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
for in no wies can we abyde, that his mightie power,
and operation, by his holie spirit, shalbe compared to the
power of any creature. We say not, we teach not, nor bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
not, that Christ Iesus doeth onely offer medicin, and
prescribe a diet, as a common Phisition, leauing the vsing
and obseruation of it, to our will and power. But we affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
that in the heartes of his elect, he worketh faith, he ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth
their eies, he cureth their leprosie, he remoueth, and
ouercometh their inobedience, yea by violence he pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> furth of the bondage of Sathan, and so sanctifieth
them by the power of his holie Spirit, that they abyde in
his veritie, according as he hath praied for them, and so

Nowe come I to the ordre of that Citie, in the
which this doctrine is taught, receiued, and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

and the seueritie of discipline executed therein, in
such sort, that no manifest offender, where so euer he
hathe comitted his offence, doeth there escaip punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Is not this it, that so doeth offend, not onely the

hypocrites, can not abide, that the sworde of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
shal strike the murtherer, the blasphemer, and
such others, as God by his worde commandeth to die.
not so by yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> iudgementes, he must liue, he may repent.
And those comon welthes, do ye highlie praise, where
men may liue as thei list, be subiect to no lawe nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,

thee of a malicious lie, in thus writing. for thou canst

against the libertie of Christes Euangil. The hatered
wilt thou and they say, which they did beare against
strangears. I answer, but no mostrangears were then
in Geneua then were before, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief captaines of
that faction were most earnest professors of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile
(in mouth I meane). And in verie dede, if they wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
haue labored, to haue expelled the strangears, they
had bene enemies to their owne comoditie. for by the
multitude of stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gears, their comon welth doth florish.
and none did receaue such benefite of stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gears, as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that required Christes doctrine to be ouerthrowen.</p>
               <p>They were papistes (thou wilt say) and therefore

But in few wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ds, I wil open the cause of their conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Thei were corrupt in manners, filthie of life, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerters
of iustice, and such finally, as by whome, the bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
worde of God, was sclandered and euil spoken by.
The preachers called for reformacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of manners. They
boldely and sharply rebuked, euen those that were in
highest auctoritie. One of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> band was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>municated,
and so did remaine mo yeres then one. The
consistoire called for iustice to be executed, and for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8568:101"/>
to be apointed. for the inobedient &amp; open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners.
But no thing coulde preuaile, the multitude of
the wicked was so great, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in votes and voices they did
preuaile. And so was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniquitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked mai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined
for a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ceason. Which bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g considered, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godlie aswel
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were natiue borne, as also the stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, consulted vpon
the next &amp; surest remedie, and that after that not onely
the moste parte of strangers were determined to depart,
but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> also, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faithfull seruant of Christ Iesus, had in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike
sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended his flock, with the weping eyes
of many to the protection, and prouidence of God, and
had publikely pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wolde be no minister in
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> church where vice coulde not be punished, according
to gods worde, where the wicked shoulde tryuphe and
make lawes at their pleasure. After this consultacion
it was concluded, that a resonable nombre of strangears
whose fidelitie &amp; honest conuersacion had long bene
tried and wel knowen, shoulde be made burgesses, and
free to haue voice in counsell, &amp; in making<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ciuil statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
which being vnderstand the wicked began more ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifestly

the Magistrates, they plainely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shoulde be free, they appeled to the greater counsel, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
being gathered, did iustifie the decree of the Sindiques
(so be the chief magistrates called). Shortly after did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hole vennom burst out: for after feasting, and banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of all sortes of villanes, was the conspiracie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and put in execution. for with one consent they
inuade vpon the night one of the chief Magistrates,
they cried victoire, and triumphe. but God sodanly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
that furie, so assisting with out the arme of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his seruant and lieutenant for that time appointed, in
that citie, that first he recouered the ensigne of his iust
and lawfull office againe, &amp; there after so put to flight,
that rebillious and great multitude, that some being
apprehended and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to prison, the rest were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
by the onely power of God. for that is a thing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8568:101"/>
euident and plaine, that the nombre of the one, did in
twentie degrees, surmount the other. This do I write, to
let the simple reader vnderstand, althogh thou be blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
what was the original of the trouble, which Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua
did after suffer. What did the strangears, I pray the
gaine by their libertie? as touching the worlde, I say
nothing, for no kynd of comoditie they lacked before
which after they did obteine, onely this excepted, that
in counsel, they shoulde haue voices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and place to spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
which thing also did onelie offend those oppressors
of iustice and mainteiners of iniquitie. for thereby
did they perceiue, that their interprises shoulde be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and that statutes shoulde be made, to reforme the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir

respect of person, vpon those that were apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
the rest who did escape to great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, were pronounced
rebelles. Then began skirmyshes vpon euerie side of
Geneua, victualles were commanded to be cut of, great
threatnings were blowen in the eares of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godlie, and
when these coulde not preuaile. then were deuised prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

               <p>I heare the accusation verey vehemently intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

none, but accusation followeth accusation. for still ye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
vs, that we are flatterers of sinners, that we take
wicked men by the hand, that we heale them with this
saing: there is none during this worlde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be knowen
to be in the election, be he neuer so vertuous, nor any
out of the election, be he neuer so vnrighteous. after
this maner (say you) do we heale them vp, so that they
nede not to endeuor them selues to bring furth the fru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
of liuelie faith.<note place="margin">answer to the 3. 4. 5. &amp; 6</note> These I say, be your accusations, the
probation whereof, ye delay so long, that after ye neuer
remember it. And so must your auctorite stand in force
bothe to accuse, and be admitted for witnes. But we
must except against you, for two causes most resona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
first because ye are our accusers, and our partie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.
Secondarely becaus ye are venemous liers,
persons defamed, and blasphemers of God. That ye are
vennemous and malicious liers, I haue in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before suffice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued, how ye falsifie, and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
the plaine Scriptures, how ye adde to our wordes, and

that ye inuent, and lay crymes to our charge, wihich ye
be neuer able to proue, as here in this place, ye shame
not to affirm, that we heale vp the sores of those that

haue had offenders in dede amongest vs, (I mean in the

vnworthie to abyde in the bodie, whose corruption
was able to infect the rest of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, If this ordre
I say, be so streitlie kept amongest vs that neuer sithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
the daies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, was it more vprightly kept in
any congregation. with what faces can ye say so that we
take wicked men by the hand? that we teach them, that
they nede not to bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g furthe the frute of a liuely faith?
ye alledge that Christ affirmed, that a good man from
the good treasure of his heart bringeth furth good
things. And so do we and do no lesse affirme, then ye
do, althogh in an other vnderstanding (as I before haue
declared) that we must obserue the commandement
of Christ, if we will be knowen to appertein to him. We
think it no assured nor certen signe of election, to be
ioyned with this, or that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation. We kuow that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
was once ioyned with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angelles, Iudas with Christ
Iesus, and many fals brethren, with the company of the
best reformed churches and chiefest Apostles. but wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der
it is, that ye burden vs with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, in this one case, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is your
plaine doctrine, which with toothe and nale ye defend.
Do ye not plainely write that no man is so elected in
Christ Iesus, but that he may fall &amp; vtterly become a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>probate?
and none is so reprobated, but by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance he
may be elected. The plaine contrarie whereof we teache.
and mainteine. O say you, ye mean of the signes, that
they are neuer certen. I answer that in verie dede som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
the elect, as touching mannes iudgement, is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
in estate with the reprobate. And againe that someti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes
the reprobate do beautifully shyne in the eyes of
men for a space, as exemples be euident. But yet I am su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re,
that you be neuer able to proue that we affirme, that
in this life, no difference may be knowen betwext the
two. The end of our doctrine, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to this but chiefly
to proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from election cometh faith, from a liuelie
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8568:104"/>
faith do good workes spring, in w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the elect continuing
and going forward, not onely make they their own elec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
sure, as. S. Peter doeth teache, but also giue a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of it to others, before whom their good workes
do shyne. And so by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie signes and effectes, we af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme
that the reprobate do manifest and vtter them
selues. And so I saie that wonder it is, that ye burthen vs
as that we shoulde affirme, that no man can be knowen
ether to be in the election, or out of the election, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this life. But more wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der it is that ye affirme vs to
adduce these wordes of S. Paul: The deuil doeth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
him selfe in to an angel of light, for probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
our purpose. for I, for my owne part do protest before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Lord Iesus, that I neuer did so vnderstand that place of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle, nether yet thinke I that any of you be able
to shewe, in any of our writings, those wordes adduced
for probation of that purpose.</p>
               <p>Trewe it is that I haue long vnderstand, and to this
houre do vnderstand, that by those wordes, wolde the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
admonish the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and all others that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
they should not receaue, and beleue euerie person,
&amp; doctrine that offereth it selfe, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloke of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
and of trueth: but that diligently we shoulde trie the
spirites from whence they are &amp; whether they come, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God, or not. for if the deuil the great angel of darkenes
enemie to mankind, and father to all fals prophetes,
can yet so transforme him self, that for a time his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and intent are not sene, but that vnder the cloke
of amitie and loue, he seketh o<hi rend="sup">r</hi> destruction as in temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
the woman, doeth plainly appere, how much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
can his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and soldiors, being deceitful workers
transforme them in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles of Christ, pretending
at the first entre, nothing but loue and iustice, nothing
but gods glorie, nothing but mortification of the flesh,
and such like, most beautiful pretences, although that
yet these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs be most farre frome their heartes. Thus
I say do I, and with me, I am assured who so euer depely

do wey the purpose of the Apostle, in that place, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and do not as ye falsly write, alledge it
to proue, that no man can be knowen to be ether in the
election, or out of the election during this life. It may
be, that we haue saied and writen, (as the trueth is) that
no man coulde haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the good workes of that
happie thief hanged with Christ, that he had bene gods
elect, before that in that anguissie, so insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly he began

and praie, that Christ wolde remembre him,<note place="margin">Luke 23</note> when
that he came in to his kingdome: And contrarie wise
that none coulde haue defined by the euil workes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>das,

Salomon affirmeth, that,<note place="margin">Pro. 17</note> he that iustifieth the wicked
and he that condemneth the innocent, are alike abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before God. Which sentence is not to be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
of iudges onelie, but is to be referred to euerie man: for
of euerie one doth God require, that he hate, and in his
heart and mouth condemne, that which God him self
hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned: and also that he allow, and iustifie, that
which God pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth iust, lawfull, and holie. And if
the contrarie be founde euen in a multitude, God doth
not onelie punishe the chief offenders, but also vpon
their fauorers, mainteiners, and iustifiers, doth he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
powre the same plagues and vengeance. And he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
is that rare,<note place="margin">Num. 16</note> and fearefull punishment taken vpon
Dathan and Abiram, sufficient proofe, for they ioyned
with Corah, were the authors of the conspiracie raised
against Moises and Aaron. But did they alone sustein
the ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance? No but their housholds, children, wyues,
tentes, and substance in the same conteined, did the

earth in a moment deuore, and swallow vp. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause
they did iustifie the cause of those wicked, and in
so far in as in them lay did maintein the same. No
man I trust will deny, but that he who killeth an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is a murtherer, althogh it be vnder the cloke of
iustice. But that he, who hauing lawfull auctoritie to
kill, and yet suffereth the murtherer to liue, is a murthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer,
in this perchance som men may doubt. But if the
law of God be diligently searched, this doubt shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
be resolued. For it will witnes, that no les oght the
murtherer, the blasphemer, and such other to suffer the
death, then that the meke and the fearer of God should
be defended. And also that such as maintein and defend
the one, are no les criminal before God, then those that
oppresse the others. One example I will adduce for all,

But God be praised, we nede not to depend vpon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certen

Apostle written in the 13. chapter of the second Epistle
to the Corinthians, is neither well marked, nor rightly
applied by you, neither yet will it suffer any suche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
as ye gather of it. The mynd of the Apostle is
this: After the departing of Paule from Corinthus, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
after many stormes susteined, he had established
the forme of a Churche, did enter in fals Prophetes,
whose chief studie was to eleuate the auctorite of Paule
and so to deface his hole labor, affirming that he was

not worthie to be called an Apostle. for he was neuer in

Paul had labored amongest them. Against which
vnthankfulnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Apostle very sharpley writeth, as in

his argumentes, which he vseth to proue that he was an

               <p>Paule doth not absolutely define that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,

wold confes, that Christ Iesus did remaine in them
by faith, which they had receaued by the preaching of
Paule, and so wold admitt him to be an Apostle: or to
grante, that they had nothing to do with Christ, and so
to confes them selues reprobates. Now let the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

alledged, do ye not know your selues that Christ Iesus
is in you? except that in som what ye be reprobates. And
albeit that the wordes were such, as ye recite, how can
you therof conclude, Dauid, and Adam were reprobates,

your argument som probabilitie. for onely of such, and

man did death enter in to the world. for Adam did not
onely lose him self, but also did with him self wrap all
his posteritie in sin, death and damnation, so that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
and all his sonnes were in him lost. But thereof it
doth not follow (as ye affirme) that therefor they were
out of the election, from the transgression vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes.
for as before we haue plainely proued, they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected

by the Euangelist S. Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn:</note> ye do shamefully abuse for in

But vnto Nichodemus he plainely declareth, that
the cause of life is faith, and the cause of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Which sentence no doubt proceded frome that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable

                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:8568:119"/>In this argument ye commit two fowle faultes.
The first, ye take that for a thing true, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, which
is fals. and therefore by vs alwaies denied. for thus ye
reason: man was elected before the worlde was created,
but man sinned aftre the world was created, Ergo man
fel from his election. we still denie the conclusion, and
do affirme, that as we were elected in Christ Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all times, so did the elect euer remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in Christ.
and therfore after that they had sinned, it behoued that
the promes shoulde be declared, that by the same the
elect might receaue comfort, and be assured of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>Your second fault, more declareth youre grosse
ignorance in the mysterie of our redemption. for from
election ye streight waies leap to glorificacion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
obseruing nether middes nor meanes, which
gods wisdome hath appointed, and determined to go
betwext Trew it is, God hath elected in Christ to
life euerlasting his chosen childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But how? Sainct Paul
yea the hole scriptures, wheresoeuer mention is made
of our election, ioyneth therewith the death and blood
of Christ. for none otherwies were we elected in him, but
that he shoulde sustein the punishement for our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
And that we shoulde receaue life, which we had
lost in Adam and in our selues, by the meanes of his
death and resurrection. therefore where ye reason, if the
elect did not fall oute of the Election, by Adams trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nede they no redemer, being alredie saued,
by reason of their election, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion is fals, and the
reason vaine. for the elect haue nede of a redemer,<note place="margin">Why the elect haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of a redemer</note> not
because that they did fal out of election but by reason

sicke, then might ye haue concluded, that they neded

in your argument vpon the wordes of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

in this lief co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually fele, how iustly ye may conclude,
that becaus they remained in gods election, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in his fauor by Christ, that therefor they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no redemer, let the indifferent reader iudge.</p>
               <p>If it seme stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to you, that God loued sinners in Christ
besides the places that are afore alledged for probation
of that part, heare what the veritie it self pronounceth:

(with greater feare and reuerence then alas you decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re)
euen such nede they haue of Christ as the bodie hath

the which, iust payment and satisfaction is made to
gods iustice, for their sinnes. And so are they reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

that such, as be sanctified, may after dishonor the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

and liuely faith, which is proper onelie to the
sonnes of God, which once begonne, is perpetuall, and
that sanctification, and faith, which is common to the

and perfect knowledge of gods mercies in Christ, that
proposition is most fals and doth repugne (as plainely
ye may se) to the mynde and wordes of the Apostle. for
he affirmeth, that we were elected in Christ Iesus, before
the fundation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world was laid, yea whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were dead
by sinne, ignorant of him, strangers from the testament
of his promes which S. Paule calleth to be without
Christ, without God in this world, &amp; without the league
of the testament. And by these wordes doth the Apostle
magnifie the superabounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mercies of God shewed to
the world in Christ Iesus. By the which he receaued not
onely the Iewes who long had continued in league with
God, but also the Gentiles to the participation of his

receaued from God such graces, as man in this life can
receaue no greater. It may seme that because ye delyte
to speak what ye please, ye take libertie to lay to our

               <p>I trust ye be neuer able to proue that any of vs, hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that he who had receaued of the fre gift of God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8568:123"/>
a true vnfeined and liuelie faith, is not the elect of God,
and that faith we knowe do gods children, which cum to
aige and discretion receaue in this life, as Peter did:
against the which, did Christ pronounce, that the gates
and portes of hell should not preuaile. But it appereth
to me that your doubt, is ether to witt, whether God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
his great and riche talentes vpon the reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.
for if so he should do, ye asffirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he bestoweth them
in vaine, meaning, to receaue no frute of them. That
God bestoweth great talentes vpon the verie reprobate,
the scriptures manifestly do witnes, to speake nothing
of lief, reason, corporall health, richesse, and honors,
which the reprobate in greatest abundance do possesse,
doth not Christ witnes; that many shall cry, Lord in thy
name we haue prophecied, we haue cast owt deuils,
and in thy name haue we done many wonderous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes?
And yet shall Christ answer I neuer knew you. Doth
not Paule affirme that albeit he knew all mysteries, had
all prophecie, and knowledge, and all faith (suche he
meaneth, as by the which miracles are wroght) yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
he had charitie he were nothing? But yet I pray
you, do prophecie, knowledge, the gift of to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues and of
miracles cease to be the good and riche tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of God?
ye crie yet are they bestowed without hope of frute to
be receaued, &amp; in vaine, if they be bestowed vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.
That of you is boldly and most blasphemous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirmed. for God knoweth the frute which his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
shall receaue, not onely of those spiritual talentes
how wicked that euer they be (to whose dispensation,
they are committed) but also of the corporall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
benefit, yea of very tyranny, doth his wisedom
and goodnes cause a frute and commoditie com, and
spring out to his Churche. By the tyranny of Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer,
he punished the proude contemners, and
tried, and partly purged his children, who before were
slothfull, and negligent. by that great conquest and
victorie, whiche he gaue to Cyrus, he procured the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8568:123"/>
of his people from bondage. By the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of victuales, giuen in the daies of Pharao, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Iacob and his children susteined. And think you
that with out frute and all togither in vaine, were these
and the like benefites bestowed? althogh that the most

to whose custodie, these tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted.
ye are to bolde thus to controle God. for his wisdome
will not in all thinges be subiect to your foolishnes.
The diuersitie of creatures here beneth in earth, may
teach you more sobrietie. How many cratures I pray
you appere to our iudgement to be supernuouse and

reprobate, who must nedes be apprehended with the

it therefore a good argument, that all those that teach
such maner of doctryne be fals teachers? or that no
such doctryne is conteined in the holie Scriptures? I
wil make the like reason: Nether Moises, nether Iohn

againe, and ascending into the heauen, shoulde send the
holie Gost visibly vpon his Apostles. nether Moises I
say nether yet Iohn, who were excellent teachers, haue
taught in expressed wordes any such doctrine, Ergo the
teachers of it be fals teachers, &amp; it is not written in gods

                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:8568:130"/>
If any aske the cause why are som so amiably, and
others so strangely intreated, I answer, no other cause
can be assigned, but that it pleased gods infinit wisdome
and goodnes to make that plaine, and euident differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
betwext those that once be receaued in his houshold
(be it by externall profession onely) and those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in blindenes, that the one he commonly doth
visit, but the other he doth as it were neglect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy.
for what other cause can we assigne, that God so
louingly did often call to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the people of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
so often offending from the daies of Moises vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
comming of Christ Iesus, that he sent vnto them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
to exhort, to rebuke, and to declare the estate of
things to come: and in this mean ceason, the space of
two thousand yeres, permitted the Gentiles to walke in
their own waies? And now after the reiection of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
what cause can we assigne, that among vs Gentiles,
God vseth to stirre vp, now one countrie, now an other
to receaue the trueth, to detest and abhorre our former

that he said,<note place="margin">Act. 15</note> to God are knowen all his workes, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the beginning, and that he will reuele his secretes

ether of his blasphemie, with any promes made to him,

by the Angel, that he shall come to destruction.</p>
               <p>But Ephesus, Smyrna, Theatira, and the rest of the
congregations, which before had professed Christ Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet were become not manifest ennemies, but were
falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> som in decay of life, some in corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and som in heresies, were exhorted to returne to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8568:130"/>
repent, and to be feruent, to continue, with sharp threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
if they did the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. And why this? because that
God before had planted among them his trueth, which
yet vtterly they had not refused, and therefore doth he
honor them as his domesticall seruantes, but in vaine
(say you) for if they be of the elect,<note place="margin">An ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nabapti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste</note> they cannot perish:
if they be of the reprobate sorte, they can not be saued.
This is of you vnreuerently reasoned, wil ye not suffer
God to order his houshold, as best pleaseth his wisdom?
This order hath he appointed that the trompet of his
worde to exhort, to rebuke, to encourage, to offer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to the penitent, and to threaten death, to such as do
declyne, shall clerely sound in his Church, so long as
he doth acknowledge it to be his. Not that by the word
preached, he that was reprobate in gods eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
may be the elect, and so changed: but that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
preached, and often repeted, maketh a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twext
the elect, and the reprobate, euen before man.</p>
               <p>Albeit to you it appere superfluous, that God
shall fede his children by his own word, which because
the reprobate do refuse, therefore do they beare a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of their own iust condemnation in their owne
conscience. Albeit I say, this appeare superfluous, yet
God hath commanded and established the same, as
a thing most necessarie and expedient, for the establi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shing
of his children, and for the manifestation of his
owne glorie.</p>
               <p>I wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der that ye wil not affirme that superfluous it is

aswel as the other. But herein, I saie, appereth your
foolish blyndnes. first that ye make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twext
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8568:131"/>
the houshold seruantes, &amp; those that be without.
and secondarely, that ye vnderstand not the vse, the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit,
and the effect of gods word preached. Is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heauen compared to a nett casten into the sea
gathering together all sortes of fishes? whereof albeit
that the seperation can not perfectly be made, till the
nett be drawen to the drie la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the last day: yet dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the worde by exhortacion, by rebuking &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
do many things com to light, which before lay
hid. how many do followe Christ, for a time, and fall
back from him, albeit, that to the end he cryeth, that
they shoulde continue. S. Paul affirmeth that he did
write his sharpe epistle to the Corinthians for a trial of
them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> if they wolde in all things be obedient. if they
as true shepe wolde heare the voice of their true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
acknowledge, &amp; follow it, which he witnesseth that
they did.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.</note> And there for he saith, now do I reioyce, not
that ye did sorow, but that ye did sorowe to repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
By the which was not onely the Apostle comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as he him self doth confes, but also were they new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed, that the Spirit of God, was not vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
before.<note place="margin">The elect haue gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at profit by the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aching of gods worde. How the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries abu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se Gods word in making fals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny places thereof</note> And so albeit, ye can se no frute
nor necessitie of gods worde preached, except that
the nature of the reprobate be changed, yet do gods
children fele in experience, how comfortable it is to
haue their dull spirites stirred vp by frequent exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions:
yea how necessarie it is, that their dulnes
and vnthankfulnes be sharply rebuked.</p>
               <p>The third thing, in which I perceaue you hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
to erre in all this youre long discourse of the
seuen Churches, is that where so euer there is precept
or commandement giuen to repent, and to continue
in faith, or to liue a godlie life, or where so euer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made, that space and time is granted to repent,
there streight waies ye conclude, then may men kepe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8568:131"/>
the commandementes: then may they repent, and so
be saued, althogh before they were reprobate. For
this ye affirme of Iesabel, she might (say you) haue
repented, and haue bene saued, and likwise vnto
them that committed fornication with her, is repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
granted. But how vaine is this conclusion,
God commandeth that which is righteous, Ergo man
may do all that is commanded. God giueth place of
repentance to all men, Ergo all men do, or may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
How vaine I say be these conclusions, such
as be not infected with the pestilent opinion of their
own power, fre will, and iustice, may easely es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.
when ye haue proued that God commandeth
nothing, which man may not do by his own power
fre, will, and strength, and that repentance so procedeth
from, man that in him self, it lieth ether to repent,
or not to repent, then may ye sing this song, which so
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t ye repete: God commandeth, God giueth space
of repentance, God offereth mercie to all, Ergo
of their own power, they may repent. But and if we be
not sufficient of our own selues to think one good
thoght, if repentance be the fre gift of God, and if to
receaue mercie procedeth of his own fre gift also, then
harp so long as ye list vpon that one string, I will answer
that except ye make it better aggre with gods scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
I must nedes say, that he is worthie to be moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
that continually harpeth vpon a discording string.<note place="margin">

               <p>As we do not contemne your exhortacion, if
we coulde be persuaded, that it did procede from the
spirit of lenitie, so can we not acknowledge our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

we teache a careles, and libertine life, nether that
we giue occasion of sinne to the people. finally that
we can not confes that we teache, and mainteine idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trie

bene men infected with all crimes, which ye lay to our

repugnant to equitie and charitie, that the treason of

If I list to take my pleasure in examining your
liues, and applying the offences of those churches to
your faction, I doubt not to bring better testimonie

               <p>Your proposition is that albeit the election is sure

there none so elected in him to lief euerlasting, but that
he may fall to perdition, and becom a reprobate. And
for the probation hereof before ye enter to your exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

reason. To the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I shortly &amp; plainely answere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
ye suppose an impossibilitie to be possible, therefor

because there is no membre of your reason which hath

it may be spoken, man is assured of his election by the

the election by the promes, is not the phrase of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Gost: further of this we shal examine in your secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
reason which is this,</p>
               <p>Election hath no promes without faith: trew faith is gods worke by his
grace,<note place="margin">To the 2 &amp; 3.</note> and is also mannes worke partely by consenting thereto: wherefor

be inconstant in his faith, then is he out of the promes whereby he was
made sure of his election, yet Gods election remaineth sure and stable in
Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>The first membre of your reason is darcke, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
and the manner of speaking so strange, that in the
scriptures I am assured it is neuer to be founde. In one
of two senses is election taken in the scriptures.<note place="margin">Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note> The
former:<note place="margin">Election is in one of two sortes ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures.</note> for the elect them selues, as when Paul saieth
the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did obteine it, that is, the elect of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
mercie. And in the same sense is Paule called
the vessell of election, that is, an elect vessel: and if in
this sense ye affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is to say the elect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
no promes without faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> albeit I wil not greatly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tend
in that behalf, yet by manifest scriptures I may
proue the contrarie. for the posteritie of Abraham by
gods fre election had this promes, that he shoulde be
their God. And sainct Paul affirmeth that the children
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8568:135"/>
of the faithfull were holie and yet all coulde not haue
faith when the promes was made, for then had Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
no sede at all, but of this I say I will not contend. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwies
election is taken in the scriptures, for the
eternall counsell of God, by the which he hath appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted
life euerlasting, to such as he hath giuen to his
Sonne before all worldes,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. &amp; 11</note> as Paul saith: For yer
the children were borne, when they had neither donne
good nether bad, that the purpose of God, which is by
his election, that is not by workes but by him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
might stand sure, it was said vnto her the elder shal
serue the yonger, &amp;c. And after, euen so at this time is
there a remnant left through the election of grace and
so furth in diuers other places. and in this sense, if ye
vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that election hath no promes without faith
I answere, that gods free election in Christ Iesu nedeth
nether promes nor faith, as touching the parte of God.

his own good pleasure in Christ his sonne, &amp; so I wold

               <p>It is a thing most certen that albeit Adam and all

can not the elect of God who be elected to life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in Christ Iesus, so fall from their election that
finally they perishe. the reason is, that as Christ Iesus,
the brightnes of the glorie of his father, &amp; the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
image of his substance, is greater then euer was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
so is his power of greater vertue to saue the elect
then Adams impotencie was to bring damnation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all.</p>
               <p>Where ye ask if our election be surer now after the
transgression then afore the transgression. I answere the
assurance and firmitie of our election was alwaies, and
at all times one. For when we stode in Adam (as ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
yet were we elected in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when we fel in

               <p>Ye be neuer able to proue that Cain was elected

offered in faith and the other without faith. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,
I pray you, your former reason: there is none (say

euen before he did kil or hate his brother, therefor by
your owne reason, he was not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> election, no not euen
before he hated. I do not approue this argument: but
yet your former reason standing true, it is inuincible.
Moises saieth not that God promised dominion to

Cain ouer his lustes,<note place="margin">The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Moi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning</note> but saieth, vnto thee shal his appeti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes

which is not spoken of sinne, but of Abel, who as he
was the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, so was he appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be subiect to Cain,<note place="margin">Cain.</note>
and to serue him, and therefor most vniustly did he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
him. It is the same phrase that before was spoken
of the woman concerning her subiection to man. Such
as haue but mean knowledge in the hebrew text, know
well that bothe these articles be of the masculin gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,
&amp; the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue which signifieth sinne in that place,
is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feminin ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre &amp; therefor wil not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> proprietie of

sinne. where blasphemously ye aske if god gaue Cain no
power to subdue his lust, who was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of his sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne?
I answer Cain him self: for he was not lyke to a dead
and vnsensible sworde, as ye adduce the similitude, but
he was a reasonable instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t infected by the venom of
Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from the whiche he not being purged could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but serue the deuil and his owne lustes, against
gods expressed will and commandement. I haue before,
proued taht God is the cause of no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s damnation but
sinne in which they are fallen, is the very cause which
all reprobates do find in them selues.</p>
               <p>Touching the fidelitie of God who suffereth none of
his to be tempted aboue their strength,<note place="margin">To the 7</note> it is onely true
of Gods elect,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10</note> to whom it is plaine that Paul there spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth.
for albeit that amonges the Corinthians there
were many reprobates, yet doth Paul addresse his style
as it were to the elect Church of God, calling them his
beloued, willing them to flie from idolatrie, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to them, as vnto men indued with wisdome &amp;c.
And therefore must ye first proue, that Cain had as
great testimonie of God that he was his elect, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rinthians
had of Paule y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were beloued and elected
in Christ, before that ye can make this place to serue
for him. for albeit he did aduertise him what was his
duetie to do, yet doth it not thereof follow, that he gaue
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:8568:137"/>
him power to obey his will reueled, nether yet pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to resist all tentation. To Pharao he did no les make
manifest his will then that he did to Cain, and yet of
him he did before pronounce that he should not heare
nor obey the voice of Moises, I do not denie but that he
stubbornly foresooke the counsell of God, whiche mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
called him. But why did he, and do all reprobate
forsaik it, we haue oft before declared, to witt: because
the sede of God abideth not in them.</p>
               <p>What was the benediction giuen after the floode vnto

of all thinges, as touching the order of nature, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
as they were before that vastation, (by reason of the
waters which had so long continued). In that place is no
mention made of election to life euerlasting in Christ
Iesus, and therefor your connexion, that Ham was not
reprobat, when he was blessed of God, is foolishe. for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that none can be both blessed and cursed, loued and
hated all at once, in that degre of loue or of hatered w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
God frely beareth in Christ to his elect, and most iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlie
hateth the reprobate, for the causes knowen to his
visdom, yet in an other sort, it is no repugnancie to say
that God both blesseth, and loueth in bestowing tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
benedictions, vpon such as in his eternall counsell
he hath reiected, and therefor hateth. As it is no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancie
to say that God bothe blesseth and loueth his

and punishe them.</p>

answers may suffice, for you be neuer able to proue, that
any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was chosen to lief euerlasting did fall
into death eternall. It nothing hurt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> saluation of Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:8568:137"/>
were all externally called and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place to such as willingly list not blynd them selues.
For he exhorteth the Corinthians not to think it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that they did commuicat with the sacramentes of

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to gods will reueled should be ioyned with the same:
for otherwise the same should happen vnto them, that
happened to the Israelites. And therefor he saieth let

contrarie to our doctryne nether yet is our doctrine in

               </p>
               <p>The fall of the reprobate we remit to gods iudgement
Albeit that Balaam had bene indued with greater gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
then in scriptures, we read that he had, yet doth it
not thereof follow, that he had receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
by true faith, which is giuen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elect one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
for we fynd the power giuen to some to expell deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
whom Christ affirmeth, that he neuer knew. And
therefor willeth he his disciples, not to reioyse in that
that spirites were subiect vnto them, but that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
were written in the booke of lief. But yet I wonder
where ye haue found that Balaam was so filled with
the spirit of God, the spirit of trueth, the spirit
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:8568:138"/>
of power and the spirit of grace (as ye write) that whom)
soeuer he blessed, was blessed, and whom he cursed, he
was cursed. I fynd no such thing witnessed of him by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
holie Gost. Trew it is that Balack gaue vnto him that
praise and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation that he was assured, that who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
blessed should be happie, &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cursed should be cur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
But whether that it was the purpose of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holie Gost
to teach and assure vs therby that in very dede such
graces were in him,<note place="margin">Nom. 23</note> I greatly doubt. yea I doubt nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
to affirm the contrarie, to witt that he nether had power
spirit, nor grace of God to blesse those whom God hath
curssed, nerher yet to curse those whom God hath bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
for so doth he him self confes. And for that end is
the historie written. If ye vnderstand that the benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
remained vpon Iacob becaus that Balaam did so
pronounce and speak, you are more blynd then Balaam
was. for he assigneth an nother cause, saying, how shall
I cursse where God hath not cursed, or how shall I detest
where the Lord hath not detested. God is not as man
that he shoulde lie, nether as the sonne of man, that
he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do
it? and hathe he spoken, and shall he not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish it?
Behold, I haue receaued commandement to blesse: for
hehath blessed, and I can not alter it. He seeth none
iniquitie in Iacob, nor seeth no transgression in Israel:
the Lord his God, is with him, and the ioyfull showte of
a king is amongest them.</p>
               <p>In these wordes,<note place="margin">why Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laam blessed Israel &amp; could not curs them.</note> I say, Balaam assigneth the cause why
he was compelled to blesse Israel, because, saith he, God
hath blessed them. And why also he could not change
his blessing, because in God there is no mutabilitie, nor
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, like as there is in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therefor as hehad on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
blessed that people, by his plaine word and promes
spoken, and reueled to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so shoulde he most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
perfourme it. If malice did not blynd you, you
should clerely se, that the holie Gost meaneth nothing
les then to teach that Balam was blessed of God, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:8568:138"/>
therefor was not at that tyme a reprobate: But that Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
was so elected, sosanctified, and blessed of God, that
their very ennemis, and suche as were hyred to curse
them, were compelled to giue testimonie against them
selues, that gods people was blessed. But this doeth no
more make Balaam to be gods elect, then did that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
which the wicked spirites gaue to Christ, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
him to be the Sonne of the liuing God) change
their nature.</p>
               <p>If you be able to proue that hole Israel so fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gods
fauor, that to none of Abrahams posteritie did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourm
the promes made to him, and to his sede, then
haue ye proued somwhat of your purpose, to witt, that
God may make a promes, &amp; that with an oth, &amp; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourm
no part of it. But if it be manifest that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their grudging, their rebellion, their carnall
lustes, their idolatrie, and abominations, gods promes
remained so sure, that the same was perfourmed (after
many te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations) in full perfection: Consider what may
be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded against you, in applying examples by simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
&amp; equalitie. I wold wish in you greater wisdom,
then to compare Balaam one particulare person, a fals
prophete accursed of God, and so perishing amongest
the vngodlie, and hole israell gods elect and chosen
people, so blessed of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not onely they were preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in all stormes,<note place="margin">To the 17 &amp; 18.</note> but also of them, according to the
flesh, came that blessed sede, the messias promised.</p>
               <p>To Saul and to his kingdom I haue before answered,
to witt, that one thing it is to be appointed to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
office, and an other to be elected in Christ Iesus to
lief euerlasting. But yet I will adde somwhat more,
which is this Propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

counsel to be kings and Reulars ouer Israel for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
If ye cry, then did the holie Gost, speaking in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
lie. for he affirmed, that God had prepared
the reigne and kingdom of Saul vpon Israel for euer,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:8568:139"/>
I answer Samuel speaketh not in that place, what God
had determined in his eternall counsel,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13</note> but what he
him self thoght that God had determined and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And therefore ye may not conclude that the holie
Gost doth lie, except the kingdom of Saul was once
appointed to haue remained ouer Israel for euer. Nay,
so can ye not conclude. But ye may say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> except that so
it was, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet was deceaued. And so no doubt he was
for a ceason, and did speake those wordes according to
the apprehension &amp; iudgement which he had conceaued
by reason of his vnction and lawfull election to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
If it appere hard to you, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophetes be decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in any thing, consider I praie you what chanced
vnto him after. did he not at the sight of Eliab prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce

was his anointed? did the holie Gost lie because that
Eliab was refused, and Dauid chosen, or was not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Samuel ignorant and in an error? the same might
I proue by Nathan, &amp; others, who being gods true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
were yet for a ceason left in error &amp; did both
speak and giue counsel otherwies than God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in his eternal counsel. But now shortlie to
proue my proposition, I say, that gods eternall purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
and counsel concerning the chief rewler and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor
ouer Israel was long before pronounced, by Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
in his last testament,<note place="margin">Gen. 49</note> who did appoint the crown,
and Sceptre royall to an other tribe then to Beniamin.
for thus he saieth, Thou Iudah thy bretheren shall prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

is plaine that many yeres before the election of Saul

him iust causes why Saul was vnworthie of that great

any tribe in Israel, then that he ment of Peter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was

of the hole nomber of the twelue, nether yet of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.
for as for Iudas, I doubte not to affirme, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as it was written in the book of Psalmes, That his

that yet in gods eternall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that none wil be so peruerse of iudgement, as to denie,
that none other was appointed to be the salt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth,

that Christ called the humiliation of the rich man, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible

and corrected by the seuere obiurgation of
their master, and in the end, by the power of the holie

how impossible it is that they be changed, none
can be ignorant, except such as haue not sene or do not

conclude, that no more could the citezeins of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

               <p>And thus I say that those thinges, which the holie

And therefor it is not onely ahard and a difficile thing

propared vnto them before all beginning, and that the

such as shall denie any of them to haue bene gods wil,
can not escape abnegation of his eternall veritie. And
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:8568:147"/>
further we say that the fall of man, is plainely reueled

the transgression whereof made Adam and all his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

which you think inuincible: we say, that that wil
which was secret in God before all time, was reueled to

That I should bring forth to light before all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what is
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the mysterie w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was hid from all ages in
God, who hath made all things by Christ Iesus, that the
manifest wisdome of God may nowe be notified to prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipates,
and powers in heauenlie things by the Church,
according to the fore appointment of the ages which
he hath made in Christ Iesus our lorde. so that we are
now bold to say, that albeit no creature did knowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all time what ordre God should kepe in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and disposition of all thinges in time: yet may we
nowe I say be bolde to affirme that the secrete was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
in the eternall connsell of God. That first he wold
create the heauen the earth, the masse being rude, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
darknes vpon the great depthe, thereafter that he
wold make light putting diuision betwene the light &amp;
the darknes, and so forth as Moises hath declared the
ordre obserued in the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as those things we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
somtime secret, but now are manifest, reueled and
knowen so likewies was the falle of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
which commeth by Christ Iesus somtime secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
in the eternall counsell of God, but nowe is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
preached and declared by Christ Iesus, and by
his holie Apostles. for nowe we know that God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the world, that his onelie beloued Sonne hath he
giuen, that so many as do beleue in him, shall haue the
life euerlasting. Which life was euen before all times
in Christ Iesus, euen as we were elected in him before
the foundations of the world were laid. And therefor I
doubt not to affirme, but that the fall of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, was not onelie forsene but also befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

before that euer Adam was created. the reason and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8568:148"/>
hereof we haue before declared to be the issue
of all things, as we are taugh by gods manifest word, yea
by most euident experience. for who nedeth nowe to
doubt, that it was gods eternall counsell, that man
should fall from that perfecte image in which he was
created and so become subiect to the death, to the end
that the faithfull might receaue perfection, iustice and
life in Christ Iesus alone, seing that scripture so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
affirmeth that we were elected in Christ Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundations of the worlde were laid that God
hath wrapped all nations in disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that he might
haue mercie vpon all,<note place="margin">Rom. 11</note> vpon all I say which refuse not
the remedie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all begining prepared, which is Christe
Iesus, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle witnesseth, saying: in him &amp; by him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
things created, &amp; he is before al things,<note place="margin">Colo. 1.</note> &amp; al things
consist or abide by him, and he is the head of the bodie
of the Churche, who is the beginning, the first begotten
of the dead, that in all things he may hold the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
for it hath pleased the father that all fulnes should
dwell in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to reconcile, by him al things to him
self. This counsell I say was not temporal, as taken and
deuised after the fall of man, but it was eternall, as the
same Apostle witnesseth in these words:<note place="margin">Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Iesus Christ. But mark well that the Apostle saieth that

of Iesus Christ according to the faith of gods electe,
and the knowledge of the veritie, which is according
to godlines in the hope of eternall life, which he hath
promised, which is God that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not lie, before the world

through preaching &amp;c. And the same saieth Peter spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of our redemption by Christes pretious blood,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.</note>
who certeinly was preordinate, sayeth he, before that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
world was made, but was manifested in the last times.
Hauing these I say most euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t scriptures to assure our
conscience that redemption, remission of our sinnes,
grace, and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation, were appointed for vs, yea and
were giuen vnto vs before all times, what nede we to
doubt, what was the counsell of God in mans creation,
or what was his secret will in giuing to him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement
of not eating the frute, and therefor you do
not onely folishly, but also iniuriously in thus raling
vpon vs, <hi>what strange and monsterous doctrine is this? to say things
be secrete, and vnsecret, knowen, and vnknowene, reueled and vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as man should say hearing? is not hearing and light is not light.</hi>
No such absurditie ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustly be gathered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,
for simply we say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs somtimes kepte secrete in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counsell of God, and vnknowen to the sonnes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
were after disclosed. and made manifest to the world, in
so much, that light expelled darcknes from the heartes
of the sonnes of light, and knowledge remoued igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from those, that were appointed to life. If these
things do not satisfie you, yet my good hope is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
godlie reader shall perceaue, that most vniustly you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
vs, as if in our doctrine were plaine contradiction.
And yet as touching the secrete will of God we moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
affirme, that our eternal election, in Christ Iesus,
our temporall falling in Adam, our restitution to life,
by the promes made, are not secret, but manifestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled.
But why that so it pleased his infinite wisdome,
and goodnes to dispose, and before ordeine the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of our saluation: that first we should beare the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of the earthlie and carnall Adam, before that we
should beare the image of the heauenlie and spirituall:
that first we shuld be all wrapped in sinne, and by reason
thereof in miserie &amp; death, before that we should be
perfecte iust, and come to felicitie, and life euerlasting,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:8568:149"/>
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d finally why y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it pleased his Maiestie to choose some:
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of this same masse to reiecte others, we say is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled,
neither yet shalbe reueled before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ Iesus
appere in his glorie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bookes shalbe opened and
all secretes shalbe disclosed. To speake the mater so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
as I can, that ye haue no occasion to complein of
obscuritie, I say that gods will in these subseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and
in many others his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous workes is secret. first why
did not God more, sode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly creat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world? why gaue he to
Adam no greater strenght? why did he permitt him to
falle? why he did not prouide mannes redemption by
some other meanes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the cruell and ignominious
death of his owne sonne? why did he choose the sede
of Abraham to be his people, refusing and reiecting as
it were the rest of the world? And finally why that God
wold that his dear sonne should die in Ierusalem, called
his owne Citie, by reason of the temple and sacrifices
appointed? why (I say) that God by the figures of the
law, and by his Prophetes had before spoken, that the
Messias should suffer in that citie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the builders,
who then onely in earthe were reputed &amp; knowen to be
the Church of God, should reiect and refuse the chief
corner stone Christ Iesus? In these and others the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
workes of God (which so far excede the reach of
our vnderstanding,<note place="margin">To the 6. 7. 8.</note> that more able they are to quenche
and swallow vp all light which remaineth in vs, then is
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great depth of the sea to deuoure our frayle bodies)
do we hold the secrete will of God for a ruele of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
perfection and sufficiencie, teaching and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that if any man of vaine curiositie or of deuelish
pride, presume to define or determine vpon these or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
his inscrutable secretes, the causes whereof (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then his secret, but most iust will) is not, neither
shalbe reueled, till the full glory of the sonnes of God
be manyfested, when the wisdome, goodnes, iustice and
mercie of God shall so euidently appere to the full con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentation
of his electe, &amp; to the most iust conuicting
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8568:150"/>
of the conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the very reprobate, to whome shall
be left no place of excuse, but in their owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they shall receaue the iust sentence of their most
iust condemnation. and so shall they in tormentes
glorifie the most iust &amp; most seuere iudgement of
God, and his vnspeakable hatered against sinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued.
We teach and affirme (I say) that if any man
in this life trauale to searche out other causes of these
foresaid works of God (then his secrete will) that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
man hedlongs casteth him selfe in to horrible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which he can not eskape without spedie repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
And against such men are al the scriptures by you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,

affirme nothing which gods worde doeth not plainely

chaseth away the darck cloudes, that the children of

blasphemously spoken,<note place="margin">To the 3. 4. 5.</note> not against vs but against gods
eternall wisdome. against vs (I say) ye cannot speak

cannot be subiect to the vanitie of your reason. But yet
because no small part of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie betwext you &amp;

assigne, or vnderstand any other reason, or cause,
but his holie will onelie: and therefore with all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
do they stoupe, and couering their eyes, crie iust
and righteous art thou oh, Lord in all thy workes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
holie, holie Lord God of armies. The vniuersall

Because I say a great part of our controuersie standeth
in this point, I wil go through your questions, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally
answer to euerie one. first you aske if God haue
two willes by reason that he hath a secret will and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8568:152"/>
wil. I answere, that as God in his eternal God head
is simple and one, so is his will in respecte of him selfe
from all beginning simple and one, which is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his owne glorie. But because the instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
(in which gods glorie is and must be for euer mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
and knowen) be diuers, therefor hath gods will w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
in him selfe is one, diuers considerations, effectes, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
in respect of the diuers instrumentes. for example
God will the vessels of his mercies to be extolled to the
glorie of the kingdome with Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">Mat. 25</note> but he will
the vesselles of wrath to be adiudged to the fire inquen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chable
prepared for the deuill &amp; all his Angelles. Who
doth not see, but in respecte of these diuers instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
the will of God hath diuers respectes, and diuers endes,
and iustly may be called two willes or a dooble will? for
it is one will to saue, and an other will to condemne, as
touching the instrumentes &amp; creatures saued or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
But in respecte of God the wil is one and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which is as before is said the manifestation of his
glorie, which no lesse shyneth in the iust punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
the one sort, then in the mercifull deliuerance of the
other. And this much for the first. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly ye ask, if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is not reueled be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is reueled. To the
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I answere as before, that in respecte of God there is
no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie betwext y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will reueled and the will vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled.
But yet may the creatures to whome God, doeth
notifie his will by commandement, rebuke or exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
apprehend &amp; vnderstand one thing, and yet it
may be that God in his eternall counsell hath determi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
the expresse contrarie. if this to you at the first
sight seme strange, yet my good hope is that examples
in the scriptures proposed shall make the mater sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ynough to the godlie and sobre reader.<note place="margin">To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

sonne of death, that God wold break the league and
couenant with him, as he had done to Saule his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicessor.
But was it therfor the eternall purpose of God
that so it should be? The end and issue declareth the
contrarie. Ezechias receaued the very sentence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
death from the mouthe of the Prophet Isaiah, who
no doute came not with message at all aduenture, but at
the expresse commandement of God, for so he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
sayinge: Thus saieth the lord put ordre to thy
house for thou shalt die and shalt not liue.<note place="margin">Isa. 38.</note> But was not
therefor the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie (to witt that he should afterward li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue

&amp;commandementes, but with one I wil sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
contented, which shall adde light to the former. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
was commanded by God, to take his sonne Isaak
whome he loued, his onelie sonne, in whome the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

               <p>Answere. Impossible we confesse it to be that
contrarietie should be in that will, which in it self
is simple and one. But how shall you be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
that God in reueling his will to Adam, had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

membre aparte. God abhorreth (say you) a dooble heart
which speaketh one thing and thinketh an other, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
That as God is a spirit and hath neither heart nor
bodie like as man hath, so must not his words, cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and thoghtes be compared to ours: for as we
be corrupte liers and vaine, so where we do speak one
thing, and think an other, we do meane deceate, fraud,
and destruction to our brother, to whome we promise
trueth, fidelitie, &amp; conseruation to our power. But God
according to the puritie and perfection of his godlie
nature in speaking to his creatures, and in creating of
them must not absolutely haue respect to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also
to his owne glory. for what reason is it that God of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
shall make that c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eature by whome his glory shall
not be manyfested? and therefor in speaking to Adam,
and in giuing a lawe to him, God had respecte to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
counsell &amp; purpose, as before we haue spoken,
and hereafter shall rehears. But still crye you, that yet we
burden God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abyde in his creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
that is, that he should speak one thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, as that Adam
should not haue fallen, and that he ment the contrarie.
for answer I ask of you, if ye will binde God to that lawe
which he hath imposed to his creatures? And if ye will
leaue none other libertie to God his soueraigne maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
then his lawe hath permitted to men subiecte to
the same: and if ye dare promise to your selues that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

things more repugnant to your reason then this. You
think I mock you in that I wil you to cite and call God
to an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, in very dede I do. for as your blasphemie
&amp; pride is vtterlie to be abhorred, so is your vanitie
more worthie to be mocked, then your simplicitie in
that case to be instructed. for what was he euer yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
the most ignorant ethnicks so foolishe or so
presumpteous, but that he did confesse that the workes
and wonders of the supreme God, were exempted from
all lawe, and censure of mans iudgement. But in your
presence, God shall haue no libertie to command, or
forbid any thing to any of his creatures, but that he
must nedes absolutely will the same, and for no cause or
respecte may he will the contrarie, but that he shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
a dooble heart, he shalbe a disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bler (cursed be your
blasphemie that causeth me thus to write) and in him
there shalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie. this is the reuerence which ye
beare to gods infinite wisdome in all his workes, to the
ground whereof ye can not atteine by your corrupt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that you burst forth in scoffing, mocking, and blas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemie.
But yet to come more nye to the mater, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that iustly you can conclude any contrarietie to be
in God, albeit that to Adam he said thou shall not eate,
and yet in his eternall counsell he had determined
that Adam shoulde eate, neither yet (I say) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to proue, that he spoke one thing &amp; willed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
because he pronounced this sentence: in what so
euer day thow shalt eate of this tree, thou shalt dye the
death, but rather we maye most assuredly conclude, that
both the precept, &amp; the penaltie threatned to ensue the
violation of it, was a plaine and manifest declaration w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat
before was concluded in gods eternall counsell, as
also that they were the meanes, by the which the secret
will and good purpose of God toke effecte amongest
men &amp; was notified vnto the world. for if God had not
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:8568:154"/>
before appointed the falle and the remedie for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
he had not imposed vpon him a lawe, the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof, should bring death, but should haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to liue without such feare and bondage, as we
shall do when victorie shalbe giuen ouer death, which
is the sting of sinne, &amp; ouer sinne also which had his
power by the lawe. And therefor I say that gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
forbidding Adam to eate, and the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment
of death denounced, if he did eate, were nothing
contrary to his secret will: but were the very wayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by his infinite wisdome, by the which he had
determined that his secrete will concerning the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s redemption should be notified &amp; put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
And albeit that such as in gods eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
finde no swetenes nor comfort, fret, fume, storme,
and rage at the onelie mention of it: yet neither dare
we nor can we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale and suppres gods eternall trueth,
infinite loue, and incomprehensible liberalitie towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
vs: neither eshame we to confesse our owne wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
pouertie, and iust condemnation, into the which
oure father Adam willingly wrapped him self and vs.
And therefor we constantly affirme that as we were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in Christ Iesus before all tymes, so it behoued vs
in time to fall in Adam, to the end that the bright glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God, might after shyne &amp; appere before men &amp;

               <p>How meane that euer our reasons be, yet great cause
we haue to giue thanks vnto God, that ye in laboring w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
all your wittes to oppugne &amp; obscure them, are yet com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelled
by the inuincible grace of gods mercie to iustifie
and illustrate the same. which shall plainely appere by
this your first answere, which you make concerning the
omnipotencie of God. forasmuch (say you) as God is
goodnes it self, his wil is alawayes good, yet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is apte
to do, and may do euill, contrary to gods will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
God remaineth omnipotent suffering man to
do euill, whome he might destroy afore he did euill, if
so pleased him: and so ye bring forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of Pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rao.
I will not take in all points that adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of you w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I
think you wold take of vs most gladly, if you had vs in
such a streit as you haue here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded your selues. for
if ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may do euil contrary to gods will: so that God for
no respect, for no end nor purpose wold that such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
should be donne (for thus you must applie your
words, orels ye say nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g against vs) and yet that it plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth
God not to destroy the wicked doer, but to suffer
him to do euill, whome he might haue destroied befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the iniquitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. What shall, I pray you ensue?
but that either there shalbe in God two contrary willes,
one that willeth no wickednes in no wyes to be donne,
and an other that suffereth wickednes, yea and that is
pleased to suffre &amp; not to destroye the wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </gap> orels
that there is a power aboue gods wil, which compelleth
him to suffer that which he wold not: one of these two
can you not auoyd. But I wil dealle more fauorably with
you. Ye grant that God suffereth the euill,<note place="margin">To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 1. &amp; 2.</note> and that he
might destroy the wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before iniquitie be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
if so pleased his godlie maiestie and wisdome.
Do ye not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that in this your confession, is no les
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>onteined then any of vs hath either written or spoken
in this mater. for if gods omnipotencie remaineth as
no doubt it doth, so perfecte and hole that he may not
impede onely wicked men of their interprises, but also
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:8568:156"/>
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may destroy eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him self, if so pleased his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
wisedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God willingly
for causes knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his wisedome alone, permitteth &amp;
suffereth things to be do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And thus (I say) doth you own answer &amp; confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
iustifie o<hi rend="sup">r</hi> doctrine. for we do not teach y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wickednes plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth
God, in so farre as it is wickednes: neither yet that
God will sinfull actes to be donne, in so farre as they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
sinfull, without any other further respecte. But we say
that as the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the godly please God

because the works be good &amp; agreable to his owne natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re:
so say we that God will, yea and hath determined the
works that be most wicked to be donne for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purposes
&amp; causes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded in his eternal cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel. Which thing if
we be able to proue by the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t scriptures of God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
oght you not to be offended althogh we preferre God
to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and his plaine trueth, to your sophisticall euasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
&amp; colde interpretations of such places. for the auoiding
the prolixitie of many, I will choose but two at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most,
plaine and most euident. Is it not a great &amp; horrible sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
that a fals prophete shall come and deceause the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Yea is it not likwyes sin, to deceaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet? and
yet God feareth not to attrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t to him self bothe the

serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, orels, to execute a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d blind those, who delite not
in the veritie. For Moises witnesseth in these words, if
in the middest of the, there arrise a Prophet, and he shal
giue vnto the a signe, and yet should say let vs go and
serue stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge goddes heare him not, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord your God
tempteth you, whether that ye wil loue your Lord, your

had resisted God speaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by his patriarks, prophets

onely (as Moises and Elias had before spoke) declareth
what fidelitie &amp; diligence God had vsed in the generall
election &amp; vocation of that people, from time to time:
and yet what had bene their obstinate rebellion &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
defection from him: by the which they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Prophetes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d should kill his Sonne sent of God
to call them from iniquitie. What hath this to do I say
with that will, by the which God, in his eternall counsel
hath made diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, betwext the electe &amp; the reprobate?
If ye dare say that Christe in that place meaneth, in that
he wold haue gathered those murtherers, and sonnes of
murtherers as he doth witnes, he doth gather his
chosen flock, him self wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicte you of a lie. for he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the same to the scribes &amp; pharisies, to whome
principally he spake, in that place that they were not of
his shepe &amp; that therfor they could not be gathered to
his folde, that they were not of God, &amp; therfor that they
could not heare his voice, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did not pray for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world,

no stronger argument nor reason I require to confute
your error then the same, which you alledge for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment
thereof for if by nature all be equall, and
that onely grace maketh the difference, then we dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
&amp; ask whether that grace be giuen to some, and denied
to others &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by permission &amp; sufferance, as you speak,
or if it be the determined will of God that his grace a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
mercie by Christ Iesus shalbe frelie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated with
some, and that the same shall most iustlie be denied to
others, albeit the causes to vs do not appere, during the
time of this our martalitie. If you dare say that gods
will in taking away the stonie hearte and in giuing the
fleshie hearte, be nothing elles but onely a permission
&amp; sufferance without the operation and will of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
then may you reason that in the hardening of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8568:159"/>
and of the rest of the reprobat there is nothing elles
but a bare permission without any efficacie of gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
But if it be God that worketh in vs the good will and
perfourmance of the same, and that he hath mercie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
whome he listeth. the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it likwies, that God harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
whome he will. Mark &amp; note y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wordes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
He saieth not, he hardeneth whome he permitteth
and doth suffer to be hardened, but palinely he saieth
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hardeneth whome he will. The Apostle sawe none
other cause why mercie was shewed to some and others
were left in induratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but gods will. Trew it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat
of nature haue and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mothers wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be doth
tary with them, the mater of their induration. But the
question is. What is the cause, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mater is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
from some, and why? dothe it remaine with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
If you answere because som receaue grace offered,
and som refuse it. Ye haue said nothing, as more plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
I haue before declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for alwayes we ask the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
why is the will of the one obedient to God, and why
is the will of the other rebellious, considering that all
by nature are equall. Althogh that you trauell to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde
the heauen and the earth yet shall ye be broght
to this principall: that God hath mercie vpon whome
he will, and whome he will he maketh hard hearted.
And therefor as of his mercie and free grace, God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
willingly in the one with his Spirit, softnes, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of mercy, so doth his iust iudgementes, &amp; iust wrath
against sinne couceaued by the spirit of sathan, work in
the others hardnes obstinacie, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sense of his wrath.
You reason affirming that Pharao had a stonie heart
before that Moises spake vnto him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could not it be

yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> reason I say is more then foolish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I suppose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:8568:160"/>
of mans heart as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naturall power of the same.
foras the stone by it self can neuer com to any softnes of

it self, come to that humilitie and obedience, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable
before God. But doth it therof insue that one
man is not, nor can not be more cruell then an other,
yea that one and the same may not procede frome euil
to wors, and by contempt of grace, make him self more
hard and more hard: althogh his heart was neuer fully
mollified. I think you will not affirme the contrarie. for
the holie Gost giuing this exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: This daye if you
heare his voice harden not your heartes,<note place="margin">Psal. 95</note> doth confirme
my affirmacion, which is, that men procede from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to hardnes, yea from one sinne to an other, till their
sinnes be becomme inexcusable, and so finally irremis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
because that obstinately they refuse grace offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as Christ doth wittnes in these wordes, if I had not com,
and spoken vnto them, they should not haue sinne, but
now haue they nothing to cloke their sinne, for they ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
sene, and hated not onelie me, but also my father. No
man wilbe so fond, as to affirme, that the Iewes before
Christs preaching and miracles, were cleane without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:
but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of grace did so augment and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ase
their sinne, that it became inexcusable. euen so say
I that Pharao did harden his owne heart frome time
to time becomming more vnthankfull vnto God and
more cruell to his people. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine of this indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and hardnes I confesse to haue bene borne with
him, and that to raige against gods people he neded no
impulsion of gods parte, but rather a brydle to impede
his fury. But yet the question is not resolued as before
I haue noted. for still we ask why was not that fountein
shutte vp? why was not the naturall venim purged and
his heart mollified? searche where you list, ye shall fynd
none other reason nor cause, for the which the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
induration of Pharao did principallie procede
but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God in his eternall counsell for causes knowen to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8568:160"/>
his wisedom alone had most iustly denyed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
his graces effectually with him, but had raysed
him vp to haue his power shewed forth in him. And so
God did harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pharaos hearte, not by permission onely
but willingly withdrew his Spirit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him as before is
said.<note place="margin">To the 8. 9 10</note> Wonder it is that amongest the ancient doctors ye

against Manacheus who did affirme the self same thing
that you do, to witte that God was a passiue God, that

thou say (saieth Augustine to Iulian) that the wicked
that be giuen ouer to their owne desires, are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
onely left by gods suffering, but not compelled
to sinnes by power, as thogh that the Apostle had not

that by flattery they beginne to seke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> originall cause

I must confesse my self nether to know nor to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what it is to do, or what it is to work. Your bold
impudencie affirming, that Iob was plagued of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
by suffering him to be plagued, is intollerable.
Doth not God prouoke as it were sathan to trye his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
Iob? saying hast thow not considered my seruant
Iob,<note place="margin">Iob 1</note> how none is lyke vnto him in the earth, an vpright
and iust man, one that feareth God and escheweth euill.
And after that sathan, vpon that occasion had defaced
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8568:163"/>
the integritie and iusticie of Iob, affirming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that easye
it was to feare and serue God, seing that all thinges were
prosperous and fortunate in his house and familie. God
first by expresse wordes giueth to him power ouer all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
perteined vnto him: and thereafter he giueth ouer the
body of Iob to the tyrannye of sathan, his life onely
bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g reserued. Was this I pray you onely, to plague Iob,
by suffering him to be plagued? Doth the father which
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth his childe to be beaten in his presence, and
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth how many stripes he shall receaue, nothing
elles but suffer his childe to be beaten? or is he not
rather the chief cause, as that he is the chief comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <note place="margin">To the 13</note> 
                  <hi>but onely suffered the deuill to take them, and so God did not
punishe his people. for he touched them not, but hid his face from them, to
see their end.</hi> Albeit your vanitie trouble me a littell, yet
must it nedes returne vpon your owne heades to your
shame. This is a good reasonly, God by him self tooke
not Iobs goods from him, therefor he did nothing
but suffer them to be taken: and gods owne hand did
not touch Israell nor Iuda, therefor was he but onely
a sufferer, and no worker of their punishment. I will
make the like reason and argument. God by him self
gaue no goodes to Iob, therfore did he nothing but
suffer Iob to be enriched. An other, no visible hand was
sene to touch Elimas the sorcerer,<note place="margin">Act. 13</note> therefor did God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
suffer him to be blinded. If ye will affirme the
former, to witt, that God did nothing but suffer Iob
to be enriched: not onely shall Iob him self testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, but euen sathan, althogh he be a lier, and
the father of lies: yet in that case shall he conuince
you of a most impudent lie. for he sayeth: Hast thow
not made an hedge aboute him, and aboute his house
and a boute all that he hath on euery syde? thou hast
blessed the work of his handes, and his substance is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased

touche all that he hath to see if he will not blaspheme

suffer Elimas to be blynded: then shall the holie Gost
speaking in sainct Paule conuict you. for he saieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the hand of the Lord is vpon the and thou shalt be

shall you haue God, man, and the deuill to rebuke

God, who feareth not to confesse that all instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

as there is no conformitie nor aggreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betwext

so are they subiect to iust damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for their rebellion

God) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these horrible blasphemies, I purpose in this
place to declare the difference betwext the holie will of
God, and the wicked will of men, and why it is, that the
worke of God is moste iust, and the worke of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
vniust, and euill, reseruing the rest to better
opportunitie.</p>
               <p>The will of God must not be restreined to those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which externally we see donne or hear to haue bene
do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne.<note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se and endes of things that be wroght.</note> But gods will must be extended to to those endes,
for the which God worketh, and causeth to be wroght,
all thinges from the beginning to witt, for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacion
of his owne glory, for the profit and saluation
of his electe children, and for the execution of his iust
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ether for a tyme to correct his chosen, orels
for euer to punishe the stubborne and disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of the
reprohate sorte. Becaus y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I suspect no man so foolish as
that he will deny the will of God working to these endes
to be most iust most holy, and most perfecte in it self: I
wil labor for no probation of that parte. But because the
instrumentes by whome God worketh,<note place="margin">Who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not God.</note> be diuers, we must
first inquire and knowe what instrumentes they be that
obey gods will, and therefor by him are reputed iust
workers, and what they are that obey not his will, and so
what so euer they do, are reputed inobediente. Onely
those instrumentes do obey gods will, who hauing his
will clearly reueled vnto them, do studie and indeuer
them selues to obey, accomplish, and fulfill the same,
and that of very loue, fre mynd, and zeale to obey
his godlie Maiestie. the frutes and workes of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes,
howe soeuer man doth iudge of them, doth
God approue, yea euen albeit they appere to repugne
to mercy, or to his lawe written. for the Israelites were
deliuered frome theft by gods will reueled: albeit
they spoyled and robbed (vnder the cloke of borowing)
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:8568:164"/>
the Egyptiens of their substance. The maryners and the
shipmasters being with Ionas, in that soden storme and
tempest raised by God, were fre from murther and she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of innocent bloode by gods will plainely reueled
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the Prophet. Iehu was not onely iustified
from all the suspition of treason, which men might
haue gathered of his facte, but also from crueltie, in
killing those idolaters, who manifestly declared them
selues friendes to Baal: by that, that God did first reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
his will vnto him, sending his Prophet to anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
him, and after approued his zeale, which he rewarded
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> temporall promise of the kingdom to continue in
his posteritie to the fourth of his sede. Thus I say doth
God iustifie the workes of these instrumentes which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his will reueled. And so I say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they onely obey God
that knowing his will do studie to obey the same. But
contrary wyes, who soeuer doth any thing, ignorant of
gods will not knowing the will of God reueled, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth
or doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the same (howsoeuer he serueth
gods eternall purpose) doth nether obey God, nether ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he be excusable before gods iustice. And that because
in his work &amp; fact he looketh nothing to gods will, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet to the end and purpose which God respecteth.
And hereof springeth and artiseth the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwext
the workes of God, &amp; the workes of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea betwext the
workes of the godlie, and the workes of the vngodlie.
God worketh all his workes, to manifest his glorie, his
wisedome, his power, his mercie, goodnes &amp; iustice. The
godlie moued by the holie Spirit, worke their workes
to giue obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto God, to support their brethere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
their necessities at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and to punish vice
according to his lawe. But the vngodly caried hedlon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
by their own lustes, and by the fury of sathan, to
whose power they are committed, work all their workes
to reuenge them selues, to destroye such as they hate,
and to promote their own entreprises without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
had to God, to his will, ordinance or counsell.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:8568:165"/>
One or two examples shall make this mater more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
The will purpose and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of God in punishing
Iob was to trye his patience, and of the same to leaue an
example to all them that truely feare God to the end.
And who dare deny this to be most reasonable, and
most iust, that God examining sharply one of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shall make him a scolmaster to all the rest? But what was
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> will and purpose of sathan, and of the Caldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Iob was punished? The will and purpose of sathan is
plainely reueled to haue bene, that by those afflictions
he fully purposed to withdrawe Iob from gods feare, and
to cause him curse God to his face.<note place="margin">The will of the Caldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s against Iob.</note> The will of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deans is euident ynough, by the manifest malice of all

refuseth none, except such as vtterly refuse light, or

finding in Semei at that time a wicked mynd towardes
Dauid did lowse the bridle to his corrupted affections.
but in two things do you and we differre. The first is
that whether he found any wickednes in him which
his godly power might not haue remoued, if so he
had determined to haue donne from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
And secondarily if so he gaue him the bridle,
that he might not haue impeded the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me, if such
had bene his godly will: and therefore where you
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8568:168"/>
affirme that God did effectually moue Semei to that
wicked dede. if you vnderstand that in so farre as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
was wicked, the Spirit of God, I meane the holy Gost
did not moue him therunto, I subscribe with you. for
so outrageously to curse Dauid, in the day of his great
calamitie, he was moued by that venime which lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g had
lurked in his breast, and by the instigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the deuill.
But if thereupon you conclude, as that you seme to do
by your manifest wordes, that God did nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g elles but
onely suffer him. Because I say that such ydle permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
can neither agre with gods power, nor with his iustice,
we must nedes affirme, that when God giueth ouer the
wicked into a lewd, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reprobate mynde, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to witt: That he doer haue gods expresse commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his assurance. And secondarely that he looke,
and haue respect to the same endes, which God hath vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in his word. and last that he do it onely to obey
God. Nowe proue any of these to haue bene in Semei,
and I will confesse that ye haue once triumphed. I finde
that Dauid did acknowledge gods commandement and
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell, and therfor at that time wold he not arme him
self nor his seruantes to take vengeance. But what com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of God I pray you did Semei either acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or confesse. I finde no mention that he excuseth
him self, no not by any commandement that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
of God, when after he submitteth him self to Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid
in the day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he returned and came ouer Iordane.
But I finde him plainely to confesse his offence saying:
Let not my Lorde impute wickednes vnto me,<note place="margin">2. Re. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre
the thing that thy seruant did wickedly, when
my Lorde the king departed oute of Ierusalem, that the
king shoulde take it to his heart. for thy seruant doeth
knowe that I haue donne amisse. If Semei had either
knowen any commandement of God, or if he had loo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:8568:168"/>
to the same end to the which God looked, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght
haue had plausible reasons to haue persuaded Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
to haue shewed fauor and mercie vnto him. first he
might haue said, Oh Dauid althogh thow was ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and
that I did curse the, thow oghtest no more to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against me, then thow wast against the Prophet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.
for as he had gods commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t plainely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uele
thy sinne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sharply to rebuke the same, to the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
that thou mightest be more effectually moued to repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance,
so had I gods commandement bitterly to curse
thee, to the end that thou mightest humble thy self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy God, whom so highly thou hast offended.</p>
               <p>These I say I had bene plausible reasons to haue moued
Dauid to mercie. But the canckered conscience of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei
did witnes against him, self y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he to his knowledge
had neither commandement of God, neither yet that
he looked to any purpose or counsell of God: but onely
to Dauids, vtter confusion &amp; destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
soght. And so I say albeit that gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the self was iust. for the purpose and end which
he had appointed, yet was this commandement hid to
Semei, and gods purpose also vnknowen to him: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was his fact neither iustly nor obediently donne.
for a iust fact (as I haue before said) requireth a good wil
to obey a iust commandement: and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce requireth
knowledge of the will, which neither of bothe was
in Semei. Nowe proue if you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either iniustice in God
who thus doeth vse this wicked instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or yet in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
his sernant, who in his testament commanded the
dissembled hypocrisie to be punished. The rest of your
vaine sophisterie, which of Castalio you haue begged,
doeth nothing profit you. for albeit we should confesse
that it was the will of God in some respecte, that Semei
should haue an euill and inobedient minde: how shall
you be able to proue, that therfor he did obey God? Is
it not the will of God, that sathan, and the wicked world,
of a wicked and malicious mynde, trooble and tempt
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:8568:169"/>
his children in this earthe? Doeth it therfor folowe that
Sathan and the wicked obey God? or doeth it not most
iustly folowe, that because God will that our pacience
should be knowen, &amp; that the wicked from tyme to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
procede in their impietie till the measure be full,
that therfor they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer obey God. And in this our af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmation

raling. But lest you should still glory in your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
and grosse ignorance, I will discouer the same
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:8568:171"/>
folowing your answer, in the wordes of S. Iames saying
God te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth no man. if ye affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God nether te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obeidie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, nether yet sendeth false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
to tempt his people, his plaine scriptures will re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buke
your vanitie. for God tempted Abraham, he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
his people fortie yeres in the wildernes, he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth
also by sending fals prophetes, as Moises doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
And therefor ye must be compelled to grant, that
this word tempting or to tempt is diuersly taken in the
scriptures: somtimes to trye and examyn, somtimes to
bring to light and knowledge thinges that be secret in
mans heart, sometymes to seke by experience a certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of thinges spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, pronounced, or affirmed, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
moue, or to prouoke to iniquitie: &amp; in this last
signification we confesse that God tempteh no man. for
as the mater of all iniquitie lieth within man, so is he
prouoked, moued, and stirred therunto by his owne lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
and instigation of the deuill onely. And thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
we grant that to moue euill thoghtes, is to tempt,
yet we denye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersion. which is this, Ergo to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt is
to moue euill thoghtes. But let vs heare forther of your
profound vanitie: all is good say you that commeth
from the father of light (God grant that in your hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
ye were assuredly so persuaded) if euill thoghtes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
from him they must be good. and so you conclude,
that then was Iosephes wordes fals, and that God may
be called the father of darknes (O execrable is your
blasphemie) because from him come euill thoghtes
which are darknes. Answer. If any of vs haue so written
or spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs be stoned to death as execrable blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.
And if that ye in your blind fury do therewith
vniustly burden vs, althogh ye may eskape the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of man, yet shall you not esskape gods seuere and
soden vengeance. It is malice that will not suffer
you to vnderstand howe that these euilles whiche men
willingly comitt; in so farre as they com from God are
iust, profitable and good. for we most constantly affirme
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8568:171"/>
that the damnation of the deuill, the induration of
Pharao, the deceauing of Achab, and other such, in
so farre as they proceded from God, are his iust and
good workes, because they are the punishment of sinne,
the excecution of his iust iudgementes, and a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his iustice. which iustely is armed against
the obstinate rebellion of Angelles, and men. but the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
to conclude, ergo their euill thoghtes, their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
myndes, their hatered and crueltie came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
from God, is more then a blasphemie. for all
these be, and are found within the offenders, which God
doth vse not by an ydle permission (for that is a thing
most contrarious to his iustice) but effectually as his
wisedome best knoweth, they shall serue to his glory,
&amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for vtilitie of his chosen children. I say it is a thing
most contrarious to gods iustice &amp; power, ydly to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
iniquititie to be done, if he had no further respect
then to the facte, as it is committed. for as a man can
not be excused, who may impede murther and doth it
not, so can not gods iustice be excused by your ydle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
if he had no further respect, but to thinges as
they be do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne by man. And so is gods iustice rather accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
then mainteined by the foolishness of your curious
braynes, saying God permitteth many thinges which
he wold not. what vanitie is this? Is it not a thing
confessed amongest all, that gods power is omnipotent?
who then ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> compelle him to suffer, that which he wold
not? And why doth he willingly suffer thinges, which
in his law, he hath forbidden? I answer, for the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of his own glory which is more precious then
the heauen and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, and all the creatures in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
conteined. And thus doth vanitie cause you to fear that
gods iustice shall fall into decay, except it be vndersett
&amp; vpholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your foolishe distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, betwext his will &amp;
his permission. but we feare not to affirme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing, which in some respect he will not. for as he
is omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; a most louing father so should he suffer
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8568:172"/>
no calamitie to come nor crueltie to be vsed against his
children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except he did before see, yea and before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn
their cofort &amp; his glory to arrise of the same. And
will you say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gods glory the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> preseruation
of his Church is an euill work? because that wicked men
are instrumentes, by whome gods eternal counsell is
broght to passe. Was the exaltatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iosephe to honor,
the preseruation of Egypte, and of other nations from
famine, yea and the feding of Iacob and his familie, an
euill work? because that, Iosephes brethren of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and enuie did sell him to the Ismaelites, and they
for lucre did seli him againe to Putiphare, whose wyfe
of malice did moste vniustly accuse him, &amp; so being in
prison at length he was broght to the knowledge of Phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rao,
and so was promoted for his reuelation, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to honor and dignitie. O say you it is not this
that we do lay to your charge, but you affirme <hi>that God
was author of the malice, and of the wicked thoghtes of Iosephes breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</hi>
You do belie vs most maliciously. for we constantly
denye that God ether powred in them any malice, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then onely, and at none other time elles do me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glorify
God, but when they confesse him worthie of glory, you
are ignorant, foolishe, and manifest liers. for your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is no better, then if I should say: man slepeth in
the night season, therfor no man may or can slepe at
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8568:172"/>
any other time. If your master Castalio had considered
that an argument made, a specie ad genus, negatiue
is vaine and foolishe, he had not heaped to gether so
many sophisticall reasons: by the which you and others
are abused. To make this mater some what more plaine:
If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist in the manifestation of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
of his trueth, of his power, of his wisedome and of
his moste iust iudgementes, then do all creatures glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
God, whether they iudge him worthie or vnworthie
of the same. for Dauid affirmeth that the heauens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the glory of God, and yet haue they nether iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
nor vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding: the heauen and the earth saieth
Isaiah are replenished with his glorye.<note place="margin">Isa. 6</note> And in an other
place the beastes of the field shall preach my glorye the
dragons and the birdes of eastriches, and Achan also
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to giue glory vnto God. The earth, shalbe
compelled saieth Habacuc to knowledge the glory of
God. Zacharie also the Prophet saieth for his glory
hath he sent vnto the nations which haue spoyled you.
finally shall not sathan and the reprobate in their iust
condemnation giue glory vnto God? and do ye think
that all these creatures, iudge God to be worthie of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in such sort as they acknowledge his power, his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
his iustice, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hole heart submitte them
selues to his holy will? I trust you do not. for we knowe
that sathan is a spirit confirmed in malice, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
against God, &amp; yet is he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled euen in tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
to giue glory vnto God, in so farre, as in his iust da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
he declareth gods power and iust iudgementes.
And therefor I say that you restreine the glory of God
with in to streit &amp; narrowe limites, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you will that
it shall extend no forther, then to suche as from their
heart iudge God worthie of glory, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> perteineth to his
chosen children onely and can neuer be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.
for such glory must procede fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is not
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mone vnto all, but is the speciall gift giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect:
&amp; yet neuertheles by other meanes God declareth
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8568:173"/>
his glory, euen in the vesselles of his wrath, as is befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
declared.</p>
               <p>Of the example of Nabuchadnezer ye can make but
a particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion in this for me, Nabuchadnezer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had felt the iust punishement of his pride and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie,
gaue glory vnto God: Ergo some man after pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
giueth glory vnto God. If you make your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion
extend any further, it is fals. for if you say that all
men after punishment giue glory vnto God, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same
confession that he gaue, many examples may be showen
to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary. if you saye that none other giueth glory
vnto God, except such as so be punished: that will be pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
likewies fals. And if you say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gods glory doth shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in none, except in those that acknowledge &amp; confesse
God to be mercifull and iust, that is most vaine of all,
and thus I say your conclusion must be but particulare.</p>
               <p>The reasons &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, which you make vpon
these wordes of Dauid: Praise God all you natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, are so
foolish, on the one parre, and so filthie and execrablev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the other, that amongest all nations ye oght not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely

for priuie hatered, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I bear against the persone of any

man. But in gods presence I say, that rather then such
horrible blasphemies should haue bene fostered in my
heart, deuised in my braine, written by my pen, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by my mouth and tongue, that rather I wold
my carcasse should haue suffered most cruell and vile
death. yea and further I say, that better it had bene, for
you neuer to haue bene borne, then thus blasphemou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
to expose gods great Maiestie to opprobrie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage.
for I appele to the iudgement of the heauen and
the earth, and of all creatures in the same conteined, if
euer that Iulian the appostate spake more disdainfully
of God, then here you write. But for the instruction of
the simple reader, to answere you more reasonably, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
your vnreuerent skoffing deserueth, I say first, that the
mynde of Dauid was not to teach vs what euerie nation
and euery particulare man amongest the Gentiles shall
do,<note place="margin">The pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uid.</note> but what was the duetie of euerie nation, euery peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and euerie man to do, when gods mercies should be
offered vnto them. And therfor if you conclude all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
do praise God, in such sorte as Dauid meaneth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the holie Gost by his mouth comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth all
nations to praife God, you make no better an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then if ye should affirme, that euery man loueth
God with all his heart, with all his mynd, &amp; with all his
strength, because that God so commandeth. This is one
portion of your ignorance. The second foloweth, gods
workes, say you, must be such as all nations may knowe
them and praise them. I answer, if you vnderstand that al
that praise God vnfeinedly from their heartes must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
some knowledge of his mercies, goodnes, iust iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous workes we distent not from you.
But if you say (as by your proces is euident, that you
do), that except all nations perceaue and vnderstand
the very grounde of gods iustice, that God amongest
them shall haue no glory. then as we lament your foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes,
so we detest your error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for albeit that the

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:8568:174"/>
of those things which God purposeth, yet shal not God
be defrauded of his golry, no not in the most carnal and
wretched man. Christe Iesus was sent into the world, and
came to that people which was called his own: and his
glory did so shine to the eyes of some,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> that they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it to be the glory of the onely So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But did the princes of the priestes and the hole nation
of the Iewes see the same glory, and so confesse him as
did the electe? Sai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Paul witnesseth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. saying,
if they had knowen, they had not crucified the king of
glory. Paul was appointed a preacher to the Gentiles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
whome he most faithfully and moste boldely
did open the treasures of gods great mercies, and of the
glory of his Sonne Christ Iesus: but did euery citie, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
nation or man, to whome these treasures were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
so receaue, vnderstand and imbrace them, that for
the same they glorified God? the contrarie is euident.
But was God therfore defrauded of his glory, euen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
midest of a wicked generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? God forbid. for as the eyes
of some were lightned, and so did glorifie the word of
the Lord, so such as remained obstinate did (and shall)
glorifie God, in so farre as his iust iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes were, and
shalbe executed against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If you feare no punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

for none of vs doeth impute vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God that he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
any man, for thing that he prouoketh him
to do. for iniquitie commeth not of gods prouocation,
motion, nor holy Spirit, as that before we haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfor as God hath reueled to vs a more assured
knowledge in his holy scriptures, then the Philistians
priestes had, so are we bold to affirme that which was hid
from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which also you can not abide, to witt, that al
creatures are compelled to serue to gods glory in such
sorte as his wisedom hath appointetd them: and yet that
the willes of men are neither violently moued nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
by God to committe iniquitie, to the which all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
men are redy bent of naturall corruption. Amongest

none ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be more foolish, nor further repugni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g

<hi>If God should punish a man: because he hath a beard, should any glory
redound to God there of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seing he hath giuen vs beards him seis:</hi> Here of
you wil inferre, that if God punishe sinne which he hath
willed or appointed to be, then can he not be iust. But
let vs examine, if your Simile doeth agree euen in the
chief pointes, in the which if it proue any thing it must
agre. first we knowe that the beard of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was created by
God. But who amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest vs did yet euer affirme that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and iniquitie was made or created by God? Sinne we

counsell of God, and that for the most iust and
the most righteous end and purpose. But that it was ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
or created by God, that are ye not able to proue by
our doctrine. Thus doeth your similitiude halt in the
chief membre. for they must be both a like gods creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

that God shall iudge the world, not according to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
Euangell plainely reueled, but according to some

men do more constantly abyde by that which is written
and reueled, no men do lesse care, to seke for newe
reuelations or vncerten authorities, then we do. Oure
continuall doctrine is, that God shall absolue from
damnation such as by true faith embrase his dear

all infideles, and such as delyte in manifest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie

that God shall pronounce by his Sonne Christe Iesus to
whom all iudgement is giuen. And for none other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete

coulde lay to some of your charges, that which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

you haue written (besides your priuie informations)

Saint Paule committed to writing, yea and further
that some of you haue called the hole scriptures of
God in doubte: and some do affirme that none is able
by the word written to decide the controuersies that
this day be in religion. And therefor that we must

Here plain it is that the eternall God who was angrie
against Israell dad stirre or moue Dauid to nombre
them, not by an ydle permission, as you alledge, but by
such motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as nothing repugneth to his iustice. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

               <p>God can not will two contraries, but to speake the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

betwene the will, and the permission.</p>
               <p>God can not will two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries, True it is in him sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe,
in one respecte, and for one purpose, he who is author
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord, can not will contrarietie: but in consideration

to make it more se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sible to the simple, I say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in this pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position,
God can not wil two contraries, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
which you make vpon the same, you oght to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
made a distinction betwene those thinges w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> God sim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply
(or as ye spake before, absolutely) will, and betwene
those thinges, which he will for a certein end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
which doeth not appere in the external actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For
certen thinges there be (as in an other place I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated)
which God will, euen for them selues, such as be
mercie, iustice, temperance chastitie, and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which he wil, haue to shyne in his elect and please
him in Christ Iesus his Sonne. And yet neuertheles he
also will crueltie, iniustice, excesse, filthie life, blindnes, &amp;
induration to be in others, as iust punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of their
sinnes, and causes of their conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. The last (I say)
will God to be in the reprobate, not for the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes
sake, which do euer displease his Maiestie, but for
such endes as his wisedom hath appointed. Let this be
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:8568:179"/>
explained by examples, some natural, and some take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
gods scriptures. There is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (except he be of a most
cruel nature) that considering the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and of battell, doeth will it, for the selfe. And yet a
godly prince persewed by externall ennemies, doeth not
onely will his soldiours to fight, and to mainteine the
warre, but also he prouoketh, he encourageth, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
his subiectes to the same. And why is it? because y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
warre or battell pleaseth him in the self, or for the self?
No, but because with out such trauaill, such danger, and
hasard, his subiectes can not lyue in quietnes, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of his commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth can not be preserued. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
may I say of godlie magistrates punishing murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
adulterers, and blasphemers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death, and yet nether
willing the death of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither yet deliting in the

to be vnlike: for gods power is not subiect to such
inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities vnwillingly, as be the powers of men. But

w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man may will two contraries, for diuers respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries, and yet one man, euen at one time may will

endes. He may will peace, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and felicitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther of springeth, and at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie in him self, he may wil warre,
to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the furie of the ennemie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wold oppresse his
subiectes. And may not these thinges, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we perceaue to
be in creatures, be in God in greater perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, althogh
we perceaue not the causes? Let vs trie the answere, both
by the examples of gods serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and last by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple
of God him self: Lot, no doubte did agree with gods wil
in that he loued chastitie, sobrietie and tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and
hated filthie life riotous chere, and excesse. For the holy
Gost boareth him this record, that he was pure, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
both in eares, and eyes. But what will had he when he
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:8568:179"/>
did offer his two daughters to be defloured, and abused
by those vilanous persons? was it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to his formar
will? Did he now beginne to delyte in that execrable fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines?
assured I am he did not. But being oppressed
with the present necessitie, reteining the same loue, wil,
and minde to chastitie, and honest conuersation, soght
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next remedie that to him appered able to haue staied
the rage of that furious multitude (vpon God I gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
no such necessitie). But let the chief scope be obser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued,
and we shall vnderstand (that for diuers respectes) to
will two thinges, wherof the one, is contrarie to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is not to will contrarietie. But let vs come to God
him self. God willeth mercy, iustice, &amp; all other vertues
as before we haue said, and these, he will at all times, and
before all times. But is it not possible therfor, that he
can will crueltie oppression, blood sheding, murther,
and death? Who then sent Nabuchadnezer, to destroy

whom God hath elected in Christe Iesu, he hath also
predestinate, and before appointed, to be like fashioned

it is plaine that the greuous destruction, the aboundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the bloodshed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g diuers natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the cruell death
of Christ Iesus, and the most fearefull afflictions of his
dearely beloued Church, did procede from gods will, in
so much as he did not onely suffer them, but also, for
most iust causes, respectes, and endes, which often before
I haue recited, he did will and appoint them: and yet in
God was there no contrarietie. For in the destruction of
Ierusalem, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of others, he had not respect simply to the
ruine, and vastatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those places, but to his iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
which were prouoked to take vengeance vpon
the multitude of their sinnes, which lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g he had suffered.
When our Master Christe Iesus did suffre, he had no
delite in the crueltie of those enraged dogges, who
did crucifie him, which as he hated, so after he did most
seuerely punish: but his pleasure a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d delite was in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption
of man, which by none other sacrifice could ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
bene perfited. And this day, and from the beginning
he hath had no pleasure in the blood which is shed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie which is vsed against his simple, and
smal flock, but because he wil haue the members like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

worke, that is: he trieth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d purgeth by fyre our faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all drosse, and corruption of earthlie affections. But in
none of all these is there any contrarietie, neither in
God, neither in his will, neither in his counsell. for all
thinges be disposed in such ordre, such consent and so
conueniently, that his glorie, and the perpetual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort
of his electe, doth finally, and assuredly folowe. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
so it is in the apperant contrarietie betwene you, and vs,

contrarietie, which hath remained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the encrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se

                  </note> Behold becaus the
Lorde God of your fathers is wroth with Iuda, he hath
deliuered them into your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and ye haue slaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in a rage that reacheth vp to heauen. And now ye purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
to kepe vnder the children of Iudah and Ierusalem, as
seruants and had maides vnto you: But are not you such
that sinnes are w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord your God? These be
his wordes in that mater, by the which if you be able to
proue, that the Israelites did more, then God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nall
counsell had appointed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should do against Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>da,
and Ierusalam, we will patiently heare your probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and reasons. If you say the Prophete reproued them of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:8568:181"/>
their crueltie, therfor they did more then God wold: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
doth not folow, for the iust will of God must not be
measured, by the crueltie of their facte, but by his owne
word, which doeth affirme, that God gaue ouer Iudah
into, the handes of the king of Syria, &amp; into the handes
of the king of Israell, who did strike them with a great
slaughter, and that for the sinnes, and abominable ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
which they, &amp; Achas their king, had committed.
We heare, and see affirmed by the holy Gost, that God
gaue them ouer into the handes of their ennemies, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
thing he did willingly, and not by permission as
you writte. Now to the place of Zachariah in which I
say, you shew grosse, and wicked ignorance. For if your
interpretation shoulde be receaued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of necessitie it
should folow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in God their lacked power to impede, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
staye the furie of those cruell me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who in their victorie
did so insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly rage. For if God wold onely haue had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Iewes gently corrected, &amp; not to haue bene so seuerely,
and rigorously destroyed: and yet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> against al maner, &amp;
sorte of his wil, they were so cruelly entreated, it can not
be denied, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the crueltie, and rage of the Babylonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
was greater, then God coulde impede or staye, how blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
and fals this is, the godlie doeth vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. O
(say you) but so do the wordes of the text sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for they
say: I am greatly angrie against the careles heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For I
was but a litle angrie against Sion, but they haue helped
forwarde the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I answer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if ye were not more ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licious
then ignorant, ye might easily perceaue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those
wordes were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any thing was do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Israel, and Iudah, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> God had not appoi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded,
but to instruct the Prophete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the will, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of God, in punishing of his people, was farre other,
then was the wil, &amp; connsell of those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did destroy them:
and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g bondage should haue an other end then
either they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, or their ennemies did vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
That nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g was do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne against y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> people, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the Lord had

doeth affirme, saying: my wordes &amp; my statutes (he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

my serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes the Prophetes, haue they not, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
y o<hi rend="sup">r</hi> fathers: in so much that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted, and
said: Euen as the Lord of Hostes hath determined, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to do vnto vs, accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to o<hi rend="sup">r</hi> wayes, and accordig

will belie the holy Gost, you must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,
God had appointed, &amp; determined so to punish
his people. Yea Amos the Prophete feareth not to say:
Shall there be euill in a citie (that is any punishment or
plague) a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Lord hath not do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne it? Why is he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
(say you) against the proud, and carelesse heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
I answer. Because they neither had respect to gods will,
counsell; nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, but to their own priuat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the satisfying of their cruel appetites. For
they did not destroye Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, willing, or minding to pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nish
the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ses of the people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st God: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet did they carie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Babylon of purpose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God
might be glorified in their deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. No, they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
the plaine contrary. To wit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should
remaine desolate for euer: That Iudah should be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritance
of strange nations, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d so should gods promise be
fals, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vaine. And in very dede the Iewes them selues, in
the extremitie of their trouble, yea, and when the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple
bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be reedified, were not free from these te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptatios,
and therfore doeth God assure his Prophetes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his loue
was great towares Sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: That he wold destroy, that natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> intended their destruction: that he wold deliuer his
people: that the warfare of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was at an end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her
iniquitie was remitted:<note place="margin">Isa. 40.</note> that she had receiued double pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for all her sinnes, from the hand of the Lord,
and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> therfore he wold take the dolourous cuppe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sorow out of her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and wold giue it into the
handes of those, that did trouble her. By which (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mo promises, and threatninges, God doeth not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
that any thing was done in Ierusalem, which he had
not appointed. But by the one he did somwhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:8568:182"/>
the troubled heartes of his afflicted people: and by
the other, he did shew the cause, why he wold punish tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
cruell murtherers, whose seruice before he did vse in
punishing his people.<note place="margin">Isa. 47.</note> And this doeth God most plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witnes in these wordes: I was wrath (saith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord) with
my people I haue polluted myn inheritance, and giuen
them into thy hand (he speaketh vnto Babylon) thou
didest shewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no mercie, but didest lay thy very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
yoke vpon the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and thou saidest, I shalbe a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
for euer, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou didest not set thy mynd to these
thinges neither didest thou reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre the latter end the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.
Therfor now heare thou that art giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pleasures
and dwellest careles, She saith in her heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d none
els: I shall not sitt as a widdow neither shall know the los<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
of children. Here of I say it is plaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of gods people (as before I haue proued) is his owne ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointement,
and will. But because the punishers loke to
another end, therfor are they criminall before gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
In adducing both these exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, that is, of Israel pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishing
Iuda, and of the Babylonians destroying Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
I finde you in another most grosse error, besides this
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I haue confuted. For you seme to affirme, that if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
and Babylonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had kept a measure, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d had not
exceded the boundes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> God had appointed, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they had not sinned. For (say you) he willed the one,
but permitted the other. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in so farre as they did his
will they sinned not, but in so far as they exceded his
wil, and did more w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he wold not, but onely did suffre it,
they sinned. This is your profound diuinitie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d godlie
meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of God, of his iustice, iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d workes
incomprehensible to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reason. Are you able to proue

spilt, or his captaines, and cruell souldioures, one drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe

to declare vnto them their blindnes, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of heart. for wher soeuer mention is made of the
difference betwext the elect, and the reprobate, this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
is attributed to the word, that it doth illuminate the

of the holy Gost: and by the contrarie that it doth exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and more harden the other by reason of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature, to the which they are iustly left. The Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
saint Iohn making mention, that the Iewes did
not beleue in Christ Iesus, albeit that they had sene his
wonderous workes, addeth this cause: therefore (saith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hath blinded their eyes, &amp; hardened their heartes, that
they should not see with their eyes, nor vnderstand in

Here doth the Euangelist attribute to the Prophet, not
onely that he declared their blindnes, but that God by
him did in verydede iustly blind their eyes, and harden
their heartes. But this shall more plainly appere in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the reasons, and scriptures which ye alledge for
proofe of your interpretation.</p>
               <p>First say you, <hi>their heartes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ngeth onely to
God who giuing them ouer to their heartes lustes he alredy hardened
them.</hi> And so ye conclude that the Prophet did onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto them the hardenes of their heartes.<note place="margin">Answer</note> We do
not deny but that their heartes were hardened before,
and that iustly for their iniquities sake they were giuen
ouer to their heartes lustes. But whether they were so
hardened before the preaching of the Prophet, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they could be not harder, I greately doubte. Yea I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doubte to affirme, but that euen as the claye by
the heate of the Sunne, becometh more hard, and more
hard, or as the branch cutte of the natural stock doth
more &amp; more wither, vntill that no kinde of sappe, nor
moisture doth remaine, euen so I say do the reprobate
from time, to time become more obstinate, more blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
more hard, and more cruell, and that by the word, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
doth plainely rebuke their iniquitie, and euidenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
whose children their are. Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in scripture he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof
are manifest: Some lenitie, and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes appered in
Pharao, toward the people of Israel before that Moses,
at gods commandement required their libertie. But
that will, and word of God commanding him to let his
people go and serue God in the wildernes, did so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
worke in the heart of that reprobate,<note place="margin">Exo. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hardnes of his heart, was sodenlye felt by the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
to their greate grief and grudging disconfort.</p>
               <p>In the people of Israel, in their elders, Priestes, and
counsell, appered some face of iustice, when Stephan was
accused, before that he pronounced these wordes: ye stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenecked,
and vncircumcised in heart, and eares, you
haue euer resisted, the holy Gost, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as your fathers ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
resisted,<note place="margin">Act. 7</note> so do you: whom of the Prophetes haue not
your fathers persecuted? and they haue slayn them, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiche
shewed before of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iust, whom ye
haue now betraied, &amp; murthered. Before this sentence (I
say) there appered some face of iustice, but what ensued
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:8568:187"/>
the holy Gost doth witnes, saying: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heard the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
thinges their heartes brast for anger and they gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
at him with their tethe. And after also that he gaue
a more plaine confession of Christe Iesus, of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
glory, power, and Maiestie, they cried out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great
voyce, they stopped their eares, they as wolues enraged
russhed vpon him, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one consent, and so without all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre
of iustice, did stone him to death. If ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the word of God, proceding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of Stephen,
did not more harden them, who no doubte were harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before, you deny a trueth that is more then euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Diuers places more I might adduce for the same purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se, but (hauing respect to breuitie) I stand content with
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se two, which I doubte nothing, are sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
that men, that be alredy hardened, yet by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the plaine word, which rebuketh their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they become more hard. As the owle being blind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
when she appereth to see best in the night season,
but yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day time, she is more blinded, bacause that
the weaknes of her eyes, can not abide the bright bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the sunne. And eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so it is w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the reprobate, they
are alwaies blind, and hard heared, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the light of
God doth most plainely shine before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or when they
are called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniquititie to vertue, then becometh the
word of glad tidinges to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a verie sauor of death, by
the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>, they are both more blinded, and more hardened.
And so in your first reason we dissent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that
you seme to affirme, that because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate are once

vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hardnes I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not admitte. For we do find y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

his heart? yes, the very hypocrite him selfe had some

posteritie, for all his princely pompe, did after fele the
veritie of them. To witte dogges did licke his blood,
the flesh of Iesabell was eaten by dogges, his children,
and hole posteritie were rooted out of Israell. And thus
did the wordes of the Prophete touch his heart (in the

the wordes of Ieremie had this effect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> according as he
spake, so came y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> destruction vpon those proud natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
so lykewise had the wordes of God spoken to Isai, the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:8568:189"/>
same effect, which he pronounced. To the one he said,
thou shalt giue vnto them the cuppe of my wrath, that
they may drinke it. The Prophet without feare did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his commandement, and God did faithfully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
what so euer his messinger had pronounced. Euen
so did God command Isai to blind, and harden, that stub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>born,
and rebellious generation of the Iewes, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching
of his Law, and by rebuking of their manifest im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pietie.
And so he did, God working all to his glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his eternall purpose. And this because your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

we can not admitte it. Against your complexion
or Epilogue, which is nothing but a superfluous repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those thinges, which sufficiently ye haue not

all thinges<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as nothing was created for the self,
so was nothing the appointer of the self to serue God, as
his glory required. But he in his eternal counsel appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
the end to euery creature, to the which they shal on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
atteine, by such meanes, as he most iustly hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
And therfor seing his glorie doth no lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his iust iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, then his superabou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie
to be knowen, he hath in his eternal counsel elected,

world. And albeit he created man after his own image,
yet did God neuer determine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mankind should sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in
Adam, but his iust cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell and purpose was that all men
should fall in Adam, that the elect might know the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of their saluation Christe Iesus, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cted,
before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Adam actualy they did fall, or were crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted.
And so God willing to make his glorie to shine in
al, hath prepared some vessels of mercie, and some of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one he hath frely giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in Christ

Iesus his sonne. The other he hath for iust causes so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
that albeit with long pacience, he suffereth their
manifest rebellion, yet in the finall iudgement he shall
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them to go to the fire that neuer shalbe quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
And this will and counsel of God is neither secret,
nor hidde from his Church, but is in his word most ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifestly
reueled: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfor of it we feare not to affirme,
that euen in the first promise, and euer since hath God
made a plaine distinction betwext the elect, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,
so that the purpose and counsell, which before
was hidde in God, was in time manifested vnto man. W<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
will and counsell of God (becaus it is constant and
immutable, like as God him selfe is) must of necessitie
take effect, and therfor I boldly affirme, that neither can
any whom God in his eternal purpose hath reprobated,
become the elect, and so be saued, neither yet can any of
Christes elect nombre to life euerlasting, be reprobated,
and so come to finall perdition. We further saye, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
gods will in the selfe, be one, to witte, the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of his own glorie, yet as touching his creatures it
hath diuers respectes, for God will the saluation of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and he also will the iust <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ondemnation of others.
And the contrarie of this doth God neuer declare in his
word, but rather doth most plainely reuele it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this his godlie will is not called secrete, as that it is
not expressed in his word: but because that in his word
there is no cause assigned (gods good will onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
why he hath chosen some, and reiected others. And
this knowledge is so necessarie to a Christian, that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout
the same, ca the heart of man neuer be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly

I briefely say at this time:<note place="margin">To the 8.</note> THE LORD shall iudge.

                  </gap>, that because the reprobate
haue not the spirite of regeneration, therfor they can
not do those workes that be acceptable before God.</p>
               <p>How God is almightie, and omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we haue befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
confessed, to witt, that as he in his eternall wisedom
foreseeth, and appointeth all thinges, so doth his power
put all thinges in execution, how, and when it best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him. Neither can his wisedom, will, nor counsels
be subiect to any mutabilitie, vnstablenes, or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge. For
if it so were then his godly wil and counsels, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon him self, but vpon his creatures, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

               <p>Nether to Pharao, neither to Semei, neither yet to
any other reprobate, did, or doth God giue, either wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
commandement or euill thoght. But those wicked
thoghtes, and euill motions, which be in them of their
euill nature, and are stirred vp by the instigation of the
deuill, as he doeth, not purge them, so doth his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
vse them well to his owne glorie, to the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of his children, and to the comfort of his Church.
In so much that the verie tyranny of Pharao, the
cursing of Semei, and the incest of Absalom in so farre
as they were gods workes, they were iust, and holy,
because they were iust punishmentes of their sinnes,
an exercise for his children, and some part also of his
fatherly correction for their offenses. To the rest of
your vanitie, I will not answere, not because I feare your
sophisticall subtilitie, but because I will not (except that
yet I be further prouoked) nether by tongue, nether yet
by penne once name or expresse your horrible blasphe

               <p>In this description of your God (whom you do ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the true God) I do wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of three thinges. First that
in this your description ye dissent from your greate
angel Castalio. Secondely how it is that ye haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your selues: And last why ye omitte these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which the scriptures do no lesse attribute to God,
then any that you alledge. Your master, and chief cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pion
Castalio (now left for your comfort) in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of his God thus writeth. But that God whom both
nature, and reason, and the scriptures do teach, is ready
to mercie, and slow to wrath, who hath created man, of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom
all men are borne, to his owne image, lyke to him
selfe, that he shoulde place him in Paradise, and giue to
him the blessed life. This God will that all men be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and that none perish, and therfore he hath sent his
Sonne into the earth, that iustice might superabound,
wher so euer sinne hath abounded, the light of whose iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stice,
doth illuminate euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that cometh in to this
worlde. Wonder it is I say that ye who so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

folowed your master in all this your worke, haue dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, or at least omitted his wordes, in these two
poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in this case be pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipall. For, first by his descrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
he will that nature, and reason, shal no les teach you
and your faction, God, then shall the scriptures. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he,
whose workes you be not able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend by nature,
and reason, shall not be to you the true God. And secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily,
that except he wil all to be saued: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the light
of his sonnes iustice do so illuminate all men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
into this world, that where so euer sinne hath abounded,
there must iustice superabound, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to you lykewise he be
no God. These be two chief pointes in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie.</p>
               <p>For we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly affirme, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brightnes of our God
doth so blind nature, and reason (as now they be corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted)
that the naturall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer atteine to those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges,
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> apperteine to God, to the knowledge of his will,
nether yet to his true honor. For we know that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
hath not knowen God, by wisedom, but thinking them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
most wise, haue becomen most vaine, in so much
that they haue worshipped the creatures, more then the
Creator. And thus beleue we that nature, and reason, are
not onely vnable to leade vs to the true knowledge of
God, by the which we may atteine to life euerlasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g, but
also we affirme, that they haue bene maistresses of all er<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rors,
and idolatrie. And therfor say we that nature, and
reason, do leade men from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true God, but are neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to teach vs, nether to expresse to vs the eternall, the
trew, and euerliuing God the father of our Lord Iesus
Christe. Further we doubte not to embrase, to beleue, to
reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and to honor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiestie of our God, who hath
made diuision, betwext one sort of men, and an other, as
plainely before we haue proued. These being two chief
pointes, in this controuersie, greate wonder it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ye make no expresse mention (as Castalio doth) in this
your descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Is it because you are ashamed that such
darkenes, and such grosse ignorance should be in your
greate angell of light? Iust cause no doubte haue both
you, and he to be ashamed of your foolish imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

But yet I feare an other thing more, which is this. That
sodenly you will not committe the greate, and secrete
mysteries of your profession to your rude scholers. For

will not offend the eares of the godly. These thinges I

And therafter ye dissuade them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all exercises, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> may

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:8568:194"/>
vaine description of your masters God, but yet couertly
ye say as much (as after shall appere): in which thing, as

yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> selues most vnworthye of credit amongest gods chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren.
For who can credit those teachers, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and for their foundation, &amp; principalles ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
darkenes, and light, lies, and veritie, yea that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with a manifest vntrueth (as doth your Master Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalio)
affirming, that nature, and reason, do teach y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true
God vnto vs, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is a manifest lie, as before we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
If ye say, he addeth also that the scriptures do teach
God vnto vs: I answer that the more is his impudencie,
and more dangerous is his venom. For what impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is it, to preferre corrupt nature, and blind reason to
gods scriptures, in such manifestation of God, as our sal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation
requireth? Did Moses, Isai, or Christe Iesus wil
the ignorant to search nature, or to consult with reason
who should be the Messias promised? or did they not
alwayes send such as lacked light to the word which was
reueled, to the law, and to the Prophetes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which did beare record of Christ Iesus, who is the
onely way, by the which men come to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Father? True it is that the Gentiles by con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>templation
of the creatures, atteined to that knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
that there was a God: but how litle this knowledge
serued for their saluation the Apostle doth witnes. And
therfore I say that your Master is more then impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, v<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
dare preferre nature, and reason, to gods scriptures. And
further his venom (in so saing) is more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, then
if plainely he had affirmed, that nature, &amp; reasone alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
had bene sufficient to haue instructed man in al thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
apperteining to saluation. For so declaring him self
the simple should haue auoyded that error, as a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
most pernicious. But now in ioining together tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
thinges which God hath so manifestly deuided, as
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:8568:194"/>
he hath deuided light from darcknes, he doth nothing
els, but as a traiterous murtherer mixe, and mingle poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
with swete lyquore. For in ioining nature, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
with gods scriptures, in the manifestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God to
mans saluation, he doth plainely witnes, that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man may boldly pronounce that those workes be
none of gods, wherof reason can not see a iust cause, why
so they should be wroght. For the fall of Adam say you,
and, the induration of Pharao, the deceauing of Achab,
and such others, were none of gods workes. But they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
by his permission and why so? Because the naturall
man can not see how such workes can agree, with gods
goodnes, and iustice. And thus ye deny him to be the
true God, who doth not laye before the blindnes of yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
reason all his workes, that they by her iudgement, may
be iustified, or condemned. O blasphemous mouthes,
dare ye denie him to be the true God, of whom Moses,
Iob, Dauid and Paule affirme: that his secretes do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
to him self? that he will not make accompte to
man of all his workes. That his counsels are incompre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hensible,
his iudgementes a greate depth, and his wayes
vnsearchable. Thus much for that which ye omitte of
yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> masters wordes in his description, which I now admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nish,
lest after ye should trouble the simple, with these
your vanities, which from time, to time, ye foster, and
spred abrode. Now to the second, which I will but onely
touch, to put you in minde, that in doctrine, ye are not
constant: for before ye haue affirmed,<note place="margin">In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 1. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that we did all sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
in Adam, before that we did fall. For none (say you) fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
but he that standeth: If we did all stand, then were
we all predestinate to life. And after: As we were all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in one man, that is in Adam,<note place="margin">In the 9 sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> so were we all created
in one estate, that is after the image of God. Of which
places it is plaine, that ye vnderstand, that in Adam we
were created to gods image, in Adam we were elected,
and in Adam we were placed in paradise, which you call
the blessed life. But here you change your tune, and say:
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:8568:195"/>
He hath made man like to his owne image in Christe
Iesu, in whom is no damnation. What should be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of this your sodein recantation, and alteration of
your sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I can not well coniecture, except it be this:
That because experience doth conuict you, that by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
we are all wounded to death, that therfor you wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
al should receaue life by Christe Iesus. And that doth
your master affirme in bold, and euident wordes, saing:
This God will all men to be saued, and that none shall
perish: and therfor hath he sent his So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, into the earth
whose iustice should superabound, where so euer sinne
hath abounded. This doth your master boldly affirme
(because he wrote to his practised souldiours) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
ye do in darcke wordes persuade. But how vaine be both
your persuasions, shall shortly appere, by examining the
scriptures by you both alledged. He groundeth his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
vpon the wordes of Paule plainely falsified, and of
Iohn the Euangelist, whom he applieth not rightly. If
you thinke me bolde that thus do accuse your master, &amp;
great angell, of falsifying gods scriptures, heare my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
and then iudge. He saith whersoeuer sinne hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
there hath grace super abounded. Which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
the Apostle doth not speake, but saith: where sinne
hath abounded: there hath grace more abounded, which
proposition is most true, as it is most comfortable. For
in Adam, Dauid, Peter, and in all other gods elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
did, and doth sinne abound, as the Apostle proueth
all to haue sinned, and to haue nede of gods glorie. But
in them did grace more abound, by the which they were
deliuered from the multitude of sinnes. But as your pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position
is not expressed by the Apostle, so it is most
fals, which is most easie to be proued. For in Cain, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao,
Iudas, Pilate, Annas, Caiphas, Herode, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did sinne abound, but in them did grace neuer so
abound, that they were absolued from that damnation,
which is pronounced against all vnfaithfull, in these
wordes: Who so euer shall not beleue, shalbe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:8568:195"/>
And therfor I say, that your masters vniuersall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is most fals, and he not onely a falsisier of the
plaine scriptures, but also a mainteiner of all impietie,
of all idolatrie, and wicked religion. For if it shalbe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
that where so euer sinne hath abounded there
shall grace more abound: then shall there be no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
betwene the condition of those that beleue in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
and those that be despisers of his Euangile offered.
Let the indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reader iudge, whether that you, or we
do now more smel of a careles, and a libertines life. But
this after.</p>
               <p>The wordes of the Euangelist are plainely wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
For he affirmeth not, that euery man is illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to saluation, nether yet that Christe is offered (as ye
wold shift) to euery man. But speaking of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie
of Christ Iesus, in whom was life, and by whom all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
were created, he saith: this was the true light, which
doth illuminate all men, that come into this world. In
which wordes he speaketh nothing of mannes redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
nether yet of any light, which man receaueth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for the same: But onely of that light which was
gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to man in his creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a part whereof (how small so
euer it be) doth yet remaine in man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that not by his
own power, but by the free gift of God, in whom we li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
are moued, and haue our being. And that the Euange
list speaketh nothing of the light of our redemption, is
euident by his owne wordes. For, before, and after he
doth witnes, that the light did shine in darckenes, but
darckenes did not apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, that is receaue, &amp; aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it: That he came amongest his owne, but his owne
did not receaue him, that such as did receaue him were
nether borne of blood, of the will of the flesh, nether yet
of the will of man, but of God. By which wordes it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that the Euangelist most euidently declareth, that
the light of saluation is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vnto all, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is
propre to those onely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are borne of God. He doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
teach, that all reason, and naturall vnderstanding
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:8568:196"/>
which man hath by his first birth, is so choked, so blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and extinguished, that man must nedes be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
before he can see the kingdome of God, that
Christ Iesus must nedes illuminate those, that be borne
blinde, orels (without remedy) they shall perish in their
blindnes. And thus I say the one text your master doth
falsely, and the other most viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wrest. But now to yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
wordes. <hi>God is slowe,</hi> (say you) <hi>to wrath, and ready to forgiue. He
will be intreated of all,<note place="margin">Answer</note> so that he biddeth all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerie where to repent,

                  <note place="margin">To y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 2</note> I will not question with you at
this time, why in this description of your true God, ye
make no mention of the Sonne, which is the eternall
word, and wisedom, of the eternall father, nether of the
holye Gost, who proceding from the father, is equall
with the eternall Sonne. But this is the one thing of w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
I did wonder in reading this your description, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye
omitte these properties, which God attributeth to him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self.
You do continually repete that God is slow to w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,
ready to forgiue, that he willeth all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be saued,
that he wilbe intreated of all men, that he willeth the
death of no creature. Which properties in God we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> sentences we acknowledge to be most true,
if they be rightely vnderstand. But why do ye not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
teach your scholers, that God is zelous, that he is a
consuming fire, that he punisheth the iniquitie of the
fathers, vpon the sonnes, vnto the third, and fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
and that his iustice can not suffer sinne to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skape
punishment, no not euen in his most derest chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Ye haue accused vs, that we deceaue the people,
teaching them a careles, and libertine life. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here againe, I require the indifferent reader, to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sider
which of our doctrines giueth most libertie: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you that affirme, that your true God wilbe intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

such as heape to them selues gods wrath, by abusing his

to his children (for they onely call in veritie, they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

True it is that Isai the Prophet, and Christe Iesus

That place of the Actes ye ether vnderstand not,<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> or els

and of the Apostle shall shortly appere, after I haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
a litle with you, how these your propositions do
agree with that which goeth before. Ye haue affirmed
that God is ready to mercie, and slow to wrath, in which
wordes you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> must execute wrath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the disobedient. And so
in the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God head ye cofesse mercy ad iustice.
But here you say that God will the death of no creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
but that he will all men to be saued. which last wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
being vnderstand as ye do vrge them, must destroy
the former nature of God, &amp; take awaye his iustice. For
if he absolutely will the death of no creature, then will
he no punishment to folowe sinne. And if he will no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
then willeth he his iustice to cease, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must one of the properties of his godlie nature
cease. Studie for an answere, to make your former wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and latter wordes better agree, orels ye wilbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that God for som respect willeth both
death and damnation to come vpon some creatures.
Further if God willeth all men to be saued, and to come

in ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and shalbe condemned as Christ Iesus doth
pronounce: then must it ether folow that gods will is
mutable, and so he vnconstant, and not at all times like
to him self, or els that he is not omnipotent. For if God
at the first creation of man, wold all men to be saued (as
ye alledge) then wold I know, when this will was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
After that man had offended, say you. Then yet ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
I obteined, that in gods will there was mutabilitie.
For after sinne he wold, and by his sentence pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that Adam, and his posteritie should suffer the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death, yea and that the sede of the serpent should
haue the head broken downe, by the which is ment the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:8568:198"/>
spirituall death, which nether of both (as you affirme)
did God will before. If you reply gods will towardes the
saluation of all mankind, did remaine the same after
sinne, which was before: for a generall promes of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was made, by the womans sede that was promised.</p>
               <p>I haue before plainely proued,<note place="margin">Answer</note> that difference most
manifest betwext y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> two sedes was made in that promes.
But admitting that the promes had bene generall, &amp; so
that the will of God this day remaineth the same w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
ye alledge it to be: to witt, that he willeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death
of no sinner, but that he willeth al men to be saued. Can
you deny, but that a separation, and diuision of the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
from the goates, of the elect from the reprobate,
shalbe made at the glorious commi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord Iesus?
Shall not these most ioyfull wordes be said vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
shall stand vpon the right hand: Come ye the blessed of
my father, possesse the kingdome which was prepared
for you from the beginning? And shall not this most
fearefull sentence be pronounced, and executed against
the other? Depart ye cursed, go to the fire prepared for
the deuill, and for his angels? Shall the Sonne of God in
pronouncing sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, do any thing that day repugning
to the will of his heauenly Father? I think you will not
so affirme. Then if gods will in the day of iudgement
shalbe that many shalbe adiudged to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perpetual,
and his will in the creation of man was, and this day yet
remaineth, that all men shalbe saued, then of necessitie
it doth folow that gods will shall change. If you say that
death, and damnation cometh not by gods will, but by
the sinne, and vnbelief of man, you haue releued your
self nothing. for if death be one thing, and life be an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
damnation one thing, and saluation an other. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
if God this day will all men to be saued, and so to haue
life, and yet that day he shall will many to be damned
to torment perpetuall (what causes so euer you alledge)
I shall obteine one of two, to witte, that ether gods will
is, and may be mutable, orels that there is a power su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:8568:199"/>
to his maiestie, and godly will. For if willingly
he shall damne those, whom before he wold, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to saue, then is his will, and determination
changed. And if he shall damne those vnwillingly, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
willingly he wold haue saued, then is he not omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Consider now vpon whom falleth the snowe, and
who do cast them selues in greatest absurdities. Now it
resteth to declare how violently ye wrest the wordes of
the Prophet, &amp; of the Apostle. The Prophete speaking
in the personne of God, saith, I will not the death of a
sinner, but rather that he conuert, and liue. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
affirmeth that God will all men to be saued and
to come to the knowledge of the trueth. Hereupon ye
conclude, God will the death of no creature, this is your
first violence, which you do to the text. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

the Prophet, for he saith not, I will the death of no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

say, that this is done against gods will? we be taught
the contrarie by his owne mouth. If you correcting
your generalitie shall say, that you meane onely that
God will the death of no man. And I feare not yet to
ioyne with you, and against you to affirme: that God
hath willed, doth will, and shall will the death of some
men. The holy Gost speaking of the sonnes of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
the high Priest,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 2</note> saith: But they did not heare the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of their Father, because the Lord wold kil them. And
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:8568:199"/>
Moises saith, Sihon king of Hesbon wold not suffer vs
to passe through his cuntrie,<note place="margin">Deu. 2</note> for the Lord thy God did
harden his minde, and strengthen his heart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shoule
giue him into thy handes. How often doth Moses, &amp; Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua
declare vnto the people, that God wolde kill, roote
oute and destroye those wicked nations from besore the
face of his people? And were all those kinges, whom Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua
did kill, killed against gods will? The holy Gost af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the contrarie: For it is written, the Lord did
trouble them before Israel, and he did strike them with
a great slaughter. And while that they did flee before
the Israelites, and were in the descense of Bethoron,
the Lord cast downe vpon them from heauen greate
stones, and many more perished by the haile stones, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
were slaine with the swerd of the children of Israel. If
the destruction, slaughter, &amp; death of these wicked men,
and of the greate host of Senacherib was not the will of
God, I can not tell how man shalbe assured of his will.
For the plaine word did before promise, that the Lord
should destroye them, and the fact doth witnes the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie,
and perfourmance of his will. and the same thing
doth God this day, &amp; shall do to the ende of the world,
when he shall adiudge the reprobate, (as before is said)
to the death perpetuall: and that not against his will,
but willingly, for the manifestation of his iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and declaration of his owne glorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say that your prosition (saying, God willeth the
death of no creature) is manifestly fals, as it that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth
to gods iustice,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>e. 18</note> and to his euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t scriptures. The
minde of the Prophetes was to stirre such as had decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from God, to returne vnto him by true repentance.
And because their iniquities were so many, &amp; offenses
so greate, that iustly they might haue despaired of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
mercie, and grace: therefor doth the Prophet
for the better assurance of those that should repent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that God deliteth not, nether willeth the death
of the wicked. But of which wicked? of him no doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:8568:200"/>
that truely shoulde repent, in his death did not, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shal God delyte. But he deliteth to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a God,
that sheweth mercye grace, and fauor to such, as vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
call for the same, how greuous so euer their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
offenses haue bene. But such as continue obstinate
in their impietie, haue no portion of these promises.
For them will God kill, them will he destroye, and them
will he thrust by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of his word in to the firewhich
neuer shalbe quenched. The Apostle in these wordes:
God willeth all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be saued, &amp; to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the trueth speaketh not of euery man, and of
euery particulare persone. But of all men in generall,
that is to say, of men of all estates, all conditions, all
realmes, and all ages. For as in Christe Iesus there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iew, nor Gentile, nether man, nor woman, free man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

nor seruant, but all are one in him, so can no estate, no
condition of man, no realme, nor no age be proued so
wicked, and so corrupt, but out of the like hath God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
some to the participation of his light, and to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and life by Christe Iesus. and that this is the very
naturall meaning of the holy Gost, the tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it selfe
doth witnes. For the Apostle immediatly before wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
praiers, and supplications to be made for all men,
for Kinges, and for all that were placed in authoritie.
And because that the Church was chiefely oppressed by
such, this doubte might haue risen: Are we then bound
to pray for those that are expresse, and coniured enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
against God? You are, saith the Apostle: for that is
good, and acceptable before God our Sauior, who will all
men to be saued. That is, God willeth you to pray for
your persecuters, that their eyes may be opened, and
they conuerted to the liuing God: who no doubt will
saue some of all estates, of all conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of
men. For the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are giuen to Christe Iesus by inhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritance:
Kinges shalbe the feders of the Church: Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
shalbe nurses: And in his holy temple, shall all sing
praise. If this interpretation (which we doubt not to be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:8568:200"/>
the verie meaning of the holy Gost, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not satisfie you.
Then will I aske of you. If God will men otherwise to
be saued then by Christe Iesus? or as the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
by comming to the knowledge of the veritie?
Plaine it is, that by the wordes of the Apostle ye ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
none otherwise. For as he saith God will all men
to be saued, so doth he adde, and willeth all men to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to the knowledge of the veritie. Which word (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth)
albeit it be not expressedly repeted in the second
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, yet of necessitie, it must be vnderstand, as those
that be but meanly sene in the greke, or latine tongue
do euidently see. Then if I shall sufficiently proue,
that God willeth not all men, to come to the knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of the veritie, in such sort, as the Apostle meaneth,
shall it not infallablye folow, that God will not all men
to be saued, in such sense as you vnderstand. That God
willeth not all men to come to the knowledge of that
veritie, by the which man is verely made free from the
bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of sathan, is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not onely by those whom we
do see walke in darknes, and ignorance, but also by the
manifest srriptures of God. who called Abraham, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to him, and to his sede the promes, of saluation,
saying: I will be thy God, and the God of thy sede after
thee which promes he kept secrete many ages from the
rest of the world. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did notifie his law vnto Israel,
and when Moses did repete the same, he said: Behold I
haue laid before you this day life,<note place="margin">Deu. 30</note> and death, benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and execration, chose therefore life, that thou, and
thy sede may liue. If God wold that all men, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly should come to the same knowledge,
why were not the lawes, statutes, and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of God
made manifest to others, as they were to Israel? And if
you answer that so they were. the holy Gost shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uict

to all nations, and that his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes he had not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
nor made knowen vnto them. But if that plaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision

Heare yet the sentence of our Master Christ Iesus, who
saith to his disciples: To you it is giuen to vnderstand

Of the other sort, it is said: All that see me ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

then must we be compelled to say, that no true fearer of
God remayned in Ierusalem, when the Prophetes did
preach, but that all were blood thirstie, all auaricious, all
idolaters, and all dumme dogges: the contrarie wherof
is euidently declared. For Isai had the children whom
the Lord had giuen vnto him, who albeit they were
holden as monsters amonge men yet, did they patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
abide the Lord. Ieremie had Baruch his faithfull,

feared the Lord, was fauourable to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,
and therefore saued he his soule for a praye, and
was deliuered from that day of vengeance. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
these vniuersall sentences must also be restrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and kept within their own boundes,<note place="margin">2. Ti. 4</note> like as these:
All haue left me, all seke the thinges, that apperteine
vnto them selues, and not those thinges that be of God.
Which sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces (except they be restreined) we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the dearest children of God, who in Paules daies

examples of the one sorte, &amp; of the other I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
to lette the simple vnderstand, that such generall
sentences of necessitie, must be so restreined, that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
may be kept betwext the elect, and the reprobate.
For els we shall do nothing in explaning scriptures, but
confound light, with darcknes. For if the wordes of our

shalbe so generally vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that no exception be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
then of necessitie it is, that all men, and euery
persone shall come to the true knowledge of Christe
Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for of that knowledge doth he speake in that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
But the contrarie thereof is moste euident, euen by

him nether can he sinne, because he is borne of God. Of
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wordes it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be two sortes of sinners, the
one be they who mourne, lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and bewaile their owne
wretchednes, and miserie vnfainedly before God, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
not onely that their hole nature is sinfull, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
but also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dailie they so offend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maiestie of their
God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> most iustly they deserue the tormentes of hell, if
Christes iustice, &amp; Christes mediation (w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> by faith they
embrase) should not deliuer them from the wrath to co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me.
To these is not sinne imputed. for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
purgeth them from all sinne, his aduocation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession,
maketh to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an enterance to the throne of
their fathers grace. To the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is giuen the spirit of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> from time, to time, as it reueleth their sinnes
so doth it mortifie, &amp; purge the same. Not that euer in
this life gods elect hath bene, are, or shalbe so cleane
purged from sinne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the flesh lusteth not against the spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit,
as some times affirmed the Pellagians, &amp; those that
then were called Cathari, that is cleane purged, and now
also do the Anabaptistes renew the same most pestilent
error: by the which Christ Iesus his iustice, his office,
and perpetuall mediation, is vtterly destroyed: in such
sort I saye are not gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purged in this life, that
nether they fele sinne, nether yet the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; entise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
of the same. But they are so purged y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sinne raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:8568:203"/>
not in their mortall bodies. for the sede of God,
which is the vertue power, efficacie, and operation of his
holie spirite suffereth them not to delyte in sinne: but
as they are first called from darcknes to light &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
bondage of sathan, to the libertie of gods children, so
when they sinne (as there is none that sinneth not) they
are called againe by true repentance to their former so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
and felowship with Christe Iesus. The death of
such sinners did God neuer will, nether yet can he will.
for from all eternitie they were his elect childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom
he gaue to his deare Sonne, to be his enherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whom
the Sonne receaued into his protection, and sauegard,
to whome he hath manifested, and to the ende, shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
him selfe, and the louing kindes of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

thirsting to a further, and more perfect iustice then
they find within them selues by reason of their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
The death I say of those sinners God will not, but
he will that they repent, and liue. The Apostle saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
saith:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3</note> The Lord that hath promised, is not slow, but
he is long suffering toward vs, while that he will none
to perish, but will receaue all to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The Apostle
here meaneth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al, without exception, shalbe recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to life by true repentance, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the cause why God
so long deferreth (as it were) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extreme iudgement, is, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
the electnomber of gods children may be complete, (as
answere was giuen to those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cried vnder the aulter to
be reuenged vpon the tyrannes that dwell on the earth)
of these his elect children, God will none to perish, as
before is said. But there is an nother sort of sinners far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
different from these. For nether are they displeased
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, nether yet hate they iniquitie, but against
gods expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes furiously they runne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
Cain to murther the innocent, with Pharao to oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the people of God, with Iudas to betray the knowen,
and professed veritie: and finally so delyte they in all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:8568:204"/>
&amp; impietie, that they can not repent. The eyes of
such be blinded, their heartes are hardened, they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer in to a reprobate minde. And for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not
Christe Iesus pray, and therefore they can do nothing
but headlonges runne from euill to worse, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
(to whose tyranny they are committed) doth driue
them, till finally they come to perdition: which ende
was appointed vnto them not against gods will, but by
his will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mmutable in his eternall counsell. For no les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

               <p>It may seme by the description of these your two
goddes (for nether of both, as ye describe them, is the
true liuing, &amp; eternall God) that ye studie to renew the
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable error of the Manichies, who imagined two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, the one of all goodnes, and of all good creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
the other of all iniquitie, and of wicked creatures:
affirming further that the good, and the mercifull God
was ouercome for a time, by him that was wicked, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
And because that the plaine scriptures did confute
these blasphem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, therefor did they denie the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Moises, and the certentie of all other scriptures
that made any thing against their error. If manifestly
ye did take vpon you the defense of those your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as that ye do of Pellagius, of Donatus, and of the
Papistes (for of all these adulterous fathers, ye be adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
children) then wolde I from Augustine (whom
God stirred vp no doubte in the daies of darckenes
most learnedly, and most plainely by infallible scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
to cofute those heresies) from him, I say I might ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
artilerie all ready prepared, able inough to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
your buildinges, and munitions, appere they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so strong. But because (as before I haue said) my pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose
is not to burden you further, then you do confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se:
I onely admonish the reader to be ware of such pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,
as beginne to call the trueth of God reueled in
his holy word, in doubt, and do persuade men to credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
dreames, and reuelations, how soeuer they appere to
repugne to that which is reueled in the word. Of such
men I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oght Christes flock to take hede, as also of
those who make of eguall authoritie such bookes, as
yet the holy Gost hath neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to the Church
of Christe, with these that are written by Moises, the
Prophetes, the Euangelistes, and Apostles, and that by
inspiration of the holy Gost. That some of you be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with this most pestilent poison, I am able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
by mo argumentes then one. Being at London the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:8568:205"/>
the winter before the death of king Edward, one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of
your faction required secrete communication of me,
in which after that earnestly he had required of me clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>senes,
and fidelitie, because that the maters that he had
to communicate with me, were so weightie, and of such
importance, as sythence the daies of the Apostles, the
like was neuer opened vnto man. In the ende, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wordes (which I nether gladly heard, nether yet will
now write) he gaue me a boke, written (as he said) by
God, euen as well as was any of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelistes. This his
booke he adiured me (as it were) to reade, and required
to haue my iudgement of it. My answer was, that at his
request I wold reade it, so that he wold be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with me of the chiefe pointes in the same contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but to pronounce sentence, or iudgement, that
could I not vsurpe, being but one man farre inferior to
many of my brethern, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachers of gods word in that
realme. Alwaies he vrged me to reade his booke. And I
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering what mysteries it should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine, called to me
a faithfull brother, who then (as pleased God) was present
with me, named He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry Farrour marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to whom I ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
the mater by whose counsell, and in whose presence
I beganne to reade his boke. The first proposition whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof
was: God made not the world, nether yet the wicked
creatures, in the same conteined, but they had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
from a nother, that is from the deuill, who is
called the Prince of the world. which proposition plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
repugning, to gods word, I did impugne, and bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
to declare vnto him, for what cause Sathan had that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to be called the Prince of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. But he vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
ether to reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and dispute, ether yet to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in any point that there was written, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nded me
to reade forward, &amp; to beleue, howbeit I did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
To whom, when I had gentilly said: Can any reaso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nable
man will me to beleue thinges directly fighting
against gods veritie, and plaine word reueled? Tusch
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:8568:205"/>
said he, for your written word, we haue as good, and as
sure a word, and veritie, that teacheth vs this doctrine,
as ye haue for you, and your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I did mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
sharpely answere saing: ye deserue the death, as a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
person, and denier of God, if ye preferre any
word to that which the holy Gost hath vttered in his
plaine scriptures. At which wordes he toke pepper in
nose, and snatching his boke furth of my hand depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after he had thus spoken: I will goo to the ende of
the world, but I will haue my boke confirmed, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
with better learned men then you be. In me I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse
there was greate neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that nether did reteine
his boke, nether yet did present him to the Magistrate.
But yet this argument I haue, that your faction is not
altogether cleane from the heresie of the Manichies. I
could name, and point forth others, who labour in the
same disease: but so long as their venom doth remaine
secrete, within them selues, I am purposed to spare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you accuse vs to be vnmercifull, proud, ambi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious,
and enuious children, bloody persecuters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for their conscience sake, euil speakers, impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

you plenteonsly of your father. To the which I
briefely answere, that because we haue a iust iudge, who
shall reuele the secretes of all heartes, we will rather su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine
to be of you, vniustly accused, then become
proud braggers of our owne iustice, as you be, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> sinne is

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:8568:206"/>
in Heluetia, and now of latter yeres in Geneua. and so
long hath this doctrine bene taught of some, and hath
bene beleued of many, but what crueltie, what murther
or what sedition, can iustly be laid to the charge of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
that most constantly haue taught and mainteined y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
same? let the world conuict them. And how farre their
life abhorreth from pride, ambition, and filthines hath
God witnessed, and to this daye doth witnes, how so euer
Sathan doth blinde your eyes. But sone after that God
had sowen his good sede, began the deuill to sowe the
cockell, and darnell, I meane the pestilent secte of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes,
whose frutes did sodeinly appere to the great
slander of Christes Euangill, and to the grief of many

extolled openly before the assemblie. And when by

sworne to ayde him, in slaying the wicked Princes,

came to Milhusium a towne of Turingia. For when he

by whose helpe he obteined the office of teaching. And
because the magistrates lyked him not, he raised a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult

created. This was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of trouble. after these
thinges the townesmen cast out the monkes, and inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their houses, wherof the chiefest and richest fell to
Muncers lotte, who now played both the preacher, and
the magistrate. For iudgement (said he) should be giue

broght furth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, in hope of a praye, &amp; of more

was of all his counsell, whose name was Phifer. this man
attributed much to dreames, &amp; visions of the night: and
amongest other thinges he chanced to boast, that he saw
in his slepe in a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stable a meruelous great multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of mise &amp; that he did driue them all away. By which
dreame he vnderstode, that God commanded him to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
his armour, and go furth with an armie to destroy
all the nobilitie. But Muncer althugh he preached ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
to the people, yet was he some what colder,
nether listed he to aduenture the prosperous estate, that
he was in alredy, before al they that were about him we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in armour. And to bring the mater more easilie to
passe, he sent leters to the workeme that digged for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles
in the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie of Mansfeld, earnestly admonishing
them to fall vpon the Princes, without doubting of the
mater, for it should come to passe that they which were
in a readines in Franconia shall come nerer to Turin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.
In the meane time Phifer that loued not to linger
long in any mater, went out with his men, and destroied
the cuntrie of Isfeld adiacent vnto them, he spoiled the
Castels and temples, destroyed many of the nobles,
and toke certen of them prisoners, whom he bound in
chaines. After he returned home with a greate praye. W<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hose
prosperous successe encouraged greatly the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of the common people, especially because the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis

At that same time died Friderike Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon
without issue (for he liued a sole life) whose succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor

were in doing, Albert the countie of Mansfeld gathered
(with all expedition) a company of horsemen, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
comming vpon them, he slew 300, wherwith they
being feared, durst procede no further, but fled to Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusium,
where they taried waiting for a greater armie.
wherby onely their assaute was deferred. In the time of
this delay the Princes that were there about, gathered
horsemen, to the number of a fiftene hundred, but no

of Saxon, Ihon Elector, George his cosin germane, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippe
Lantgraue of Hesse, and Henri Duke of Brunswic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.
The bowres (that is husband men) remained vpon a

They offer foolish, and fond conditions to the intent
to spoile you of yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> armour. And now, it is manifest to
you all, that I began this dede, but not of any priuate au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie
of my own (nether did I euer go about such a

being so, it becometh both me, and you to obey, &amp; not

once to moue out of this place, wherin God hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self hath
sette vs, who in times past commanded Abraham to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his sonne, whose precept without resistance Abraham
obeied, albeit he was ignorant what should come of it.
And therfor did God both preserue his sonne, and also
highly rewarded his faith. in like maner oght we (which
are in the same state) to perseuere, committi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the issue
vnto God. for withoute doubt, all thinges shalbe euen as
we wold haue it. Ye your selues shall behold the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
helpe of God, and who so euer is our ennemie, him
shall we suppresse on euery side. Nether is it in one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the scripture onely, where God promiseth succour
to the afflicted, &amp; to destroye the wicked. This promes
most assuredly apperteineth vnto vs. for we are poore,
and in miserie, &amp; because we desire to reteine and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the knowledge of God, there is no doubte, but that
we shall ouercome, and be conquerors. On the other si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

nether haue they any care of you at all, but deuoure all
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goodes, and spend them most wickedly. In that peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
which sometime God chose peculiarly vnto him
self, he ordeined that kinges should not spend any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
in waste, yea he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that they should loke di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligently
in the boke of the lawes, which he had giuen
them. But what do our tyrannes? or how are they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied?
They think the common welth is no part of their
charge: they know nothing of poore mens causes, they
care not for iustice, they suffer the wayes to be besette
with theues, they punish not robbers, nether any other
vice, they helpe not the widdow, nether yet the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
They loke not to the good education of youth. As
for the honoring of gods Name, they do not onely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues neglect it, but also they hinder it Thus onely
they applie to draw all mens goodes to them selues:
and therfore do they euery day deuise new wayes to

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:8568:209"/>
vpon defending or mainteining of peace, but that
(being enriched aboue measure) they may abound in al
kinde of riotte, and pride. It is to manifest how greate tu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>multes,
and warres they raise for very light, and foolish
causes: whereby all that remaineth to the poore people
is lost, and destroied. Behold these are the excellent
vertues, and policies of your noble princes, wherin they
exercise them selues. Therfor let none think, that God
will suffer those thinges any longer, but rather persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
him self assuredly, that as God did once destroye the
Cananites, so will he now also these. For thogh all these
thinges, which I haue recited before, were tollerable,
thinck you that they shall escape vnpunished for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and mainteining that most execrable impietie of
the popish preachers? Who is ignorant how greate ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
is in the bying, &amp; selling of Masses? I will say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the rest. Surely as Christ draue out the byers, &amp;
sellers, out of the church, so shall he now also roote out

But furthermore, they adde yet much more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

encreased through all Germanie, both farre, and wide.
Luther and many other learned men, earnestly with sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

his spirite, he returned after certen monethes. But they
(to whom his returne was greuous) determined to let
his preaching, but it was in vaine, the people bare him
such fauour. Shortly after it came to passe, that certeine
of the chief citezens receaued him into the towne, and
when the church dores were shutte against him, they
made him a pulpet in the church porch. And becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
the number of the citizens, and other hearers encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
daily, they desired of the Papistes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that one of the
temples might be opened vnto him, which if they
wold not grant, they wold make away in by violence.
Not long after (by the counsell of the chiefest of the
people, he sent letters to the cuntrie of Hesse, which was

desiring that certeine good, and lerned men,

them selues, how they might first ouercome the
clergie, by the which meanes the Gospell might with
more frute be taught. And to bring this to passe, this
waye was thoght most conuenient. They wrote out the
errors of the Papistes in thirtie articles, and deliuered
them to the counsell, offering them selues to suffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

to come before them, and they shewed vnto them,
those chief pointes of their errors. And when conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
they alledged for them selues their doctrine to
be pure, and agreable to the word of God, and the
preachers denied the same, and that they wold proue,
vnder the paine of losing their heades: It was asked of
them, whether that they wold by the word of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute

wordes they answered: That they had nothing to defend
them selues with all: and wher as vntill that time, they
had said that their ordinances, and maners were good,
and lawfull, they confessed their so saing to be but by
by opinion and ignorance. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Senate seing them
to be conuict, of fals doctrine, and errors, hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and the people, there was appointed to euery one of the
preachers a seuerall temple, to preache in. The Papistes
were greued therwith, but specially the canons of the
Cathedrall church, which for the most part, were genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

the bishop of that Citie. And after that they had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seled

The Bishop was a countie, and called Francis valdock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and his predecessor was named Friderick, brother to
the Arch bishop of Collen. This Bishop (ether because

before. They broght all the captiues into the Citie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
whom were the chief prelates, and diuers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
nobilitie. Of these the Magistrates asked, what their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was, and whither they were minded to hinder the
preaching of the Gospell any more: They frely answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that they wold do their diligence, that the Gospell
might florish. And by the occasion of this answer there
was a pactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made betwene them. The copie wherof, the
magistrates sent to the Lantgraue, desiring him, that he
wold assist them, in the maintenance of the Gospell, and
their common welth, Then sent he vnto them, certen
of his seruantes, through whose comming vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
peace was made, and being reconciled, and the grief tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

impieties, and superstitions, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> were in religion might
be taken awaye: That in the cathedrall church, nothing
should be changed, and that the citizens should not thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
that to apperteine any thing at all vnto them. This
forme of peace in writing was signed by the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgraue,
by the Bishop, and his adherentes, with the noble men,
and all the people the 14. of Februarie the yere of our

there came vnto Monster a botcher of garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, named
Iohn Leiden borne in Holland, which was a vehement

with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> preachers, he priuely asked of them, whether
they thoght, that it were mete to baptise children or no:
and when they answered yea, he as one vtterly of the

them from being corrupt with heresies, and chiefly
from the opinion of the Anabaptistes, which now priue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
do crepe in among them, and gather them selues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

being made companion with Rotman did publikely

it were an other steppe forward in this new kinde of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
This came to pas that the Anabaptistes taught
through all the Citie, althogh it were in priuate houses,
&amp; secretely, and none was receaued of them, except they,
that were of their secte. Further more there was none y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
made them selues knowen to be the authors of this opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion,
nor they did not teach but by night, and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were at their rest: which time they wroght their
mysteries but the thing being knowen, and diuers of
the citizens being greued at it, saying that it was a great
shame that such new doctrine should be sowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in secret,
and by night. It came to passe that by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the rulers the captaines of them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to auoyde the Citie, which going out at one ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
they came in againe at an other, saying, that they
had a commandement from God, that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
there, and applie their maters. This thing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the rulers not a litle, and caused no smal wonder in
the towne. Therfor for the auoiding of greater tumult,
and danger, the magistrates gaue in commandement,
as well to the anabaptistes, as to the preachers of the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:8568:213"/>
Gospell, that they should appere before them in the
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell house, with certen other lerned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bewrayed his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which vntill that time he
had concealed, and condemned the baptisme of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
as a thing wicked, and abominable. But one named
Herman Bushe (chiefly) so defended the contrarie parte,
that the Anabaptistes were commanded to departe out
of the Citie, out of hand. And when they did all edge for
them selues that they should not quietly passe through
the Bishoppes land, the Senate obteined for them a safe
conduite, and gaue them wherwith all to bear their
charges. But they hauing long before determined not
to depart from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to any other place (secretly retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to their companions) kept them selues closely for
a time. The magistrates in the meane ceason, before
that they came forthe of their corners againe, caused all
the churche dores to be shut, one onely excepted. For
it was to be feared, lest that the Anabaptistes, (who daily
increased accompanied with their teachers) should dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the preachers of the Gospell out of their temples. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this in the moneth of Nouember the Lantgraue at
the request of the Rulers of the Citie sent two preachers
vnto them, Theoderik Fabritius, and Iohn Melsinger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
but Melsinger seing the trouble, and fearing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
returned home againe. The other with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, exhorted the citizens, that they should beware
of the doctrine of the Anabaptistes, in this wise he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to do his indeuour, vntill that the Anabaptistes,
getting the vpperhand, did driue the other out of the
Citie, as afterward shalbe declared. And to make all sure,
he wrote in a brief somme the effect of the trew doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and ecclesiasticall administration, the counsell and
people appointing the same. Then by the counsel of
the magistrates one Peter wirta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began againe to preach,
but he had not preached long, yer the Anabaptistes
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:8568:214"/>
stirred vp by Rotman, droue him away. who being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
fierce then before, prouoked Fabritius, and others
to disputation, the senate agreing thereunto, but vnder
this condition that the disputation shoulde be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon the word of God, and other writings agreable
vnto the same. in the presence of some godly learned
men, which should be as it were arbitrers, who hearing,
and trying the sentences, and argumentes indifferently
on bothe sides, might giue iudgement: and looke what

of all. By which meanes discorde being taken away, the
peace of the Church might be restored. This Codition
Rotman, and his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did refuse. when they cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftely
auoyded to be bewrayed, they beganne openly to
be contemned of the common people. But to wipe
awaye this foule blotte, they finde out an other way,
much more compendious. One of them (as if he were
inspired with the holy Gost) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there was a common tumult, and as many, as were
rebaptised, cried after the same maner, as did the first:
many fearing the wrath of God, which they so threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to fall vpon them (deceaued of verie simplicitie,
which otherwise were good men) obeied them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did the same for sauing of their goods. For after
that the Anabaptistes had gotten the vpper had of their

1534. Thus one partie growing weake by their
departing, the Anabaptistes chose new Magistrates, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as were of their owne opinion: They made counse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
also, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whome was Knipperdoling. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they inuaded the temple of sainct Maurice in the
suburbes, and they burnt it withall the houses about it
they spoiled all the temples about it also, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the great church within. This done, they began
to runne on heapes about the citie, in the stretes, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
first: Repent: and immediatly after they cryed,
Hie you hence, ye wicked persones, except ye list to
adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture your liues. At the same time they ranne about
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:8568:215"/>
the Citie in harnes, and chased out of the Citie all such
as were not of their secte, without any regard of age, or
kinde, after such a sorte that in this turmoil, and hastie
flight, many women were deliuered before their time,
and immediatly they toke the goods of those whome
they had chased out. And althogh that this chanced
the day before the bishope laide siege to the Citie, yet
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding when certaine of the companie of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that fled, fell into the handes of the bishop, they were
taken as ennemies, of which companie some were put
to death, among whome were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one or two preachers
of the Gospell. And when Peter wirtam, of whome we
spake before, was in danger of his life, he was saued
through the sute of the Lantgraue. Now the residue of
the townes men moued thereby, which were good men,
beholding present da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nger to fal vpon them, thogh they
wold forsake the Citie, ful fore against their willes (and
as it were constrained) they taried still. At y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time their
chief Prophet (for that name they vsurped) named Iohn
Mathew commanded, that euery one which had any
gold, siluer, or mouable goods, they should bring it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
to be in common, vnder paine of heading. And to
this vse there was a publike house ordeined. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was greatly astonished with this sharpe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
yet notwitsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they obeid it. And it was not

if any deceat was vsed. And they were not onely
content thus to do with their owne goods, but also they
vsed the gods of others whome they had driuen out, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the like maner. After this the same Prophet gaue in
commandement, that none should haue, or kepe to him
self any boke, sauing the Bible, and that all other should
be broght forthe, to be rased, and destro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he said, was giuen him from aboue vpon

mockage against those that called them selues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes.
This being knowen, they called the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
together, and commanded them to come in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and streight way they accused the man, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him to death. With this the people was greuously
moued, and striken with feare. The chief prophet (a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
named) toke the poore man, which being downe on
the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, he stroke him with a speare, without giuing
him his deathes wounde, althogh he ranne vpon him
with a greate violence. Then he commanded him to
be caried into an other place, and taking a yong mans
halfe hake that stode by him, he shotte him through,
lying on the ground. And because that yet he died not
out of hand, he said, that it was shewed to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
that the time of his death was not yet come, and
that God wold pardon him of his offense. But the poore
man within feaw dayes after dyed. When the prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
heard of his death, he toke a long speare, and ran with
it about the Citie, crying that God the father had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to driue the enemie out of the Citie. And
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came neare vnto the campe, a certeine soldiour
slew him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And notwithstanding that this was the secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
time of bewraying of their falshode, yet the residue
of his felow prophetes had so bewitched the people,
and they so set out the mater vnto them, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people toke the mater verie heauily, and said, that
surely some greate plague should fall vpon them, for
the taking away of so notable a man. But the next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be of a good courage: for (said he) it was lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
me that he shoulde dye after that maner, and that
I should take his wife in mariage. Two dayes before
Ester they ranne into the temples, and rang all the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
at once. Within few dayes after Knipperdoling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those which were set aloft should be broght

downe, and the other should be exalted, from a vile, and
base estate. After that he commanded that all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
should be cast downe, affirming with muche graui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie,
that commandement to haue come from God. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
the thing was obeied, and that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
celestial (as he termed it) with all dilige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. About the same time, the fore named Iohn
Leiden toke the sworde that serued for the heading of
the offenders, and gaue it to Knipperdoling, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
him hangman, for so (said he) it was determined of
God, that he which was one of the chiefe Ruelars befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
and of the counsel should now be in the lowest place,
and be made hangman. Knipperdoling was nothing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with the mater, but toke the office thankfully
vpon him. Now when the bishoppe had certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
borne all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge of the siege him selfe alone,
Hermannus the Archbishop of Collen, and Iohn Duke
of Cleue sent him for ayde, money, and gunnes with a
certeine companie of horsemen, and footemen. The
Archbishop of Collen him selfe came also to the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
to sit in counsel with them, and not long after, the
citie was besieged, in sondrie places. And when there
was no hope to winne it by force, they made 7. rampers
about the citie, to kepe it from victuales, furnishing
them with footemen, and horsemen, which should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
there all winter. The bishop of Monster (for the
maintenannce of the siege, and warre against the towne)
required ayde of the Princes about the Rhine, as the
next neighbours, and to whome the mater also did be
long: for which cause they gathered them selues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

1534. After this vnprofitable beseging of the citie: Iohn
Leiden fell into a slepe, and dreamed the space of thre
daies, and when he awaked, he spake neuer a worde, but
onely required, paper to be brought vnto him, in
which he wrote 12. mennes names, among whome were
certeine of noble birth, which 12 should rule as chiefe

heades, as it was among the Israelites: this he said, was
the will of the heanenlie father. When as by these
twelue there was a way made for him to be king, he put
forthe certeine articles vnto the preachers, and wil led
them, that if they could, they should confute them by
Gods worde, or els he wolde publish them vnto the mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude,
and so of them they shoudle be alowed, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
The somme of them was this, that a man was
not bounde to one wife onely, and it was lawful for any
man to haue as many wiues as he wolde. But when the
preachers withstode this sentence, he called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the

were all come thither, he put of his cloke, and threw it
on the ground, and with it the new testament: by those
(as it were) signes, he testified, and sware, that article
which he had put forthe was reueled to him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,

that liked not their doings (asigne being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through
the Citie) they called all the louers of the Gospel into

commonn people heard of, they armed them selues,
and reskewed those, that were taken, killing with
great torment, to the number of fiftie persones: for they
tied them to trees, and postes, and so shot them through.
For the greate prophet cried, that all those that wold
do acceptable seruice to God: should throw the first dart
others were killed after another maner. The 24. of Iune

a goldsmith. This prophet called the people into the
market place, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there he said vnto them, that it was the
commandement, and will of the heauenly father that
Iohn Leide should be the Emperour of the whole earth,
and that he going forthe with a mighty armie, should
kill all the Princes, and kinges of the earth, shewing
mercie onely to the common people (that is to saye, all
those that loue righteousnes) and that he should posses
the seate of his father Dauid, vntil the father should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him. For, said he, the wicked being
put downe, the godly shal here reigne in this life. And
when he had published these things openly, by and by,
Iohn Leiden fell vpon his knees, and holding vp his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
vnto heauen, said, It was manie daies ago (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern)
that I did know of this, but I wolde not declare
it, and now God hath vttered it vnto an other, that ye
might the better credite it. This man obteining the
kingdome by this craft, immediatly he put out of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
the forenamed 12. And after the maner of kings, he
chose vnto him noble men, and commanded that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
should be 2. crow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the which he wold openly heare all mennes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that had any thing to put forthe vnto him. So often
as he came abrode, he was accompanied with his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and noblemen of his court, next vnto him folowed
2. yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on horse backe, and he on the right hand ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
a crown, and the bible, the other on the left hand, a
drawen sworde. The pompe of his chiefe wife (for he
had mo at that time) was after the same maner. In the
market place there was an high throne made for him,
couered with cloth of gold. The actions and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
that were brought before him, for the most part were
of mariages, and diuorcementes, which then were most
frequent, and after such, a maner, that not a few
which had before liued togethers a long time, were

then diuorsed. It came to passe, that on a certeine day as
the people were in the market place verie thicke, and
thronging together to heare, Behold, Knipperdoling,
leaped vp, and creping vpon the heades of the people
with his handes, and fete (for they stode so thicke) he
breathed in the mouth of euerie one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying to
one, after another, The father hathe sanctified thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the holy spirit. An other daye he leading the dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
before the king, said, thus was I wont to do with my
harlot, but now the father hathe commanded that I
should do the same before the king. But because he
did it so often, and neuer ended, the king being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
went his way. Then hastily he went into the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and behaued him selfe like a king. But the king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

in the meane while, thrust him out, and caused

acte that he had done. After supper, those 28. preachers
were sent forthe alitle before night. And besides for the
finding of them, there was giuen to each of them a pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of golde, with a charge, that wheresoeuer their doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
was not receaued, they should leaue those pieces, in a

witnes against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their destruction, and euerlasting
damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they had refused peace, and a doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
so wholesome. When they came to the places appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
vnto them, they cried in the townes that men should
repent, orels they should perish out of hand. They
spred their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes vpon the ground, before, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and cast vpon them their pieces of golde, which
they had receaued, affirming, that they were sent of the
father to bring them peace, which if they wold receaue,
then they willed them to put all their goods in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
and if they refused, then, by this signe, and (as it
were) a marke, they wold witnes their euil dede, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes.
For behold the time (said they) spoken of
before by the prophetes, in the which God will that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghteousnes
shall reigne vpon the whole earth, is come.
And when the king shall haue fulfilled his office, that
iustice doeth rule in euerie place, then shal it come to
passe, that Christe shall giue vp the kingdome to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They speaking after this maner, were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and (in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning by gentlnes, and afterwith tormentes) they
being asked of their doctrine, &amp; life, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strength of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
citie, answered, that they onely had the true doctrine,
which they wold mainteine with the perill of their
liues. For (said they) from the time of the Apostles, the
trueth hathe not bene truely preached, nor any iustice
vsed: also that there were 4. prophetes, two iust, Dauid,
and Iohn Leiden, and two vniust, the Bishop of Rome,
and Luther, who was the worst of bothe. They being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
why co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to their promise they had driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentes
out of their Citie, occupying their goodes wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
and children, &amp; by what place of the scripture they
wolde proue that their fact to be well, and iustly done?
they answered, that the time was come, which Christe
spake of,<note place="margin">Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptistes are as make as waspes</note> that the meke should posses the earth, and that
in lyke case God did giue the goods of the Aegyptians
to the Israelites. Afterward they tolde of the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and victualles, that were in the citie, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:8568:219"/>
and also that many in it had aboue fiue wiues a

of Friseland and Holand, which when they were once co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me,
the king wold set forth with all his host, to bring
the whole worlde vnder his power, and subiection, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he had killed all the kings therof, for not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
iustice. When they had bene reasoned withall
after this maner,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and wolde acknowledge none other magistrate, then
their king, they were all put to death, sauing one that
escaped. The Citie was so hardly, and so straitly beseged
that none could ether go in, or out. Wherefore the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
fearing famishment, and seing the danger that
they were in, they thoght to haue taken the king, and to
deliuer him to the Bishop bound, but he getting know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
therof, chose 12. out of all the multitude, suche as
he thoght to be most faithful vnto him, and called
them captaines, and to eche of them he appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
quarters of the Citie to defend, and garisons of
men to kepe the people from rising. More ouer he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to all the multitude, that by Ester the siege
should be remoued, and that they should be deliuered
from the necessitie that they were in. But vnto them
which he had chosen to be captaines, he promised
much more largely, that they should be lordes, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
ouer many things, naming the Towres and
land that he wold giue to eche of them. Also he said,
that only the Lantgraue should be pardoned, because he
hoped that he wold take his part. We spake before of
the Conuention (appointed at Confluence) of the noble
men, in the prouince of the Rhine, in the moneth of
Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. Vnto which companie (of his owne good will)
the Duke of Saxon Elector Iohn Frederick ioyned him
selfe. In this Session, it was concluded, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
ayding of the Bishop, there should be appointed
furth 300. horsemen, and 3000. foote men, for sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes.
The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of Oberste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> named Vlrik was made ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:8568:219"/>
captaine ouer this armye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the whole war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
It was also there ordeined, that the whole estates of
the Empire should be desired to ayde in this mater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and because the Emperour was in Spaine, that Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dus
the king should be desired, for this mater to appoint
a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uention in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moneth of Aprile. And also they sent
leters vnto the Citie besieged, willing them to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
their entreprise, being so vnhonest, and wicked, as
nothing could be more: which thing if they wold not,
nether submit them selues againe vnder their lawfull
magistrates, they should be sure that the Bishoppe
which now kept the siege, should haue the whole helpe
of the Empire against them. This was about the end of
December. They gaue answere the 13. of Ianuarie, in the
yere of our Lord 1535. with manie wordes, but nothing
to the purpose, yet so, that they praysed, and defended
their entreprise: and as touching, that which was laid to
cheir charge, for their creating of a king, they made no
answere at all, but in priuate leters written to the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue
they laboured to excuse them selues, speaking
many wordes of the slawghter, and destruction of the
wicked, and of the deliuerance and reigne of the godly
in this life: with these letters they sent also vnto him
the boke, wherof we spake before, called the restitution,
and aduertised him to repent, and not to make warre
(as did the other wicked Princes) against them, which
were innocent men, and the people of God. The Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue
when he had red their leters, &amp; their boke, he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
those pointes that were not alowable in the same,
and gaue charge to certen of his learned men, that
they should answere them. And because they (in feaw
wordes, and verie darkely) affirmed their king to be
more chosen of God, then by them, he asked them, why
they shewed not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places of scripture, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think
it lawfully done, &amp; why they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed it not before by
some miracles, &amp; signes aboue nature. For said he, God
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:8568:220"/>
shewed by all the prophetes long before, of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Christe, so that it was not onely euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of what
house, and linage he should come, but also in what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and where he should be borne. They did also desire
that their cause might come in question. Vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
the Lantgraue answered, that it was to late, seing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
had taken the power of the sworde into their handes,
and had bene the authors of so great calamitie. For, said
he, all men may plainly see, what is their meaning, to
wit, the ruine of all lawes, and common wealthes: and as
their beginning is wicked, &amp; cursed, so also is the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their mater to come in question, nothing but
feined, and dissembled: also that he had sent vnto them
faithful Ministres, by whome they were wel, and godly
instructed. but seing they had refused their doctrine,
giuing ouer obedience to Magistrates, possessing other
mens goods, hauing manie wiues, chosing vnto them
a new king, denying Christe to haue taken the nature of
man of the virgin Marie, affirming man to haue fre wil,
forcing men to put their goods in common, denying
pardon to those hat sinne: all these opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be vtterly
repugnant both to the law of God, and of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After they
had receiued this answere, they answered againe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
&amp; withall they sent a boke, set forthe in the dutch
to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, of the mysteries of the scripture. In their Epistle
they published their cause againe anew, and defended
their doctrine to be good in their forsaid hoke. They
deuided the whole course, and ages of the world into 3.
partes, and the first age, as from Adam, vntill Noach to
haue perished with the flood, the seconde, in which now
we be, to perish with fyre: the third they saye shalbe new,
in the which righteousnes shal reigne. But before that
the last age shalbe reueled, this that now is, must be
purged with fire. But that (say they) shal not come to
passe before Antichrist be disclosed, and his power be
vtterly put downe: Then shal the ruined seate of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
be erec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:8568:220"/>
earth and all the writings of the Prophetes, shalbe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled:
And as touching this present age, it is like to the
time of the which Isai speaketh. For iustice is put to
silence in it, and the godly are afflicted. But now the
time of libertie, and deliuerance from so many, and
great calamities is come, as it came vnto the Israelites,
being in the captiuitie of Babylon, and the wicked shal
receaue the full reward of their wickednes, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
in the Apocalypse: but this restitution to go be
fore the world to come, to the end that all the wicked
being oppressed, the seat of iustice might be prepared.
When the Lantgraue had redde ouer their boke, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue

               <p>In Februarie the famine was so great in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie, that
diuers perished with hunger. One of the kinges wiues,
being striken with pitie towardes the people, spake by
chance vnto the other wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and said, that she thoght it
was not the wil of God, that the people should so dye for
lacke of sustenance, The king, which had good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in the house, not onely, to serue his necessitie, but
also to waste superfluously, knowing of this, he broght
her into the market place, with all the residue of his
wiues, and there commanded her to knele downe vpon
her knees, and then he cutt of her head from her shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
and yet not so content, after her death he defamed
her with whoredome. This being done, his other wiues
beganne to sing, and to giue praises to the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Then dansed they, and the king led the dance,
&amp; he exhorted the people also (which had no other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualles
left, saue onely bread, and salt, that they should
dance, and be of good chere. Now when the day of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was come, and that there appered no signe of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance,
the king, which had made them so many good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
and large promises, that he might finde some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to excuse him selfe with all, he feined him selfe to
be sicke, sixe daies togethers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which dayes being ended,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:8568:221"/>
he came furth vnto the market place, and said vnto
the people that he had ridden vpon a blinde asse, and
that the father had put vpon him the sinnes of all
the multitude,<note place="margin">The sim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plicitie of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note> so that they were all made cleane, and

promised by him, with the which they oght
to be content. Among other things that Luthere
caused to be printed, in that time speaking of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
that were besieged in Monstere he said thus: Oh what
shall I say, or how shall I bewaile this vnhappie people:
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing it self doth declare, that they be possessed with
many deuilles, but we oght to giue praise to the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

deserued for the contemning of the Gospel, hatred of
Gods Name, and shedding of innocent blood, to be grie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uously
punished by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, yet notwithstanding
he hath brideled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force and violence of Sathan hither

but that most subtile and craftie spirit wold haue ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

thus restreyned hym he is not able to do so muche
as he wolde and as he desireth, but so farre as God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
him, he fretteth &amp; rageth. For the deuil which
desireth to destroy the Christian faith, goeth not this
way to worke to giue libertie, for men to haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

it, it is so open, detestable, and filthie a thing in all
mennes eyes, The Politick and ciuil gouernement may
this way be troubled: but to inuade the kingdome of
Christe withall, there must be other maner of weapons
and enginnes vsed. for he that wil go about to flatter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

I do also think, that all the inhabitantes of Monster do
not allow their toying folie, but that diuerse of them
do greatly sorow, wihch (not without many sighes
and teares) do look for deliuerance at gods hand, as it
hath bene sene afore in the seditions of the bowres.
And I wolde to God there were no deuil in the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

               <p>For I suppose there be but verie few, that wil giue

But in dede when God is angrie or displeased, there is
no error so folish, vnlikely or out of order which Satan
shal not persuade some to beleue, as we se to be broght
to passe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Mahomet. For thogh all their
teaching is fond, yet not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the light of Gods
worde being quenched, it toke strength, &amp; hathe spred
furth it self so large and mightie, as we se it this day,
and the like had come to passe in Germanie, if God
had not put doune the enterprise and counsel of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.
For with the least sparke that is, Satan can make a
great flamb (if God do suffer him) and a better way to
quench it withall there is not, then with the worde of
God. for when the weapons of the ennemie are all toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
spiritual, he can not be ouercome with a multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of horses, or any enginnes of warre. But our Princes
and Bishoppes worke otherwise. for they hinder the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospell, which is the onely way, wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
myndes and heartes of men may be healed. And in the
mean tyme they violently torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them to plucke the
bodie from the deuil, leauing to him the principal part
of man, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is his heart and soule, vsing the mater as the
Iewes did, which thoght to extinguish and put doune
Christe by the punishment of the crosse. But now as tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching
the common brute and writings that go of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
I haue no doubt, but that it is so as it is reported:
and that which they them selues haue written of late,
maketh me fully to beleue it, in which they paint out
liuely their owne furie and madnes. first of al they teach
of the faith verie foolish and absurde things, and of
Christ as thogh he tooke not flesh of the virgine Marie
and yet they confesse him to be of the sede of Dauid.
But they vtter not their myndes fully: and without
doubt Satan doeth nourish some monstre which
may easily be perceaued by this which they say,
the sede or the flesh of Marie can not deliuer vs.
But in vaine is their trauaile, for the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:8568:222"/>
Christe to be borne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgine Marie. Which
saying in all langages is referred to the frute, which
being conceaued and fashioned of the flesh and blood
of his mother, is borne into the worlde. Also they shewe
furth their ignorance, in that they condemne the first
baptisme, as a profane thing, esteming it not as the insti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tution
of God, but of man. But if it be so that all maner
of things oght to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned and put away, that ether
the wicked haue or do giue, then do I meruell that
they cast not away the gold and the siluer with the other
goods, that they took from the wicked, and deuise some
other meanes to liue by. for as these things be the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and worke of God, so is Baptisme also. when the
wicked man sweareth he abuseth the true name of God:
and if the name of God be not true to him, then he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth
not, he that killeth, robbeth or spoileth, he tras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth
the commandement of God, but if the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement
of God be not true vnto him, he sinneth not.
Euen so if the first baptisme be nothing, then the recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers
of it haue not offended. Wherefor then do they so
much detest the first baptisme, as a wicked thing, where
as notwithstanding they affirme it to be nothing? Also
if the mariages in times past oght to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and adulterie, as they say, because they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
of them that wanted faith, I pray you, do they
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, them selues to be the children of harlottes?
Now if they be bastardes and vnlawfully begotten, how
cometh it to passe that they inioye their Citie and the
possession of their fore fathers? It were mete therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
sei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they be such that, they should haue no enteres into
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heritages of their ancesters, but that in this new ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
of mariage, that they are entred into, they should gett
vnto them selues new goods and richesse, which might
beare a more honest title. for it is vncomelie for these
holie and religious men that they should liue with the
goods of harlottes, and miscreantes, or that they should
winne them to them selues frome others by violence,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:8568:223"/>
and robberie. And as touching their kingdome, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is to
be laughed at, there is so much wickednes in it, and so
manifest, that we shall not nede to make many wordes
of it. And truely for those things, whereof we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as we haue treated more then inough, so also more
then nede, considering that it hathe bene so plentifully
and largely set furth by others. Now when they in the
Citie were come into this case, that diuerse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
died for hunger, and that many also departed from
thence, and came out so weake and feble that the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had pitie vpon them, the captaine sent worde to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
townes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that if they wolde deliuer to them the king
&amp; certen others, they them selues should be perdoned.
The citezins, althogh they had good will so to do, yet
durst they not go about it, the crueltie of the king was
so great, and the watch was kept so streitly: for the king
was so obstinate, that as long as there remained any
thing for him to eate and a few others, he was fully bent
not to yelde. for which cause the captaines sent word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them that from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce furth, they
should not send any furthe of their citie, not so much
as children or women. This was in the cale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of Iune,
the day folowing they made vniuste compleining that
their cause might not lawfully be heard, and that they
were wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully afflicted aboue measure, also profering
them selues to submission, if any could shew them w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herein
they offended: fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ther more they expounded a
certen place of Daniel, as of the fourth beast much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
cruel then the others, the conclusion of their leters
was this: That God aiding them they wold stand to the
trueth which they had confessed, but all this was written
at the kings comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement. Now when all things were
come to the extremitie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie, there were two that
fled from thence, of which one was taken of the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,
the other came to the Bishope vnder safe condu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cte,
both these shewed, how the Citie might be taken.
The Bishope &amp; the general captain hearing the words
of these two fugitiues, and weying the mater, the xxii
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:8568:223"/>
of Iune they talked with them of the Citie, aduertising
them to yelde them selues into their hands, and to saue
the multitude, which perished with hunger. Answer was
made in the presence of the king, by Roteman, that in
no wise, they wold giue ouer frome that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne.

The citizens resisted them a litle at the first brunt, but
they gathered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues together in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> market place: &amp;
being in dispaire of any victorie (many of them being

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there an other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the Empire at Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fiftenth of Iulie, wherein king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dus by his

were to be done concerning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rooting out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tistes,

them that the Princes oght to aske cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel of the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
of Rome: wherunto they answered that it was alredie
prouided by certen edictes, what was best to be done to
the Anabaptistes, and that the Emperour had asked cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sell
of the Bishop ofter then once, nether could he do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more in the mater. In the same conuention the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Monstere desired his charges &amp; losses to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed,
compleining that the money promised was
not payd. but when no thing els could be determined,
few of the nobles being present, an other conuention
was called in the same place, the first of Nouembre, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
the things concerning the warre and the charges
thereof might be knowen, wherein also it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
what forme of common welth were after to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
at Monstere. When the day was come, the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bassadour
of king Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dus briefly repeted the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of that present conuention, to witt, that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other
things it might also be deliberated, how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie newly
conquered, might from thence forthe continue in the
olde religion. After these things the Bishoppes legate
sheweth what great charges he was at, al the warre tyme,
how greatly he was indebted, &amp; how it was necessarie (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Citie being now take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) for the auoiding of tumultes and
other dangers, to build two Castles in the Citie, with
strong holdes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al which thinges he desired to be conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red.
To these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs answer was made, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bishoppe had
taken the greater parte of the spoile with all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and goods of the citizens which wholie appartei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welthe of the Empire, therefore that
it was reason, the value should be counted and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with the charges, &amp; what other things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
besides, should also be considered. After it was
determined, that the Bishoprike of Monstere should be
vnder the Empire, after the ancient custome, and that al
the nobilitie should be restored, and the citizens also w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
had departed to other places, so they were not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistes:
that the Bishoppe should set forthe the reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:8568:224"/>
according to the decre of the Empire: that in the
beginning of the next spring the embassadours of the
Princes should go to Monstere to know the state of the
citizens and to kepe them in sauegard, to pull doune all
the forteresses, which the Anabaptistes had erected, and
&amp; that the Bishop also should pul doune the Castles w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
he had builded in the citie, &amp; that he should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay put to death the king with knipperdoling, &amp;
Crechting, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prisoners without reteining them any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
As for that which we said was determined of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the duke of Saxone, the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tegraue, Wirtemberg
and Anhold, testified openly that they wold not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent,
to it: the citezins also professed the same, nether wold
they haue the old forteresses of the towne distroied, but
they consented to the pulling downe of the new. The
king and his two felow captiues were caried hither &amp;
thither to the Princes to be gased and laughed at, by w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preachers of the Lantgraue talked and
disputed with the king, chiefly of these pointes, of the
the kingdome of Christe, of Magistrates, of iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
of Baptisme, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper of the Lord, of the incarnation
of Christe, &amp; of Mariage, and they preuailed so muche
by the testimonie of the Scriptures, that althogh they
did not altogither conuert him, yet they so bowed and
confounded him (notwithstanding his repugnance, and
defending his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) that at the last he granted to the
most part of al: which neuertheles, is thoght that he did
but to saue his life. for when they came to him the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
tyme, he promised, so he might be pardoned to
bring to passe that all the Anabaptistes which were in
great nombre through all Holand Braband, England,
and Friseland, should kepe silence, and in all thinges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Magistrates. Those same men also disputed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the kinges felowes bothe by communication and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
of mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of the Baptisme of infantes, of the
communion of their goods, and of the kingdome of
Christe. When they were come to Telgate, the Bishoppe
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:8568:225"/>
asked the king by what auctoritie he arrogated to him
self such libertie ouer his Citie &amp; people? who asked
him againe,<note place="margin">An equall vo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

euen so,<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

archbishop of Colle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the embassadours of the Duke
of Cleaue with him, two daies after they were exhorted
by godlie admonitions to conuert from their errors.
And in dede the king aknowledged his sinne, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
his recourse to Christe by praier, the other two wold
not confesse that they had offended at all, but obstinatly
defended their fals opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: the next day after, the king
was brought forth into an high place, and bound to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste,
where were present two executioners with fyrie ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
to torment them with all, the king at the thre first
pyntches of the tongues held his peace, afterward cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God incessantly for mercie. When he had bene
torne on this maner for the space of an houre and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
he was thrust through the breast with a sharp sword
and died. The same punishment also had his felowes, w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
being all dead, they were eche of them bound in
yron cofers, and ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vp in the toppe of the towre of the

by the stature of a man. This fearefull tragedie, in w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hich
gods most iust iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are declared doth teach
vnto vs two things. The former, what may the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and the godlie looke for, if ye may bring your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
to passe: and secondarely what doeth the worlde
&amp; the rulers now in earth for the most part deserue. As
touching you, how so euer for a time ye cloke your
crueltie, what simplicitie so euer ye declare in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
gesture, what so euer ye speake of charitie and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:8568:225"/>
and how so euer ye seme to be zealous ouer the
trueth, yet shall you in the end produce no other frute
then these yours fathers haue done before you. If y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
to note particular exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, I might shew in your sect
and amongest you to haue bene so horrible enormities
as more horrible were neuer from the beginning: but
lest I might seme to take any pleasure in accusing parti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cular
perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I wil not at this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t write al that I know.
Onely (I say) that the Church of God may looke for no
other thing at your hand, but for confusion of all gods
ordinances, and for more cruel persecution then euer
yet it did susteine since the daies of the Apostles. for w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat
your fathers began in Monster in their purpose,
you do performe and finish: and to that end do you w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
your bookes, some calling all the Scriptures of God
in doubt, some affirming that there is a more perfect
knowledge, then that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined, or expressed in
the worde, some plainely denying the God heade of
Christ Iesus, and of the holy Gost, some claiming liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
that no man should be troubled for his conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
cloking vnder that title all blasphemie, and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
doctrine. And you now last in accusing vs of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
most odious crimes, whereof we be most innocent,
ye, and your brethern, I say, in teaching this your
pestilent doctrine, and accusing vs who gainstand your
deuilish errors, do plainely declare, what ye haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
intended, if God by his great power bridle not
your furie. And assuredly the world and the Rulers of
the earth (for the most part) most iustly deserue so to be
entreated. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God, it must be subiect to
the crosse, euen vntill the comming of the Lord Iesus
from the heauens. But the world I say, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth (which is the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> seconde point, which
we haue to marke in this former historie) most
iustly deserue to be punished with suche confusion
as ye intend. For the one, and the other (I meane
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:8568:226"/>
the Princes, and the people, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spired to this day against
God, against his sonne Christe Iesus, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d against his eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal
veritie. They mainteine impietie, superstition, and
idololatrie, they cruelly murther the Saintes of God,
and so do they reioyse in all kinde of tyrannie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gods
iust iudgementes can not long delaye punishment. And
therfore leauing you Anabaptistes into the handes of
him whose power ye can not escape, I am compelled in
feaw wordes to admonish you aswell the people, as the
princes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> spedely ye retourne to the liuing God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
veritie so long ye haue oppugned, whose religion ye
gainstand, and true messingers, ye persecute, or els per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
your selues that vengeance is prepared. He will
not entreate you, as he hath done his afflicted Church,
and deare childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is, he will not call you to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
by a fatherlye correction, the end wherof shal tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. Not so, not so, but as ye haue still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, and dishonored him, so will he powre forthe con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempt
vpon you, in the which ye shal perish bothe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porally,
and for euer. And by whom doeth it most appe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re,
that temporally ye shalbe punished, of vs, whome ye
banish, whome ye spoile, and robbe, whome cruelly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ye
persecute, and whose blood ye dayly shed? There is no
dout, but as the victorie w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ouercometh the worlde is
our faith, so it behoueth vs to posses our soules in our
pacience: we nether priuely, nor openly denie the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the ciuile magistrate: we do not claime the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naltie
of all things in this life: the pluralitie of wiues
we do abhorre: we wold not destroye gods ordinances,
and Pollicie, by him established, in common welthes,
but we hate, &amp; detest all such confusion. Onely we desire
the people, and the Rulers to be subiect vnto God, and
vnto his holy will plainly reueled in his most sacred
worde. And therfore of vs, I saye, ye are and maye be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout
all feare. But what ye may loke for, if the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tistes
shal atteine to their purpose: the confusion, and ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rannie
vsed by those of whome we haue spoken, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:8568:226"/>
may be a glasse, wherein ye may se your iudgement, &amp;
end most fearfull, vnlesse that vnfeinedly ye repent. Flat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
not your selues, that ye be able at all times to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in battel by stregth, because that in nomber ye be
manie, or because those Prices of Germanie preuailed
against that most miserable, &amp; most wicked sort of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Anabaptistes. Consider, consider depely in your
hearts, that when God will punish, no multitude can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
At that time God gaue victorie to the Princes, and
did suppres the furie of those wicked men, not because
the Princes were iust, and had deserued suche a benefite
at gods hand, No, the most part were wicked, as their
factes since haue plainely declared. But God had respect
to his owne glorie, and honour. He did admonish his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
by their examples to beware of such poison, and did
also by such confusion, call you to repentance. Of late
yeres before was the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gile of Christ Iesus reuiued in
Germanie, the haruest of the Lord was not come to ripe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; therfor for his owne names sake he wold not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce so sodainly to preuaile. But now seing
that of so long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance from wickednes ye procede
to open contempt of God, and of his true religion, shall
he suffer you to rage without punishment? No, his iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
can not. And what instrumentes can God, (I say) finde
in this life, more apte to punish you, then those that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
and detest all lawfull powers, and do thirst nothing
more, then such confusion as before ye haue heard? God
will not vse his saintes, and chosen children to punish
you. For with them is alawaies mercie, yea, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> althogh
God haue pronounced a curse, and maledictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in the
Historie of Iosua is plaine But as ye haue pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rong
and cruel iudgement without mercie, so will he
punish you by suche as in whome there is no mercie.
Tremble therfor, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert vnto God, if that ye think

               <p>To the which I answere, that if the deuill were not a
lier, and the father, not of lyes onely, but also of all
deceatful lyers, it were not possible, that you who in so
manie thinges haue declared your selues horrible lyers
should vainly bragge that ye haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trueth. For
besides those odious crimes, which most impudently,
and most falsely you lay to our charge, amongest al the
scriptures by you alledged, their are not three which ye
do not abuse, yea and in some ye do so openly belye
the holy Gost that you conclude contrarie to his expres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:8568:228"/>
wordes. But when I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that your Master &amp; father
Satan him self, eshamed not in the presence of Christe
Iesus, to boast, and to bragge, that all the power, and
glorie of the earth was giuen vnto him, and that he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
it to such as best pleased him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet in very dede he
had no power to giue to his felow angelles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of darkenes licence to enter into the bellies of
swine, till that he, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they were faine to begge that plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sant
palace, of him, to whom all power is giuen in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and in earth. When this I saye, I do considre, I do
more lament your miserable blindnes, then that I can
stomake against your vanitie, except in so farre, as to
the ende, I must saye, that such as obstinatelye denie the
plaine trewth of God, are lyers, and the sonnes of that
lier, who first deceaued man, and powred into his hart
the same venome, and error which this day ye teach,
and mainteine. For he was bold to affirme that wisdom
and lyfe was to be found by other meanes then God had
determined, yea where God had pronounced death, and
damnation, he promised saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and life, and so do
you. For God hath apointed life to none of his elect,
but in Christe Iesus onely, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that by such meanes, as in
his holy word expressed, which are trew faith, continuall
repentance, abnegation of our selues, of owr owne iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and wisdom, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d finally by receauing (of free grace)
in Christe Iesus, whatsoeuer we haue lost in Adam. But
ye ashame not to affirme, that the iustice of Christe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth
vs not, except that we haue a personall iustice of
our owne. How coldely ye speake, or write of his death,
of his resurrection of his mediation, and perpetuall
intercession, is euident. Your bragging and prowd boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of your owne iustice, and of your greate perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
are euident tokens how you do agree with Christe Iesus
the trueth, and veritie it self, who commandeth vs to
saye (not for the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but from vnfeined heartes) we
are vnprofitable seruantes. But some of you in your
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:8568:228"/>
iesting eshame not to saye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ye are not two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
passes, distant from the fulnes of perfection.</p>
               <p>But this your vanitie (your blasphemies excepted)
doth not greately offend vs. For a small pricke of
of a pinne, or of a nelde shalbe sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to declare that
bladders (be they neuer so streitly blowen) conteine
in them selues nothing but wind. That by necessitie
you haue written your railing blasphemies, and most
impudent lies we easily confesse. For seing that ye
are the sede of the serpent (I meane such as in your
error shall continue to the end) what thing can you els
do, but of necessitie spew forthe ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nom, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the weight
of gods eternall veritie beginneth a litle to presse dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
your head (for so doeth the serpent whensoeuer she
is touched) But why do ye not considre (seing ye be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
serpentes) that like as prowdly ye lift your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
against the glorie of the eternall Sonne of God, and
as ye cease not maliciousely to slander suche instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
as in his Church be most profitable, and most wort
hie of prayse in the eyes of all godly, that likewise of
necessitie it is, that ye come to ruine, that your pride
be repressed, and your blasphemous tongues be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
for euer? seing that God, who hatch all iniquitie,
must nedes resist the proude, destroy the lying lippes,
and remoue from his societie suche as declare them sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues
