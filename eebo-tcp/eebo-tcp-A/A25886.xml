         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

had it in hand. But the plaine truth is, tis a worke more
fit for Angels then men: prayſing of God is their trade;
we are all but bunglers at it. Yet becauſe even the <hi>little
children</hi> to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> writes have leave to liſp &amp; ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
out the prayſes of their <hi>heavenly Father;</hi> in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his and your commands I ſhall ſet upon the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
hoping for aſſiſtance from him, and attention from
you.</p>
            <p>Satans firſt deſigne is to hinder men from holy duties,
his next to create diſturbances in them. Iſrael being here
met to faſt and reform, Satan ſtirs up the Lords of the
Philiſtims, to bring into the field againſt them a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Armie. The Lord of Hoſts fights for his people,
puts their enemies to the rout, and enables them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
the victory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Samuel took a ſtone,</hi> to wit, <hi>after the men of Iſrael
had gone out of Mizpeh,</hi> the place of their abode when the
enemy ſet upon them, <hi>and purſued the Philiſtims, &amp; ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them untill they came under Bethcar,</hi> the place of their
retreat: ver. 11. <hi>And ſet it between Mizpeh and Shen, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

<hi>Bethcar</hi> (of which before) to be the proper name of a
Rock,<note place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> upon this place.</note> and knowing <hi>Shen</hi> to be elſwhere taken in ſuch a

Eben,</hi> ſignifies a Stone, <hi>Ezer</hi> help. To the end,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99459:4"/>
that if Iſrael ſhould be ſilent, this ſtone might ſpeak the
goodneſſe of God, this <hi>lapis adjutorii,</hi> reminde them of
the mercie received between theſe two places, <hi>Samuel</hi>
not onely impoſes the name, but adds the reaſon of it,
ſaying, <hi>hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as here we have

               <item>1 That the Churches helpe is from the Lord.</item>

            <p>The truth of the firſt of theſe obſervations, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Churches help is from the Lord,<note place="margin">Obſ 1.</note> appears by
<hi>Pſal. 121. 1, 2. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from
whence commeth my help, my help commeth from the Lord,
which made heaven and earth.</hi> It comes two ways.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Immediately,</hi> from himſelfe alone. The Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
raiſeth help to his people, as he framed the world,
out of nothing; and is therefore ſaid to create it. <hi>Be ye

<hi>Numb. 11. 12. Have I conceived all this people? have I
begotten them, that thou ſhouldst ſay unto me, Carry them in
thy boſom (as a nurſing father beareth the ſucking child) unto
the land which thouſwareſt unto their fathers?</hi> No nurſing

in the face of our Miniſters, even of the moſt godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

            <p>As when <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> in <hi>Epirus</hi> was beſieged by the

which furniſhed the inhabitants with water; upon the
diſcovery whereof the ſouldiers choſe rather to die then
to drink: and ſo the City was yielded up. In like manner,
now when the Church is ſo ſtraitly beſieged on every

water of life held out in the publike Miniſtry; onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of that noyſome carrion of exceptions and aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

hereof preſent you with matter of Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of Terror; and of Advice.</p>
            <p>1 Of <hi>Encouragement</hi> to the people of God. We have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99459:7"/>
an Almighty helper on whom we may rely with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
how many ſoever our extremities, how ſtrong ſo
ever our adverſaries be,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note> 
               <hi>We may boldly ſay, The Lord is
my helper, I will not fear what man can doe unto me. Heb.</hi>
13. 6. The keyes of Rome will ſhew themſelves more
potent then the gates of hell, if ever they finally prevail
againſt the Church. Take a City beſieged by Land, if
the ſea be open it may be relieved: block it up both by
ſea and land, yet ſo long as heaven is open, it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
help from thence. That's the Churches caſe when
ſhee is at her worſt. To one that ſuppoſed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
would with all his Forces fall upon the Duke of
Saxony, (who was the chiefe protector of Proteſtants)
and demanded ſaying, <hi>Where will</hi> Luther <hi>be then?</hi> That
man of God returned this quick anſwer, <hi>Aut in Coelo aut
ſub Coelo,</hi> either in heaven or under heaven; becauſe he
expected protection from heaven ſo long as he lived,
and knew he ſhould have poſſeſſion of heaven when
ever he died.</p>
            <p>2 Of <hi>Terror</hi> to the Churches enemies. Know ye
(if any ſuch be here) that the league betwixt God and
his people is both defenſive and offenſive, they have the
ſame common friends and foes. If any ſhall ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

<hi>appoints ſalvation for walls and bulwarks.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 1.</note> When <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
it ſelfe can be deſtroyed, then may you that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of Chriſt and his ways, hope to finde a ſuccesfull
iſſue of your undertakings. But if theſe <hi>walls</hi> be too high
for your ſcaling ladders, theſe <hi>Bulwarks</hi> too ſtrong for
your batteries; then <hi>Malignants</hi> goe and get you ſome
other trade, for beleeve it, you will never thrive upon
this: You may for a time like <hi>Samſons</hi> foxes, carry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99459:8"/>
firebrands ſufficient to burn the corn in Gods field: but
remember how it fared with thoſe foxes. Were not they
themſelves burned together with the come which they
ſet on fire? The courſe you take will certainly tend to
your own ruine. for when you ſhall have endeavoured
all you can to undoe the people of God, the God and
helper of that people will be ſure to finde out a way of
undoing you, according to <hi>Zephan. 3. 19. Behold, at that
time I will undoe all that afflict thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Of <hi>Advice</hi> to this Honorable Auditorie in two
particulars. If the Churches help be from the Lord,
Then</p>
            <p>1 Let the Lord be acknowledged in all the help that
wee of this Nation have received. The holy Ghoſt
ſpeaking of Victories is wont to aſcribe them wholy to
God, and though mention be made of the inſtruments,
to carry the praiſe of all to him. Thus <hi>Iudg.</hi> 4. 15, 23.
it is not ſaid that <hi>Barak</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> defeated <hi>Iabin</hi> and his
hoſt before the Lord, but <hi>the Lord diſconfited Siſra, all his charets, and all his hoſt, with the edge of the
ſword, before</hi> Barak. And <hi>God ſubdued on that day</hi> Jabin
<hi>the King of Canaan, before the children of Iſrael,</hi> Alſo in
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 7. 18. where we read <hi>of the ſword of the Lord and
of</hi> Gideon, the ſword of the Lord is ſet before the ſword
of <hi>Gideon,</hi> as that which both gave the commiſſion to
<hi>Gideons</hi> ſword, and enabled it for execution. Vaine
men may imagine themſelves able by their proweſſe and
pollicy to help and ſave a ſinking State: but what ſaith
<hi>Iob. Chap. 9. 13. If God will not withdraw his anger, the
proud helpers doe ſtoop under him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remarkable is that reproofe which was faſtned upon

<hi>Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou alſo haſt

ſought to in his own way for the further help we have
need of. <hi>Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
we may obtain mercie, and finde grace to help in time of
need. Heb. 4. laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you three things.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>That we of this Nation have need, great need of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
help.</hi> It appears thus. There would not be ſo
much ſtrugling as there is in the womb of this Kingdom;
ſo much roughnes, both of the ſword and of the pen,
if there were not <hi>Eſaus</hi> in it as well as <hi>Iacobs.</hi> As when
the Jewes were employed in building the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(<hi>the glory whereof was to be greater then the glory of
the former</hi>) though the ſtructure were not ſo magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,<note place="margin">Hag. 2. 9.</note>
becauſe of the perſonall preſence of Chriſt, who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99459:9"/>
appeared and taught in it) there was a <hi>Sanball at,</hi> a <hi>Tobiah,</hi>
and other adverſaries to the work: So now at the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of this ſecond reformation (which is like to have
more of Chriſt in it, though leſſe of outward pomp and
ſtate) many thouſands are found to oppoſe it by force
of Armes, beſide the ſwarms of pernicious Sects, that
like great heaps of rubbiſh lie in the way, and hinder the
ſetting up of that building which in likelyhood would
have prevented them, had it been erected ſooner.</p>
            <p>2 That the help we need, is much more then the beſt of
men are able to afford us. <hi>Well may</hi> England <hi>cry to God
as</hi> David <hi>doth,</hi> Pſal. 68. 11. Give us help from trouble
for vain is the help of man. <hi>The Parliament hath already
done what lay in them for the making up of breaches
by the faithfull endeavours of their Commiſſioners in
the late Treaty.</hi>

Be intreated, right Honorable, to conſider the nature of
the work you have in hand;<note place="margin">Lunae radi is non matureſcit botrus.</note> and to remember that the

the moon-ſhine of created abilities is too
weak for ſuch a production. Seek we therefore to God
for help; and ſee we doe it in that way which Iſrael in

in the Text: which I ſhall not wander from, ſo long as I

            <p>2. <hi>Of ſolemne humiliation.</hi> Such was theirs, <hi>Verſ. 6.
They drew water and poured it out before the Lord,</hi>

               <hi>and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
that day, and ſaid there, wee have ſinned against the
Lord.</hi> Theſe actions of drawing and pouring out water
are by ſome thought to be hieroglyphicall. Emptie a
veſſell of any other kind of liquor, it leaves ſome relliſh
or colour or ſmell behinde it; as when honey, wine, or
oile is poured out. Not ſo upon the effuſion of water:
which is therefore fit to ſignifie the pouring out of mens
hearts in ſuch a manner as to leave none of their ſinnes
unconfeſt, unrepented of. To make it more ſolemne,
faſting is added to their humiliation, as that which helps
devotion to wings. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fasting, is a ſouldier without a ſword;</hi> able to do but
little ſervice. And yet of the two, faſting may be the
better ſpared. I ſhall not be affraid to aſſert, that faſting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99459:10"/>
ing without prayer is a ſword without a ſouldier, able to
do no ſervice at all. With Iſrael here we ſhould confeſs,

unto God.</hi> A whiſpering devotion is ſeldome anſwered
with a loud echoe from heaven. <hi>Ask</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and
it ſhall be given; ſeek and ye ſhall finde; knock, and it ſhall

treaſury where it lies ſhall be opened to you. Was there

A <hi>ſecond mercie</hi> which this ſtory acquaints us with,
is, <hi>The Lords hearing the prayers that were then put up
for Iſrael, ver. 9. Samuel cryed unto the Lord for Iſrael,
and the Lord heard him.</hi> Hath he not done the like for
us? was he ever a God hearing prayers more then of
late? Our devotion hath not had a <hi>miſcarrying wombe,</hi>
but been fruitfull in deliverances: neither have her <hi>breaſts</hi>
been <hi>dry;</hi> for three Kingdoms all this while have been
nurſed up in the boſome of prayer. The Jews were
wont to ſtand when they prayed, and from thence men
learned to ſay, <hi>Sine Stationibus non ſubſiſteret mundus,</hi>
The world could not ſtand but for this ſtanding in
prayer. But for it, <hi>Ireland</hi> perhaps by this time had not
been at all, <hi>Scotland</hi> had been all in bloud, and <hi>England</hi>
giving up the ghoſt. Each of theſe Nations may ſay for

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> third mercie <hi>is</hi> the Lords defeating their enemies,
<hi>and that ſo, as to make</hi> Iſrael <hi>inſtrumentall for its own
preſervation, in the 10. and</hi> 11. verſes, The Philiſtims
drew neere to battail againſt Iſrael: but the Lord thundred
with a great thunder on that day upon the Philiſtims, and
diſcomfited them, and they were ſmitten before Iſrael. And
the men of Iſrael went out of Mizpeh, and purſued the
Philiſtims, and ſmote them, &amp;c. <hi>We are aſſembled this
day to praiſe God for ſhewing the like favour to us in
more then one or two places.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>I am not able to parallel our ſucceſs with theirs in all
things. The chapter tels us of a defeat occaſioned by
miraculous thunder; here was none ſuch: onely an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
thundering on both ſides, and that on ours bleſt to
the diſcomfiting of our enemies. Yea our three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in chief, in thoſe three fore-mentioned places,
what were they elſe, but (to uſe the Poets expreſſion)
<hi>Tria fulmina belli?</hi> yet in two particulars they may be
compared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:99459:14"/>
1 <hi>Iſraels victory,</hi> which the Text relates to, <hi>was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected.</hi>
They were met together at this time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,
and not to combate; not to fight and kill, but to
faſt and pray; to reforme, and not to embattail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Yet now doth God give up their enemies into
their hands. Tell me, was not the gaining of <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
unexpected by all men here? the regayning of
<hi>Weymouth</hi> a thing which but few of us had in our
hopes? Hath not the Lord in both theſe, yea, and at
<hi>Scarborough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſ. 64. 3.</note> done <hi>terrible things which we looked not for?</hi>
Have we not received Weymouth eſpecially, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
did <hi>Iſaack,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 19.</note> 
               <hi>even from the dead?</hi> may we not ſay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this occaſion, <hi>mutat is mutandis,</hi> as the man in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
did of his ſon, <hi>Luk. 15. 32. It is meet that we ſhould
make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead,
and is alive again; was loſt and is found?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Iſrael got the victory, though the Philiſtims had the
advantage.</hi> It ſeemeth by the tenour of the ſtory, that
full men ſet upon ſuch as were faſting; armed men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch as were naked: <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ought we read, being
furniſhed with no other weapons but their prayers and
tears,<note place="margin">Salian. Annal.</note> and ſacrifices. Onely when the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> were
diſcomfited by the thunder they ('tis thought) took up
the weapons, that fell from their amazed enemies, and
with them did execution in the purſuit. 'Tis eaſily
found which ſide the advantage was on at <hi>Weymouth.</hi>
Were not our numbers inconſiderable? were not the
few men we had well-nigh ſpent, and worne out with
watching and other military duties? yet did they prove
<hi>more then conquerors,</hi> by getting, not onely victory, but
booty; recovering what they had loſt before, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
poſſeſſing themſelves of what the enemy had laid in.
Let us therefore beſtow another <hi>Eben-ezer</hi> upon this;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99459:14"/>
and ſay once more, <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</hi>

the duty of prayſing God for his help.<note place="margin">Obſ. 3,</note>
            </p>
            <p>Climbe we up to the full explication of this truth by
certain ſteps: which are theſe. Every creature is made to
praiſe God in its kind; Men are more bound to this duty
then other creatures; Chriſtians more then other men;
Profeſſors eminent for their places in Church or State
more than other Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Every creature is made to prayſe God in its kinde.</hi>
Prayſe ye him Sun &amp; moon, prayſe him all ye ſtars of light,
prayſe him ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the heavens: Prayſe the Lord from the earth, ye dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
and all deeps, Fire and haile, ſnow and vapour, ſtormie
winds fulfilling his word, mountains and all hils, fruitfull
trees and all Cedars, beaſts and all cattell, creeping things
and flying fowls. Pſal. 148. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>They doe it
accordingly,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. The heavens declare the glory of
God; and the firmament ſheweth his handy work.</p>
            <p>2 Men are bound to this duty more then other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O that men would prayſe the Lord for his goodneſſe, &amp; for
his wonderfull works to the children of men. Let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
him alſo in the congregation of the people, &amp; prayſe him
in the aſſembly of the Elders. Pſal.</hi> 107. 31, 32. The whole
world is a muſicall inſtrument; every ſtring is ſo tuned,
as to be fitted for reſounding the great Creators prayſe:
But man of all viſible creatures is the onely muſician
that knows how to play upon this inſtrument. The reſt
can prayſe God but <hi>Objective,</hi> by being the objects of
mans meditation. They doe all bring, as it were, their
ſeverall ſacrifices unto him, and lay them down at his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99459:15"/>
feet: he is the Prieſt that muſt offer them up for the
whole Creation.</p>
            <p>3 Chriſtians more then other men.</p>
            <p>That place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 1. deſerves more then ordinary
conſideration. <hi>Prayſe wayteth for thee ô God in Sion.</hi> The

<hi>Prayſe is ſilent for thee ô God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coppen in Ioc.</note> perhaps to imply

they are ſtruck into a ſilent admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that rich boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

that the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe</hi> ſhould vouchſafe to
ſhine upon dunghils, and wanting words to expreſſe
the goodneſſe of their Maſter to ſuch unprofitable
ſervants. <hi>Prayſewayts, ſilently wayts,</hi> and <hi>that in
Sion.</hi> 'Tis due from all Quarters of the World, but it
waits for God onely in <hi>Sion:</hi> None have it in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for him but the members of that Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Sion</hi> was a type. <hi>All thy works ſhall prayſe thee ô Lord
and thy Saints ſhall bleſſe thee, Pſal. 145. 10. Unto him be
glory;</hi> but where? <hi>in the Church, by Chriſt Jeſus, Epheſ.</hi>
3. 21. Great reaſon there is why it ſhould be ſo. For
the Church is more indebted to God, than all the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
in the world. They receive but drops of bleſſing
to her ſhowers. <hi>Ezek. 34. 26. I will make them, and the
places round about my hill</hi> (meaning his holy hill of Sion)
<hi>a bleſsing: and I will cauſe the ſhower to come downe
in ſeaſon, there ſhall be ſhowers of bleſsing.</hi> No wonder
then if the Spouſe have doves eyes, <hi>Cant. 1. 15.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99459:15"/>
Behold, thou art faire my love, thou haſt doves eyes;</hi> lifting
up themſelves to heaven, when ever ſhee either eats a
grain or drinks a drop: while the reſt of the world
have hogs eyes; devouring the acorns that fall from the
tree, without ſo much as looking up, or ever conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
whence they come.</p>
            <p>4 Profeſſors eminent for their place in Church or
State more than other Chriſtians. I gave them the name
of principall men in reference to <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 5. where wee
read of Gods <hi>raiſing up against the Aſſyrian ſeven ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
and eight principall men,</hi> i. e. a competent number
of Office-bearers to withſtand the fury of the enemy,
under Chriſt, who was their peace. Such are to have a
principall hand in this duty.</p>
            <p>1 In regard of the depth of their intereſts. They as
being more concerned in the publique wel-fare than
Chriſtians of a more private ſtation, are bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the wheelings of providence more than others;
and to acknowledge the hand of the Lord in every turn.
Hence are Church-officers called upon ſo expreſly, with
ſo much importunity, both in the beginning, and in the
end of the 135. Pſalme. <hi>Ye that ſtand in the houſe of
the Lord, in the Court of the houſe of our God, prayſe ye the
Lord, for the Lord is good; ſing prayſes to his name, for it
is pleaſant, ver</hi> 2, and 3. And again, <hi>in the 19, and 20.
verſes, Bleſſe the Lord ô houſe of Aaron; bleſſe the Lord ô
houſe of Levi.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Beza in Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 136.</note> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> gives a good reaſon why that clauſe,
<hi>for his mercie endures for ever,</hi> is ſo often repeated; no
leſſe then ſix and twenty times in one Pſalme. 'Tis
done, ſaith he, to make it appear that we may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our ſelves with acknowledging mercie in the
lump, but ſhould take a diſtinct view of each ſingle fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
as the Pſalmiſt there begins with the goodneſſe of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99459:16"/>
God in generall, <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is
good. Pſal.</hi> 136. 1. but afterwards deſcends to particulars,
and to every one of them annexeth the fore-mentioned
clauſe. For example, it well becomes us at this time,
not onely to ſay in the language of that Pſalme, <hi>O give
thanks to the Lord of Lords, to him who alone doth great
wonders, who remembred us in our low eſtate, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from our enemies,</hi> ver. 3, 4, 23, 24. but more
diſtinctly, To him that bleſt our forces at <hi>Plimouth, for
his mercie endures for ever;</hi> and proſpered them at <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
for his mercie endures for ever:</hi> Who delivered
<hi>Shrewsbury</hi> into our hands, <hi>for his mercie endures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
and gave us our loſt Weymouth again, <hi>for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
endures for ever.</hi> This if men of the deepeſt intereſts
ſhall neglect, who then will be found to doe it? will
not God be a looſer by this omiſſion? yea, will not they
be looſers themſelvs, whoſe engagements to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, or to the Church, are ſuch as that they muſt
needs ſtand or fall with it, whatever becomes of other
men?<note place="margin">Super tribus conſiſtit mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus; ſuper lege, &amp; cultu ſacro, &amp; Retributione beneficiorum.</note> The Jewes have a ſaying, <hi>that the world ſtands

but by thankfull acknowledgements, which we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have cauſe to be punctuall in.<note place="margin">Aloyſ. Novar. Schediaſm. p. 149. n. 99.</note> 
               <hi>What ſhall I render
unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take
the cup of ſalvation, Pſal.</hi> 116. 12, 13. he alludes to the
cup of bleſſing uſed in their peace offerings, which were
always accompanied with ſolemne thanks to the moſt
High for his ſaving health. Have you a minde to take
the ſhorteſt cut to ruine? bee unthankfull. Expect
ſhowers of bleſſings from heaven no longer then wee
continue to ſend up vapours of prayſe: for as trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
delight to ſound where they may be anſwered with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99459:16"/>
an ecchoe; ſo doth God delight to give where he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
with thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>2 In regard of the height of their relations.</p>
            <p>Who was <hi>the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael,</hi> but <hi>David the man
that was raiſed up on high? 1 Sam.</hi> 23. 1. The higher he
was raiſed the more ſweetly did he ſing, and warble out
the prayſes of God, inſomuch as, if the penmen of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſhould come to be differenced by their characters,
<hi>Solomon</hi> haply would be ſtyled <hi>The Preacher of wiſdome;
Jeremiah the Prophet of lamentation. Saint John the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of love, and Saint Paul the Apoſtle of grace:</hi> but the
ſtyle of <hi>the ſweet ſinger of prayſes</hi> muſt be reſerved as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
to <hi>David,</hi> more than to any of them all. 'Tis a
maxime in divinity, <hi>Beneficium postulat officium.</hi> Thoſe
whom God calls to the higheſt places, he calls withall
to the higheſt ſervices: and ſuch is this of thankſgiving.
Prayer is an high and holy duty, but (if it be lawfull to
compare them) prayſing will be found to excell it in
ſome reſpects. As the martyr ſaid when ſhe was at the
ſtake, <hi>Now farewell hope, and welcome love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> becauſe ſhe

that is ſeen is not hope, Rom.</hi> 8. 24.) ſo may a dying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſay, Now farewell prayer, and welcome praiſe, for
in heaven there will be no uſe of prayer; becauſe all
wants ſhall be ſupplyed without asking, or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there ſhall be no want of any thing the ſoule can
wiſh: but of prayſe there will be uſe to all eternity.<note place="margin">Revel 7 10.</note>
               <hi>Saluation to our God which ſitteth upon the Throne, and to

that ſits upon the throne. <hi>David</hi> accordingly ſeemes
to have plyed this ſomewhat more then the other duty,

and at noon, will I pray and cry aloud.</hi> But as on purpoſe
to put his ſoule in tune here, that in heaven it might
make the better muſick; he multiplies prayſes even to
ſeven times in a day, <hi>Pſal. 119, 164. Seven times a day
doe I praiſe thee, becanſe of thy righteous judgements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Application</hi> hereof followeth.</p>
            <p>What now remains, (O ye principall men, Lords,

Yet becauſe, as poyſon conveyed in flowers is moſt
dangerous, in that it preſently takes the brain, ſo there is
nothing more deadly than poyſoned joyes: to the end
your chearfulneſs may be kept within Scripture bounds
your rejoycing be ſuch and none but ſuch as becomes
the Goſpel, I ſhall here preſent you, before I conclude,
with a ſhort character of Chriſtian joy. 'Tis a ſpirituall
affection that hath the Holy Ghoſt for its Father, Faith
for its Mother, Prayer for its Midwife, the Word for its
Nurſe, Sincerity for its Keeper, and trembling for its
Handmaid.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>The Holy Ghoſt for its Father,</hi> we finde it called <hi>joy
of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 Theſ.</hi> 1. 6. They in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> kept
the dedication of the wall of Jeruſalem, with gladneſſe,
and thankſgivings; they offered great ſacrifices and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
<hi>for God had made them to rejoyce with great joy;</hi>
Cap. 12. ver. 27. 43. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous,</hi> Pſ.
97. 11. Spirituall joy is a <hi>light</hi> ſhed from heaven, it
ſprings not out of ones own bowels, as the carnall joy
of worldings doth; but is as <hi>ſeed</hi> caſt in from without,
and the Seedſ-man is the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Faith for its Mother. Joy of Faith,</hi> ſo 'tis called,
Phil. 3. 25. <hi>Beleeving ye rejoyce,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter, with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable
and full of glory.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. In the ring of
graces, faith is the diamond; joy the ſparkle of the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 3.</note>
Heare Saint <hi>Paul, We are the circumciſion which
worſhip God in Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Holy
men have their rejoycing onely in Chriſt; they are
made partakers of Chriſt onely by faith. Such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have joy as a flower blown in their hearts, muſt be
carefull to water the root of faith; for from thence it
ſprings.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Prayer for its Midwife.</hi> John 16. 24. <hi>Aske, and ye

1 Theſſ. 5. 16. and preſently after, <hi>pray without ceaſing.</hi>
as if hee had ſaid, Ceaſe to pray, you will ceaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce;
pray without ceaſing, ſo ſhall yee be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
evermore. The cheerfulleſt Chriſtians are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thoſe that are fulleſt of Prayer. After <hi>Hannah</hi> had

in the heart of a man makes it ſtoop; but a good
word makes it glad.</hi> A ſoul ſick of ſorrow is directed
by the Word of grace to an able Phyſician. Upon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi>
preaching Chriſt, there followed great joy in the
Citie of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Acts 8. 5, 8. <hi>Then</hi> Philip <hi>went down to
the Citie of</hi> Samaria, <hi>and preached Christ unto them. And
there was great joy in that Citie.</hi> Where <hi>the Priests are
clothed with ſalvation,</hi> there <hi>the Saints ſhout aloud for
joy.</hi> Pſal. 132. 16.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Sinceritie for its Keeper.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing
is this, the testimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicitie,
and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdome, but by the
grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
They are the upright in heart for whom the light of
gladneſſe is ſown, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 11. It comes up in no other
ſoile. Any kinde of ſin may nip joy in the bud, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
kils it at the root. True joy can never breathe in
an heart obſtructed with by-ends. <hi>In the tranſgreſsion
of an evill man there is a ſnare</hi> (ſuch a ſnare as will be
ſure to ſtrangle his joy; that appeares by the oppoſition
there made) <hi>but the righteous doth ſing and rejoyce,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs
29. 6. They in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 29. were able to rejoyce
in the ſervice then in hand; why? <hi>becauſe with perfect
hearts they offered willingly to the Lord.</hi>

6 <hi>Trembling for its Hand-maid.</hi> Pſal. 2. 11. Serve
the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling. Do
you lend an eare to this, who are members of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Houſes; for the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks it to ſuch as
are <hi>Rulers of the earth,</hi> Verſe 10. Your affections
ſhould be proportion'd to Gods diſpenſations. His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is to feed the Church with bitter-ſweets: her care

ye have not had a white in the North, for a black in the

at, when ever you had a white in the Weſt. Wherefore
