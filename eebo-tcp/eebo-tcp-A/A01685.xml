            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for my preſumption. But where the Vnicorne drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

they being beggers by abilitie, thoſe being Kinges

Yet their willingnes in accepting, did bewray the
worthines of their calling: for as the tree is known
<pb facs="tcp:2053:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the frute, the golde by the touch, the bell by the
ſound: euen ſo is a mans birth by his beneuolence, his

indeede true Gentillitie ſhould obſerue one thing by
the Lark, which although he mounts neuer ſo high in

earth. I preſume with theſe poore men to offer a

by the curteſie of theſe kings your worſhip will accept
of it as it is, meaſuring the matter by the mulberie,
which will euer bee red though it bee not ripe, but if

this treatiſe, whether I

to bee read, and better worth
than to rende, but ſeeing I
haue beſtowed ſome paines in
the pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, I meane to hazard
my hap in the printing, hee
ſhall write well that can ſatiſfie all, and he as bad that can
pleaſe none, if Chriſt could not content al, being a God,
it is no maruaile wee miſlike many, being but men; In
times paſt they did not care how plaine a thing were, ſo
it were profitable, and now we force not how bad it be, ſo
it be pleaſant, it is this that maketh ſo many writers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their time more wantonly than wiſelie, becauſe
they ſee a vaine trifle is more accepted tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a diuine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.
If it bee ſo, that thoſe bookes which are moſt light
are beſt liked, and thoſe men that employ their learning
to leuitie, are moſt laudable, then the tenor will but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the title of my booke: for it will not be worth the
reading: but (good Reader) thou muſt obſerue in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the manner of it according to the matter, wee muſt
not paynt the Scriptures with ſuperfluous ſpeaches, as
men doo their owne fictions after their fancies: for the
maieſtie of the word requireth modeſty in the wrter,
this is not vnlike that gem Chalazias, which will be cold
though it be caſt in the fire or the Chorall, which is beſt
without colouring, thoſe be like water which is apt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
coulour as it hath courſe, or the Camelion which
<pb facs="tcp:2053:4"/>
wil change it ſelf into any hewe it beholds, but this I am
ſure, there is none can afford ſo fruitefull a phraſe as the
Bible, though they practiſe neuer ſo fine tearmes in
their bookes; I ſpeak this not to that end I would gloſe
to get credit by my words, or to diſgrace thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue

there is betweene a pleaſant ſtory (which wee may han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

(which muſt be penned according to the platforme.)
Well ſeeing my former attempts haue found ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
my care ſhall bee the leſſe for the latter, for this I
knowe, that the enuious will ſpite, bee a thing neuer ſo
ſpeciall, the flatterer will ſooth, be it neuer ſo ſimple, the
idle will inuay, be they neuer ſo ignorant, and there are
ſome will finde fault, be they neuer ſo fooliſh; (were not
he a wiſe man could ſtop al their mouthes?) but my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is not to ſatiſfie ſuch readers which bee rude, but
reaſonable, not the curious but the curteous, the one
will excuſe and couer a fault with diſcretion, the

ſonne,) this mayde is very deſirous to marrie, and
hath made her choyce of ſuch a one, as is both of a
goodly compoſition of bodie, and of a godly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of minde. Yet as hee is proper and well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
ſo he is very poore, inſomuch as her father by
reaſon of the baſenes of his linage, and barenes of
his liuing, will not allow of her liking, but hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
her another, which both by parentage and
portion may counteruaile her calling and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
yet nothing anſwerable to his daughters
deſire, becauſe for his yeares hee may rather bee her

father than her husband, which as he cannot be the
firſt, ſo he is ſo farre from the latter that ſhe will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be martyred than married to him, now in this

               <p>You produce your preamble (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
to impugne and reprooue ſuch as (vpon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of parentage and poſſeſsions) will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
or prohibit marriage, and therefore before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
your propoſition, I will ſay ſomewhat to
your proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. You bring an olde verſe to proue
that gentilitie began with goods. Indeede goods in
theſe dayes adde a grace to many, yet gentry hath
not his beginning all of one ground. Some haue
been baſe borne, yet came to great eſtimation, not
by their poſſeſsions, but by their valiant exploytes,
as <hi>Iphtah,</hi> being ſonne of a harlot: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11. 1. became
Iudge of <hi>Iſrael. Iudg.</hi> 12. 7. Others haue been poore,
and yet came to great promotion, not for their
wealth, but their wiſdome; as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> who being an
abiect of his brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 4. became fellow to
king <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and was made gouernour ouer all
<hi>Aegipt Gen.</hi> 41. 40. and in theſe dayes amongſt vs,
many come to preferment, not for their liuing, but
learning, not by progeny but prowes, not by deſert,
but diſcent: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I affirme your ſayings
that as touching the bare birth, a king hath no better
beginning than a beggar, or in reſpect of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ende, the Prince hath no priueledge aboue the
poore; for as both proceede from a woman, ſo both
ſhall feede the wormes; yet that followeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all be made of one mettall, none ſhould bee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2053:7"/>
more excellent in maieſtie, or albeit none be noble
by nature, any ſhould not be renowmed by calling:
for as many differ in degrees of dignity, ſo according
to their title and authoritie they are to be preferred,
and what renowne the predeceſſor dooth purchaſe
by his life, it diſcendeth by ſucceſsion to his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
after him. You proceed further &amp; ſay, that kings
would beſtow their children vpon plaine men, and
for proofe you bring in <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter and <hi>Dauid?</hi>
this example nothing auaileth: for <hi>Dauid</hi> had her,
not by interceſsion, but vpon condition, if hee had
not ſlaine <hi>Goliah</hi> he had gone without her, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.
25. Yet are you aduiſed of <hi>Dauids</hi> anſwer after hee
ſhould haue her, <hi>What am I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and what is my
life, or the familie of my father in Iſrael, that I ſhould be
ſonne in Lawe to the King. 1. Sam.</hi> 18. 18. Herein hee
doth ſhewe his vnworthines to match with ſuch a
mans daughter (I meane for petigree, not for piety)
&amp; this argueth that in thoſe daies they had a ſpeciall
reſpect of parentage? And Lords (ſay you) would
match with meane mens childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; for this you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Dinah;</hi> you muſt note, although he
were a Lords ſonne he plaid a leaud part to deflower
her, &amp; therefore no doubt it was the filthines of the
fact that forced him to marrie her. Yea &amp; rich men
(ſay you) would take poore women to their wiues,
as <hi>Boaz</hi> did <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſtill you ſtriue againſt the ſtreame,
for <hi>Boaz</hi> was hir kinſeman, &amp; therefore was to take
her by the title of affynity according to Gods law as
it was commanded. <hi>If bretheren dwel together, &amp; one
of them die &amp; haue no ſonne,</hi> (as ſhe had not) <hi>the wife of
the dead ſhall not marrie to a ſtranger, but his kinſeman</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2053:7"/>
                  <hi>ſhall goe in to her and take her to wife, and doe the kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
office to her. Deut.</hi> 25. 5, 6, 7. So that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
is impertinent: for where parties be matched
equally according to their birth and abilities there
is euer beſt agreement. Nowe to your queſtion:
<hi>Whether the election of the father is to bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the affection of the childe.</hi> This is as eaſie to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
as to aske: The ten commandements teach
children to honour and ſubmit themſelues to their

altogether prepoſterous fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the propoſition:
for the word of God hath giuen parents great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
ouer their children, euen in this matter
concerning Marriage; inſomuch as no contract
(much leſſe any coniunction) can bee lawful vnleſſe
the parents allow it, according as it is written. <hi>If a
woman vowe a vowe vnto the Lorde and binde her ſelfe
by a bonde being in her Fathers houſe in the time of
her youth, and her Father heare her vow &amp; bond wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

                  <hi>euerie bond wherewith ſhe hath bound hir ſelfe ſhall ſtand.
But if her father diſallowe her the ſame daye that he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
all her vowes and bonds wherewith ſhe hath bound
her ſelfe, they ſhall not be of value, and the Lord will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
her: becauſe her father diſſalowed her. Nomb.</hi> 30. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
5, 6.Hereof it is that where the maide was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and abuſed, albeit ſhee was afterward married
to the man that did it, yet hee was to pay a peece of
money to her father, becauſe he had not his precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as it is written, <hi>If a man intice a maide that is not
betroathed and lie with her, he ſhall endowe her and take
her to his wife, If her father refuſe to giue her to him, hee
ſhall pay mony according to the Dowry of Virgins. Exod.</hi>
22. 16, 17. It is more fullie confirmed in <hi>Deuter.</hi> 22.
28, 29. <hi>If a man finde a maide that is not betroathed, and
take her and lye with her and they bee found, Then the
man that lay with her, ſhall giue vnto the maides father
fiftie Shekels of ſiluer, and ſhe ſhall be his wife, becauſe hee
hath humbled her, he cannot put her away all his life,</hi> yea
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe dooth approoue the ſuperioritie
of Parents in this reſpect, for (ſaith he) <hi>If any man
thinke that it is vncomely for his Virgine, if ſhe paſſe the
flower of her age, and neede ſo require let him doo what
he will, he ſinneth not: let them be married,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 36.
And hereto agreeth the ſame ſaying of the wiſe
man, <hi>Marrie thy daughter, and ſo thou ſhalt performe
a waightie worke. Eccleſ.</hi> 30. I coulde amplifie the
matter very much, but theſe are ſufficient to reſolue
you, that children cannot match without their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
conſent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Alas, you doo not conſider the innumerable
inconueniences that bee incident to thoſe parties
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2053:8"/>
which bee brought together more for lucre than
loue, more for goods than good will, more by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
than conſent, nay more than that, you doe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
way the inequalitie of yeares, the contrarietie of
natures betweene age and youth, is there no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene the withered Beech and the flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
Bay tree, no oppoſition betweene froſt and
flowers, or is it poſsible that oxen vnequally yoked
ſhould draw well together? if you would conferr al
theſe circumſtances together with the accidents
you ſhal find that ſuch an husband, is an hell to a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Virgine, and that ſuch a marriage, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of al miſerie, and no doubt he that beſtows his
daughter no better, ſhall abridge her griefe, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
her to the graue. So that I conclude, ſeeing
marriage is of great moment, not for a moneth
but a whole life time, there is no reaſon, but hee
or ſhee that entreth into that bond, ſhould make
their owne bargaine: becauſe it is they that muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
by it.</p>

confirme your craſed opinion, as though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
rule of Gods book, where to be impugned by
the naturall reaſon of mans brayne. If a man may
giue his goods to whome hee will, hee may as well
beſtow his Children where hee thinketh beſt, for
Children are the goods of the Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? So it ſeemeth
by that which God himſelfe ſaide to Sathan, when
he earneſtly deſired to deale with <hi>Iob, All that hee
hath</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>be in thy handes. Iob.</hi> 1. 12. If you
looke into the olde law, you ſhall finde that Parents
might ſell their Children to ſupplie their neceſsity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2053:9"/>
as appeare in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>If a man ſell his daughter to
be a ſeruant &amp;c. Laban</hi> did little better than make a
benefit of his daughters before he beſtowed them:
For by <hi>Iaacobs</hi> ſeruitude it appeareth he made a ſale
of them, and ſo they could ſay themſelues after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 15. Therefore if Parents had this
great priuiledge then (which is almoſt importable)
why ſhould they bee barred of this benefite now,
not in ſelling but in beſtowing them (which is ſo
reaſonable) you alleadge it is good reaſon they
ſhould make their own bargaine, becauſe they muſt
abide it; as though parents would ſeeke the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of their owne children, but what libertie of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

the parents, that you altogether enioyne their

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2053:9"/>
                  <hi>for it is better to marry than burne. ibid. verſ</hi> 9
nay more then that, the parents muſt preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for them as a duetie enioyned to them, which
the ſame Apoſtle prooueth in theſe wordes, <hi>Let
them be married</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 36. neither may they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any match, if their children miſlike; we
haue example thereof in <hi>Rebecca,</hi> for when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
(who ſhould haue her) whome <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent
was requeſted that ſhe might remaine ten dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their departure, his expedition was ſuch that
he had rather goe away without her, than tarry to
take her: whervpon her parents called her, to aske
her conſent, and to know whether ſhee would goe
with that man or no, her anſwer was, ſhee would:
<hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this argueth that parents muſt not

               <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
               <p>Yet all this is to no purpoſe to the queſtion

               <p>It is needeleſſe to adde a double anſwere
to a ſingle queſtion, or to demaund a reaſon where
there is no doubt, your word peruerſitie, is ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the wilfull, but it is taken for prudencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the wiſe; for they know that it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of parents, not to deale frowardly but father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with their children, and to beſtow them not as
they deſire, without diſcreſion; but as is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient;

thoſe that vnder that pretence might take occaſion
purpoſely to ſeperate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the 15. verſe. the ende he chiefly aymeth at,
was to premoniſh the vnmarried not to match in

<hi>or what parte hath the beleeuer with the Infidel?</hi> So
hauing aunſwered your obiection, I will iterate
where you interrupted me: As children may not
intercommon with Infidels, ſo their parents may
not vrge them to match with Idolators, or ſuch like
becauſe it is prohibyted.</p>

pomice, or elſe you would neuer waſte the time
with ſuch wordes, doth it follow becauſe moſt in
marriage haue regarde of goods, that I by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
ſhould impaire Gods glory, why wee are
taught, not to follow a multitude in euill. Did the
Iſraelites intercouenant with the Gentiles? why
they did contrary to the commaundement of God:
<hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 3. Yet the Lord did not let them paſſe vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 8. Did <hi>Salomon</hi> marrie an Idolatrous
wife? why he was drawen to Idolatrie by them, &amp;
what followed; he incurred the wrath of God for
his wickedneſſe. 1. King. 11. 14. As for that act of
<hi>Dauid</hi> it cannot animate vs, ſeeing the example of
diuers may deterre vs, neither is it expedient for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to preſume of Gods power, without his will.
Now hauing anſwered your digreſſion, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
where I left, I ſay ſtill, that the glory of God
not the motions of men, his praiſe not their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are to be preferred in euerie thing, as in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concerning marriage; we ought indeede to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay
our earthly parents, yet we muſt not diſhonour
one eternall father, for we are taught by the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter to obay God more than man. Act.</hi> 5. 29. Wee
ought to loue our worldly parents, yet we muſt not
offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father: for, <hi>He that loueth father &amp;
mother more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me is not worthy of me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. we ought to feare our natural parents,
that haue gouernment of our bodies, yet wee muſt
be more afraide of our celeſtiall Father, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues
both bodie and ſoule, and is able to caſt them
into hell fire <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. whereupon I ground my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2053:12"/>
argument, that if Parents will profer and impoſe
vpon their children ſuch a match as tendeth more
to profite, than pietie, more to content their gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
deſire for lucre, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their childrens godly choice
for loue, as this man hath doon to his daughter, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they nor this mayde ought to depend on their
Parents in this poynt: what greater occaſion of
incontinencie can be giuen, than to match a young
and luſty maid againſt her owne minde, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
and decrepite perſon to ſatisfie an others plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
what a croſſe contract would this be? and ſhall
not the maide (who hath made a fit choyce to her
owne minde) marry, vnleſſe ſhe take ſuch an old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
againſt her minde? what ſay you, ſhal the ſeuerity of
of her Father abridge her liberty, or depriue her of
the lawfull remedy? Nay more than that, ſhall the
maide increaſe in ſin for want of her deſire, becauſe
her father wil not yeeld his conſent, vnleſſe it bee to
her diſliking? I ſay no. The Apoſtle telleth vs, <hi>It is
better to marrie than burne,</hi> and yet ſhe ſhall keepe her
within the bounds of obedience, becauſe ſhe doth it
not of purpoſe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of her parents, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of Gods glory to auoyd the occaſion of euill.</p>

nay then that which is more admirable, ſome man

ſooner angle for a frogge than a fiſh; I meane, he wil

them with this deluſion, by his life to

what a ſtraunge thing is this, that thoſe which

               <p>Becauſe you both conuince me of the time
for tediouſnes, and of my ſpeeches for prolixitie, I
will cut off manie curious termes, and come brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the matter, and according to my firſt motion
let me common with you in this manner; Is the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
moſt diſſolute and inclined to euill, and are the
yonger more diligent and forward to thriue? hath
the father beſtowed a great portion of the other to
prefer him by learning, and brought vp theſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to take paines for his liuing? is all his coſt caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
vpon the other, and haue theſe yet receiued no
profit for their paines? then what reaſon is there,
to tie golde to the girdle of him that is graceles, and
leaue a browne cruſt for them to chew that are wel
giuen? What wiſedome to beſtow abundance on
him that will waſt it, and to leaue ſuch to thriue
with a penie, that will proſper? Are men ſo bound
to prefer the elder of cuſtome, that they will iniure
the yonger without conſcience? No, no, A wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will alter cuſtome after diſcretion, and diſpoſe
his wealth according to wiſedome, hee will not
leaue his riches to him that is riotous, for hee
knowes full well, that a broken veſſell will holde
no water, that wealth in his fingers, is like waxe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſt
the fire, one will conſume with much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the other with much handling: hee conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
conſidereth, that the leaud lauiſhing of his
liuing after his death, vvill bee an argument to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
they vvere euill gotten by him ſelfe in his
life, hee vvill therefore make him his heyre, not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2053:17"/>
which is firſt borne, but beſt inclined, not the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
but the excellenteſt, he will (I ſay) giue moſt of
his goods to ſuch a one, as by his owne life, he ſhall
haue foreſight of his forwardnes to liue, and not to
ſuch a one, as hath no regard to be reformed in his
life; yea, hee will make him the better that is moſt
obedient and dutifull to doo him good, this is the
courſe Chriſtians ought to take, and for this they
haue warrant by the word of God, and thus it may
be prooued; Goods are the gift of God, and he hath
appointed vs, not to doo as we liſt with them, like
Lords, but to diſpoſe them well, as his Stewards, &amp;
therefore wee ought to haue a great regard of this,
to beſtowe them on ſuch, where he that gaue them
may be glorified, according to the Apoſtles teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>VVhatſouer ye doe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do all to the praiſe
and glorie of God. 1. Cor. 10. 31.</hi> If one ſhould giue
his goods to his eldeſt Sonne, that taketh his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
in venurie, voluptuouſnes, or ſuch like, I
would ſuppoſe the gift would be ſo far from Gods
glorie, that it would rather be a meane to maintaine
than reclaime him from ſin: and ſhall he not make
another his heire, which is more worthie, becauſe
he is elder and moſt wayward? Why? <hi>Iaacob</hi>
was a verie godly man, and had two ſonnes <hi>Reuben</hi>
&amp; <hi>Iudah, Reuben</hi> vvas his eldeſt ſonne, yet he gaue
his kingdome to <hi>Iudah, Gene. 49. 4.</hi> What made
him diſpoſſeſſe his firſt borne of his priuiledge and
Kingly honour? Nothing but his improbitie; for
he vvas giuen ſo much to beaſtlines, that he did not
let to defile his fathers bed; and therefore it is lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for anie man, vppon ſuch leaude occaſions, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2053:17"/>
take the like courſe.</p>

               <p>If parents ſhould alter their diſpoſition vpon
euery ſmal diſpleaſure, then they may make a Wil
euery weeke, and yet neuer a wiſe one in the ende.
A wiſe man, hath reaſon, to whome he giueth, and
therefore is reſolute when he giueth, he will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and yet ſinne not, that is he will not ready in
his rage, to diminiſh his gift for euery grudge, but
mitigate his wrath with wiſedome, hee may well
put vp ſome diſpleaſures, that hath receiued manie
pleaſures, if one offence ſhall make a man froward,
the remembrance of many forepaſſed benefits, may
purchaſe his beneuolence. I ſpeake this to this end,
there is many a good man that hath vngodly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
yea and ſometimes they are moſt euill, that are
eldeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet it were pittie they ſhould be depriued
of their dignity. <hi>Ioſiah</hi> did not ſo much beate down
Idolatrie, as his eldeſt ſonne after him did ſet it vp,
yet he poſſeſſed his fathers kingdome. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 23. 32
<hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> aboliſhed al ſuperſtition as his father did
afore, but his eldeſt ſonne after him did erect it,
yet he came to his fathers kingdome, 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 6.
and therefore God forbid the elder ſon ſhould haue
iniurie for euery light occaſion: for he runneth far

your examples (I denie not) are ſingular, but
your application is ſo ſingle that it woulde make a

learning. I ſpeake of ſuch as haue preſent experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

Deut.</hi> 15. 1. 2. So that I can ſee no cauſe but
that the rich may lawfully paye vſury, and ſo much
the rather becauſe that yeare of priuiledge was in
reſpect of the poore, but as for the rich creditor he
had no eaſe by that order but might be conſtrayned
to pay, for ſo it appeareth by the wordes, <hi>that which

there bee diuers places of proofe in the ſcripture

things you ought to expend: the firſt is the abilitie
of the borrower, the next is, the cauſe that induceth
him to borrow, his abilitie is ſufficient, the cauſe is
ſuperfluous: ſufficient, becauſe it rather exceedeth

becauſe it rather proceedeth of ſome couetous

               <p>Your ſayings are very ſenſuall, and be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes to animate many, than reſtraine any
from euill, wherein you take a confuſed courſe to
maintaine ſuch a monſtrous ſinne as Vſurie is,
for the next way to quench fire is not to powre on
oyle, or to driue away the dropſie to followe drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
neither is it the beſt courſe to aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don Vſurie by

is it to become approouers of euill? I perceiue that
the drift of your long diſcourſe is to no other ende
but to proue that Vſurie may be taken of the rich;
yet I cannot finde it lawfull for them to giue it,
the Prophet <hi>Iheremie</hi> confesſing his integritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the wicked (which did curſe him without
cauſe) to cleare himſelfe altogether of the blotte of
Vſurie ſaith in theſe wordes: <hi>I haue neither lent on

you obiect, ſhould confound the double confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Moſes</hi> which I alleadge: Notwithſtanding I
confeſſe that ſame ſaying of <hi>Iheremie</hi> is ſingular, as
hee placed it, although it be but ſimple as you apply
it; for if you vnderſtand it ſimplie by the verball
ſenſe, then you ſhew your ſelfe ſo ſimple that you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2053:20"/>
bee voyde of all ſenſe; for I neuer read of any
godly Prophet that did euer let or take monie to V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
neither was it like that he whoſe calling was
ſo excellent by inſpiration, would haue his life to
ſauour of ſuch corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; what though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
doth by a <hi>Simile</hi> make a mention of Vſury to
ſome intricrate end, doth it follow that the naming
of it ſhal make the thing to be nocent, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception?
Therfore no doubt you are greatly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
herein, for thoſe wordes <hi>(I haue neither lent, or
men lent me to Vſury)</hi> are vſed of the prophet for two
principall endes: The firſt is by <hi>Synecdoche pars pro
toto</hi> (to ſet forth the ſimplicitie of his calling) ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was as well cleare of that, as of all other
worldly matters and meanes which might either
bee impediments to his profeſsion, or giue any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of curſing: the next is by a Metaphore drawn
from an act of the accidents (to note the peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of the people) who exclaymed againſt him
as bitterly (and yet without cauſe) euen as the
poore doo when they are grieuouſly oppreſſed by
the Vſurer, which outcries are ſometime ſaide to
be ſo pitiful that they pierce the skies. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5. 9. now
becauſe here may riſe ſome ambiguity in this latter
aſſertion, I will proue it ſufficiently by reaſon, for
your better reſolution, It ſeemeth by all ſenſe and
reaſon that the original of theſe outcries ſhuld pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from the poore, firſt becauſe they of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue moſt occaſion to borrow, and whether
ſhould they repayre but to the rich? next, becauſe
when they are oppreſſed (by reaſon of want)
they can not vſe thoſe remedies the rich may,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2053:20"/>
and it is this that makes them to exclaime againſt
them. Yea to conclude theſe exclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s can neuer
be conſtrued to come from the rich: for they will
ſooner crucifie than curſe the poore, becauſe (as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>

<hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 15. beſides that the ſame wiſe man ſaith in

of the poore by oppreſſion, &amp; that we may perceiue
apparantly in the 5. of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> where the rich,
had gotten from the poore all their landes, houſes
vinyardes, corne, &amp; what they had into their hands
verſe 11. Inſomuch, as the exclamation of the poore

ſaying that ſhould be vſed by our Sauiour Chriſt,
which is this: <hi>It is a bleſſed thing to giue rather than
to receiue. Act.</hi> 20. 25. Now if you ſhould demand
how I could proue theſe wordes by any other part
of the Scripture, my anſwere ſhould bee, I knowe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2053:21"/>
not (for the like literall forme, is not to bee found)
but if you ſhould aske, why I beleeue thoſe bare
words to be true? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I would anſwere, the effect of
them may be gathered (though not orderly, yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently)
by the words of our Sauior Chriſt in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other places in the ſcriptures. Euen ſo, touching
your authorities &amp; places you produce, I perſwade
my ſelfe they are altogether pronounced agaynſt
ſuch as oppreſſe the poore: if you ſhould aske mee
how I could proue it? I might anſwere, I knowe
not: for there is no one ſpeciall place of proofe for
it. But if you ſhould demaund, what reaſon ſhould
inforce me to ſay ſo? then I would make this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
If you confer all places of the Scripture to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
tending or pertaining to this purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Vſurie, it will appeare that euerie part hath
a ſpeciall reſpect to this ende, to ſupport and profite

yet there is reaſon to make a doubt of your bare
ſurmiſe without authoritie, ſeeing we all knowe it
is a courſe wooll will take no colour, &amp; a bare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that will beare no argument. <hi>Salomon</hi> that wiſe
man, doth note the ſinne of Vſurie by this ſentence,
<hi>He that increaſeth his riches by vſurie and intereſt,
gathereth them for him that will be mercifull to the
poore. Prou. 28. 8.</hi> the Lorde will not onely abridge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2053:22"/>
his daies (for the wicked ſhalbe ſoone cut off) but
alſo thoſe goods he hath gathered ſo vngodly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(how hardly ſoeuer he had them) ſhall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him, and left to ſuch a one as ſhall better
beſtowe them. I pray you, doo but conſider into
what an intollerable extremitie the people were
brought in the time of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> by burdens of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie
and exactions, inſomuch, as if the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
had not ſpeedely ſought a remedie, there had
followed great confuſion vpon it. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. And
no doubt, if good lawes had not been prouided to
repreſſe it amongſt vs, it would haue cauſed ere this
day, as great calamitie in <hi>England,</hi> as it did then in
<hi>Iheruſalem.</hi> So that you may plead what you pleaſe
euerie way to excuſe Vſurie, but I ſee no reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
way to admit it.</p>

who would thinke you ſhoulde giue ouer ſo many
good arguments, to relie vpon this laſt allegation of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> when indeed his intent is cleane contrary
to your interpretation; for hee meaneth thoſe that
gather their goods by intereſt of the poore, and not
of the rich, yea, and (that which is more malignant)
thoſe that ſpare the rich, &amp; pinch the poore: which
may be gathered in another place in his Prouerbes,
<hi>Hee that oppreſſeth the poore to increaſe himſelfe,
and giueth vnto the rich, shall ſurelie come to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie.
Prouer. 22. 16.</hi> As for that matter of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
I meruaile you implie it ſo impertinentlie,
hauing prooued before that it pertaineth to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2053:22"/>
of the poore: and that may more euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeare vnto you by the Prophets owne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
who (the better to beate downe Vſurie,
and to mooue the rich to remorſe) perſwadeth
them by his example to be good to the poore: For
(ſaith he) <hi>euen I and my brethren and my ſeruants
doo lend them money and corne: I pray you let vs
leaue of this burden. Nehe. 5. 10.</hi> As for your laſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
touching our Lawes againſt Vſurie, certes
they are verie well prouided: for albeit they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine
the vnreaſonable loane for lettage, yet they
admit ſome competent allowaunce for lending: (I
mean not of the poore but the rich) otherwiſe, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may want ſometime of a ſodaine, but they may be
bolde to borrowe at leaſure. So that all your obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

               <p>I remember there is a common ſaying,
that hee that is once wet, cares not how deepe hee
wade; ſo it ſeemeth, that you hauing ouerſhot your
ſelfe in your ſayings, care not how you maintayne
them by ſhiftes, our S. Chriſt hath giuen vs a newe
commandement (not to lend for lone as the <hi>Iewes</hi>
did in their daies) but (ſaith he) <hi>Lend looking for
nothing againe. Luk. 6. 35.</hi> what ſay you to this?</p>

               <p>I ſay, it were beſt to intercept you with
ſome other ſentence, that might barre the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from all the benefit; could you be content to lend
a ſumme of money to your friend at his inſtance,
and take this peece of ſcripture for paiment at your
day? I thinke not. Our S. Chriſt doth not onely wil
vs to le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d looking for nothing againe, but alſo in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2053:23"/>
ſame chapter, <hi>of him that taketh away thy goods, ask
them not againe, Luk. 6. 30.</hi> yet his meaning is not
by theſe words to maintaine wrong; for if wee bee
forbidden to couet our neighbours goods, much
more we may not violently take them awaye: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth he meane by le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding looking for nothing
againe, that a man ſhould looſe al when he lendeth;
for he willeth vs to do, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we wold be done to;
then what is he will lend to looſe all, albeit he could
be content to borrowe and brooke all? Beſides, to
detaine a mans dutie, it is a great argument of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
and that may appeare by the Prophet <hi>Dauids</hi>
ſaying; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the wicked borroweth, &amp; pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not againe, Pſal. 37. 21.</hi> Therefore you muſt not
conſter the Scriptures by the literall but the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
ſenſe, as hauing regard to the time when, &amp; to
the end wherefore it is ſpoken: and conſequentlie
you may perceiue that all your poſitions, are diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
from your opinion. Now hauing attended &amp;
anſwered all your obiections with patience: you
haue reaſon to heare a little what I can alleadge
for proofe: for indeede, it is the part of a cunning
Chirurgian, not onelie to purge the wound from
corruption, but to applie a plaiſter to cure it. But to
the matter; The new Teſtament may be a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
with me: for all other particular ſinnes (as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,
extortion, and ſuch like) are expreſſed &amp;
ſet downe, but as for vſurie there is no mention
made of it, ſauing in one place, where it appeareth
by the words of our Sauiour Chriſt, that vſurie is
rather admitted than adempted, (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he reproued
the ſloathfull ſeruant, that vnder idle excuſes made
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2053:23"/>
no profite of his talent) <hi>Thou oughtst</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to
haue put my money to the exchangers, and then at
my comming should I haue receiued mine own with
vauntage.</hi> Mat. 25. 27.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tych.</speaker>
               <p>If the Surgeon you ſpeake of coulde no
better cure by his arte, than you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert me by theſe
arguments, he ſhould rather procure a putrifaction
than a purgation; for there is neither ſenſe nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele
in your aſſertion: becauſe vſurie is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
named in the newe Teſtament, you will
conclude <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> that Vſurie is no ſinne.
What a paradoxe is this? is not the affection the
cauſe of the action, the intent, the procurer of the
attempt: why then, it is impoſsible but that vſurie
ſhould be comprehended &amp; condemned with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes;
for where there is no auaricious deſire,
men will lend for loue without lucre: and ſeeing
couetouſnes is the roote of all euill, it is no maruell,
though Vſurie be a branch of it. <hi>Thou oughtest to
haue put my mony to the Exchangers</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Chriſt) <hi>ergo</hi> (ſay you) Vſurie is tollerated.
What a parabolicall proofe is this? are we now to
learne the purport of a parable, when indeede it is
not to be beleeued ſimplie but ſignificantlie, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the circumſtance of the matter, but the
ſubſtance of the ſenſe, and the doctrine, that may be
deduced from it, thus your ſimple handling of your
two laſt propoſitions, may be wray the looſenes of
all the reſt of your allegations.</p>

               <p>I haue read that the Tigreſſe milke the

tree the more it is watred, the more it withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2053:24"/>
ſo it fareth with you: for my reaſons the more
forcible the les effectuall they be to perſwade you,
whether I ſhould impute it to your ignoraunce, or
obſtinacie, I knowe not: but no doubt to erre, and
excuſe it is a greater argument of wilfulneſſe than
wiſedome; you ſay Vſurie is included within co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,
for where there is no greedie deſire, men
will lend for loue onely, by this reaſon, hee that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his land ſhalbe reſtrained of his rent, for if his
deſire were not couetous, he might aſwel take God
amercie as money, what a concluſion were this, you
would haue men, liue by the aire like the Elephant,
when you abridge them of their lawfull courſe to
increaſe. You proceede further and ſay my proofe
is parabolicall? I confeſſe it, yet it followeth not it
ſhould be improbable? The husbandman that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the ſeeede (albeit he referreth the bliſsing to
God) yet he hath great regard of the ground; and
ſhall wee that read a parable (although wee reſpect
chieflie the ende and effect of it) neglect the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that doth manifeſt the ſame? Is it poſsible that
the myſterie beeing ſerious and ſingular, that the
matter ſhould be light and ſiniſter? Would GOD
bewraye his heauenly Wiſedome, by ſimilitudes
without ſenſe, or not worth our obſeruation? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
it: for his diuine prouidence diſpoſeth althings
to a good purpoſe. The end of the parable of <hi>Diues</hi>
and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is to terrifie vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hardning our harts
againſt the poore, yet there is ſomewhat elſe to bee
obſerued in the matter of that parable: for I beleeue
that after death euerie one ſhall goe immediately ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to heauen or hell, as there be manifolde proues
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2053:24"/>
in the ſcripture, ſo I haue a manifeſt exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this
euen of <hi>Diues</hi> and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> The like I may ſay by
the other parable, although the efficient end therein
was to reproue the ſlothful ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe he made
no vſe of Gods benefits; yet we may perceiue that
the matter beſides doth not only import but aproue
that it is better to imploy our treaſure to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by exchaunge, than to hide it in the earth to no
ende by excuſe; for Gods gifts are abuſed if they be
not vſed. Therefore let vs not ſo lightlie eſteeme of
parables, knowing to what ende our S. Chriſt vſed
them, <hi>that the people by ſeeing might ſee &amp; not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
and by hearing might heare &amp; not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mat.</hi> 13. 13. Now, if we ſhall both hear &amp; ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It is an eaſie matter by follie to make a peece of

your determination with reaſon, for <hi>There
is more hope of a foole</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) than of him
that ſtandeth in his owne conceipt,</hi> and yet of both
the foole is more to be borne with: for he erreth of

we may aſwel ſhun that which of it ſelf is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
good, as that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly by occaſion is euil,

of his contempt? nothing els but for feare he ſhuld
be euill ſpoken of. <hi>Ionah. 4. 1, 2. &amp;c.</hi> Thus he did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that which was good and meete to be done, for
feare of the euill might follow of it. But admit the
Apoſtle perſwadeth vs to ſhunne ſuch things as be
ſiniſter and of euill report: yet thoſe wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
not vſurie, as it may be vſed; for if you note
the originall of that report, it will appeare that it is

was enioyned to get his liuing, <hi>In the ſweat of his

a proportionall price according to the time of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
now if Vſurie be after your definition, theſe
aſwell as the Vſurer doe ſin, though they deale not

Riches (ſay you) make men high minded; and yet
the deuill hath other deuiſes to drawe poore men
to pride he hath many engines to work euill with,
and can allure men to one ſinne after many ſortes,
as wealth may inflate the rich man, ſo knowledge
may puffe vp the poore man, and ſometime hee
that wants both, is prowde in his owne conceipt:
riches makes vs forget God (ſay you), ſo doth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,

               <p>They ſay that one ſwallow is no argument

make his face faire, neither may the forwardnes of
a few, be a generall preſumption for all that be rich,
It were hard if amongſt many bloſſomes all ſhould
proue blaſts, or amongſt many rich men, all ſhuld be
miſers, but yet if you marke the maner of ſuch
as doo good, you ſhall finde they either doo it
grudgingly or glorionſly, and that was the fault of
the <hi>Phariſies,</hi> one doth a pleaſure and but ſeldome,
and yet he muſt ſpeake of it very often, hee cannot
be content to doe good before God who can make
reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he muſt haue it known to the world,
that laugh at his vaine oſtentation to giue, it is
good; the deede is charitable to him that hath need,
but not acceptable to God, becauſe he ſinneth if he
doth it not ſimplie: and ſurely hee that braggeth or
vpbraydeth where he hath done good, deſerueth no
better amendes than his owne mouth. Other
there be that be wealthy, that wil hardly parte from
a pennie by their life, but giue great promiſes of
much after death, and yet I think if they could ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
it with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they would hardly leaue it behinde.
It is a wonderfull thing that ſuch men as almoſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2053:29"/>
haue no heires to inherite, no cauſe to be couetous,
no reaſon to hold faſt, ſhould ſhewe themſelues ſo
wretched to the world, that they will crucifie theyr
owne carkaſſe for want of coſt, and ſooner die than
depart with ought to doo another pleaſure. Alas,
what poſsibilitie of preferment is to be expected of
ſuch a perſon, that will yeeld no likelihood of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
by his life? Beſides, doo they thinke, one can
feede vpon faire wordes, or proſper by bare promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?
Why, he may goe long barefoote that tarries
for dead-mens ſhooes, and yet when he hath them,
they wil not be worth the wearing: for I haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
ſuch, as haue promiſed golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hils by their life,
that haue performed but durtie daies at their death:
It is but a fetch of fraudulencie, yea oftentimes the
cauſe of farther inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience, to bring one in hope
of hauing a thing, and then to delude him at the laſt
with nothing. Theſe ſhould doo well to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
the Wiſemans words, <hi>to doo good before they die.</hi>
For it is far better they ſhould ſend their workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, than they ſhould follow after them, &amp; it
is a greater worke of charitie for them to doo good
by their life freely, than to doo it after their death
forcibly. Wel, to be briefe, let this ſuffice, where
there is one that doth good with his goods, there
are a hundred that doo hurt with them.</p>

though I did admit your antecedent, it wold make
againſt your ſelf, if I ſhuld reaſon with you by waie

to giue them? if the concluſion be made by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
what ſay you to this? yet betweene your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and this, there is neither barrell better her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
as for your conſequent, it is vainly intruded:
for if the poore can effect the bleſſednes of the rich,
the cauſe can neuer faile, conſidering that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ye shal haue the poore alwaies with
you. Mat. 26. 11.</hi> Therefore in this you doo but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
the Spaniell, that forſakes the Partridge to

ſuch bolts; it is better to lay the finger on the
mouth, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeak without modeſtie: but becauſe
it is a follie to ſtriue to go ouer a ſtile when the gap
lieth open, I will leaue off ſuch tearmes as I might
well returne, for the imperfection of your poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and produce ſuch matter as is meete to applie,
for the proofe of my propoſition. You knowe the
queſtion, I were loath to be much about it, leſt you
ſhould thinke I would begge it. I affirme that the
Rich man (although it bee rare) that diſpoſeth of
his goods like a good Steward, is more bleſſed
than the poore that haue not any thing to giue.
All men will graunt this, becauſe it hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
euen by the Apoſtles ſpeech in my former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2053:31"/>
                  <hi>Act</hi> 20. 35. Againe, this is another reaſon;
ſuch kinde of pouertie is to be counted as a croſſe,
and for this cauſe, the Wiſeman deſired to be kept
from it, <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 30. 9. And this was one of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
that fell vppon <hi>Iob. Salomon</hi> willeth vs
not to loue ſleepe? and why? leaſt (ſaith he) thou
come vnto pouertie. Therefore, if it were not a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
he would not premoniſh vs to preuent it
<hi>Prouerb.</hi> 20. 13. Yea, and in the ſame Chapter by
this hee dooth adde a double puniſhment to the
ſloathfull perſon: for hee telleth him, becauſe hee
will not worke in Winter, he ſhall begge in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but haue nothing. <hi>verſe.</hi> 4. So that I maye
conclude, the rich man is more bleſſed than the
poore in this reſpect, becauſe God giueth him the
benefite of a double bliſsing, one in this World
with aboundance, another (if he vſe them well) in
the world to come more ſuperabundant.</p>

               <p>My meaning is not to refell your reaſons,
but to recite ſuch as I haue heard: and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
this they alledge, that in the palace of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prince, there be manie ſeuerall roomes, &amp; in the
houſe of our heauenly King there be manie dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
places, ſo ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14. 2.
Now as there is neuer a roome in an earthlie Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
but hath his ſeuerall Office, and euerie Office
doth ſomewhat differ in dignitie from another, ſo
ſay they, there be manie manſions in heauen, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one according to the worthineſſe of his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
is preferred to the greater glorie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tych.</speaker>
               <p>As though hee which is the omnipotent
Creator would take a patterne by the proceedings
of his Creatures, when wee reade that <hi>thoſe things
which are highly eſteemed amongst men are but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination
in his ſight.</hi> Our Sauiour Chriſt vſed
that ſpeach to his diſciples for their conſolation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he perceiued they were much troubled to
thinke of his departure, as though when hee were
gone, he would either vtterlie forget them, or goe
to ſuch a place, that there ſhould be no ſpace for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be where hee was: therefore our Sauiour Chriſt,
to comfort them in theſe croſſe cogitations, dooth
nothing elſe but by theſe manie dwelling places,
amplifie and ſet foorth the largenes of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
houſe to aſſure them they (as the faithfull)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2053:32"/>
ſhould be where he was: for although the gate bee
verie ſtraight to enter, heauen is wide enough for
thoſe that ſhall inherite it. This I take to be the true
meaning of our Sauiour Chriſt: for albeit hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention of manie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions, we muſt not think
there bee anie diſtinct dwellings in heauen, (much
leſſe any degrees of glorie) for it is written, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhall all meete in one place in Gods preſence, and
miniſter a like ſeruice to his Maieſtie. <hi>Apocalipſe

               <p>To prooue there is difference of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in Heauen, they proceede further and ſay; The
<hi>Apostles</hi> ſhall bee more glorious than the reſt:
becauſe they ſhall ſit vpon twelue Thrones, and
iudge the twelue Tribes of <hi>Iſrael. Matthew. ca.

               <p>I remember our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith
in another place to his Diſciples, that they ſhall
eate and drinke at his Table in his Kingdome,
<hi>Luke.</hi> 22. 30. yet I doo not thinke ſo. And in the
ſelfe ſame place, hee ſaith, They ſhall all ſit on
ſeates, and iudge the twelue Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi>
yet I doo not take it ſo. For thoſe Similitudes
and ſayings, import nothing elſe but their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
to bee partakers of his glorie. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the firſt, is this, In heauen is neither eating
nor drinking, becauſe wee ſhall reade, that there
wee ſhall neither hunger nor thirſt anie more. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalips.
7. 16. Eſay.</hi> 49. 10. My reaſon for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is this, The Apoſtles ſhall not iudge vs, becauſe
they, we, and all, ſhall bee iudged by Chriſt Ieſus.

               <p>They reſt not ſo but referre themſelues to a

               <p>This aſſertion is anſwered by my former,
yet for your better reſolution I will explaine it by a
temporall conſtitution: you knowe that when a
priſoner (being a hainous malefactor) hath his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
laid open apparantly to all that be preſent
(although the chiefe office of giuing ſentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Iudge) yet all the reſt that bee there
may eaſily iudge what puniſhment that priſoner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues,
euen ſo in this reſpect the Saints may be ſaid
to iudge the world when our ſinnes and liues are
laid open manifeſtly in the preſence of ſo many
millions of Angels and Saints (albeit it appertaineth
properly to Chriſt to iudge vs) yet it is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them to iudge what we are, and in this ſenſe
it may very well be ſaid, we ſhall ſtand helples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo many Iudges as haue excelled vs in good
workes; for the ſight of ſuch as are innocent is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to iudge thoſe that haue iniuried them, yea,
it will ſtrike ſuch a horror into their hearts that
their very thoughts (as the Apoſtle ſaith) wil accuſe
or excuſe them <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 15. 16. at that day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phi</speaker>
               <p>Yet they leaue not here but aleadge this for
a further probation of the matter, they ſay that as
we haue on earth Biſhops, ſo there are which differ
from them in dignitie, which are intituled Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,
ſo in heauen there are Angels of great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and yet there are Archangels which are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
glory.</p>

               <p>This concluſion is nothing forcible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your compariſon is fallible, for although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
be preferred more than others to higher digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in this world, yet their inferiors may bee equall
to them in excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering how theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preferments come to men oftentimes aſmuch for
their reuenewes, as their vertues): now we knowe
with God is no reſpect of perſons, neither doth he
regard the promotion of a man by his title, but the
puritie of his life by his workes: and therfore, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
it pleaſeth God (of his good pleaſure) to call vs by
ſundrie names, as <hi>Archangels, Angels, Saints, Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
Iust, Righteous, Children, Heires, Sonnes,</hi> and
ſuch like, it is no conſequent anie ſhoulde differ in
glorie from another; for what greater glorie can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
haue more, <hi>than to be like him that is most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious?
1. Iohn.</hi> 3. 2. and to ſit vpon the Throne with
him that ſhall iudge vs? <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3. 21. Yet this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
generally to all the faithfull.</p>

               <p>I haue read that ſome of the Prophets as
<hi>Eſay,</hi> was cut in peeces with a ſawe of wood, <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi>
was ſtoaned to death, <hi>Amos</hi> thruſt into the
temples of the head with a great nayle: others, as
the Apoſtle ſaith, were tried by mockings, ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
&amp;c. <hi>Hebr. 11. 36, 37.</hi> yea in our times, manie
haue ſuffered as Martyrs for the teſtimonie of the
truth. And ſhall not theſe which haue indured ſuch
extreame torments in this world farre aboue theyr
brethren, poſſeſſe ſome greater glorie in heauen
than they?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tych.</speaker>
               <p>If you had ſaid poſſeſſe ſome greater ioy
in heauen, then it might haue bred a queſtion: for,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2053:34"/>
if in this world (where all our pleaſures are but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories)
when one that is poore doth attaine rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
which are but mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tany, if he taketh more ioy
by remembrance of his miſerie paſt, than hee that
was neuer pinched with penurie, then no doubt, in
the world to come (where the leaſt pleaſure is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable)
it cannot be, but that he, which hath bin
moſt afflicted here, ſhall conceiue and receiue farre
more exceeding ioy, than he which hath been tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with leſſe tribulation, &amp; yet the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
are fitlie compared to veſſells filled with licour
of all quantities, for euerie man ſhall haue his full
meaſure there. Againe, it pleaſeth God to afflict all
whom he loueth, &amp; yet he doth it not in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and meaſure to all. For as his giftes and graces
are not of like excellencie in euerie one, ſo his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are not of like equalitie to all; yet that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not anie ſhould exceede others in glorie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
ſo they indure that croſſe with patience, which
God doth lay vpon them on earth. There bee two
ſpeciall reaſons, that make much againſt you in this
matter: one is this. All the afflictions a man maye
ſuffer cannot ſaue him, becauſe when he hath done
his beſt, he is but an vnprofitable ſeruant ſayth our
Sauiour Chriſt. <hi>Luk. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 10.</hi> Another reaſon is this,
no man maye hope to haue greater glorie than his
brother: becauſe they themſelues (for all their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings)
are not worthy the glory of the life to come.
<hi>Rom. 8. 18.</hi> Therefore, let euerie one reioyce (as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
perſwadeth vs) inaſmuch as he is counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be partaker of Chriſts ſufferings: for, as by
faith the thiefe was ſaued vpon the gallowes at the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2053:34"/>
laſt gaſpe, euen ſo all men are ſaued by that meanes
when they haue perpetrated aſmuch as is poſsible.
The Similitude of our Sauiour Chriſt is ſufficient
to ſatisfie you in this behalfe; it is concerning the
houſholder that hired laborers into his vineyard at
all howres in the day: he that came early &amp; wroght
in the heate of the day, had no greater reward than
thoſe which were idle and wrought but an hower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſeeing the hyre is indifferent to all, none ſhall haue
glorie greater than another.</p>

they drawe a reaſon by the contrarie, and ſay, that
ſeeing there is difference of paines in hell amongſt

difference of degrees in heauen amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Angels;

               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, he that knowes

with ſome ſtripes; but he that knoweth it and
doth the contrary ſhalbe beaten with many ſtripes,
this they alleadge for one. The ſame our Sauiour
ſpeking of the hypocrits in another place, ſaith, that
they ſhal receiue the greater damnation. This ſaying
is inuiolable (which they likewiſe produce. Alſo
our Sauior Chriſt, (ſpeaking of <hi>Chorazin</hi> &amp; <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi>
he telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it ſhalbe eaſier for <hi>Tyrus</hi> &amp;
