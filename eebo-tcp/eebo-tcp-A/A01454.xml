            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:610:4"/>
the same, to bee translated anew, by a more <hi>Diligent,</hi> and <hi>Zealous Pen;</hi> which hath since travailed in it: And though it stil comes short of that Lively, and Incomparable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which lived and died with the <hi>Authour;</hi> yet I dare avouch it, to
<pb facs="tcp:610:5"/>
bee much more warrantable, and agreeable, than the Former. It is true, this <hi>Booke</hi> was not intended to have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in <hi>English;</hi> But seeing it hath beene, alreadie, made free of that <hi>Language;</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Benefit, or Delight, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound from it;

            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> is an ancient Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Complaint; That <hi>Life</hi> is <hi>Short,</hi> and <hi>Art Long.</hi> Wherefore, it behoveth us, who make it our chiefest Aime, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Arts;</hi> to take upon us, the Consideration, of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing Mans Life; God</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:610:10"/>
the Author, of all <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> prospering our Endevours. For though the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but a Masse, and Accumulation, of Sins, and Sorrowes; And they that looke for an Eternall Life, set but light by a Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; Yet the Continuation of workes of Charity, ought not to be contemned, even by us <hi>Christians.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Beloved Disciple</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> survived the other Disciples; And many of the Fathers of the Church, especially of the Holy Monkes, and Hermits, were
<pb facs="tcp:610:10"/>
long liv'd; which shewes, that this Blessing of <hi>Long life,</hi> so often promised in the old Law, had lesse A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement after our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> Dayes, than other Earthly Blessings had. But to esteeme of this, as the chiefest Good, we are but too prone. Onely the Inquirie is difficult, how to attaine the same; And so much the rather, because it is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with false opinions, and vaine Reports. For both, those Things, which the <hi>Vulgar Physitians</hi> talke, of <hi>Radic all Moisture,</hi> and <hi>Naturall Heat,</hi> are but

            <p>And as for that <hi>Death,</hi> which is caused by Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Putrefaction, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Diseases, wee speake not now; For that pertains to an <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Physick;</hi> But onely of that <hi>Death</hi> which comes by a totall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the Body, and the Inconcoction of old Age. Neverthelesse, the last Act of <hi>Death,</hi> and the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing of <hi>Life</hi> it selfe;
<pb facs="tcp:610:11"/>
which may so many wayes bee wrought, outwardly, and inwardly; (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding have, as it were, one common Porch, before it comes to the point of Death;) will bee perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, to be inquired of in this Treatise; But wee reserve that for the last place.</p>
            <p>That which may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by Degrees, without a Totall waste of the first Stocke, is potentially eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; As the <hi>Vestall Fire.</hi> Therefore, when <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi> saw, that Living Creatures were nourished, and their
<pb facs="tcp:610:12"/>
Bodies repaired; But that this did last only for a time; And afterward came old Age, and, in the end, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; they sought <hi>Death</hi> in somewhat, which could not properly bee repaired; Supposing a <hi>Radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture</hi> incapable of solid Reparation; And which, from the first infancie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Spurious Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but no true Reparation; wherby it grew daily worse and worse; And, in the end, brought the Bad, to None at all. This conceit of theirs, was both ignorant and vain. For all Things, in Living
<pb facs="tcp:610:12"/>
Creatures, are, in their youth, repaired entirely; Nay, they are, for a time, increased in Quantitie, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in Qualitie; so as the Matter of Reparation might be Eternall, if the Manner of Reparation did not faile. But this is the Truth of it: There is, in the Declining of Age, an unequall Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Some Parts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired easily, others with Difficultie, and to their losse; So as, from that time, the Bodies of Men begin to endure the Torment of <hi>Mezentius; That the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving die in the Embraces</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:610:13"/>
               <hi>of the Dead;</hi> And the Parts easily reparable, through their Conjunction with the Parts hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, doe decay. For the <hi>Spirits, Bloud, Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> are, even after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of yeares, easily repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But the Drier, and more Porous parts, (As the <hi>Membranes;</hi> All the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles;</hi> The <hi>Sinewes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Veines, Bones, Cartilages;</hi> Most of the <hi>Bowels;</hi> In a word, almost all the <hi>Organicall parts;</hi>) are hardly Reparable, and to their losse. Now these hardly Reparable Parts,
<pb facs="tcp:610:13"/>
when they come to doe their office, of Repairing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are easily repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, finding themselves deprived of their wonted Abilitie, and strength, cease to performe any longer, their proper Functions. By which meanes, it comes to passe, that in processe of time, the whole tends to Dissolution; And even those very Parts, which in their owne nature, are, with much case, Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; Yet through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the Organs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, can no more receive Reparation; But decline and, in the end, utterly fail.

And the cause of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Life, is this For that the <hi>Spirits,</hi> like a gentle Flame, continually preying upon Bodies; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring with the outward <hi>Aire,</hi> which is ever Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and Drying of them; Doe, in time, destroy the whole Fabricke of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; As also the particular Engines, and Organs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; And make them unable, for the worke, of Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These are the true wayes, of <hi>Naturall Death,</hi> well, and faithfully, to bee revolved in our Mindes. For He that knowes not the
<pb facs="tcp:610:14"/>
wayes of <hi>Nature,</hi> how can he succour her, or turne her about?</p>
            <p>Therefore, the <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ought to bee two-fold: The one touching the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> or <hi>Depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of the Body of Man; The other, touching the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> and <hi>Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the same: To the end, that the Former may, as much as is possible, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and restrained; And the Latter, comforted. The Former of these, pertaines especially, to the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and Outward <hi>Aire;</hi> By which the <hi>Depredation,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:610:15"/>
and Waste, is committed; The Latter, to the whole Race of <hi>Alimentation,</hi> or Nourishment; whereby, the Renovation, or Restitution, is made. And as for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, touching <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;</hi> This hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things common, with <hi>Bodies Inanimate,</hi> or without Life. For such Things, as the <hi>Native Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> (which is in all Tangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bodies, whether Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or without Life;) And the Ambient, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, <hi>Aire,</hi> worketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Bodies Inanimate;</hi> The same it attempteth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:610:15"/>
               <hi>Animate,</hi> or <hi>Living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> Although the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Spirit</hi> super added, doth partly breake, and bridle, those Operations; Partly exalt, and advance them wonderfully. For it is most manifest, that <hi>Inanimate Bodies,</hi> (most of them,) will endure a long time, without any Reparation; But <hi>Bodies Animate,</hi> without Food, and Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, suddenly fall, and are extinguished; As the <hi>Fire</hi> is. So then, our <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> shall be double; First we will consider the <hi>Bodie</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> as <hi>Inanimate,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:610:16"/>
and not <hi>Repaired</hi> by <hi>Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment;</hi> Secondly, as <hi>Animate,</hi> and <hi>Repaired</hi> by <hi>Nourishment.</hi> Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prefaced these Things, we come now to the <hi>Topick</hi> Places of <hi>Inquisition.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Desiccation, or</hi> Consumption, in the Processe thereof, is finished by three <hi>Actions;</hi> And all these, (as was said before,) have their Originall, from the <hi>Native Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The First <hi>Action</hi> is, the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation</hi> of the <hi>Moisture</hi> into <hi>Spirit;</hi> The Second is, the <hi>Issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth,</hi> or <hi>Flight</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> The third is, the <hi>Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of the <hi>Grosser Parts</hi> of the

               <p n="4">4 Touching <hi>Attenuation,</hi> the matter is manifest. For the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is enclosed in every <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Body,</hi> forgets not his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; But whatsoever it meets withall in the Body, (in which it is enclosed,) that it can disgest, and master, and turne into it selfe; That it plainly alters, and subdues, and multiplies it selfe upon it, and begets new <hi>Spirit.</hi> And this is evicted, by one Proofe, in stead of many; For that those Things, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:610:38"/>
any Thing, confers Nothing to the <hi>Weight;</hi> But rather Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it; And therefore it must needs be, that the same <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath turned into it, the <hi>Moisture</hi> and <hi>Juyce</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> which <hi>weighed</hi> before; By which Meanes the <hi>Weight</hi> is lessened. And this is the first <hi>Action;</hi> The <hi>Attenuation</hi> of the <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> and Converting it into <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 The second <hi>Action,</hi> which is the <hi>Issuing forth</hi> or <hi>Flight</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is as manifest also. For that <hi>Issuing forth,</hi> when it is in throngs, is apparent even to the Sense; In <hi>Vapours,</hi> to the Sight; In <hi>Odours,</hi> to the Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: But if it issueth forth slowly; (As when a Thing is decayed by <hi>Age,</hi>) then it is not apparent to the Sense; But the Matter is the same. Againe, where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:610:39"/>
of the Body, is either so Strait, or so Tenacious, That the <hi>Spirit</hi> can finde no Pores, or Passages, by which to depart, Then, in the striving to get out, it drives before it the grosser Parts of the Body; And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes them beyond the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, or Surface of the Bodit; As it is in the <hi>Rust</hi> of <hi>Metals;</hi> And <hi>Mould</hi> of all <hi>Fat Things.</hi> And this is the second <hi>Action;</hi> The <hi>Issuing forth,</hi> or <hi>Flight</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>

               <p n="6">6 The third <hi>Action,</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more obscure, but full as certaine: That is; The <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> of the <hi>Grosser Parts,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Spirit</hi> issued forth.

               <p n="1">1 There are more kindes of <hi>Birds,</hi> found to bee long liv'd, than of <hi>Beasts;</hi> (As the <hi>Eagle</hi> the <hi>Vultur,</hi> the <hi>Kite,</hi> the <hi>Peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> the <hi>Raven,</hi> the <hi>Crow,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> the <hi>Goose,</hi> the <hi>Storke,</hi> the <hi>Crane,</hi> the <hi>Bird</hi> called the <hi>Ibis,</hi> the <hi>Parret,</hi> the <hi>Ring Dove,</hi> with the rest;) Though they come to their full Growth, within a yeare; And are lesse of Bodies.

of the wether; And besides, living, for the most part, in the open Aire, they are like the Inhabitants of pure Mountaines, which are long liv'd. Againe, their <hi>Motion;</hi> which, (as we else where said,) is a mixt <hi>Motion;</hi> Compounded of a Moving of their Lims, and of a Carriage in the Aire; doth lesse wearie, and weare them; And is more wholesome. Neither doe they suffer any Compression, or want of Nourishment, in their Mothers Bellies; Because the Egges are laid by Turnes: But the chiesest cause of all, I take to be this; That <hi>Birds</hi> are made more of the substance of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than of the Father; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Spirit is not so eager, and hot.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It may bee a position; That <hi>Creatures,</hi> which partake more

               <p n="3">3 The <hi>First Breeding</hi> of <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> is ever most Materiall, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their Hurt, or Benefit And therefore it stands with Reason; That the <hi>lesser Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> and the more <hi>liberall Alimentation,</hi> of the <hi>young</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:610:53"/>
                  <hi>one,</hi> in the wombe, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre much to <hi>Long Life;</hi> Now this happens, when either the young ones are brought forth successively, as in <hi>Birds;</hi> Or when they are single Births; As in Creatures bearing but one at a Burthen.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But <hi>long Bearing,</hi> in the <hi>wombe,</hi> makes for <hi>Length</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> three wayes. First, for that the young one partakes more of the substance of the Mother; As hath beene said. Secondly, that it comes forth, more strong, and able. Thirdly, that it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes the predatorie Force of the Aire, sater. Besides it shewes, that Nature intendeth to finish her periods, by larger Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Now though <hi>Oxen,</hi> and <hi>Sheepe,</hi> which are borne in the wombe, about six Moneths, are but short liv'd: That hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens

                  </gap> Herbs, are but short Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; And Creatures, feeding upon Flesh, or Seeds, or Fruits, long Livers; As some <hi>Birds</hi> are. As for <hi>Harts,</hi> which are long liv'd; They <hi>take the one Halfe of their Meat,</hi> (As men use to say,) <hi>from above their Heads.</hi> And the <hi>Goose,</hi> besides Grasse, findeth something in the water, and stubble, to feed upon.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Wee suppose, that a good <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> maketh much to <hi>long Life:</hi> For it Fenceth, and Armeth, against the Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the Aire, which dot wonderfully Assaile, and Decay, the Body: which Benefit <hi>Birds</hi> especially have.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:610:54"/>

               <p n="7">7 The Seat of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> without doubt, is principally the Head: Which though it bee usually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, of the <hi>Animall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> onely, yet this is all in all. Againe, it is not to bee doubted, but the <hi>Spirits</hi> doe, most of all, waste, and prey upon the Body; so that, wher they are either in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plentie; Or in greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and Acrimonie; There the life is much shortned. And therefore wee conceive, a great Cause of long life, in <hi>Birds,</hi> to bee; The Smalnesse of their Heads, in comparison of their Bodies: For even Men, which have very great Heads, wee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be the shorter Livers.</p>
               <p n="8">8 We are os opinion; That <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> is of all other Motions, the most helpfull to long life; which

               <p n="9">9 Those <hi>Creatures</hi> which are long, before they come to their perfection; (Net speaking of Growth in stature onely, but of other steps to Maturitie; As Manputs forth, First his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:610:56"/>
are scarcely nourished with Plants alone. Perhaps, <hi>Fruits,</hi> or <hi>Graines,</hi> baked, or boyled, may, with long use, nourish them; But <hi>Leaves,</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> or <hi>Herbs,</hi> will not doe it; As the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Foliatanes,</hi> shewed by Experience.</p>

As for <hi>Men,</hi> which are <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> they feed not ordinarily upon <hi>Mens</hi> Flesh; But reserve it as a Dainty, either to serve their Revenge upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or to satisfie their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite at some times.

For a young <hi>Slip,</hi> or <hi>Cions,</hi> is not so well nourished, if it bee pricked into the Ground; As if it be grafted into a Stecke, agreeing wich it in Nature; And where it findes the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment alreadie disgested, and prepared: Neither, (as is reported,) will the <hi>Seed</hi> of an <hi>Onion,</hi> or some such like, sown in the bare earth, bring forth so large a Fruit, as if it be put

               <p n="8">8 It is a strange Thing, of the <hi>Stalkes</hi> of <hi>Fruits;</hi> That all the Nourishment, which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, sometimes, such great Fruits, should bee forced to passe thorow so narrow Necks: For the Fruit is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver joyn'd to the Stock, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some stalke.</p>

But <hi>Elizeus</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> may seeme to have died, when he was above an hundred yeares old; For he is found to have lived after the <hi>Assumption</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> sixty yeares; And at the Time of that <hi>Assumption,</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:610:104"/>
there are a few Things, and those of very great Moment, of which we would have Men to bee fore-warned.</p>
               <p>First, wee are of that Opinion, that wee esteeme the <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> to bee more worthy than <hi>Life</hi> it selfe. Therefore, if there be any Thing of that kinde, that may indeed exactly answer our Intentions, yet so, that the <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> bee thereby hindred; whatsoever it be of this kind; wee reject it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, wee may make some light Mention, of such Things, but wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not upon them. For wee make no serieus, nor diligent Discourse; Either of hading the life in Caves, where the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Beames, and severall changes of the Aire, pierce not; Like <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </hi> his <hi>Cave;</hi> Or of perpe tuall Baths, made of Liquour,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:610:104"/>
prepared; Or of Shirts, and Seare-cloathes, so applied, that the Body should bee alwayes, as it were, in a Box; Or of thick Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Body, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of some <hi>Barbarous Nations;</hi> Or of an exact Ordering, of our Life, and Diet, which aimeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyat this, and mindeth nothing else, but that a Man live; (As was that of <hi>Herodicus,</hi> amongst the Ancients; And of <hi>Corna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the <hi>Venetian;</hi> in our Dayes, but with greater Moderation;) Or of any such prodigie, Tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or Inconvenience: But wee propound such Remedies, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by which the <hi>Offices</hi> of Life may neither be deserted, nor receive any great Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Mo'estations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, on the other side, wee denounce unto Men, that they would give over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; And
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:610:105"/>
not imagine, that so great a Works as the Stopping, and Turning back, the powerfull Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can bee brought to passe by some Morning Draught, or the Taking of some precious Drug; But that they would bee assured, that it must needs be, that this is a work of labour; And consisteth of many Remedies, and a fit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of them amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; For no Man can bee so stupid, as to imagine, that what was never yet done, can bee done, but by such wayes, as were never yet attempted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ingenuously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse; That some of those Things, which we shall propound, have not been tried by us, by way of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment; (For our Course of life doth not permit that;) But are derived, (as wee suppose) upon good Reason, out of our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:610:105"/>
and Grounds; (of which, some we set downe, others we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in our Minde;) And are, as it were, cut, and digged out of the <hi>Rocke,</hi> and <hi>Mine</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> Her selfe. Neverthelesse, wee have been carefull, and that with all Providence and Circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (Seeing the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Man; That it is more worth than Raiment;</hi>) To propound such Remedies; as may at least be safe, if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they be not Fruitfull.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we would have Men rightly to observe, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish; That those Things which are good for an <hi>Healthful Life,</hi> are not alwayes good for a <hi>Long Life.</hi> For there are some Things which doe further the Alacrity of the Spirits, and the Strength and Vigour of the Functions, which, notwithstanding, do cut off from

               <p n="1">1 ALthough a good <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,</hi> performed by the <hi>Inward Parts,</hi> bee the principall, towards a perfect Alimentation; yet the Actions, of the <hi>Outward Parts,</hi> ought also to concurre;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:610:168"/>
That like as the <hi>Inward Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> sendeth forth, and extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Aliment; So the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie</hi> of the <hi>Outward Parts,</hi> may call forth, and attract the same: And the more weake the <hi>Facultie</hi> of <hi>Concoction,</hi> shall be; The more need is there, of a Concurring Helpe, of the <hi>Attractive Facultie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 A <hi>Strong Attraction,</hi> of the <hi>Outward Parts,</hi> is chiefly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by the <hi>Motion,</hi> of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> By which, the Parts being Heated, and Comforted; Doe more cheerfully, call forth, and <hi>attract,</hi> the Aliment, unto themselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But this is most of all, to be foreseen, and avoided; That the same <hi>Motion,</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which cals the new Juyce to the Members; Doth not againe despoile the Member
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:610:168"/>
of that Juyce, wherewith it had beene before refreshed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Frications,</hi> used in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, serve especially, to this Intention; But this must ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more accompany them; That after the <hi>Frication,</hi> the Part be lightly annointed with Oyle; Left the Attrition, of the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts,</hi> make them by Perspiration, Dry, and Juyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The next is <hi>Exercise,</hi> (by which the Parts confricate, and chafe themselves;) so it bee Moderate; And which, (as was noted before,) be not Swift, nor to the utmost Strength, nor unto wearinesse. But in <hi>Exercise,</hi> and in <hi>Frica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> there is the same Reason, and Caution; That the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, may not perspire, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, too much: Therefore,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:610:169"/>
                  <hi>Exercise</hi> is better in the oper Aire, than in the House; And better in Winter, than in Summer: And againe, <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> is not onely to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Vnction,</hi> as <hi>Frication</hi> is; But in vehement <hi>Exercises, Vnction</hi> is to bee used, both in the Beginning, and in the End; As it was anciently to <hi>Champions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 That <hi>Exercise,</hi> may resolve, either the Spirits, or the Juy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as little as may be, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, that it be used, when the Stomach is not altogether Emptie. And therefore, that it may not bee used, upon full Stomach, (which doth much concerne Health;) Nor yet upon an Emptie Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, (which doth no lesse concerne Long Life;) It is best, to take a <hi>Breakfast</hi> in the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:610:169"/>
Morning; Not of any Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Drugs, or of any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours, or of Raisins, or of Figs, or the like; But of plaine Meat, and Drink; yet that very light, and in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Quantitie.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Exercise,</hi> used for the Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Members, ought to be Equall, to all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Not, (as <hi>Socrates</hi> said,) <hi>that the Legs should move, and the Armes should rest;</hi> Or, on the contrarie; But that all the Parts may participate of the Motion. And it is altogether requisite to long Life, that the Body should never abide long in one <hi>posture,</hi> But that every halfe houre, at least, it change the <hi>posture;</hi> Saving only in Sleepe.</p>

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:610:171"/>
cheerfully, than a Simple, and Homogeneous Diet doth: Besides, it is more Forcible, to stirre up <hi>Appetite;</hi> which is the Spur of <hi>Disgestion.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we allow, both a <hi>Full Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and a <hi>continuall changing of Dishes,</hi> according to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeare, or upon other occasions.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Also that Opinion, of the <hi>Simplicitie</hi> of <hi>Meats,</hi> without <hi>Sawces,</hi> is but a Simplicity of Judgement: For good, and well chosen, <hi>Sawces,</hi> are the most wholesome preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Meats; And conduce, both to Health, and to Long Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It must bee ordered that with <hi>Meats,</hi> hard of Disgesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be conjoyned, strong <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours;</hi> And <hi>Sawces,</hi> that may penetrate, and make way; But

               <p n="7">7 <hi>Roasting</hi> ought to bee with a quick fire, and soone dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; Not with a dull Fire, and in long time.</p>
               <p n="8">8 All <hi>Solide Fleshes,</hi> ought to be served in, not altogether <hi>Fresh,</hi> but somewhat <hi>powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> or <hi>Corned:</hi> The lesse <hi>Salt</hi> may bee spent at the Table, with them, or none at all: For

               </p>
               <p n="10">10 But <hi>Beatings,</hi> and as it were <hi>Scourgings,</hi> of Flesh Meats, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bee boiled, would work no small Matter.

and <hi>Beaten,</hi> become more tender, and wholesome. Also <hi>Hard,</hi> and <hi>Sowre Peares,</hi> and some other <hi>Fruits,</hi> grow sweet with Rowling them. It were good to practise some such Beating, and Bruising, of the Harder kindes of Fleshes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they bee brought to the Fire.

               <p n="11">11 <hi>Bread,</hi> a little <hi>leavened,</hi> and very little <hi>salted,</hi> is best: And which is baked in an oven, thorowly heated, and not with a faint Heat.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The <hi>Preparation</hi> of Drinks in order to long Life, shall not exceed one precept. And as touching <hi>Water Drinkers,</hi> wee have Nothing to say; Such a Diet, (as wee said before,) may prolong life to an Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

Things, which may conduce thereunto.

            <p>TOuching the <hi>last Act</hi> of <hi>Assimilation,</hi> (unto which the three <hi>Operations,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding, chiefly tend) our Advice shall be briefe, and single. And the Thing it selfe, rather needs Explication, than any various Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1 IT is certaine, that all Bodies are endued with some Desire of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:610:176"/>
               <hi>Assimilating</hi> those things which are next them: Tuis the Rare, and Pneumaticall Bodies; As <hi>Flame, Spirit, Airt</hi> performe generously, and with Alacritie; On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, those that carrie a Grosse, and Tangible Bulke about them; Doe but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: In regard, that the Desire, of <hi>Assimilating</hi> other Thing, is bound in, by a stronger De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Rest, and Containing themselves from <hi>Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe, it is certaine, That that Desire of <hi>Assimilating,</hi> being bound, as wee said, in a Grosse Body, and made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; Is somewhat freed, and stirred up, by the <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Neighbouring Spirit;</hi> So that it is then Actuated: which is the onely cause, why <hi>Inanimates Assimilate</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:610:176"/>
not, and <hi>Animates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 This also is certaine, That the Harder the Consistence of the Body is, the more doth that Body stand in need, of a Greater Heat, to prick forward the <hi>Assimilation:</hi> Which fals out ill for old Men; because in them the Parts are more Obstinate, and the Heat weaker: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either the Obstinacie of their Parts, is to be softned, or their Heat increased. And as touching the <hi>Malacissation,</hi> or <hi>Mollifying</hi> of the Members, we shall speak afterward; Having also formerly propounded many Things, which pertaine to the prohibiting, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, of this kinde of Hardnesse. For the other, touching the Increasing of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:610:177"/>
the Heat, wee will now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a single precept; After wee have first assumed this <hi>Axiome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Assimilation,</hi> (which, as we said, is excited, by the Heat circumfused,) in a Motion exceeding Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Subtile, and in Little. Now all such Motions doe then come to their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, when the <hi>Locall Motion</hi> wholly ceaseth, which distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it. For the <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> into <hi>Homogeneall</hi> parts, which is in <hi>Milke;</hi> That the <hi>Creame</hi> should swim above, and the <hi>Whey</hi> sink to the bottome, will never work, if the <hi>Milk</hi> bee never so little agitated: Neither will any <hi>Puterfaction</hi> proceed in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Mixt Bodies, if the same be in Continuall <hi>Local</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:610:177"/>
               <hi>Motion.</hi> So then, from this <hi>Assumption,</hi> we will conclude this, for the present Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The <hi>Act</hi> it selfe, of <hi>Assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> is chiefly accomplished in Sleepe, and Rest; Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, towards the Morning, the Distribution being finished: Therefore, we have nothing else to advise, but that Men keep Themselves <hi>Hot,</hi> in their <hi>Sleepe:</hi> And further, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Morning, there be used some <hi>Annointing,</hi> or <hi>Shirt</hi>

               <p n="3">3 This <hi>Operation,</hi> (if perhaps it bee within our power,) is most likely to bee done, by <hi>Baths, Vnctions,</hi> and the like: Concerning which, these Things that follow, are to be observed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 We must not be too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Hoping to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish this matter from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of those Things which we see done, in the <hi>Imbibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Macerations</hi> of <hi>Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates:</hi>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:610:179"/>
By which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenerated: whereof we intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced some Instances before: For this kinde of <hi>Operation,</hi> is more Easie upon <hi>Inanimates,</hi> Because they attract, and suck in the Liquour. But upon the Bodies of Living Creatures it is Harder; Because, in them, the Motion rather tendeth outward, and to the <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Therefore, the <hi>Emollient Baths,</hi> which are in use, doe little good, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hurt; Because they rather draw forth, than make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; And resolve the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Body, rather than consolidate it.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The <hi>Baths,</hi> and <hi>Vnctions,</hi> which may serve to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Operation;</hi> (Namely, of <hi>Intenerating</hi> the <hi>Body,</hi> truly
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:610:180"/>
and really,) ought to have three properties.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The First and Principall, is; That they consist of those <hi>Things,</hi> which in their <hi>Whole Substance,</hi> are <hi>Like</hi> unto the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> of Man; And which have a <hi>Feeding,</hi> and <hi>Nursing</hi> Vertue, from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The Second, is; That they be mixed with such Things, as through the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of their <hi>Parts,</hi> may <hi>Make Entrance;</hi> And so insinuate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh their <hi>Nourishing Vertue,</hi> into the <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 The Third, is; That they receive some <hi>Mixture</hi> (though much inferiour to the rest,) of such Things as are <hi>Astringent;</hi> I meane, not Sowre or Tart Things; But Unctuous, and Comforting; That while the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:610:180"/>
other two do operate, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of the Body, which destroyeth the Vertue of the Things <hi>Intenerating,</hi> may (as much as is possible,) be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; And the Motion to the Inward Parts, by the <hi>Astriction</hi> of the Skin, and Closing of the Passages, may be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and furthered.</p>
               <p n="10">10 That which is most <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall,</hi> to the Body of Man, is <hi>Warme Bloud,</hi> either of Man, or of some other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But the Device of <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> Touching the Sucking of <hi>Bloud</hi> out of the Arme of a wholesome young Man; For the Restauration of Strength in Old men; is very Frivolous; For that, which nourisheth from within, ought no way to be Equall, or Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the Body nourished;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:610:181"/>
But in some sort, Inferiour, and Subordinate, that it may be converted: But in Things applyed outwardly, by how much the <hi>Substance</hi> is <hi>Liker,</hi> by so much the <hi>Consent</hi> is better.</p>
               <p n="11">11 It hath been anciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; That a <hi>Bath</hi> made of the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> will cure the <hi>Leprosie,</hi> and heale the Flesh already putrified: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that this Thing hath begot Envie towards some <hi>Kings,</hi> from the Common people.</p>
               <p n="12">12 It is reported, that <hi>Heradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for cure of the <hi>Dropsie,</hi> was put into the <hi>Warme Belly</hi> of an <hi>Oxe,</hi> newly slaine.</p>
               <p n="13">13 They use the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi> warme; To cure the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease called <hi>Saint Anthonies Fire;</hi> And to restore the Flesh and Skin.</p>

                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:610:181"/>
14 An <hi>Arme,</hi> or other <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> newly cut off; Or that, upon some other Occasion, will not leave <hi>Bleeding;</hi> Is, with good successe, put into the <hi>Belly</hi> of some <hi>Creature, Newly ripped up;</hi> For it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth potently, to Stanch the <hi>Bloud;</hi> The <hi>Bloud</hi> of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cut off, by consent sucking in, and vehemently drawing to it selfe, the <hi>Warme Bloud</hi> of the Creature Slaine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it selfe is Stopped, and retireth.</p>
               <p n="15">15 It is much used in <hi>Extreme</hi> and <hi>Desperate Diseases,</hi> to cut in two young <hi>Pigeons,</hi> yet Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and to apply them to the <hi>Soles</hi> of the <hi>Feet,</hi> and to shift them one after another; whereby, sometime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Reparation</hi> of these same <hi>lesse Reparable Parts,</hi> all our Forces would bee employed.
