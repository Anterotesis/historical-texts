            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Declaration of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty at the Rendezvous at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> 
               <date>
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. 1688.</date>
            </head>
            <p>We the Nobility, Gentry, and Commonalty of theſe Northern Counties aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> for the defence of the Laws, Religion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, according to thoſe free-born Liberties and Priviledges, deſcended to us from our Anceſtors, as the undoubted Birth-right of the Subjects of this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> (not doubting but the Infringers and Invaders of our Rights will repreſent us to the reſt of the Nation in the moſt malicious dreſs they can put upon us) do here unanimouſly think it our Duty to declare to the reſt of our Proteſtant Fellow-Subjects the Grounds of our preſent Undertaking.</p>
            <p>We are by innumerable Grievances made ſenſible, that the very Fundamentals of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Liberties, and Properties are about to be rooted out by our late Jeſuitical Privy-Council, as hath been of late too apparent, 1. By the King's diſpenſing with all the Eſtabliſht Laws at his pleaſure. 2. By diſplacing all Officers out of all Offices of Truſt and Advantage, and placing others in their room that are known Papiſts, deſervedly made incapable by the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Laws of our Land. 3. By deſtroying the Charters of moſt Corporations in the Land. 4. By diſcouraging all perſons that are not Papiſts, preferring ſuch as turn to Popery 5. By diſplacing all honeſt and conſcientious Judges, unleſs they would, contrary to their Conſciences, declare that to be Law which was meerly arbitrary. 6. By branding all men with the name of Rebels that but offered to juſtifie the Laws in a legal Courſe againſt the arbitrary proceedings of the King, or any of his corrupt Miniſters. 7. By burthening the Nation with an Army, to maintain the violation of the Rights of the Subjects. 8. By diſcountenancing the Eſtabliſht Reform'd Religion. 9. By forbidding the Subjects the benefit of petitioning, and conſtruing them Libellers; ſo rendring the Laws a Noſe of Wax, to ſerve their arbitrary Ends. And many more ſuch like, too long here to enumerate.</p>
            <p>We being thus made ſadly ſenſible of the Arbitrary, and Tyrannical Government that is by the Influence of Jeſuitical Councels coming upon us, do unanimouſly declare, That not being willing to deliver our poſterity over to ſuch a condition of Popery and Slavery, as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Oppreſſions inevitably threaten; we will to the utmoſt of our power oppoſe the ſame, by joining with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (whom we hope God Almighty hath ſent to reſcue us from the Oppreſſions aforeſaid) will uſe our utmoſt Endeavours for the recovery of our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ruin'd Laws, Liberties, and Religion; and herein we hope all good Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will with their Lives and Fortunes be aſſiſtant to us, and not be bugbear'd with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious terms of Rebels, by which they would fright us, to become perfect Slaves to their tyrannical Inſolencies and Uſurpations; for we aſſure our ſelves, that no rational and unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed perſon will judge it Rebellion to defend our Laws and Religion, which all our Princes have Sworn at their Coronations; which Oath, how well it hath been obſerved of late, we deſire a Free Parliament may have the Conſideration of.</p>
            <p>We own it Rebellion to reſiſt a King that governs by Law; but he was always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Tyrant that made his Will the Law; and to reſiſt ſuch an one, we juſtly eſteem no Rebellion, but a neceſſary Defence; and in this Conſideration we doubt not of all honeſt mens aſſiſtance, and humbly hope for, and implore the great God's protection, that turneth the hearts of his people as pleaſeth him beſt; it having been obſerved, That people can never be of one mind without his inſpiration, which hath in all Ages confirmed that obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Vox Populi eſt Vox Dei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent reſtoring of Charters, and reverſing the oppreſſing and unjuſt Judgment given on <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge Fellows, is plain, are but to ſtill the people, like Plums to Children, by deceiving them for a while; but if they ſhall by this Stratagem be fooled, till this preſent ſtorm that threatens the Papiſts, be paſt, aſſoon as they ſhall be reſetled, the former Oppreſſion will be put on with greater vigour; but we hope in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of the Birds: For (1.) The Papiſts old Rule is, <hi>That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks,</hi> as they term Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, tho' the Popiſh Religion is the greateſt Hereſie. And (2.) Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> ſo ill obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her promiſes to the <hi>Suffolk</hi>-men that helpt her to her Throne. And above all, (3.) the Popes diſpenſing with the breach of Oaths, Treaties, or Promiſes, at his pleaſure, when it makes for the ſervice of Holy Church, as they term it. Theſe, we ſay, are ſuch convincing Reaſons to hinder us from giving Credit to the aforeſaid <hi>Mock-Shews</hi> of Redreſs, that we think our ſelves bound in Conſcience to reſt on no Security that ſhall not be approved by a freely Elected Parliament, to whom, under God, we refer our Cauſe.</p>
