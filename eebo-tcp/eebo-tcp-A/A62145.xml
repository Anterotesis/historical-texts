         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I prefix this really before I write more of the matter; And
therefore to pretend excuse for what shall follow amiss, might
seem a presumptuous sin, as if I meant to offend: Not, but
that Offences will come, and may be found out hereafter, more
properly then to be summ'd up in the end of all, and added to

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Design is <hi>History;</hi> commonly divided into 3. Kinds.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Memorials,</hi> A naked Narrative without contexrure of
Things and Actions.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Antiquity,</hi> The Shipwrack of <hi>History,</hi> somewhat saved
<pb facs="tcp:60657:3"/>
from the Deluge of <hi>Distruction,</hi> and so subject to question, as
that excellent <hi>History of the World,</hi> done by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi>
with exact diligence; which yet indures the examination of
his Errours, by One, who in truth took much pains to worst it
the more (that <hi>Master-peice)</hi> by the <hi>Epitomy,</hi> which (besides the
injury to the Work it self) becomes unprofitable to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
expectation. With these two kinds we mean not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                  <p>3. But with <hi>Perfect History,</hi> being in truth that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
a <hi>Chronocled Time,</hi> representing the life of a Prince,
with the Narrative of actions relative; therefore with little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of different opinions, may be accounted the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
for Estimation, Profit and Use in the magnitude of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this nature, Our <hi>Histories</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are said to be
defective in the Main; And for that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> too too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
as done by different affections and interest in matters <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi>
and <hi>Civil.</hi> Therefore it hath been accounted worthy the
labour, to mold them both into one Body joined to these times
from their first conjunction in Union of the <hi>Roses,</hi> to the uniting
of the <hi>Kingdomes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The latter hath been in some sort set out (single) to our hand
by a <hi>Compendium</hi> of the 5. King <hi>Iames</hi>'s, immediately succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
each other, and lately done by <hi>William Drummond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After whom we intend to take up the <hi>Remain;</hi> Beginning
where he leaves, with the birth of <hi>Mary</hi> instantly succeeding
the Death of her Father <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth with the contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
actions of neighbour Princes. And so to her Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
<hi>Iames</hi> the sixth; and (after the death of <hi>Queen Elizabeth)</hi>
of <hi>Great Brittain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> the first, and last King
compleat, in right of issue descended from <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldest
Daughter unto <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> the
fourth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Re-union in that antient Title of
<hi>Brittain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in brief;<note place="margin">Henry 7.</note> The first Union of Marriage begat a present
Peace,<note place="margin">James 4.</note> between <hi>Henry the seventh</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Iames the
fourth</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And at that instant, <hi>Scotland</hi> brought forth
a Prodigious Monster of Man; under the waste like other men,
the Members both, for use and comliness were two; and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it was indifferent to which of the two Bulks the Legs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.
This <hi>Bifrons</hi> had different passions and divers wills;
chiding each other, and quarreling; until by over-wrangling,
they unwillingly agreed, and was cherished by the King, taught
languages, and lived eighteen years. <hi>A Monstrous Omen to the
Union.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Iames</hi> was young and active, for twenty five years of
<pb facs="tcp:60657:3"/>
his Reign, having occasion to cope with two <hi>Henries,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
and Eighth of <hi>England,</hi> Father and Son successively. The
first took his Entry here by <hi>Arms,</hi> and Establishment by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Yet the times proved to him, like strong Tides, full of
Swellings, but well mannaged by the wisdome of an able Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
through all storms; being of himself the most sufficient
<hi>Sovereign</hi> of any his <hi>Predecessours.</hi> Between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi>
the fourth, there had been distempers, ever espousing the <hi>French</hi>
Quarrels. And therefore their times produced sundry great
mutations, treacherous, false and deceiving, the events bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Beginnings. Princes</hi> mostly inconsiderate, before they
imbarque, whether their Wars be just or necessary, and may
serve <hi>Examples</hi> of great mens <hi>frailty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, succeeded his Son
<hi>Henry</hi> the eight, young and wealthy, whose actions had more
of <hi>Gallantry</hi> than <hi>Honour,</hi> though he meddled with the mixed
Affairs for ballancing the <hi>Western Monarchy</hi> amongst the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
<hi>Germany, Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> with the change of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
to reformed. And so soon as ingaged against <hi>Louis</hi> of
<hi>France, Iames</hi> interposed, as to divert him. Enters upon <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
invades the <hi>English Borders,</hi> and after comes to handy
blowes in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> six and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sann,
the <hi>Scots</hi> many more; and at <hi>Flowden Field</hi> 1513. a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
slaughter on both sides, and <hi>Iames</hi> in the Fight was lost,
as in a Fog, for ever; though he acted so well his affected Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity,
that his loss became more disconsolate to his People,
than any his <hi>Predecessors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Son succeeds,<note place="margin">James 5.</note> a cradle King, seventeen Moneths old, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Tutelage of his Mother, who implores <hi>Henry</hi> her <hi>Brother,</hi>
for compassion upon a <hi>Widow-Sister,</hi> and an <hi>Orphan-Nephew,</hi> not
to wage War, but to defend them. He answers like himself,
<hi>With the mild he was meek, and with the froward he could fight.</hi>
But she too weak for her wild Subjects, marries with the Earl
of <hi>Angus,</hi> and being disdained for matching so meanly, the
Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> race <hi>(begotten in Exile)</hi> is sent for
out of <hi>France</hi> to govern them at home. The success may soon
be imagined; for the <hi>Scots</hi> heretofore had killed <hi>Iames</hi> the first,
covenanted with <hi>Iames</hi> the second, overthrown <hi>Iames</hi> the
third, and (some say) mislaied <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, and now hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submit to a Stranger.</p>
                  <p>The Queen and <hi>Angus</hi> fly to <hi>England,</hi> and here she is brought
to Bed of <hi>Margaret,</hi> Grand-Mother to King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth.
Conspiracies increase in <hi>Scotland,</hi> fomented from <hi>Henry</hi> the
eighth, till horrid Rapines, wearied each party into a Peace at
home, and <hi>England</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>And thus freed from War for a time, the <hi>Governour</hi> Duke
<pb facs="tcp:60657:4"/>
executes Justice upon such whose former fewds had made but
suspitious, and so he wearied with doing evil, returns into <hi>France</hi>
to settle their <hi>Solemn League.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gone <hi>Henry the eight sends home the Queen and</hi> Angus, and

instigating the King to fall out with <hi>France;</hi> the like
<hi>Empirick Balm</hi> the <hi>French</hi> apply to cure the wounds of the <hi>Scots</hi>

meet, but the <hi>Scots</hi> would not fight; the <hi>English</hi> fire all before

                  <p>The first that suffered in suspition of those attempts, were the
<hi>Hameltons,</hi> of Kin to the Crown; which wrought factions to such
height as that King <hi>Henry</hi> takes heart, begins by Incursions,
where the <hi>English</hi> were soundly beaten. And then in Revenge
<hi>Howard,</hi> stiled the <hi>Old Earl of Norfolk,</hi> is sent with formidable
Forces, 40000. to 30000. (if the sums are not mistaken) either
party so numerous, as to eat up all and starve themselves, But
upon some distrust of success, the Earl retreats. The <hi>Scots</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
this advantage. And the next Spring mutiny among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and at <hi>Salloway Moss</hi> the <hi>English</hi> gave them a mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat;

remaining to succeed him in his Throne.</p>

                     <hi>King Iames,</hi> with re-union of the antient <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Britain, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>
indeed succeeded in the Inheritance begotten by <hi>H.</hi> 8.
upon <hi>Ann Bullen;</hi> after his divorce from <hi>Katharine</hi> his Brothers
widow, by whom he had Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and that mariage dispensed
with by the Pope. Hence did arise a question;</p>
                  <p>Whether the Divorce was legal, or <hi>Elizabeth</hi> legitimate?
when <hi>Adam</hi> was created, <hi>Eve</hi> was taken out of him, and made
<hi>Woman,</hi> a fit Instrument for prolification and Society. And both
married in <hi>Paradice, God the Father being the Priest, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
Witnesses;</hi> for which cause, <hi>A man shall leave Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and cleave to his Wife.</hi> They begat Sons and Daughters,
which were Brothers and Sisters, and married one the other
without contradiction, untill the Flood, nay, after the Flood,
untill <hi>Moses</hi> writ. And these Marriages were not against the
<hi>Moral</hi> Law written in their hearts (which being much oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the faculties of the Soul by reason of <hi>Adams</hi> transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when <hi>Moses</hi> writ the Law of Nature <hi>(or Law of Reason)</hi> it
was therefore twice written in <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Stone,</hi> that by reading
those Precepts (which were much defaced within) man might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
in some measure, those Laws almost blotted out by sin. And
so by reading get them into his <hi>Understanding, Will</hi> and <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
Mans <hi>Knowledge</hi> comming most naturally by Sense. <hi>Moses</hi>
did not onely write this <hi>Morall</hi> Law in Stone, but gave many
positive Laws for the <hi>Pedagogie</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> untill <hi>Christ,</hi> as the
<hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Iudicial.</hi> The <hi>Iudicial Lawes,</hi> amongst other
things did forbid Marriages in cases of blood and affinity, and
these continued until <hi>Christs</hi> time, and no longer, unless there
were a Moral Equity in them, which <hi>Morality</hi> is onely <hi>inter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendentes
&amp; descendentes,</hi> where there is a kind of <hi>Paternity</hi> and
<hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ation,</hi> for <hi>Filius non portabit iniquitatem Patris;</hi> and for that
sin <hi>Iacob</hi> cursed <hi>Reuben,</hi> for <hi>ascending his Fathers bed.</hi> This
ground being truly laid, it was conceived, there is no Law of
God in force, but that which is between <hi>Ascendents</hi> and <hi>Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi>
It is true, every Church hath made Laws to bind people
in their Churches; but it was insisted upon only in this, That
the <hi>Moral Law</hi> doth not forbid, and the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Laws</hi> are now abrogated. In Sir <hi>Giles Allingtons</hi> case (not long
since) who married his <hi>Sisters</hi> Daughter, there was a sin against
the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and so they were divorced. But it was said in
that case, that if the <hi>Aunt</hi> had married the <hi>Nephew,</hi> it had been
<pb facs="tcp:60657:6"/>
a greater sin, because the <hi>Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t</hi> being in <hi>loco Parent is</hi> to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,</hi>
he by such marriage being <hi>Husband</hi> to the <hi>Aunt,</hi> became
by that Relation <hi>Superiour</hi> to his <hi>Parent,</hi> which did aggravate
the offence. So then that which is to be insisted upon is the law
<hi>Moral,</hi> which is the constant and permanent will of God, both
in the <hi>Church Triumphant</hi> and <hi>Militant.</hi> So that <hi>Adam</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
marry any, if he had lived until this time, being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Parent of <hi>Mankind</hi> in the <hi>Old World,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much concerning the Divorce, and <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>

For alwaies unto established Governments, Successors are soon
suspected; The People most usually, upon dislike of present
things, look up after the rising Sun, and forsake the setting.
Nor is it customary with Successors designed, to keep their own
hopes, and other mens lewd desires, within the compass of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and truth; and thereby also to cut off the likelyhood of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
security, by hanging before their own eies their winding

the same.</p>

conserve their Liberty; The mutual Love of both Kingdomes,

                  <p>It was but slowly considered; upon these grounds, That
the <hi>Scots</hi> were poor, bare of Money and Munition, unfaithful

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60657:28"/>
and so was it time for the <hi>English</hi> to strike in for a share,
if not to prevent such Neighbour-hood, upon that Rule, <hi>Let
the</hi> French <hi>be thy Friend, but not thy Neighbour,</hi> and indeed were
afraid of an invasion, as was threatned, upon several Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>And first the <hi>English</hi> Counsellors wisely considered, not to
provoke, nor to give bad Examples for Princes, to lend Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to rebellious Subjects <hi>(For so all Potentates esteemed the</hi>
Scots <hi>against their Sovereign.)</hi> And on the other side, it might
be accounted little <hi>Piety,</hi> to forsake a <hi>Protestant</hi> Party, for so the
Religion would have them. But concluded it reasonable to be
in Arms, and to expect occasions; It being alwaies the <hi>English</hi>
fore-sight to prevent invasion at home.<note place="margin">Gain assistance from Englan.</note> On the sudden it was

                  <p>This Result might be grounded on former <hi>Examples;</hi> by the

to the <hi>French.</hi> Upon which score, lest <hi>Berwick</hi> and the <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
should be surprized, forces are sent by Land thither, and by

produces the <hi>Breves,</hi> which he acknowledges, and reads
them. Being asked, whether he were sorry so much had past from
his pen, he answered, <hi>Before I repent, teach me my Offence; If the

between lawful and unlawful Assembling; what Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been without my vocating?</hi> He was answered, <hi>That
heretofore it might admit favourable construction, but now the Q.
presence in the Kingdom, and more peaceable Authority, it becomes
no private person to assume that boldness. Knox</hi> replied, <hi>The time
that was, to me is now; though the Devil has got a vizard, he came
in as himself, a Tyrant; and was it then more lawful? But now he
practiceth under the Cloke of justice, what he could not do by strength;
And if my Convention was without the Q. command, so hath all

an Englishman of their gang, demanded of the Secretary, <hi>What
title either the Queen had to the thirds, or the Papists to two parts?</hi>
He was answered, <hi>Ne sit peregrinus curiosus in aliena republica.</hi>
But he replied, <hi>I am so, in the policy of</hi> Scotland, <hi>but free born in
the universal Church of God, and the care thereof, as equal mine, as
any yours. Knox</hi> craved the Opinion, and sentence of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,

<hi>It was not for them to justifie rash Iudgments of men, who speak their

continual railing, until the next general Assembly in <hi>Iune
1564.</hi> whereto, the Lords adjoined; but withdrew into the
Inner <hi>Council-house,</hi> and required to confer there with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Intendents,
and chief Ministers; answer was returned, <hi>That
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60657:34"/>
as they were members of the Church,<note place="margin">Anno 1564.</note> so they ought to propose in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and be assisted by the whole body; inferring some foul play, to
draw the Ministers singly to the faction of the Court.</hi> Which the
Lords in answer endeavored to cleer, assuring, that no conclusion
should be of this discourse, without consent of the Assembly.</p>
                  <p>And so they were permitted a choice number, among whom
we may be assured <hi>Knox</hi> was not wanting, and to watch the
<hi>Scribes pen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords began to remonstrate the grace of the Queen for
liberty in <hi>Religion,</hi> though not of her own profession, which
should deserve good Offices from that Church, to maintain her
advancement, and to procure obedience of her people, with their
unanimous and uniform Prayer for her Majesty, especially Mr.
<hi>Knox</hi> to be moderate in obedience to her person and State; for
others by the evil example may imitate the like liberty, albeit
not perhaps with the same discretion and fore-sight.</p>

by suffering and permission, as the Q. and you Lords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They told him of his prayer, which was,</hi> To illuminate her heart,
if thy good pleasure so be, with condition: <hi>he answered,</hi> We must
ask according to his will, thy will be done, and so the Master of the
Prophets and Apostles taught him to pray.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They said it gave a doubt in the people of her conversion.</hi> No,
<hi>said</hi> Knox, In her obstinate Rebellion, not to hear true preaching, but
will use the Mass; <hi>and</hi> Peter <hi>prayed,</hi> That if it were possible, the
thoughts of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may be forgiven him, and the same doubt
toucheth me of the Queen.</p>
                  <p>After long disputation of the duty of subjects in general, which
<hi>Knox</hi> disallow'd in each particular, <hi>Lethington</hi> desired the Lords
to decide these questions, and whether the Q. should have <hi>Mass?</hi>
but <hi>Knox</hi> opposed sentence, but in the Assembly, yet they fell

plotted revenge with <hi>Morton,</hi> and Lord <hi>Herris,</hi> to be rid of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zio,</hi>
by any way: but <hi>Morton</hi> refused. Then he insinuates
with <hi>Rizio,</hi> and tells him, that the Office of Chancelour being

by the Queens favor; which if by his means withdrawn,

strength and secrecie, seizes the keys of the Palace, leaves
some forces in the Inner Court below, to surprize such Lords
as were not of the plot, and staies in the presence. The <hi>King,</hi>
with <hi>Ruthen</hi> and five more, went up the back-stairs to the Queen
at Supper, waited on by the Countess <hi>Arguile, Rizio,</hi> and
some Servants; She was amazed to see them armed; <hi>Ruthen</hi>

                  <p>These Murtherers at the first had proposed to hang him, and
had <hi>Halters</hi> for that purpose, but in hast they stabb'd him with
53. wounds. <hi>Bothwell</hi> and <hi>Huntley</hi> came in to the Close, but
soon had their arrand to begon or to taste the same sauce. <hi>Rizio</hi>
had ambitiously managed the most affairs with pride, beyond
the equipage of the King, and was designed this Parliament to
be <hi>Chancelour,</hi> which made those Lords in envy to be his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and forced the King, and his <hi>Father</hi> to sign to his Death.
<hi>Rizio</hi> had advice of this by the <hi>French Priest Dannet,</hi> but his fate
was unavoidable, which the Queen some time resented with
tears, threatning revenge, which to avoid they fly to <hi>England,</hi>
where <hi>Ruthen</hi> dies. The Noise hereof in the Town, caused the
Provost to ring the <hi>Common Bell</hi> (or <hi>sonner le Tocsen,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi>

told them, all was well.</p>
                  <p>The King,<note place="margin">The K. turns Protestant.</note> to strengthen himself after this <hi>Action,</hi> inclined to
the Religion, and subscribed to a Proclamation, that all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,

and in Council advise the Queen to be satisfied with <hi>Rizio</hi>'s
death, and take it as good service; the Queen dissembling her
passion, got the remove of all the men in Arms out of the Court;
and so with some domestiques in the night drew the easy <hi>King</hi>
to fly with her to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> sending for all the Lords to attend in

                  <p>Most writers complain of these times, and some of them,

one Servant that watched with him, the House blown up with

<hi>Bothwell,</hi> with some others, by warrant, caused the body to be

in the Abby.</p>

though the Queen was beautiful and young e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

brother to <hi>Rizio,</hi> Domestiques of the Queen, and Strangers

<hi>Bothwell</hi> being in hope to succeed him, in case the Divorce

which his

<hi>Bothwell</hi> follows the Queen in her visit of the Prince at <hi>Sterlin,</hi>
from whence he carries her to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> and for which violence
he gets a general pardon, and so includes that of the King, if it

caused them hastily to leap out of their Beds, and out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
into the Garden; the King had his Sword in his hand, and
suspecting <hi>Treason,</hi> as also hazard of the young Prince, hastily
commanded <hi>Aston</hi> to speed thither and prevent his danger,
whilst himself single was seized upon by divers, and
wounded to death, and so left in the Garden; and to colour it,
the <hi>House was blown up with Gun-powder,</hi> but the Kings body
not scorched by any fire, was viewed, and found to be slain
by such, as so ordered the secrecy, as not in those daies to be
divulged. And this <hi>Tale</hi> was told by <hi>Aston</hi> himself, since he
came into <hi>England</hi> with K. <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that I may unfold the Mistery of these late Murthers,
and how the Queen was involved into future suspition, by her
hasty Mariages, I shall open <hi>Murrays</hi> subtilty to be the chief <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
and <hi>Actor</hi> in all.</p>
                  <p>The slaughter of <hi>Rizio</hi> (not long ago) gave security,<note place="margin">A brief Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the late Murders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Queens hasty Mariages, and the cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>.</note> in that time of
distraction at Court, for <hi>Murray</hi> boldly to appear before the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
upon his Indictment of Rebellion, the very next day after
the Tumult, and so no Accusation came against him, the Murther
being hastned for that purpose, The Queen therefore (through the
Kings intercession) receives him; her self in such Distraction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it the safest way to depend on his Brotherly (base) Counsel.
The King very sensible of his own Accessary in <hi>Rizio's</hi> death, and
deluded by the Cunning contrivance of <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> His
youth and easiness of belief giving way, Now repents of that rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60657:41"/>
implores the Queens clemency, and ingenuously reveals to her
the Villany of them all, with resolution to be revenged. And seeing
the Bastards power and interest in Affairs of State, equal, if not
before, His, advises with others to remove him farther off; <hi>Murray</hi>
hath intelligence of all, and, under shadow of outward duty,
thought of nothing more than to ruin him. Of which he acquaints
<hi>Morton</hi> by Message into <hi>England,</hi> who was conveyed thither upon
<hi>Rizio</hi>'s murder.</p>
                  <p>Some difference between the King and Queen gave the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
for by their former villany; they animate him to strain upon
the Rights of Soveraignty, to his face, which covertly they opposed
to the Queen, and alwaies after he had done a miss, to leave him in
the lurch.</p>
                  <p>And finding the good nature of the King likely to comply into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
with the Queen, and to be reconciled together. To prevent
them <hi>Murray</hi> draws in <hi>Bothwel</hi> to the Confederacy with these
murtherers, who though fled, acted in all Councils. And so <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
must be reconciled to <hi>Murray,</hi> and brought into grace with the
Queen.</p>
                  <p>Contracting under hands and seals, and bound with Oaths, That
the King being laid aside, he advanced, the Queen distrusted by the
Peers, and so the rule of Regency in <hi>Murray.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this Conspiracy, the Bastard conveys himself slyly out of
the way, but twelve hours before the King was murthered; and in
hurray of affairs returns to Court, and altogether they advise (nay
compel) or threaten the Poor Queen to mary <hi>Bothwell,</hi> who they
present, as nobly born, bold and faithful to the <hi>State,</hi> against all
assaults of the English, to prevent the Tumults of the time, and
hazard to all. If not, they would purchase their own security, by any
otherwaies, how prejudicial soever to her safety, which at last, she
was forced to consent unto.</p>
                  <p>And this Relation was confirmed under the hands of the Earls of

for that purpose, and altogether implore the Queen to mary
<hi>Bothwell,</hi> which being done, and their turns served; Then they
increase a violent suspition, and vent it abroad of the Queens
guilt and consent with <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and so conspire her deposing,

                  </p>
                  <p>Then out comes <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and, to avoid the blood of many, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
his own in combate against any. <hi>Iames Murray</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Brother, accepts the Challenge, but he is refused as not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

                  <p>At the day, the King sits on a Throne mounted, with two
seats on each hand for the Constable and Marshall, at the foot
of the Ascent; who demand the Pledges, to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the King, or the <hi>Appellant</hi> and <hi>Defendant,</hi> to come in
and make Oath.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Appellant</hi> comes on horse-back to the East dore, whom
the Constable brings in, and demands his name, and why thus
armed; He answers I am <hi>A. B. Apellant,</hi> and demand Entry,
to make proof of my intent against <hi>C. D.</hi> and to acquit my
Pledges. The Constable takes off his <hi>Bever,</hi> and proclames
him to be the Man, opens the door and bids him enter, with
his Arms, Victuals, necessary Attendants, and Council, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
him to the King, and sets him on a Seat till the <hi>Defendants</hi>
comming, and request being made, his Pledges are dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>Then the King commands the Constable, who commands
the Marshal, and he the Lieutenant, and he the Marshal of the
Heraulds of the South (if it be this side <hi>Trent,</hi> being the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of King <hi>Clarencieux)</hi> or otherwise if it be Northward, then
the Heraulds of <hi>Norris</hi> King of Heraulds there) to call the
Defendant thus. O yes, <hi>C. D.</hi> Defendant, Come to your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
acquite your pledges in the presence of the King, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable

of the Constables Court, with the order, time, horses,
arms and attendants and their manner.</p>
                  <p>Two <hi>Knights</hi> are assigned Observant to either Adversary, that
they take no charm or spel, or other evil arts, till their Oath be
taken, which the <hi>King</hi> commands the Constable to receive,
and what other Protestations their Council shall advise; If
not,</p>
                  <p>The Register saies; you <hi>A. B.</hi> Appellant; do you know this
to be your Bill of Complaint exhibited in Court before the
Constable, Swear to the Truth thereof in all points, and that
you intend to prove the Contents thereof upon C. D. so ayde
you God, and your Patron Saint; and then proclaims, Thou
<hi>A. B.</hi> thy Bill is such in all points, continue thy intent to prove
it this day, so God help thee and hallowing.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant <hi>C. D.</hi> in like manner, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then the Appellant takes his second Oath, That he comes

sharp weapon, no stone or herb of virtue, charm or spell, of
power or belief to be assisted, but only by God, and his own
Body, and merits of his Cause. So God him help, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Defendant swears the like.</p>
                  <p>The Constable bids them both to take each other by the
right hand, without violence, gently, and laying the left hand
on the <hi>Book,</hi> He saies, I charge your <hi>A. B.</hi> that you use all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to force the Defendant to render himself into your
hands, or to demand a Parley, or with your own hands to
kill him, before you part out of the lists, by the light of the Sun,
and age of the day assigned, by your Faith, and so God
help you.</p>
                  <p>The like by the Defendant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then</hi> O Yes.</p>
                  <p>The Herauld pronounces; In the Kings name, <hi>That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

these lying flat on the Ground at each side of the List, only the

mary with <hi>Norfolk;</hi> for she feared her great Friends here, and
beyond Seas.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Mary</hi> was therefore more earnest to satisfy the <hi>Duke,</hi>
who meant not to adventure the Treaty upon uncertainties;
And <hi>Murray</hi> for these respects kept <hi>Bothwels</hi> title in being; for
from <hi>England</hi> he was assured by his Friends there, that <hi>Norfolks</hi>
plot, and <hi>Queen Maries,</hi> was so cunningly conveyed, that no
wit nor power was able to countermine. Yet he remained
stedfast, and sent one of his Domestiques to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
with Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Petition, and their answer; but She not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with such an Ordinary Messenger, the <hi>Abbat Pitcarn</hi> was
sent Express, from the Convention at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> held only for that
purpose.</p>
                  <p>About the same time of his last arrival at <hi>London,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and his story which Murray plotted.</note> 
                     <hi>October</hi> 11. and the
Conspiracy discovered, which was thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Murray,</hi> with much cunning, before his late departure out
of <hi>England,</hi> proposed some hopes to <hi>Norfolk</hi> of mariage with
the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and secretly induced a belief of her present
restoring, and spread these Rumours to prejudice her, and to
increase jealousies, with many other suspitious, which surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Of Rebellions at home, and Plots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by the Papists. And as many more <hi>Tales</hi> that Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
and <hi>Murray,</hi> had compacted against the young King. To wipe
off these, an <hi>Apology</hi> was printed in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> defence.
In truth, she was much perplexed with fears, out of <hi>Emulation</hi>
of the other. Yet with some compassion for her Imprisonment;
and in both these distempers, there wanted not Instruments to
rub the wound. <hi>Mary</hi> often solicited Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet Princely, Letters, with such compassionate Eloquence,
that though the Queen had a Wolf by the Ears, yet with tears,
had oft resolution to return her Home, and dealt with <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>
by Messengers herein, but he was settled in malice, and
would not incline.</p>
                  <p>Then was rumoured the Mariage of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as advantagious to both <hi>Realms</hi> and security
of the Kings person, who must be brought also into <hi>England,</hi>
and so under Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> power, and she so to be secured
of fears. And that for finishing so good a work, the <hi>Dukes</hi>
Daughter should be contracted to the <hi>King.</hi> And these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
many the chiefest <hi>Earls</hi> in <hi>England</hi> had contrived. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>
himself at his being here, intimated no less to the <hi>Duke,</hi> for
that, <hi>She having maried her self to a Boy, then to a rash young
Man, and last to a Mad-brain, might now recover her honor to wed
him, a Man of discretion.</hi> Nay more, secretly, by <hi>Melvin,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

very seriously to <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon which the <hi>Duke,</hi> not faint-hearted, courted the <hi>Queen
by Letters,</hi> and all consenting, <hi>Articles</hi> were propounded.</p>

                     <item>2. To Covenant a League between both Kingdomes.</item>
                     <item>3. To establish Protestant Religion.</item>

                  <p>They promise to procure <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> consent, and the
other to be restored, to all which she, in Prison, easily yielded,
and who could blame her in the case she was? But ere they had
so done, <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> had suspition, and therefore it was
more than time to break it themselves, so from one to the other
it was neglected, till <hi>Leicester</hi> did it.</p>
                  <p>She asked the Duke thereof, and charged him to decline it,
least he hop't headless, and it was good warning, sufficient to
him to look ere he leap't, and so he stole away in time of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
back to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caecil</hi> wisely took care of the State, and learned so much of
the Matter, that the <hi>Duke</hi> began to fear; restless in any place,
withdrew to <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where some <hi>Commotion</hi> was purposely set
on foot, and he suspected. To prevent the worst, he returns
back towards the Court, but at Saint <hi>Albans</hi> was taken to guard,
and secured, for by this time Treacherous <hi>Murray</hi> had out of
<hi>Scotland</hi> discovered what he knew, and upon which the Duke
was sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> Bishop <hi>Ross,</hi> and others committed, and
<hi>Pembroke</hi> examined, not well remembring what he had said, or
should say: for he could not read a word. <hi>Northumberland</hi> and
<hi>Westmerland</hi> take Arms, but fearing greater opposition fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the North.</p>
                  <p>But ere all this was known in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Secretary <hi>Metallan</hi>
increased faction for <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and sided with <hi>Hume,</hi> and
<hi>Grange</hi> Captain of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle; and before it was ripe, he
is sent for to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> accompanied with the <hi>Earl Athole,</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
if need were; and need there was, for he is accused as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

Sir <hi>Iames Balfore</hi> in the same Condition, were both of them
sentenced by the Convention of States (for by them <hi>Murray</hi>
did all his work as in cases of Treason) but with much ado,
<hi>Balfore</hi> had pardon, and <hi>Metallan</hi> reprived to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle;
and <hi>Murray</hi> posted up and down to reduce the <hi>Norfolk</hi> faction,

                  <p>This service <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> took well, and gave audience
to <hi>Pitcarn</hi> his Ambassadour, to whom she promised, to desist the
restoring of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and assured all friendship to the <hi>Regent</hi>

and he undertakes to kill him. His opportunity he takes at
<hi>Lithgow</hi> in secret, where he placed himself in a House as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
passed by, shot him with an <hi>Harquebuss</hi> out at a Window,
the bullet passed thorow his <hi>Body,</hi> and killed the Horse under
<hi>George Dowglass 21. Ianuary</hi> 1569.<note place="margin">Murray the Regent slain.</note> He dyed that night. <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

not long after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Murray</hi> was base Son to <hi>King Iames</hi> the fift, and took up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for the gain of the Spoil of <hi>Papists.</hi> He was a Man full of
Ambition, injurious, and ungrateful to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and likely not
to have spared her Son, when time had wrought him power to
effect it.</p>
                  <p>He was much assisted in his Regency by <hi>Mortons</hi> perpetual

                  <p>It comes to be the question, whether for Interest or Friendship
<hi>Morton</hi> was so fixt; certainly <hi>Murray</hi> aimed at all, the <hi>Queen</hi>
in durance, and his labour so to continue her, or rather to have
her in his Custody, and so to have ordered her and her Son, for his
own purpose.</p>
                  <p>To ballance him, the <hi>Queens</hi> faction were, <hi>Hamiltons, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile,

them on all sides with a bit and a bob; for in this time she had
sent three several Armys against the <hi>Borderers</hi> under that colour,
which most horridly burnt all in their way, with incredible mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
to that miserable Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Murther of <hi>Murray</hi> was lookt upon as more publique
than to be acted by one, and a Resolution of his Friends to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it by force or Justice. In the mean time the Estates appoint
a day, and this put off was counselled by <hi>Metallan,</hi> who was

                  <p>From this Parliament now sitting, were the Papists utterly

which so heightened the Kirk into swelling Pride against Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
also, that their violence afterwards could never be brought
to Moderation. Though the Protector conceaved the Prelatical
function, to be no less necessary in State, then warrantable in
Reformation. And so he regulated them (as the Bishops of

others. And thus stood the power of Synods, interposing
the moderate Prelates, who yielded much in Peace to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

not leaving the least action undon to amuse the Admiral into firm assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

to affiance his Sister <hi>Margaret</hi> to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> Son to the Queen
of <hi>Navar,</hi> who had defended the Cause of the Religion in the late
Wars, and this to be celebrated according to the Reformed Religion.
The League between <hi>Charls</hi> the King, and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
and Articles concluded. The Mariage appointed in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the
Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> (of the Religion) repaired thither for the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The Admiral also sent for by the King to go before to <hi>Paris,</hi>
promising himself to follow; and the Spire-Cross-Steeple, called

and reproach of the Religion (a Monument of Civil Dissention) was

and so the Kingdome descended to Prince <hi>Henry</hi> her Son, who
was to be affianced to the Kings Sister, and the Mariage solemnized
with respect to eithers Religion. And five daies after the Admirall
solicited the Council in behalf of the Religion, and returning home
with divers Noblemen, he was shot by a Harquehuss out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,

                  <p>The King visits the Admiral in some danger of Death, from whom

And this was published in print to this day; and from thenceforth

                  <p>Some of the Lords combining mischief to the King,<note place="margin">Surprize of the King at Ruthen.</note> under
colour of Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom, took occasion
and advantage of the Duke of <hi>Arrans</hi> absence from the Court,
and detained the King at <hi>Ruthen.</hi> These Conspirators were
<hi>Iohn</hi> Earl of <hi>Mar, William</hi> Earl <hi>Gowry,</hi> Lords <hi>Lindsey, Boyd,
Clames,</hi> and <hi>Oliphant,</hi> Some <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Lairds,</hi> and stopt the

vilified. But it was reproached, <hi>That better bairns should weep
than bearded men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This news hastens the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> to Court, where he was
soon secured, and bid be patient, with safety of his life, for
his brother <hi>William Stuart</hi> was wounded by the way, and kept
Prisoner. The like course they take with some <hi>Noblemen</hi> sent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60657:66"/>
by the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> to enquire of the King. Who cried out
to them <hi>that he was a Captive, and desired his good subjects to release
him.</hi> The conspirators excused themselves, that their surprize
only restrained the King from <hi>Arran,</hi> and from <hi>Lenox,</hi> whose
banishment they threatned into <hi>France.</hi> And forcing the King
to pacifie the people with a Proclamation, That <hi>for removing
some differences, His Majesty interposed himself Mediator, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to reside at</hi> Perth, <hi>being his own free and voluntary choice,
and commanding such as were in Arms upon pretext of his restraint,
to dissolve within six houres, on pain of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke raises Forces, but was countermanded by the
Kings Letter, to <hi>depart the Realm within twenty daies,</hi> yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
to <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> where the Noble-men, and others, flock to
defend his Cause. These uprores were posted to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
who sends Sir <hi>Henry Cary,</hi> and <hi>Sir Robert Bowes</hi> to advise
the King to be counselled by the Lords, against the <hi>Duke</hi> and
<hi>Arran,</hi> and to restore the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> exiled in <hi>England</hi>
since <hi>Mortons execution.</hi> This last was obtained, and soon after,
he was accepted into favour, but much ado to incline the King to
part with <hi>Lenox.</hi>

                  <p>And the Assembly then convened, ratifie the attempt on the

protests his subscription to that fact, was forced upon him, and

                  <p>And now new Lords and Laws share old offices. The Guard was

Lords of former accusations, and confessions; the very Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minants
and Deponents must now voluntarily offer new Oaths,
to purge them from all Treasonable Attempts. Amongst whom
<hi>Duntraith</hi> now confessed to be suborned to accuse <hi>Mains,</hi> out of
fear to save himself.</p>
                  <p>Besides these powers that overmastered the Kings party, the
want of supply from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> lost the Court; the raging
Plague swept away twenty thousand persons, and that City
quite forsaken. He is forced now to yield to their Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
this Success imboldens the disloyal Ministers to return

                  <p>Then their Synod, being assisted by a number of the Laicks,
convene the Bishops; <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> was compeered before them,
upon accusation of <hi>Andrew Melvil,</hi> in malice and private revenge,
but his pretence was that the Bishop devised and penned former
Acts against the Presbytery; the Bishop protests against their
Judicature, and disputes his Innocency from any evil therein,
and to avoid their censures, appeals to the King and Estates,
and they therefore in fear what to do, a young Fellow, <hi>Andrew
Hunter,</hi> professes to be armed by the Spirit, and so usurping
the Chair, he pronounced Sentence against him. <hi>Cunningham</hi>
the Bishops man, did the like, the next day, against <hi>Melvil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These and other such disorders involves the King and Estates
what to do with them, when the Secretary of <hi>State</hi> perceiving
their vexations, advises the King to leave the Ministery to their
own courses; That in a short time, he should see them so intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,

<hi>viz.</hi> after the first of <hi>June</hi> in the seven and twentieth Year of the

and imagined in this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> divers matters
tending to the hurt, death, and destruction of the Royal Person of our

answered much for his innocency, as being unwilling to
contest with the Queen, yet could he not endure his modesty
should wrong the Truth and his own Integrity, and so suffered
himself to be be guilty and censured a thousand pounds Fine and
Imprisonment, which he endured a long time, and never could
procure the Queens favour, though he was relieved by her chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in his great necessity, which after followed.</p>
                  <p>The Qu. <hi>(saith he)</hi> upon the Departure of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotish</hi>
Ambassadours from Her,<note place="margin">His apology unto Walsing.</note> of her own accord commanded me to prepare
the Commission, for executing the Sentence against the <hi>Queen</hi> of
<hi>Scots,</hi> and when it was exhibited, she willingly signed it with her own
Hand; and after, gave order for it to be made ready under the Great
Seal of <hi>England;</hi> and merrily said, <hi>Signifie thus much to</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham,
<hi>who is sick, though I fear greatly it will make him die
with grief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She added also Reasons, why she had deferred it so long, to wit,</hi>
That she might not seem to be drawn unto it forcibly or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously;
though she were not ignorant all the while how necessary
it was.</p>
                  <p>She blamed <hi>Paulet</hi> and <hi>Drury,</hi> that they had not freed Her from
that care, and wished that <hi>Walsingham</hi> would try them therein.</p>
                  <p>The next Day the Great Seal was to it, she sent Injunction by <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legrew,</hi>
that it should not be done. And when I shewed to Her, that it
was done, she reproved my haste, intimating, that some other couse
by some wise Persons might be taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I made Answer,</hi> That that was always the best way, which was the
justest.</p>
                  <p>But fearing that she might lay the fault on me, (as she had done
the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> punishment on the Lord <hi>Burghley)</hi> I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
the whole matter to <hi>Hatton;</hi> protesting not to engage any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in so great an Affair. He strait way did communicate to <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and he to the rest of the <hi>Counsellours,</hi> who all consented to have
it hastened: and severally vowed, that they would bear the blame; and
they sent down <hi>Beal</hi> with the Commission and Letters.</p>
                  <p>Three Days after, perceiving her minde doubtfull, by reason of a
Dream which she told, of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> Death; I asked, if
her minde were altered? <hi>No,</hi> (said she) <hi>but some other course
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60657:83"/>
might have been thought upon.</hi> And with all demanded, if <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
had returned any Answer?</p>
                  <p>Whose Letters when I shewed to her, wherein he plainly refused to
undertake it, as being neither honorable nor just;</p>
                  <p>She in anger accused him and others, which had tied themselves in
Association of Perjury, and their Vow violated, who had promised
great matters for their <hi>Princes</hi> safety, but would perform nothing:
yet there were amongst them <hi>(she said)</hi> that would do as much in their
own cause.</p>
                  <p>But I shewed, how infamous and unjust a thing that were, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
into what Dangers she should cast <hi>Paulet</hi> and <hi>Drury;</hi> for if she
allowed the Fact, she must draw upon her self Danger and Disgrace,
besides a note of Injustice, but if she disallowed it, she must ruine well-deserving
men and their posterity.</p>
                  <p>Afterward, the same Day, that she was put to Death, she gave me a
Check, that the Sentence was not all this while put in execution, as
thinking it not done.</p>
                  <p>Hereby appears foul play intended,<note place="margin">Foul play on all hands.</note> by another (no doubt)
wicked way, which <hi>Paulet</hi> and <hi>Drury</hi> boggled at to perform:
and yet we see, what daubing there was on all sides, to cast the
blame and after-shame on any, to keep the stain and blot from the
eminent Actors.</p>
                  <p>And the cunning of <hi>Walsingham,</hi> who having the greatest
hand in the contrivance towards her Death, craftily got out of
the way at the Deed doing; and therefore <hi>Davison</hi> appeals to
him, telling the truth in his politick absence of a counterfeit
cold.</p>

upon my Return impart to Master <hi>Dowglas</hi> some things,
concerning the course was conceived here, by your said <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns</hi>
best Friends, fit to be holden in this remediless Accident;
for continuance of Peace and Amity between the two <hi>Crowns,</hi>
as the best for both <hi>Nations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The rather, for that by advertisement out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60657:83"/>
that the <hi>Queens</hi> Death is like to breed a strange Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>Majesties</hi> minde towards this <hi>Realm,</hi> tending (as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported)
wholly to violence and revenge of that, which hath been
done so necessarily by the whole Body of the <hi>same;</hi> whereof, as
for my own part I should be sorry, so it is generally hoped, that
his <hi>Majesty</hi> being of that singular judgment himself, by the
good help and advice of such as you are in credit and authority
about him, men of wisdom and experience, whom he will hear,
this mischief, will (notwithstanding) be carefully and prudently
prevented; considering how every way all things being rightly
weighed, this course will be found prejudicial, as well to your
<hi>Sovereigns Estate,</hi> as to his Reputation, if he resolve to persist
therein.</p>
                        <p>For first, the Enterprise will undoubtedly be condemned, in
the sight of all such as shall not be transported with some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
passion; for that they shall see, that he takes <hi>Arms</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of an <hi>Action</hi> (besides the necessity wherein it is grounded)
full of so honourable and just Proceedings, as, however the effect
was contrary to their liking, the manner thereof, by the late
<hi>Queens</hi> great Favourers, could not but be approved and allowed.
And as on the one side, the <hi>King</hi> your <hi>Sovereign</hi> oppugning the
course of Justice; of so unlawfull, unjust and desperate a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
cannot be expected any other thing than an unhappy and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
issue: so, we being assured, that in the defence of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
the assistance of God his mighty Arm will not fail us,
whose Judgment this was, need not to fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what ever man shall
attempt to the contrary, against this <hi>Realm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But not to stand upon the justness of the Quarrels, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man perhaps will not so much regard; It would be considered,
what means your <hi>Sovereign</hi> shall have to go through with such
Enterprise, if he take it in hand. For, the Forces of his own
<hi>Realm,</hi> being so far inferiour to these in <hi>England,</hi> no man is so
simple, but seeth it were no way safe for his <hi>Majesty,</hi> trusting onely
thereto, to make Head against the power of this Land, neither is
it thought, that any man will be found so unadvised, as to wish
him so to do.</p>
                        <p>But, as it may be, that a great Number (for lack of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing)
are carried away with such Discourses, (as some with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
solid ground imagine) of that might be done in this case by a
King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> backed and assisted (as they conceive in the
air) with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> aid; so it is likely enough, there
shall not want those, that either in satisfaction of their private
passions, or supply of their necessities, or better affectionating of
some other their private design, would be content to serve
themselves of this present publick occasion and oportunity,
who will propound and promise more to his Majesty, of such fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60657:84"/>
assistance, than they know in their consciences, can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
if he would declare himself Enemy to this Realm;
which that he should, (though to his own ruine) the Enemies of
both Nations, will do what they can to procure.</p>

and pursute, the simple supplies and support, commonly found at

being so prepared, and in case to defend it self, both otherwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and also by the conjunction of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealands</hi> Forces by
Sea; in respect whereof, this <hi>Realm</hi> need not fear, what all the
Potentates of <hi>Europe</hi> being bended against us, can do, to afford
the same; Due consideration (I say) being taken hereof, you will
easily judg and finde, how vain it were, for your Sovereign, upon
so uncertain hopes, to embarque himself and Estate in an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
War: but much more, if you shall consider, what a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
and train of Dangers, this War draweth therewith, the
consequence whereof reacheth to whatsoever your <hi>Sovereign</hi>
possesseth, or hopeth for in this life. For, escaping to be slain in
the field, if he should happen to be taken Prisoner, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to retire himself out of the Realm, (things that have
often fallen out in experience) and then, having incensed this
whole <hi>Realm</hi> against him, he should be disabled from any Right
in the Succession of this <hi>Crown,</hi> (as authority is given to do it by
the same Statute, whereby they proceeded against his Mother)
for attempting the Invasion of this <hi>Land,</hi> what extremity should
he be reduced unto?</p>
                        <p>And truly it could not otherwise be, the antient enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two <hi>Nations</hi> now forgotten, being (by drawing bloud
one of another again) likely to be in such sort revived, that it
would be impossible to make them to receive a <hi>Prince</hi> of that
<hi>Nation,</hi> and especially <hi>Him,</hi> who had (upon so unjust ground)
been the <hi>Author</hi> of so unhappy a Breach.</p>
                        <p>Besides that, the greatest part of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> by whose judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the late <hi>Queen</hi> was condemned, and the rest of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> who confirmed the same in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
should have just cause to adventure any thing, even to the
marching over their bellies, rather than to yield to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who carrying such a vindictive minde, they might doubt,
would not day call their Lives and Honours in question.</p>
                        <p>And as for the remedy and relief which he might attend
(standing on those terms) of forein <hi>Princes,</hi> there are many
Examples of former Ages, and within fresh memory; as the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navar</hi>'s Grandfather by the Mothers side, and <hi>Christian
King</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> both being allied to <hi>Francis</hi> the First, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60657:84"/>
                           <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, two of the mightiest Potentates that reigned of
long time: and that this present <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> may su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>fice for
Examples, to teach all <hi>Princes,</hi> (if they can avoid it) to beware
how they fall into that state, whereby they shall be enforced to
seek their own by other <hi>Potentates</hi> means; <hi>Princes,</hi> not being so
ready in these days, to embrace other mens Quarrels, but where
they are extraordinarily interessed in their own fortunes.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I doubt not, but it will be seen by men of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(not transported with passion, or led away with private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects)
that it should be every way, the onely best course for your
<hi>Sovereign,</hi> by a good and kinde usage of <hi>Her Majesty,</hi> and by
shewing that <hi>Princely</hi> moderation, as well in this grievous Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his <hi>Mothers</hi> death, as his whole proceeding with this
Realm (which his Highness excellent Education seems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise)
to seek to win the hearty good wills of this <hi>Nation;</hi> as the
chief and principal assurance he can in any sort obtain.</p>
                        <p>For, to trust and depend either upon the <hi>French</hi> King, or the
K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if by their assistance, he might attain to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
possession of this <hi>Crown,</hi> they being indeed the only two <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,</hi>
whom he must have recourse unto, if he reject the amity
of <hi>England;</hi> whosoever shall so counsel your <hi>Sovereign,</hi> (as things
now stand) shall in the judgment of men of the best understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be blamed either of fidelity or want of wisdom, drawing
his <hi>Majesty</hi> unto so untoward and desperate a course.</p>
                        <p>For, it is no way safe for any <hi>Prince</hi> to repose his trust and
strength upon their favour and assistance, to whose desires and
designs his greatness may yield any impeachment or hindrance;
so it were clearly against common reason, to expect other support
and assistance from them, than might stand with their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
and pretensions, in respect whereof, neither of the two
foresaid <hi>Kings</hi> can simply and roundly joyn with his <hi>Sovereign</hi> to
his good.</p>
                        <p>First, his <hi>Religion</hi> being odious to them both, and likely to
prove most prejudicial to the <hi>Catholick Cause,</hi> he growing so
great, as he should be made by the union of the two <hi>Crowns;</hi>
the consideration whereof, caused his <hi>Mothers</hi> affairs to stick a
long time, and made now in the end, to leave him quite out
of the reckoning, ordaining the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> her Heir, if her
Son became not <hi>Catholick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Next, it is meerly repugnant to the policy of <hi>France,</hi> were it
but in respect of the ancient claim which <hi>England</hi> maketh to that
<hi>Crown,</hi> to suffer the uniting of this <hi>Island</hi> under one <hi>Prince.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They have been content in former times, when <hi>England</hi> had
footing in <hi>France,</hi> to serve themselves of your <hi>Nation,</hi> therewith
to annoy this <hi>Realm,</hi> by the means of diverting or dividing the
Forces thereof; and so perhaps the Politicks of <hi>France</hi> can be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60657:85"/>
content to wish at this day, by your <hi>Sovereigns</hi> Quarrel, or any
such like, to be eased of the burthen and miseries of the present

<hi>French</hi> Quarrels, and the desolation of that <hi>Realm.</hi>
                        </p>

that you shall finde the <hi>King</hi> ready to hearken unto any Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise

with his Neighbours abroad, and with his Subjects at home; but
that he hath been forced full sore against his will, by the practice
of them of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> to countenance with his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Civil War raised in that <hi>Realm;</hi> which maketh him (what
ever shew he hath to shadow out the contrary) to hate them in his
heart.</p>
                        <p>Neither would it be held sound counsel, to be given him, by
any that depends upon his fortune, to further the advancement
of a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> so nearly allied to that Family, which he hath
discovered, and greatly feareth to level at his own <hi>Crown,</hi> with
any intention to depose him, which by the greatness of a <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Scots,</hi> they should be so much the sooner and better able to
effect.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s assistance, being now in War with this
<hi>Realm,</hi> were more likely to be obtained, but far more dangerous
to be used, in respect of his most insatiable ambition, deep pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and power, accompanied in this case with a colour of
Right, wherein how far he would seek to prevail, any opportunity
or advantage being offered, it may be justly doubted, by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that sundry States have had, which upon slender grounds of
Title, have been extorted and wrung from the true Inheritors,
and annexed to his own <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as <hi>Navar, Portugal,</hi> and all that
he possesseth in <hi>Italy,</hi> hath been.</p>
                        <p>It is believed, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> considering his years,
and unsettled Estate every way, would willingly incline to
peace, if it were offered, with reasonable conditions, and not
over readily at this present, imbarque himself in any new Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
                        <p>But, otherwise it is well known, as he had fancied to Himself
the <hi>Empire</hi> of all this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> so he had an eye to this
<hi>Realm</hi> ever since he was <hi>King,</hi> in Right of his <hi>Wife.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
was intended under colour of <hi>Religion,</hi> as it was discovered
by some that were of his <hi>Privy Council</hi> at that time; his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be Heir of the House of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and (since the late
<hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> Death) the first <hi>Catholick Prince</hi> of the Bloud
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60657:85"/>
Royal of <hi>England,</hi> as also the Donation of this <hi>Crown,</hi> made to
him by the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> in her Letters, with a promise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it by <hi>Testament;</hi> (things blazed abroad by the <hi>Spanish Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour</hi>
at <hi>Paris)</hi> ought to breed jealousies and suspitions in your
<hi>Sovereigns</hi> head, and give him true cause to think, how he should
be used at such an Assistants hand. Auxiliary Forces have ever
been reputed dangerous, if they either in number or policy were
superior to them that called them in. The Assistance therefore
of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> being of this <hi>nature,</hi> as your <hi>Sovereign</hi> hath
need of neither, so he shall do well to forbear them both, and so
shall it be well for his ease.</p>
                        <p>It may be, some will pretend by change of his <hi>Religion,</hi> your
<hi>Sovereign</hi> shall better his <hi>condition,</hi> in regard of these forein <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
besides, a great party within this <hi>Realm,</hi> that thereby shall be
drawn wholly to depend upon his fortune; but the poor distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
estate of <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> being a <hi>Catholick Prince,</hi> spoiled by a
<hi>Catholick,</hi> and receiving so little succour at <hi>Catholick Princes</hi>
hands, shall be a sufficient bar to all that can be said in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>Catholick</hi> party in <hi>England,</hi> in his <hi>Mothers</hi> life, it
was never so united, as they drew all in one line, much less will
they be brought suddenly to rely upon him, if he should alter his
<hi>Religion,</hi> (as God defend) which would be his utter discredit and
overthrow, both with the one and the other party; neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cause to repose confidence in him; the <hi>Protestants,</hi> because
he had renounced the <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein he was with great care
brought up.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Papists,</hi> because they could not be assured in short space,
that he was truly turned to their faith; yea, all men should have
reason to forsake him, who had thus dissembled and forsaken his
God.</p>
                        <p>And whereas it was given out, that divers do insinuate into
your <hi>Sovereign,</hi> that his Honor and Reputation is so deeply inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed
herein, as it must necessarily turn to his perpetual ignominy
and reproach, if he give not some notable testimomy to the
world, of the affection and dutifull love he bare to his <hi>Mother;</hi>
your <hi>King</hi> being of that singular judgment, that he is thought
to have, cannot be ignorant, how far true honour ought to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
a <hi>Christian Prince,</hi> that is, not whither <hi>Passion</hi> or fury useth
to carry men, but whither Reason or Wisdom have laid the
bounds, that is, within the compass of <hi>Possibility, Decency</hi> and
<hi>Iustice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the late <hi>Queen</hi> had been <hi>innocent, Revenge</hi> had been necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
just and honourable; but being culpable, contrary, (in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
mens judgments) he hath sufficiently discharged the duty
of a <hi>Son,</hi> in mediating for his <hi>Mother,</hi> so long as she was alive,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60657:86"/>
and so far as he was able to prevail; they which require more at
his <hi>Highness</hi> hands, may be presumed, not to regard what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
his Place and Dignity, but to seek the satisfaction of
their own particular passions and desires.</p>
                        <p>And whoever perswadeth his <hi>Majesty,</hi> that the mediation
used by him for his <hi>Mother,</hi> contrary to the humble pursute of
the whole <hi>Parliament,</hi> hath already given that offence to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and People of this Land, as it behoveth him of force to
have recourse to forein supports, doth greatly abuse both his
<hi>Highness</hi> and this <hi>Realm;</hi> for as they were not ignorant, what
Nature might and ought to move his <hi>Majesty</hi> unto, so long as
there were any hope of her life; so, they do not doubt, but that
reason will induce him to leave sorrowing, and thinking of her,
in due time.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I troubled you with a long Discourse, whereunto
the desire I have of the continuance of amity between the two
<hi>Crowns,</hi> hath carried me unawares further than I purposed; all
which, I refer to your consideration, not doubting that you will
afford most readily and willingly all good offices that shall lie in
your power, to the end that a happy conclusion may ensue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which shall tend to the common good of the whole <hi>Island.</hi>
And so I commit you to God.</p>

the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> urge him to a revenge, to seek aid of forein
<hi>Princes,</hi> and a Navy from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whose daughter
then was in treaty of Marriage with him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Catholicks</hi> suggested, rather to joyn with the <hi>Pope, Spain,</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> and to desert the <hi>Puritans;</hi> who (they said) would
murther him, as his Mother. Some willed him to be Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to take time to bethink, and by that means, whilst his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
condition gave excuse for his Acting, he might piece
himself to that party, where he should be sure of best support.
Alwaies, he resolved to keep peace with <hi>England,</hi> and constancy
to his <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus,<note place="margin">Whom Queen Elizabeth caressed.</note> whilst his wisdom beyond his age (twenty two
yeers) sate still, the <hi>Queen</hi> feared the more; not knowing, what

indeed to big to be cured,<note place="margin">Anno 1587.</note> till it should lye down, and rest with
its own weight and weariness.</p>
                  <p>Therefore knowing how mightily the <hi>French</hi> wrought in their
mine to provoke both Nations to publike defiance, she mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sends several Messengers, and afterwards the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi> her
Ambassador, with studied arguments, to take off his adhering
to foreign friendships, and the danger thereby to both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
where his interest in succession was most of all concerned,
being his just right, to which his <hi>Mothers</hi> sufferings could be no
prejudice.</p>
                  <p>But the next yeer, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> sends to the Duke
of <hi>Parma</hi> his Governor in the Low Countries,<note place="margin">Designs upon the King to revenge.</note> in his Name, to
promise to King <hi>Iames</hi> mony and Amunition, sufficient, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
revenge for his mothers death. <hi>Parma</hi> sends over to
<hi>Scotland Robert Bruce,</hi> a Scot by birth, and noble family, with
money to quicken his purpose. The <hi>Pope,</hi> also, <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi>
dispatches thither his Bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to promise to the King
the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> in marriage, if he would turn Romane <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike;</hi>
but faithfull, <hi>Metallan</hi> the Chancellor, frustrates those
hopes, and returns him home with a flea in his ear.</p>
                  <p>But ere he departs, he designs on <hi>William Creyton</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> also,
and sometime <hi>Rector</hi> of the College,<note place="margin">Designs in Scotlaand.</note> of <hi>Iesuits</hi> in <hi>Leyden,</hi> to stay
behind; and this man treats with <hi>Bruce</hi> to murther <hi>Metallan.
Bruce</hi> refuses that Assassination; and then he is urged to hire with
<hi>Parmas</hi> mony, some needy noble man there, at a banquet,
to poyson the <hi>King</hi> his invited guest, and was denyed in that
also. Then he quarels with him to part with fifteen hundred
Crowns, to distribute them to three other Lords to effect it, but
being refused in all these, he stayes the time to work out other
mischiefs hereafter; and <hi>Parma</hi> dying, he accuseth <hi>Bruce</hi> of
<hi>Treason</hi> (for not willing to be a <hi>Traytor)</hi> and for which he indures
long imprisonment ere he got liberty.</p>

not take the least injury, but he would <hi>slay a strong man in his

                  <p>The <hi>Catholick</hi> Lords had been cited to the last <hi>Parliament</hi> in
<hi>Iuly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Proceedings against Popish Lords.</note> but failed by some defect in the <hi>Libell,</hi> and so were remitted

of <hi>Fife</hi> therefore excommunicate <hi>Angus, Huntley, Arrol,
Home</hi> and <hi>Chisholm,</hi> and writ to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for them to do so
there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> displeased with such Proceedings, requires M. <hi>Bruce</hi>
there great <hi>Pastor,</hi> to stay <hi>Sentence,</hi> the Persons neither cited nor
subject to <hi>Fife Synode, and if this be your Order</hi> (says he) <hi>for one to
excommunicate, with their direction for others to do so too, who can be
sure to eschew trouble?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But</hi> Bruce <hi>boldly told the</hi> King, that the Ministers had their own
Reasons, and were answerable onely to the General Assembly.</p>
                  <p>Well, <hi>(says the King)</hi> your Discipline hath distasted all men, and
seeing your practices are without good President, I will bethink me of
some Remedy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Popish</hi> Lords complain to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Falaw,</hi> and humbly
crave a legal Trial, but were commanded to enter their persons at
<hi>Perth,</hi> and abide there till the Trial; and lest any jealousie should
censure the <hi>King,</hi> as conniving, the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Lunders</hi> was sent to
the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour, and to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Ministery, to tell
them the truth; and it was time so to do.</p>

                  <p>That the Trial of the <hi>excommunicate</hi> Lords be not prevented,
but their Day prorogued onely for the conveniency of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors

committed; in the mean time to stand committed; their <hi>Iury</hi>

<hi>Gospel;</hi> that they being <hi>excommunicate</hi> and so cut off from the
Body of the Church of <hi>God,</hi> have no benefit of the <hi>Law,</hi> till
they be reconciled to the <hi>Church:</hi> and that such onely as

and justice he with his Councel had granted, and considering the

at the meeting of the Estates, and with their advice; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

for his own Guard, those whom he called thither should be welcom,

he now convenes the Estates at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> for that and other

                  <p>The Kings opinion seemed further to oversway. Because

                  <p>In the end, <hi>Bruce</hi> was so bold, as to tell the King in plain

                  </p>
                  <p>The King not able to amend what was amiss, meant to work it

                  </p>
                  <p>Mean while, the <hi>Commissioners</hi> send copies of all transactions, to

by the warrant of Christ, to take care of hazard to the Church,

to continue together, and to send to the <hi>Octavians</hi> (those 8 <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi>
of State formerly mentioned) that seing at the entrance
to their places, the Church was in quiet and peace; and now
to be imbroyled; the Enemies to truth overpowring, and all
by their councels and connivance; The event of evil, must fall
upon them, the Contrivers or Connivers.</p>
                  <p>The President hastily made answer, As they began so let

them end; the Councills advice, neither was desired, nor given
on either part, and therefore would not meddle between the
King and them, but leave it to his Majesty and Nobles.</p>
                  <p>This answer taught them fresh advice; to remonstrate to the
King himself by Messengers of their own; and fearing the effects
(the Kings anger) humbly interceed, for surcease of Processe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Master Blake,</hi> Until his Majesty should be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke

and so, appertaining to the judgment of the Church.</p>
                  <p>This by the wiser, was held fit to be received, as an end of

against Princes. Others argued to try Mastery with

the best conditions we can, least our weaknesse appear, if we
have the worst, and so the terror of the Church despised, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
Much <hi>will</hi> portends little <hi>wit;</hi> and as it is often seen,
who gripes at all, grasp nought but wind: and to levy all their
wills, is to lose all their wits; of which, God send them more
plenty than appears by their proceedings.</p>
                  <p>But not prevailing, the King proceeds to proclaim their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
and <hi>Blakes</hi> appearance as afore ordered.</p>
                  <p>The next day, sunday, solemnized the christning of the

                  <p>That seing the decision of intricate questions could work no good,
and was subtilly urged to ingender discention, between his Majesty
and the Church, he would be pleased to remit the discision to a lawfull

upon any pretence, but to bend his actions against the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of the Church and state, the <hi>Papists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then they exhort the Noblemen to give his Majesty faithfull
Counsel, and not to be subject to the guilt of sin, by the craft
of such as seek the thraldom of the Gospel, who intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite
their honours to be the Executors of their malitious devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

                  <p>The King rejects it,<note place="margin">Is rejected.</note> as not worthy of Answer, commanding
to call <hi>Blake</hi> to his summons</p>
                  <p>First, That he affirmed in Pulpit that the <hi>Popish Lords</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

he had detected the treachery of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Articles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Blake.</note> that he called all Kings the Divells barns, and that the

                  <p>Thirdly, That in his prayers for Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> he had used these
words, we must pray for her, in fashion, but we have no cause, she
will never do us good.</p>
                  <p>That he called the Queen of <hi>England</hi> an <hi>Atheist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he had discussed a suspention granted by the Lords of <hi>Session</hi>
in Pulpit, and called them <hi>Miscreants</hi> and <hi>Bribers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Nobillity were degenerate, godlesse, dissemblers, and eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Church.</p>
                  <p>That the Council were <hi>Holliglasses, Cormorants</hi> and men of no
Religion.</p>
                  <p>And that he had convocated divers Noblemen and others within
Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>June 1594.</hi> caused them to take arms in troops
of <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>Foot</hi> and thereby usurped the power of King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                  <p>After reading of the summons, <hi>Robert Pont</hi> their Minister
protested, that the processe in hand should not prejudice the
Church.</p>
                  <p>To which the King answered that he meant not to meddle with
matters of doctrine, but to censure, the treasonable speeches of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
which he and his Councel would judg, <hi>except, that by scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it could be held forth that Ministers were not subject in these
cases to judicatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blake</hi> makes answer;<note place="margin">His answer.</note> that the accusations were false, calumnies;

                  <p>Next he said.</p>
                  <p>That to the first six points the Council were not lawfull Iudges of
speeches in Pulpit, but the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> where the sermon was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>And so presents a second <hi>Declinator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But being put to voyces it was sentenced, That the crimes
and accusations mentioned in the summons, were seditious and
treasonable, and that the King and Council were competent
Judges in all matters, criminall, or civill, as well to Ministers
as other subjects.</p>
                  <p>The Council dissolved, the King willing to conserve peace
and amity, to the Ministers offered terms of reconciliation and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60657:118"/>
to return <hi>Blake</hi> to his charge and Pastorage.</p>
                  <p>Bruce <hi>answered,</hi> That if it concern'd only Master <hi>Blake,</hi> the
offer might be accepted, but the liberty of <hi>Christs Kingdom,</hi> being
wounded by the Proclamation, and by usurping spiritual Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of greater consequence then Master <hi>Blakes</hi> life and twenty more;
and that if those things were not retreated they would oppose, during
the last aspiration of breath.</p>
                  <p>The King the next morning treated with some of theirs.<note place="margin">The King treats wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how far he was from impairing spiritual Jurisdiction, that he
would amplifie and inlarge the same; but (said he) to discourse of

and civil and criminal causes; and of speeches that may
import such crimes; and if the Pulpit should be a place of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
under colour of doctrine to stir up sedition, no good man
will grant. If Treason and sedition be crimes punishable, much
more comitted in the Pulpit, where the word of truth only
should be taught. I am not ignorant what <hi>France</hi> of late and
<hi>England</hi> formerly, have suffered by the violence of such spirits.
And I may not indure it.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the Church finding the King resolved, desire
some Declaration to be made to the people in favour of Church
Assemblies, which they feared was hereby, of late somewhat
weakned; which the King assented unto, and it was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
published, to give finall conclusion to these differences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blake</hi> was required only to acknowledg his offence to Queen <hi>Ann.</hi>

                  <p>See the effects of Rebellion, in general, if they succeed not,
advance the Soveraign; so did this. The insurrection proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the Ministers their Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction, submits
alwaies after to the Kings authority. In these stories of <hi>Bruce</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and <hi>Blake</hi> now, the grand Incendiaries of their Riot, it
appears how patiently the King proceeded, if possibly to have
confirmed them, and to have secured his Prerogative with their
priviledges, which he could never procure from them, without
this oversight of their own.</p>
                  <p>Besides; how submiss are the Lay subjects now; and how
high grows the King, and his Counsellors! Advice is offered;
to raze the Town and erect a Pillar of repentance; a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their misery; caused by their insolencie; and this their
punishment. Others were lesse mild, but all for condign marks
of <hi>revenge, to teach others their duties, for the time to come.</hi>

                  <p>Nay <hi>Bowes,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour was out, and in, and in,
and out, with his policies; he liked well to imbroile the State,
but not to allow advantage to the King, for by the faction of the
Brethren, all the designs of <hi>England</hi> were managed; and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall
assistance from them, to ballance their quarrels at home;
and therefore Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> writes to the King her advice;
fearing belike, too much pressing upon the Ministry according

redress some injurious acts, that they feared might overthrow their
profession; which I grant no King for the manner ought to bear with,

                  <p>The Articles were at first drawn up to fifty five, and to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
that those questions were never decided, but effectually
they were in use, to the prejudice of the King, and people, which

the King timely holds a Parliament in some respects for restoring

And the Commissioners for the Ministery are suiters for sundry
Articles. Amongst them this was one. <hi>That the Ministers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting

                     </gap>
in favour of the Church, and the libertie, and freedom.</p>
                  <p>The King was earnest therein to please them,<note place="margin">Ministers voice in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> and had it past.
But then obtained the manner as for himself; thus.</p>
                  <p>That such Pastors <hi>and</hi> Ministers as his Majesty should please to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60657:126"/>
to the Place and Dignity of a Bishop, Abbot, or other Prelate at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time shall have voice in Parliament, as freely as any other Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Prelate had at any time by-past. And that all Bishopricks then in
his Majesties hands and undisponed to any person, or which should
happen to fall void hereafter, should be only disponed to actua! Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Ministers in the Church, or to such other persons as should be
found apt and qualified to use and exercise the Office of a Preacher or
Minister; and who in their provisions to the said Bishopricks should
accept in, and upon them, to be actual Pastors and Ministers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
thereto should practise and exercise the same.</p>
                  <p>But the Office of them in the spiritual Policy and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church was remitted to his Majesty and to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly; and so hereby occasion was soon taken to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
at <hi>Dundee.</hi> And first advises them to consider, <hi>Whether it
was lawfull and expedient that the Ministers as representing the whole
Church within the Realm should have Voice in Parliament or not?</hi>
It was concluded for them, <hi>They might;</hi> as also <hi>in other meetings
of the Estate, and very expedient to have some of them always present
to give Voice in the name of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The number of them was agreed upon to be one and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ifty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
(as of old in the Papistical Church. But then, who should
elect those to have voice? They were pleased with much ado to
grant. It did appertain, partly to his Majesty, and partly to the
Church, and so it came to after consideration. <hi>De modo eligendi:</hi>
whether <hi>ad vitam.</hi> What their Title? with caution to preserve
them from corruption? What their Rents and Revenues? with
a number more such circumstances are recommended to their
Presbyteries to consider, and so to certifie his Majesty.</p>
                  <p>And because it was time for the Kings grace and favour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to mercy the <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Ministers, such as of late were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
to suffer them now to preach again, but with such articles
and conditions as bound up their better manners to the Kings
turn, not their own old tunes in the Pulpit. Nor were they safe
as they thought they should be, till the King was pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<hi>That he did freely remit their former offences, in hope that they
would hereafter deserve it.</hi> And so were all persons concerned in
the late Tumult and all others in honour to the King and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to their brethren concluded and contented. But Mr. <hi>Iohn
Davidson</hi> a malitious man, he being behinde hand of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
protested <hi>against the Assembly, as not free, but over-awed by
the King.</hi> And when he had put his Spoke into the Wheel slip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
aside, but left it in motion with more ado than was meet to make
such a stir.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> a Preacher there for ten years,<note place="margin">Bruce refuseth imposition of hands.</note> yet never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Ordination to the Ministery, pretending the approbation
of the general Assembly equivalent, if not more sufficient. He
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60657:127"/>
was told, that the Approbation which he had, was only a Licence
to preach, but now to receive the <hi>Office,</hi> it was necessary thereto,
<hi>Imposition of Hands.</hi> No, though he was instructed, that the
Ordination was not to question his former <hi>Calling,</hi> but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it; nor would that serve, unless he had a Declaration to
him thereof set down in writing.</p>
                  <p>A whole fourteenight was wasted to make the form, to please
him, and others that sided for him, and his day of admission
came. Mr. <hi>Robert Pont</hi> in the Pulpit signified their business, and
being come down to assist the work. <hi>Bruce</hi> was got up in his
place, railed against all the acts of the Commissioners, and with
his Tongue raised such a Tumult of the Commons, that the
poor Ministers appointed to administer Ordination were in
fear to be stoned by the people, and so got away, and nothing
done.</p>
                  <p>Upon this this the King commands the Commissioners to cite
<hi>Bruce,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">but at last is so admitted.</note> and censure him. He did appear, but excused himself, and
laid the fault on the peoples affection to him; and being afraid
what would be the issue, pain of deprivation, gave obedience,
and accepted his Admission, with Imposition of the Hands of
two Ministers. Here was seen his perverse pride and wilfulness,
which fools referred to his true zeal.</p>
                  <p>And this good conclusion of the general matters of the
Church gave like success to the conference at <hi>Falkland,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
their Votes in Parliament, concluding the manner of his
Election, who was to have Vote in Parliament, that the Church
should name for each Prelacy six, whereout the King should
chuse one.</p>
                  <p>That the nomination of them should be made by the general
Assembly.</p>
                  <p>And his Rent provided out of the Prelacy, whereunto he is
preferred.</p>
                  <p>With such cautions to preserve him, as was not to be feared he
could transgress his bounds, or be deposed <hi>ipso facto;</hi> but his
Title should be called <hi>Commissioner</hi> for such a place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, some of the Articles of Caution were ridiculous and
absurd to be performed, but such was the Kings wisdom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to all their conceits, knowing that in time the benefit and
good use of this Government would appear, which he purposed
(says one) to have established, or rather, to permit those inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
until weight of their own sufferings should betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to abler conclusions.</p>
                  <p>The King having greater Councils of more importance to
him, next to the settlement of the Church, and not till then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

with their Answers, in substance alike.</p>
                  <p>That albeit his Majesties right was well known to them,<note place="margin">Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> they did
esteem it an Act of great wisdom in him, to acquaint his Friends and
Allies with the Exceptions which some may presume to take to his just
Title, that so, when occasion required, nothing might be amiss for
them to do for him within their power. But to move the Queen to
name her Successor, they excused themselves therein, as more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to him than usefull to his intent, lest it might less promove
the business, and offend her. Always (each of them) would advise, but
counsel together with the Confederates and Allies of either, and in the

                  <p>The King staying longer in his sport of hunting than was expected,
the Earl at middle of dinner; <hi>Andrew Ruthen</hi> came in hast, and
signified the King to be nerer at hand; presently after came <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and <hi>William Bloire,</hi> and withdrew themselves to consult, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Henderson</hi> for the Earls <hi>Gantlet and steel Bonnet;</hi> at the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> bids <hi>Henderson</hi> to fetch the keys of the Chambers
from one <hi>William Rynde;</hi> and presently after <hi>Cranston</hi> requires
<hi>Henderson</hi> to come to the Earl; who commanded him to attend
his brother <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to doe what ere he bid him; which was,
to be locked up within the round Chamber, and to stay in silence, till
his return.</p>
                  <p>Neer the end of dinner, the King at his fruit, and the Lords
and wayters gone to eat, <hi>Alexander</hi> beggs of his Majesty, in
this opportunity to withdraw, and to dispatch the business.
And up he leads Him through four or five roomes, locking each
dore behind them, til they came into the round Chamber where
<hi>Henderson</hi> stood armed. No sooner entered, but <hi>Alexander</hi> pulls
out <hi>Hendersons</hi> dagger, held it to the Kings brest, claps on his
<hi>Bonnet,</hi> and with stern countenance faces the King and saies,
Now Sir you must know I had a father,<note place="margin">Alexander treats with the King.</note> whose blood calls for
revenge, &amp; you shall die, minting to the K. heart with the dagger.</p>
                  <p>The King amazed, <hi>deals gently with his fury; excuses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the guilt of his death, by his then Infancie; advising
him, not to lay violent hands on the sacred person of his Annoynted So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
especially in a cause of his innocencie;</hi> pleading the lawes
of <hi>God and Man; and his merits,</hi> by restoring your brother <hi>in
blood and honors;</hi> by breeding your Sister <hi>the neerest in the Queens
affection, and by his reception of his Bedchamber, withall promising
pardon of all that is past.</hi> And which wrought so much upon <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
for the present, that he leaves the King in custody of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi>
until he returns from his brother; having taken oath of the
King not to stir, nor cry out, and so locks them in.</p>
                  <p>

That the Earl <hi>Gowry,</hi> at <hi>St. Iohnstons,</hi> appointed this Deponent
<hi>Henderson</hi> over night to ride with his <hi>Brothers, Alexander</hi> and
<hi>Andrew Ruthen</hi> to <hi>Falkland</hi> the next morn, who came all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thither at seven of the clock; <hi>Alexander</hi> presently spake
with the King in private, as he gat on hors-back, and instantly
commanded this Deponent to ride with all possible speed to the
<hi>Earl,</hi> whom he found at <hi>St. Iohnstons</hi> in his <hi>chamber</hi> at ten of the
clock, and told him that the <hi>King</hi> would be there by noon. The
<hi>Earl</hi> presently with-draws into his Cabinet, demands, <hi>How his
Majesty took with his Brother?</hi> This Deponent said, <hi>Very well, for
the King clipt him about the shoulder.</hi> The <hi>Earl</hi> asked <hi>if there were
many with the King, and what special persons?</hi> He answered, <hi>The
usual number, and the Duke of</hi> Lenox. And that within an hour
after the <hi>Earl</hi> commanded this Deponent to put on his secret
plate-sleeves, saying, <hi>He had an High-land man to take.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That about one a clock the <hi>Earl</hi> being at Dinner, <hi>Andrew Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
came from <hi>Alexander,</hi> and whispered to the Earl, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

from his Dinner, and sent for his Gantlet and Steel-Bonnet, and
then the <hi>King</hi> came in.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Alexander</hi> bids this Deponent, fetch the Keys of the
chambers from <hi>William Reynd,</hi> and so both went up the stairs;
but afterwards <hi>Thomas Cranston</hi> required this Deponent to come
to the <hi>Earl,</hi> who commanded him to go up to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the <hi>Earl</hi> followed, bidding this Deponent do what ere
<hi>Alexander</hi> bade him, who forthwith lockt him within the <hi>Round</hi> in
the Chamber, telling him, <hi>he must stay there till he returned;</hi> who
shortly after came with the <hi>King,</hi> and opening the Door, both of
them entred, <hi>and instantly</hi> Alexander <hi>clapping on his Hat pulled out
this Deponents Dagger, and held it to the Kings breast,</hi> saying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
ye of my Fathers murther; You shall now die for it.</hi> And mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his <hi>Higness</hi> heart with the Dagger, this Deponent tript
the same out of his hand, and believes, <hi>that if</hi> Alexander <hi>had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Dagger, so long as one might go six steps, he had killed the
King therewith.</hi> But wanting the Dagger, <hi>the King gave him gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
language, excusing himself of</hi> Gowries <hi>death. Alexander</hi> says,
<hi>Well, if you keep quiet, nothing shall a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will have of you.</hi> The King asked, <hi>What would you have?</hi>
He answered, <hi>I will bring my Brother.</hi> And having taken Oath
of the King not to cry out, nor ope the Window till his return,
he lockt them both together.</p>
                     <p>The King asked the Deponent <hi>what he was?</hi> who answered,
<hi>A Servant of my Lords.</hi> The King said, <hi>Will your Lord kill me?</hi>
The Deponent said, (with an Oath) <hi>He shall die first.</hi>

must die.</hi> And having a loose Garter, strove to binde the Kings,
hands, who said, <hi>Nay, sall you not, Ise die a free man.</hi> And this
Deponent pulled the Garter from him. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> clapt
his hand upon the Kings mouth, to stop his crying, and held his
head under his arm. But this Deponent pulled his hand from the
Kings mouth, and opened the Window, and the King cried out
thereat. Whereupon the Kings Servant came running in at the
Gate, and the Deponent ran and opened the <hi>Turn-Pike</hi> head,
whereat <hi>Iohn Ramsey</hi> entred; and this Deponent saw him give
<hi>Alexander</hi> the blow, and then this Deponent gat away.</p>

that goeth about such a business</hi> (said he) <hi>should not put any man on his

frighten his Army, forthwith sends away their shiping to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stend</hi>
and fords over the <hi>Haven,</hi> and lodges between the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
and the <hi>Sea,</hi> so to fight, or dye. The rest of the Army of
foot, passed over the next day at Ebbe, being the turn of Sir
<hi>Francis Vere</hi> to have the Van, where he found the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi>
with all his Army in Battalia, who apprehending, that these
forces were the whole Army, come over, otherwise it had been
easy for him to have prevented the <hi>Princes</hi> fording the rest. And
besides, the dust of the sand-hills drove upon the <hi>Spanish,</hi>
that blinded their sight, who were forced to halt, until all were
got over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vere</hi> with the Troops of the Van, leaving the foot, ranged
into Order, behind the sand-hills, hastens not to ingage with
the Enemy, as yet, but only to chose the place, to attend for
them, being all the advantage was left. And so got to a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
bottome between the Hills and <hi>Downs,</hi> which they might
make use of, and stop the <hi>Spaniards</hi> way, by the Sea-shore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
And so draws out 1000. men, whereof 300. <hi>English,</hi> and
50. of the Princes guard were lodg'd on the top of an Hill,
steepy and sandy, and so hollow, that they were covered from
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60657:141"/>
the other Hills, and might shoot as from a Bulwark. And the
like order upon two other Hills with 700. men more, the rest
of the <hi>English;</hi> so that this <hi>avant-guard</hi> took up the third part
of the downs.</p>
                     <p>The Prince comes to <hi>Vere,</hi> and consult, whether to advance
upon the Enemy, or to stay his coming: Most voices (as in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to advance) conceived it would rather daunt them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their fortifying upon their Princes passages to <hi>Ostend,</hi> and
so stop their victuals, and cut off any retreat thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vere</hi> was of the contrary opinion. That the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
his Army in hast, and brought thither, where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not to make a seat of warr, unprovided and without
any Magazine of victuals, and so no fear to starve the Prince
who had the sea open. And according to his Counsel here they
stayed.</p>
                     <p>The Prince returns, places his horse next the sea, six pieces
of Cannon advanced and planted in the head of the <hi>Avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard</hi>
with advantage of wind and sun, some ships of warr
waved so neer as to gall the <hi>Spanish Battalions</hi> upon the sand.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> had been hurried out, and tired, his men
with a nights March and all that day; and his adversaries mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he rested a holt, for some time, and staying till half flood,
that the <hi>Dutch</hi> might have less land for their horse, He marches,
and before him some light Horse-men to discover; One
of them suffering himself to be taken, and tels <hi>Vere</hi> (what
he knew) that some <hi>Dutch</hi> forces had been routed, brags
of their Number, valour, and resolution speedily to give bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
                     <p>And so they did; their Horsemen come in the head of
their Divisions, a competent distance, who marching neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Vere</hi> discharges his Cannon, scatters their Troops in disorder,
and fly. The <hi>Spanish</hi> foot come on &amp; discharge their Ordnance
roundlyand did much hurt, which drew them on into the <hi>Downs,</hi>
where <hi>Veres</hi> horse stood, &amp; a fit place upon a Hill for two demy
Cannons to be planted, and himself on the Top of another
which commanded all; fromw hence he gave his Orders.</p>
                     <p>Thither comes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with 500. pikes, without En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or order, labour to enter upon <hi>Veres</hi> Hill, who was forced
to succour himself with more shot, and gawled them.</p>
                     <p>Their horse likewise, Marching between the Hills, were sore
put to it by the two Demy Cannons, gawling them upon the
first profer of a charge; with the advantage also of the Princes
horse encountring, put them to a disorderly retreat.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> sees this, and once more commands <hi>Solms</hi> with
the <hi>French</hi> to fall on, assisted with the <hi>Walloons</hi> Regiments called

the Enemies <hi>Rere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Princes Rere</hi> come in with five Regiments, and a lasting
fight of three hours was doubtfully performed: the <hi>Arch Dukes</hi>
side declining, had their Horse driven almost to <hi>Newport;</hi> but
then, their Foot did the like, against the <hi>Orange</hi> party on the
<hi>Downs,</hi> to the hazard of their <hi>Ordnance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This while, <hi>Vere,</hi> with the <hi>Van,</hi> and his shadowing Hills, had
advantage thereby, to gall his Adversaries, who retire to their
<hi>Gross,</hi> from whence disbands five hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> more, and
fall upon the Assailants, forcing them back to <hi>Vere,</hi> who not
used to give ground, beats the <hi>Spaniard</hi> home again; whilest
their Battel of Foot are come up to the <hi>Gross</hi> of their <hi>Van,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
good covert, and by fresh men force <hi>Vere's</hi> men from his
Grounds of Advantage, which he sometime lost and won a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
with loss of men, his Design being to beat upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
gross body, and to engage them till the <hi>Orange</hi> other
Troops might advance, which did and retreat, and were pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
by which occasion the <hi>Arch Dukes</hi> Horse were got out of
the Foot-mens reach; an over-sight in fight; for in Battel the
success of Foot depend most on the Horse.</p>
                     <p>But the fight increased on all sides, the <hi>English</hi> on <hi>Vere's</hi> side
pell mell with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and seeing their Gross disband by
degrees, sends to the <hi>Prince</hi> to second him, with some Horse;
lest his Enemy grow too strong upon him, and so increased,
that he was forced to descend and encourage them in the
Downs; who were driven from their good Ground to Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
And at his very Approach had two Bullets through
his Leg and Thigh, which he dissembled from his Surgeon,
knowing, that his presence must encourage his Troops near foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for in all this time, the <hi>Prince</hi> sends no Relief, being put
hard to it in the <hi>Battell. Vere</hi> gave Ground, and retires to his
<hi>Canon,</hi> when his own Horse being shot, fell dead upon him;
and his hurts affording him no help of assistance being alone,
there he lay, till by good hap Sir <hi>Robert Drewry</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn
Ogle</hi> drew him from under his Horse; and being set up behinde
one, he escaped the Enemy at his heels, his hurts bleeding much
at four holes, he was forced to fall off for that present.</p>
                     <p>His Brother Sir <hi>Horace,</hi> he found at the two <hi>Canons,</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
some three hundred retreat Foot, and there staid the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

on them, with a Train also of some Barrels hid in the sand, and
made wondrous Execution.</p>
                     <p>And not till now comes Succour, two <hi>Cornets</hi> of <hi>English</hi>
from the <hi>Prince,</hi> which encourages Sir <hi>Horace,</hi> and bold necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to boot, beat the <hi>Spaniard</hi> back again; by the way, some
others fell on also, and followed them to Execution.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arch Dukes Phalanges</hi> and <hi>Battalions</hi> startle, and rowse
up, rather for defence, than revenge: and now <hi>Orange</hi> findes his
Friends have fresh courage, by the tottering effects of fight,
caused his whole <hi>Battell</hi> to advance; both meet, and joyn pell

                  </p>
                  <p>The horrid remembrance of the late execution of his <hi>Mother</hi>
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> famed by all forein <hi>Nations,</hi> for a <hi>Lady</hi> that had

living long time, to see her Son a <hi>King,</hi> renowned for <hi>wisdom,</hi>
and thereby apt to <hi>apprehend,</hi> and powerfull of himself, and so
fitted for <hi>Revenge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The splendour of Imperial <hi>Crowns</hi> are eclipsed by suffering
such <hi>ignominy,</hi> the sacred character of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> defaced,
the magnificence of the most secured <hi>Thrones</hi> destroyed, and
<hi>Sovereignty</hi> would cease to be the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for him to ascend that <hi>Throne</hi> steeming with his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
innocent bloud, wrought amazement to himself (no

                  </p>
                  <p>Best of beauties may be discoloured, and so the complexion
alters; <hi>Christian</hi> policies are good rules for <hi>Sovereignty:</hi> we
may examine his <hi>Resolution</hi> by the happy effects of his <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, he was bound to acknowledge <hi>Truths. Her Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

whom in <hi>Iustice</hi> she had <hi>destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For though her fathers <hi>will</hi> setled the <hi>succession,</hi> Her power
with the people might have allowed it, she might have <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
or <hi>Created</hi> another, and so made a favorite. Or indeed (the

                  </p>
                  <p>Her <hi>Adoption</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> was of equal <hi>Ballance</hi> with <hi>His Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi>
and (usually) as Venerably received, as <hi>Inheritance</hi> from

The One, <hi>Natural,</hi> even to <hi>Brutes,</hi> in their Ordinary
<hi>Inclinations:</hi> But <hi>Adoption</hi> operates with affection, and choice;
not from <hi>Sense,</hi> but from <hi>Reason;</hi> and examines the <hi>Object,</hi> ere
it settles the <hi>possession.</hi> And so, thus considered, <hi>she,</hi> merits
<hi>Pardon; He, Excuses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Relation,</hi> falls upon <hi>Her Counsellors</hi> then, the most
<hi>honourable birth;</hi> admirable in <hi>wisdom;</hi> and <hi>Eminent</hi> in <hi>Power;</hi>
for the King to confide in <hi>These;</hi> or <hi>They</hi> in <hi>Him. Those,</hi> that

                  <p>
                     <hi>Those</hi> hands, that hurt <hi>Her,</hi> healed <hi>Him,</hi> who <hi>sealed</hi> to <hi>Her</hi>

of theirs, be directed towards <hi>Her Person,</hi> but <hi>Her Power.</hi>

                  <p>Necessity of <hi>State,</hi> made <hi>Them</hi> submit, to sentence <hi>Her,</hi>
which otherwise, they (perhaps) would have spared, in <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
to <hi>Her,</hi> and <hi>Honor</hi> to <hi>Him.</hi> And, as their <hi>Persons</hi> were <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,</hi>
so was it hazardous for <hi>Him,</hi> to question a <hi>Crime,</hi> that
<hi>He</hi> had not power, to punish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> they are, so different in <hi>Them,</hi> as make up the wonder
in <hi>Him.</hi> How to <hi>revenge</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> and not <hi>reward</hi> the <hi>Other.</hi> Acts
of <hi>Oblivion,</hi> alwaies more <hi>Noble,</hi> than <hi>Revenge. Caesars.</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

                  <p>Acts of <hi>Honor</hi> to others memory, reflect, in effect, upon
the <hi>person present.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore; <hi>He,</hi> rather chose to Court <hi>Her Counsellors</hi>
with the favour of <hi>Clemencie,</hi> than to correct <hi>Them,</hi> with the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60657:152"/>
                     <hi>Rod</hi> of <hi>Iustice. Rigour</hi> hath much of <hi>Majesty;</hi> but <hi>Mercy</hi> hath
more of <hi>Glory.</hi> The <hi>One</hi> may be more safe, the other more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
And though <hi>Machivael,</hi> makes Fear, and Love, incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
and inseparable: <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> may <hi>Kiss</hi> each Other;
<hi>we may Fear and yet Love the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virtues</hi> consist in <hi>Concatenation.</hi> He who stiled <hi>Hanibals Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He</hi> had Examples of former <hi>Presidents;</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi>
forgat the <hi>Quarrel</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans; He</hi> did so: And
more did King <hi>Iames,</hi> which over-ruled <hi>Him,</hi> to that pious, and
prudent <hi>Consideration,</hi> that resolved into the most hapy <hi>Event,</hi>
The aym, and End, to make <hi>His</hi> design also <hi>Practical,</hi> and His
<hi>Precepts</hi> an admirable <hi>Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>He</hi> alwaies walked in, were the less obvious to Common <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps,</hi>
as they were confirmed to choicer <hi>Limits:</hi> Being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
an example to <hi>Himself,</hi> and Inimitable of all; for in
<hi>His</hi> way, few went, before <hi>Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus resolved, whilst Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> age and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
increased, He wanted not Parasites of Her own Court,
that constantly offered their Intelligence of all Her Actions
and weak condition, which gave him timely occasion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the settlement of his affairs at home in reference to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of <hi>England.</hi> His first was for <hi>Religion,</hi> and to judg with
what affection the Kirk of <hi>Scotland</hi> had faction,<note place="margin">The King settles affairs in Scotland in Religion.</note> with <hi>Calvins</hi>
documents; very averse from <hi>Papistrie,</hi> but subject to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Neighbour schisms; And how to ballance them,
was his work to wade through.</p>
                  <p>It was no boot heretofore to strive against this stream at
home, and therefore he suffered the violence to run into the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Chanel, for that time; Wisely weighing, the perverse pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness
of the Ministery; And with what constitutions they
had linckt themselves, with the publick affections of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and withall got a mixt power in the affairs of <hi>State;</hi> And
it was not, for him, to break through that Custom, which
yet he foresaw must afterwards quarrel with the Customes of his
successive <hi>Inheritance,</hi> where Episcopacie had fixed such firm
footing.</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">Bacilic on do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> laying the foundation of his adventure on His own

                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed, their Reformation from <hi>Popery,</hi> as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
by <hi>God,</hi> so was it done Inordinately, by popular
<hi>Tumult</hi> and <hi>Rebellion;</hi> of such, as did the work; clog'd with
passion, and particular respects (as in other Neighbouring <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>)

of his <hi>Grand-mother</hi> and his <hi>Mother</hi> (as hath been related)
and afterwards, usurping larger liberty under four Regents in
His Long <hi>Minority;</hi> and by these occasions, setled themselves,
in hope, to lead the people by the Nose, and so in all facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
then, (and for many years before, and sythence) to spouse
any quarrel, as their own; evermore esteeming <hi>Him,</hi> the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
evil, not by any Vice, but only, to be a King.</p>
                  <p>And because, some of the Ministery, the more grave and
learned, were asham'd to side with them, therefore the other
sort, preached themselves, a Parity in the Church; <hi>the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Confusion, and enemy to unity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which means, great disorder was likely to follow, which
the <hi>King</hi> sought by several waies to prevent, or countermine
their subtlety, with His wisdom. The professed <hi>Puritan</hi> being
a <hi>Sect,</hi> whom no deserts could oblige, nor their own Oaths, or
promises bind; and whose consciences, had not more of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
than their own conceits.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, the <hi>Kings</hi> preservative, against such, was
to advance learning in their Ministers. In whom truly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

time, (who was able to try Men) it was very defective, (taking
a pride in their pretended zeal, to shadow their great ignorance
in divine knowledg, making their shop dark, thereby to vent
false wares to the people) And so, to keep ballance in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
conditions, with those of the <hi>Episcopacie.</hi> And to avoid
extreams, to repress the Vanity of the <hi>Precisian,</hi> so not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the excess of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and to chain them both, with such
bonds and ligaments, as did preserve that <hi>Estate,</hi> from creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into very great Corruption; Even in the period of time
when their Doctrines had amplified into Heads of very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequence. Errors grow fastest in hot brains, but their
Obstinacie therein is that dead flesh, which makes the green

she took upon her to meddle in all <hi>their</hi> affairs, and so to tamper

was not over-nice to take upon her.</p>

in childe-bed of a Son, whose life and fortune shall be a mirrour
to posterity; and therefore he was brought up with a <hi>Person</hi> of
<hi>Honour,</hi> with great observance, which made him capable of

                  <p>In whose defence <hi>George</hi> fights on horse-back, with his <hi>Lance</hi>

                  <p>This story not difficult for the Moral, which served those

                  <p>Whether this <hi>Saint</hi> and his story (with others) were invented

                  </p>
                  <p>It is said by <hi>Matthew Paris, in Gulielmo secundo, pag. 57.</hi> that
<hi>St: George</hi> appeared in the air with an Army of white Horses,
fighting for the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> against the <hi>Turk.</hi> But to say,
there was no such <hi>Saint,</hi> and to change all literal sense into an
<hi>Allegory</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church;</hi> yet it may seem more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that our <hi>English Nation,</hi> amongst so many <hi>Saints</hi> that
were, would chuse <hi>one</hi> to be their <hi>Patron</hi> that was not at all,
especially seeing the World in that Age had rather a glut than a
famine of <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The intent of those times was pious, to gain credit, and to
convert to <hi>Christianity;</hi> but then, so to prosecute it, as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
still continue to do, must be condemned, thinking to
grace the <hi>Gospel</hi> by such absurdities; for <hi>Heaven</hi> has a <hi>Pillory</hi>
to punish <hi>fraus pia</hi> her self: and indeed, better to leave <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>

wrought a stay of the <hi>Popes</hi> declaration against the <hi>Queen,</hi>
grounding this favour, (no doubt) from his own fears, lest
that a Union of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the person of <hi>Mary</hi> the

                  <p>How equall soever Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had been for peace or

her self; for by those courses King <hi>Iames</hi> found her Treasure
exhausted, and the Estate of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> in this

                  <p>He saw <hi>Germany</hi> upon an immoveable centre of self-great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Empire.</note>

                  <p>Now whilst these Potentates lived, thus fettered within the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness

Mines of gold effectual, not only to carry on any design, with

make way, where he list, by corrupting the <hi>Counsels</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of any <hi>King,</hi> with temptation and underminings, either
by his purse, or the pates of <hi>Iesuits.</hi> So that in a word, he
was now grown hard to be pleased, and dangerous to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Through all these Considerations King <hi>Iames</hi>
                     <note place="margin">King James Interest.</note> comes in, to
choose his <hi>Game,</hi> and through all these distempers abroad, he was
to secure himself, and his new Inheritance. His safest way to take
breath for the present, was to make peace with <hi>Spain</hi> first of
all, and after with the rest; (which indeed were done together)
presuming that being in his power so to do then, it should depend
on his pleasure, to break off after, or to conserve it to his death,
which he did.</p>
                  <p>And being a wise and wary Prince, rather solid than formal,
having been well seasoned at home with practice, and broken
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60657:160"/>
to affairs abroad; therefore now freed from former Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
he began to search into the ground of his preceding mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in <hi>Scotland:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of War and Conquests.</note> and well assured, where the Sword bears sway,
<hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> (the Guiders of the best of humane <hi>Action)</hi>
do not always endure the lasting, no not of the memory of the
<hi>Actors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here therefore He began to consider, what advance ambitious
Princes lust after, for the present, when hazardous success hurls
upon them miserable events.</p>
                  <p>He was not ignorant of the interests of <hi>Christian Estates,</hi>
one with the other (as is said) and how it concerned them to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress
him for his amity.</p>
                  <p>Amongst them all, whom to trust, he was not assured, and
how to depend upon his new Inheritance without confederacy,
might be the best <hi>Counsel,</hi> but the most difficult.</p>
                  <p>He therefore (to avoid difference with any) made <hi>Peace</hi>

How long was it, that wickedness had leave to lord it? With
what strength of policy, the Tyrants of each time, sold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to settle the work of sin? And though in the period of
that portion of time (compared with everlasting) and of our
neighbour-affairs, (with the succeeds of the vast Universe) In
these (I say) he religiously observes (perchance in some) the

were kept under heretofore, began now to raise their hopes and

                  <p>Amongst many of sundry conditions,<note place="margin">Court and Character of King James, p. 31.</note> we fall upon the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy</hi>

late <hi>Relators,</hi> and huddled up in obscurity, as not many men in
these days believe it for truth: to undeceive them, I shall give
the world that story.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> was a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of good Alliance in the

always the place of esteem with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which she
would say, <hi>fitted youth for the future.</hi> But he staid not there: and
as his fate would have him, of the <hi>Sword</hi> first, so destiny drew
him on, to have a mixt Reputation with the <hi>Gown;</hi> for he was

                  </p>
                  <p>And such ways as these, were his introductions (the best
hopes of his Risings) Some natural parts he had, a good wit and
judgment, but his best Weapon was his <hi>Tongue,</hi> which gave
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60657:161"/>
him repute to be learned then, but after, he improved to more
value in his future troubles, the best School to a wise man.</p>
                  <p>His quarrel with <hi>Grey</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> was there complain'd to a
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War,</hi>

in <hi>pleading;</hi> which so took them, especially <hi>Leicester,</hi> that
the <hi>Queen</hi> was told the Tale, and more of him; which begot
esteem from her, and envy from others; however, he held up,
being accounted a cunning <hi>Courtier,</hi> in that ticklish <hi>Trade,</hi>
whereof, he that once breaks, seldom sets up again; but he got
by those losses, and thriv'd best after such compounding.</p>

<hi>Silva caedua quae succisa renascitur,</hi> and so flourished oft
times after, without absolute impute to his <hi>Princes</hi> pleasure. His
Enemies of greater Rank kept him in and out, which made him
then to decline himself out of the Court-rode; in <hi>Voyages</hi> to
the <hi>West Indies, Guiana, New Plantations, Virginia;</hi> or else in
some <hi>Expeditions</hi> against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> which confirm'd him a
grand Opposer of the general <hi>Peace</hi> which King <hi>Iames</hi> brought
in, and that brought <hi>Ralegh</hi> to his ruine.</p>
                  <p>He rose no higher than Governour of <hi>Iersey,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">His Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</note> Lord <hi>Warden</hi>

in the <hi>State</hi> at all:<note place="margin">by the Queen.</note> and therefore most men of parts that want of
their pride of Preferment, are tired with lingring expectation of
change, from the settled way of Sovereignty; which in every
shift of Princes gives fair hopes to many, neither so mean nor
modest, but to please themselves with Objects of Advance: So
this man, ambitious of his conceited merits, put himself for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
a little too soon.</p>
                  <p>Busie he had been heretofore, to speak his minde of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
affairs, and therein he pleased his late <hi>Mistress;</hi> for then,
his inclination went with the humour of those times of War;
but now, his counsel came out of season.</p>
                  <p>For, at the entrance of the <hi>King,</hi> he was presented by <hi>Ralegh</hi>
with a Manuscript of his own making against the <hi>Peace</hi> with
<hi>Spain:</hi> it was his Table-talk to beget more esteem, which took
accordingly, and the way, to unbend him, was the work of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Faction; either to buy him out of that humour, or to abuse
him into worse condition, which was effected by this way.</p>
                  <p>To mould him into <hi>Treason,</hi> there was a medley of divers
conditions,<note place="margin">His Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy and manner of Treason.</note> but the Contrivers were two Priests, <hi>Watson</hi> and
<hi>Clark,</hi> and Count <hi>Arembergh</hi> Ambassadour Extraordinary for
the <hi>Arch Duke,</hi> who brought in the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he his
<hi>Brother,</hi> and the <hi>Parham,</hi> and others, and they the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of
<hi>Wilton:</hi> Then came in Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> the wisest of them all,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60657:162"/>
who dallied, like the Fly with the flame, till it consumed him.</p>
                  <p>Willing he was (it seems) to know it, and thought by his wit,
to over-reach the Confederates whom he knew well enough,
though none but <hi>Cobham,</hi> (for a good while) dealt with him;
and with him <hi>Ralegh</hi> play'd fast and loose, till himself was
caught in the Gin.</p>
                  <p>There was one <hi>Matthew de Laurencie</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laurencie.</note> here at <hi>London,</hi> but a
Merchant of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> with whom <hi>Cobham</hi> held intelligence, for
many years before, and for some Reasons of <hi>State,</hi> connived at,
by the late <hi>Queen</hi> and her <hi>Council.</hi> This man, was the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which <hi>Arembergh</hi> used to <hi>Cobham,</hi> who was now much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented.</p>
                  <p>These three made the first step to the Contrivements, and it
hath been my jealousie, (for I laboured the truth) that <hi>Laurencie</hi>
betray'd it; I being often present with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> in his
Imprisonment, when he privately discoursed hereof.</p>
                  <p>But such Designs, like wounds, if they take air corrupt; their
Project could not be covertly carried, consisting after wards of
several persons of different tempers and unsuiting souls; and so,
through the rifts and chinks of their several aims and ends,

                  </p>
                  <p>To the first was read <hi>Brooks Confession,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Brooks his confession.</note> that his Brother <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

from</hi> Ralegh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ralegh</hi> answered, <hi>That</hi> Brooks <hi>was his Enemy;</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>That</hi> Cobham <hi>was ever your Friend; and it would seem
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60657:162"/>
a strange malice in</hi> Brooks, <hi>to ruine his Brother, to undo you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the second part, there was produced a <hi>Book</hi> (which I have
read) <hi>A Defence of the</hi> Queens <hi>Proceedings against</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of
Scots:</hi> The <hi>Title</hi> could defend it self, but the <hi>matter</hi> therein
meddled too much in a dangerous consequence, to the <hi>Kings</hi>
Succession, and treasonable enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cobham</hi> had confessed,<note place="margin">Cobham's confession.</note> 
                     <hi>That</hi> Ralegh <hi>delivered to him that Book,
and he to</hi> Brooks, <hi>and</hi> Brooks <hi>to</hi> Grey, upon <hi>Cobham</hi>'s discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
<hi>Ralegh</hi> acknowledged, that it contained <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>scandal</hi>
to the <hi>Kings Title;</hi> and that he had leave of Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi>
(after his Fathers death) to look into his <hi>Study,</hi> for <hi>Cosmographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Manuscripts</hi> of the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and so lighted on this <hi>Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cecil <hi>then present upon the</hi> Bench,<note place="margin">Cecils speech,</note> 
                     <hi>acknowledged this leave,
and said,</hi> He would then, as really have trusted him, as any man,
though since for some infirmities of Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> the bonds of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
were crakt; and yet, preserving his duty to the <hi>King,</hi> which
may not be dispenced withall, he swore (By God) he loved him, and
had a great conflict in himself, that so compleat a member had fallen
from the <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this passage needs no soothing to excuse <hi>Cecil</hi> either <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
or <hi>Son;</hi> for I have heard Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> when he was
<hi>Salisbury</hi> to say publickly at his own Table, that he had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and kept all the considerable <hi>Libells</hi> against the late
<hi>Queen</hi> and this <hi>King;</hi> but though justifiable in them as <hi>Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
of <hi>State,</hi> yet was it a crime in <hi>Ralegh,</hi> who never was any.
And this <hi>Book,</hi> as I remember, was of one <hi>Brag</hi> or <hi>Crag</hi> a <hi>Iesuit.</hi>
But Sir <hi>Walter</hi> excused all, <hi>That there was nothing acted thereby, to
the Kings prejudice, for that Book was burnt, and others are in
print.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to insist hereupon, <hi>Cobham</hi> had confessed, <hi>that</hi> Ralegh <hi>had
agreed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cobham's confessions.</note> 
                     <hi>that he should treat with</hi> Arembergh <hi>for six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>

this Design in the</hi> Low Countreys, Flanders, France, <hi>and</hi>
Spain; <hi>and to carry three Letters from Her to the</hi> Arch Duke,
Duke <hi>of</hi> Savoy, <hi>and</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Spain; <hi>and to promise Toleration of</hi>
Religion, <hi>and Her to be disposed of in</hi> Marriage; <hi>that at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
he should meet</hi> Ralegh <hi>at</hi> Jersey <hi>(the place of his command)
and there to agree, how to dispose the money to Discontents; and</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh
<hi>should have seven thousand</hi> Crowns <hi>from</hi> Arembergh <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further confessed, <hi>That</hi> Ralegh <hi>had instigated him to all
these Treasons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that <hi>Ralegh</hi> should say, <hi>That the best way to trouble</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>was to cause Division in</hi> Scotland.</p>
                  <p>To this onely of <hi>Scotland, Ralegh</hi> answered, and confessed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60657:163"/>
the words, and that he had so thought these twenty years. <hi>It
seems by the sequel since, in these our days, that he was not much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</hi>

                     <hi>That</hi> Cobham <hi>might appear to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him face to face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may not omit this passage, that when the <hi>Confederates</hi> had
suffered under some <hi>Examination,</hi> and restrained to their several
<hi>Houses;</hi> and <hi>Ralegh</hi> well knowing that <hi>Laurencie</hi> was suspected,<note place="margin">Ralegh at first discovers Laurencie.</note>
but not examined, then did <hi>Ralegh</hi> discover in a <hi>Letter</hi> to Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Cecil,</hi> where <hi>Laurencie</hi> was in secret with <hi>Cobham,</hi> and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
to apprehend him, and so to intercept their intelligence,
whilest matters were ripe.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s Design was herein, is not imagined, but this
use was made of it, to <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s ruine; for, after that <hi>Cobham</hi>
had denied much of the former stuff, upon his first <hi>Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
this <hi>Letter</hi> was shewed to him, under <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s hand; then
<hi>Cobham</hi> in an extasie, railing against <hi>Ralegh,</hi> delivered his posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Accusation</hi> of him, as is before mentioned, and added, that
after <hi>Ralegh</hi>'s first <hi>Examination</hi> before the <hi>Lords,</hi> he writ to <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
That although he had been examined of many matters, he had
cleared</hi> Cobham <hi>of all:</hi> when (as the <hi>Lords</hi> protested) he had
not been at all examined concerning <hi>Cobham:</hi> and thereby this
was inferred (by the <hi>Council</hi>) to confirm <hi>Cobham,</hi> to deny all,
when he should be examined.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> said, <hi>That</hi> Cobham <hi>had not signed his Accusation,
and that he was at the worst, but</hi> singularis Testis.<note place="margin">Cobham singularis testis.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the <hi>Lord chief Iustice</hi> gave it for Law, that it was
not necessary for either.</p>
                  <p>After much pleading, <hi>Ralegh</hi> urging <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> for
not admitting a <hi>single witness,</hi> to condemn, yet the <hi>Court</hi> was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
by the <hi>Iudges,</hi> to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Then said <hi>Ralegh, Prove it by one witness, face to face, and I will
confess my self guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Iudges</hi> were of opinion, not to admit that neither;
yet <hi>Ralegh</hi> insisted thereon with many <hi>stories</hi> and <hi>Presidents,</hi>
which took up much time.</p>
                  <p>But being asked, <hi>Will you be concluded, if</hi> Cobham <hi>should
justifie his Accusation, under his hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this it may be observed, that <hi>Ralegh</hi> made no Answer at
all, knowing his guilt, but consented that the <hi>Iury</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> Council being to speak last,<note place="margin">Cobham's last Letter condemned Ralegh.</note> they produced <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Letter, under his hand, writ but the day before. In effect
thus:</p>

                     <pb n="287" facs="tcp:60657:163"/>That Sir <hi>Walter</hi> had writ a letter to him, wrapt in an <hi>Aple,</hi>
and cast in at his window in the Tower, ten daies since, to intreat
him for Gods sake to write to him under his own hand, that he had
wronged him in his accusations; advising him to be constant in
denials, rather than to appeal to the King.</p>
                  <p>And now (writes <hi>Cobham</hi>) It is no time to dissemble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
protested, before God and his Angels, that all and every part
of his accusation of Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> was substantially true,
<hi>and added</hi> that <hi>Ralegh</hi> had delt with him, since the Kings coming,
to procure him a pension from <hi>Spain,</hi> for Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Ralegh</hi> rayl'd at him,<note place="margin">Ralegh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to be read.</note> confessed that letter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

                  <p>And here <hi>Ralegh</hi> confessed, that <hi>Cobham</hi> had offered to him

                  </p>

                  <p>

                  <p>And <hi>Ralegh</hi> fifteen years after lost his life by the Axe for
this Treason. See. 1618.</p>

                     <hi>Ralegh</hi> insisted upon, for his advantage in the tryal.</p>
                  <p>But in truth, (besides the confessions) <hi>His fatal evidence was</hi>
Cobhams <hi>own voluntary last letter overnight, writ every whit
with his own hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King commanded (as the Court was assured at his tryal)
that no Examinant should be wrackt, which made Captain
<hi>Kemish</hi> (the Emissary between them) to protest afterwards in
my hearing, that in truth he was threatned with the wrack,
which was shewed to him, and that had he tasted thereof, it
should have inforced him, to tel an odd tale, <hi>meaning</hi> of guilt.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was admitted a chair, pen, Inck, paper, and
truly he rather tired the Court and Jury with Impertinences,
though he spoke well.</p>
                  <p>Not much to remind what we have said concerning the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours

                  </p>
                  <p>To pacifie such, He appoints a <hi>Conference,</hi> to be held with
the <hi>Episcopacie,</hi> and <hi>Them,</hi> at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court. In the mean
time to let them see what they should trust unto, he sets forth a
Proclamation,</p>
                  <p>Against such as seditiously seek Reformation in Church Matters;<note place="margin">Proclamation against them.</note>
And that the Constitution and doctrine here, is agreeable to Gods

forewarnes them of publick invectives, gathering of Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                  </p>
                  <p>But in truth these men were too hasty, and might well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the King of such their behaviour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
to prevent, he did for ever after advance the power of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie</hi>

<hi>the</hi> Bishops <hi>of</hi> London, Durham, Winton, Worcester, St:

                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:60657:166"/>On the other part were these Doctors, <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and <hi>Sparks,</hi>
Mr: <hi>Knewstubs,</hi> and Mr: <hi>Chaderton,</hi> Agents for the <hi>(Millenary</hi>
Plaintiffs,<note place="margin">See Confer. at Hampton-Court.</note> says the <hi>Book</hi>) and these four were the fittest, that
could be found amongst them all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King sent for the Bishops to come before him in private,
and entered their Assemblying, with a grave and princely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of this his general drift;</hi> By example of all Christian
Princes, in commencements of their Reign, establishing the Doctrine
and policy of the Church; <hi>Henry 8.</hi> did it toward the end of his
Reign; <hi>Edward 6.</hi> altered more; Queen <hi>Mary</hi> reversed all; and
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> settled it as now it standeth; His happiness is to
have no cause to alter, but to confirm what he findeth, and which so
affects him, that he entered into a gratulation to Almighty God, for
bringing him into the promised Land, where Religion was purely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
and to sit amongst grave, learned and reverend men, not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
elsewhere, a King without State, Honour, or Order, where beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
boys would yet beard him to his face; acknowledging now the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
Ecclesiastical to be approved by manifold blessings of God,
increase of the Gospel, and a glorious Peace. But as nothing could
be so ordered, but may have additions, and in any State, (as in the body
of man) corruptions might insensibly grow, either through time or
persons, of which some complaints have pretended Reformation:
His purpose therefore was, to try the complaints and remove the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
if scandalous; or to cure them, if dangerous; or, if but
frivolous, to take so much knowledg thereof, as to cast a Sop into
<hi>Cerberus</hi> his mouth, never to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And in particular the King signified,<note place="margin">The Kings private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> he called them alone,
about some points, to be satisfied himself concerning the <hi>Book</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, for the <hi>use;</hi> at first indeed upon occasion, that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi>
being <hi>baptized</hi> and <hi>answering</hi> by their <hi>Patrini,</hi> it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

                     <p>The <hi>Arch Bishop</hi> shewed the Antiquity of <hi>Confirmation</hi> from
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> till of late some particular Churches had rejected it:
he declared the lawfull use thereof; and affirmed, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> did not hold Baptism imperfect without it,
or added any thing to the virtue and strength thereof: this he
manifested by the Rubricks in the <hi>Communion Book</hi> before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> said, It did not depend onely upon
Antiquity, as in <hi>Cyprian, Ep. 73.</hi> and <hi>Hierom. adversus Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi>
but was one of the particular points of the Apostles Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism
in express words, <hi>Heb. 6. 2.</hi> and so did <hi>Calvin</hi> expound
that very place, which was read and approved.</p>
                     <p>That we made it not a Sacrament or Corroboration; and yet
the King was of opinion, it might rather be intituled <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                     <p>It was cleared from all abuse or superstition, the Minister
does but pronounce Absolution in general, after the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that in the <hi>Communion Book</hi> there was another particular
and personal Form of Absolution for the Visitation of the Sick;
and that the Confessions of <hi>Augusta, Boheme, Saxon,</hi> which be
there cited do retain and allow it, and so does <hi>Calvin</hi> approve
such a kinde of Confession and Absolution.</p>

                     <p>That the Administration by Women and Layicks was not
practised of the Church, but inquired of by Bishops in their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitations
and censured; and although the words in the <hi>Book</hi>
might seem doubtfull, yet the Compilers did not so intend
them, and yet propounded them ambiguously, (perhaps) that
it might thereby pass in Parliament, and in case of necessity one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and was so, agreeable to the practice of ancient Church, as
<hi>Acts 2.</hi> where three thousand were baptized in one day; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the Apostles to do themselves, or improbable, and
besides them there were no Bishops or Priests; and <hi>Tertullian</hi>
and Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> in <hi>Ephes. 4.</hi> are plain in that point; laying
open also the impious opinions, who think there is no necessity
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60657:167"/>
of Baptism; not, as if without it God could not save the
Childe; and the case being put as incertain, if not baptized;
but, if baptized, an evident assurance, and so rather to ground
upon <hi>Christ</hi>'s promise, than by omission upon Gods secret judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The King replied,</hi> That the place <hi>Acts 2.</hi> was an act extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
the Church then unsettled and ungrounded, now stablished and
flourishing; that he maintained necessity of Baptism; as to the place
of Saint <hi>John, Nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua, &amp;c.</hi> was meant of
Baptism; and that fourteen Moneths ago, he did argue in <hi>Scotland</hi>
against his Divines there, for ascribing too little to that Sacrament;
so that <hi>(said he)</hi> a pert Minister asked him, if it were so necessary,
that being omitted, the Child should not be saved? He answered, No.
But if you be called (though in private) to baptize him, and refuse, I
think you shall be damned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But he concluded,</hi> Necessity of Baptism to be necessary by lawfull
Ministers, and none other, and yet utterly disliked Rebaptization,
though after either Women or Laicks.</p>
                     <p>Here the Bishop of <hi>Winton</hi> affirmed, that to deny baptizing
by private persons in case of necessity, crossed all Antiquity;
that the Minister is not of the <hi>essence</hi> of the Sacrament, yet is he
of the essence of the right and lawfull Ministry thereof; the
commission of <hi>Christ, Matth. 28. 20. Go preach and baptize.</hi>

1562. might be explain'd where obscure, and enlarged
where defective, <hi>viz. Acts 16.</hi> the words are these, <hi>After we

seem to be contrary to the Doctrine of Gods Predestination
and Election in Article 17. both these words might be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this addition, <hi>yet neither totally, nor finally;</hi> and that the

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, where it is said in Article 23. that none should
preach or administer Sacraments in the <hi>Congregation</hi> without
lawfull calling; he said, implied, a lawfulness for any man <hi>out</hi> of
the <hi>Congregation</hi> to preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he had no lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in Article 25. touching <hi>Confirmation,</hi> grown partly
of the corrupt following the Apostles, being opposite to those
in the Collect of <hi>Confirmation</hi> in the <hi>Communion Book, Upon
whom after the example of the Apostles;</hi> argue (saith he) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
each to other; the first confessing Confirmation to be a
depraved imitation of the Apostles; the second, grounding it
on their example, <hi>Acts 8. 19.</hi> as if the Bishop in <hi>confirming chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
did by imposing his hands, (as the Apostles do in those
places) give the visible graces of the Holy Ghost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore
he desired that both the contradictions might be considered,
and this ground of contradiction examined.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> first desired his Majesty, <hi>That the

antient Canon might be remembred,</hi> Schismatici contra Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos
non sunt audiendi.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that if any of these parties were in the Number
of the 1000. Ministers who had once subscribed,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
against it, they might be removed, according to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
decree of an antient Counsel, <hi>That no man should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to speak against what he had subscribed,</hi> and contrary to a
statute,<note place="margin">1. Elizabeth.</note> to speak <hi>against the Liturgie and discipline established,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging
what Master <hi>Cartwright</hi> had confirmed, that <hi>we ought
rather to conform to Orders and Ceremonies to the fashion of the</hi>
Turks, <hi>than to the</hi> Papists,</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>falling from Grace,</hi> the said Bishop said,<note place="margin">Falling from grace.</note> that
very many Men neglecting holiness of Life, presumed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in Grace, laying all their Religion on <hi>Predistination, if
I shall be saved, I shall be saved,</hi> a desperate doctrine, wherein
we should rather reason <hi>ascendendo</hi> than <hi>descendendo,</hi> Thus, <hi>I live</hi>
in Obedience <hi>to God, In love with my Neighbour, I follow my voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. I trust God hath elected me, and predestinated me to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
But contrariwise they use this argument, <hi>God hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated
and chosen me to life, and though I sin never so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously,
I shall not be damned, for whom he once loveth, he loveth
eternally.</hi> Whereupon he shewed what was the doctrine of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> briefly, <hi>That we must receive Gods promises
as they are set forth generally in Scripture, and do that will of God,
which is expresly declared in Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King wished that the doctrine of Predestination be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
handled, lest on the one side Gods Omnipotencie might be
questioned, by impeaching the doctrine of Predestination, or
on the other, a desperate presumption might be averred, by
inferring the necessary certainty of standing and persisting in
grace.</p>
                     <p>To the second it was answered, none but a Licensed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
might preach,<note place="margin">Licensed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> nor administer the Eucharist or the Lords
supper, and for private Baptism (the King said) he had ordered
already.</p>
                     <p>The third point was observed, to be of Curiosity or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,<note place="margin">Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
because the Article (there read) <hi>These five commonly called
Sacraments, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, &amp;c. are not to be
accounted Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown
partly of the corrupt following the Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> Insinuateth, that
the making of <hi>Confirmation to be a sacrament,</hi> is a corrupt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
But the Communion-Book makes it to be <hi>according to
the Apostles example,</hi> which being read, the King concluded it
to be but a Libel. Now for the ground thereof, it was not so
much founded on the places in the <hi>Acts,</hi> but upon <hi>Heb. 6. 2.</hi>

                     <p>It was conceived, that Lay-Patrones presented such, as liked

                     <p>Some moved to settle a praying Ministery another while,
for there are many excellent duties in the Ministers, Absolving

                     <p>The King said it was most necessary to plant by preaching, but in
a Church so long established in faith, onely the Hypocrite placed all

and desired not to be exacted; their reason, The books
Apocryphal, enjoyned in the Common prayer-book to be read,
were in part erroneous. Instanced <hi>Ecclus. 48. 10.</hi> That <hi>Elias</hi>
was to come before Christ, and so Christ not to be come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith he) <hi>Ecclus.</hi> useth the very words of <hi>Elias</hi> in Person,
which <hi>Malachi</hi> Chap. 4. doth apply to <hi>Elias</hi> in resemblance,
which both an Angell, <hi>Luke 1. 17.</hi> and our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 11.</hi>
did interpret to be <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was answered with Sir <hi>Ieromes</hi> distinction, <hi>Canonici sunt ad

an even Order. Not all Canonical books to be read in the
Church, unless to be interpreted, nor any <hi>Apocrypha</hi> at all, where
any error, but such as were clear with the scriptures, else why
printed? As the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> excellent to make up the story of the
Jews persecution, but not to teach a man to sacrifice for the
dead, or to kill himself.</p>
                     <p>But the King finding them to insist so hotly against <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticus,</hi>
the place being read, he shewed who the Author was, then
the cause why he did write it, next Analyzed that Chapter, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the precedents and consequents thereof, lastly, exactly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
unfolded the sum of that place, arguing and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that whatsoever <hi>Ben Sirach</hi> had said there of <hi>Elias, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
had in his own person while he lived performed and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished;
So that the <hi>Susurrus</hi> at the first mention, was not so
great, as the astonishment was now at the Kings sodain sound
and admirable interpretation, concluding, that the opposers did
ill, to impose upon a Man that was dead, a contrary sence; and
(smyling) told the Lords, what, trow yee, makes these men so

3. The third Objection against Subscription were <hi>Interrogatories</hi>
in <hi>Baptism</hi> propounded to Infants; that out of <hi>Austin, Baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
was <hi>credere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King said, <hi>Ego non intelligo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Bishop <hi>Winton</hi> aiming at his meaning, shewed the use thereof
out of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> and the reason, <hi>Qui peccavit in altero, credat
in altero.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was seconded by the King,</hi> That the Question should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the party whom it principally concerned, as <hi>(saith he)</hi> by
example of my self, to whom Interrogatories were propounded, when
he was crowned in his infancy in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Knewstubs</hi> fell out with the Cross in Baptism;
first, as the offence of weak Brethren, <hi>Rom. 14. &amp; 1 Cor. 8.</hi> the
consciences of the weak not to be offended.</p>
                     <p>It was answered, <hi>Distingue tempora &amp; concordabunt Scripturae;</hi>
then a Church not settled, ours long flourishing; asking them,
How long they meant to be weak? Whether five and forty
years were not sufficient? Then, who they were? For it is not
now required <hi>Subscription</hi> of Laicks and Idiots, but Preachers
and Ministers; that it was rather doubted, some of them were
not to be fed with milk, being strong enough, if not head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong,
and thought themselves able to teach all the Bishops.</p>
                     <p>Their Objections were, whether the Church had power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
an external significant sign?</p>
                     <p>Answered, It was used in Baptism onely as a Ceremony, and
as by their own example, who make Imposition of hands in their
Ordination of Pastors, to be a sign significant; all our actions in
Prayer are ceremonies significant; the <hi>Iews</hi> to their <hi>Moses</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
have added signs and words, <hi>Take and eat these in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
&amp;c. Drink this in remembrance, &amp;c.</hi> Upon which addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and tradition, our Saviour at his last Supper celebration
used the same, as approving that fact of theirs, and generally
that a Church may insti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ute a sign significant.</p>
                     <p>Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> confessed the use of the Cross ever since the
Apostles, but whether in Baptism, <hi>Quaere?</hi> It was used in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism
in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who was no Papist.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Knewstubs</hi> said, Though the Church had power to add
significant signs, yet not to add where <hi>Christ</hi> had ordained
but one; as not to add a private Seal to the great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was answered, that no sign or thing was added to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
which was fully and perfectly finished, before any
mention of the Cross is made.</p>
                     <p>Then it was opposed,<note place="margin">Opponent.</note> how far such an Ordinance of the
Church was binding, without impeaching Christian liberty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The King told him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Answer.</note> He would not dispute that point, but argue
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60657:171"/>
as Kings speak in Parliament, <hi>Le Roy s' avisera;</hi> adding, that it
smelt rank of Anabaptism, saying, A beardless Boy <hi>(John Black)</hi>
in a conference I had with the Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> vouchsafed to
say, He would conform to my Ordinances for Doctrine; but for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, they were left in Christian libertie to every man as he was
more or less illuminated of Gods Spirit; even till they grow mad with
their own light: but I will have one Doctrine, one Discipline, one
Religion in substance and ceremony.</p>
                     <p>They urged the stamping the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> to pouder by
<hi>Ezekias,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Opponent.</note> because the people abused it to idolatry, and so it was
abused in time of Popery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore said the King,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Answer.</note> It shall continue, because you say, it
was abused in Popery to superstition; it implies, it was well used be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Popery, and so now.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Here the King remembered,</hi> that he had lived long with such
men as these, but never of them; they do so peremptorily disallow of
all things, which had been any way used in Popery. The Papists ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
us with <hi>Novelties,</hi> which truly I cannot better answer, than to
tell them, their abuses are <hi>new,</hi> but the good things which they abused
we retain, and forsake the <hi>novel</hi> corruption; for by the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we may renounce the Trinity, and all that is holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Popery.</p>
                     <p>What resemblance is there between the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> a visible
thing, and the sign of a Cross made in the air? The Papists never
ascribed any power or spiritual grace to the Cross in Baptism; the
material Crosses are by us demolished, as you desire, which the Papists
used to idolatry.</p>

                     <p>Sir, <hi>said the King to</hi> Reynolds, you have spoken for my Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,

Ecclesiastical Government, dislike my Supremacy?</p>
                     <p>He answered, No.</p>
                     <p>I will tell you a Tale, After Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had overthrown <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward 6.</hi> his settlement of Religion, whereupon Mas. <hi>Knox</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
writes to the Queen Regent my Grand-mother, a virtuous and
moderate Princess, telling her, She was Supreme Head of the Church,
charging her in Gods Name to take care of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Evangil,</hi> and
suppress the Prelates. But how long trow ye, held this? Even till he
and his Adherents were shuffled in, and understood matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
declined her Authority, assuming all Ecclesiastick into
their own hands, and according to more light wherewith they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
illumination, made further Reformation. How they dealt with
my good Mother, not allowing to her breeding a poor Chapel; but her
Supremacy was not sufficient Authority: and how with me in my
minority, these times remember.</p>

My Lords Bishops, I thank you that these men plead for my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
now; they think you too hard for them, but by appealing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, as if you were not well affected; but I say, [No Bishop, no

Gang, to pray for my Person as King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. but for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
over all persons, they pass that over. If this be all you can
say, Ile make you subscribe, or hurry you out of <hi>England.</hi>

                        <hi>The King was shewed the three Articles which are to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60657:172"/>
                        <hi>and</hi> Common Prayer-Book. <hi>His Majesty said,</hi> Subscription
was necessary to prevent Tumults in the Church, 2ly. Because the
Minister must answer for every Minister, for <hi>turpius ejicitur quam

affection, and to avoid confusion, and he that would be refractory
deserved to be hanged, <hi>praestat ut pereat unus quam unitas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the Oath <hi>ex Officio,</hi> the King prevented that old
Allegation, <hi>Nemo cogitur detegere suam turpitudinem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ex officio.</note> said that
civil proceedings only punished facts, but Ecclesiastical Courts
looked unto <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Scandal;</hi> that there was necessary the Oath
Compurgator and <hi>ex officio,</hi> with moderation <hi>in gravioribus cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus;</hi> 2ly. In such of publick <hi>Fame,</hi> and to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where lying with a wench, though but sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
was made publick, to all the states and people, at the
stool of repentance. And here the King described the Oath
<hi>ex officio, the grounds thereof, the wisdom of the Law therein, the
manner of proceeding thereby, and the necessary use thereof,</hi> In so
compendious and absolute order, as the Auditors were amazed;
the Arch-Bishop said he spake by Gods spirit.</p>
                     <p>Then was committed to consultation,</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. For excommunication; the Name or censure to be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</item>
                        <item>2. For the high Commission; the quality of the Persons to
be named, and the nature of the causes.</item>
                        <item>3. For Recusant Communicants; the weak to be informed,
the wilfull punished.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The 4th thing consulted was, for sending Preachers into
<hi>Ireland;</hi> He being (as he said) there but half a King, over their
Bodies, but their soules seduced by Popery, no Religion, no
Obedience; to send men of sincerity, Knowledge, and Courage.</p>
                     <p>The last was for maintenance for the Clergie.</p>
                     <p>Then Master <hi>Chadderton</hi> requested,<note place="margin">Opponent.</note> that the surpliss and
Cross in Baptism, might not be urged upon godly Ministers
in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> lest they revolt to Popery, instancing the Vicar
of <hi>Ratesdale,</hi> a Man that doled the Communion bread at the
Sacrament, out of a Basket, every man putting in his hand for
himself.<note place="margin">Answerr</note> That letters should be writ to the Bishop there, but if
they were turbulent spirits, they should be inforced to confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and a time limitted.</p>
                     <p>Master <hi>Knewstubs</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Opponent.</note> desired the same favour for the Godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in <hi>Suffolk</hi> not to be forced against their Credits to the
surpliss and Cross. Sir, said the King, have we taken pains, and
concluded of an unity and conformity,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and you forsooth must
preferr the credits of a few private men, before the publick
peace of the Church. The <hi>Scots</hi> Argument; because they had
been long of a contrary opinion.</p>

                        <pb n="306" facs="tcp:60657:173"/>
Somewhat was said against their <hi>Ambuling Communions,</hi> and
Master <hi>Chaterton</hi>'s sitting Communion in <hi>Emmanuel</hi> College<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
finally, they all promised conformity and obedience, and so
parted that Meeting.</p>
                     <p>Chancellour <hi>Egerton,</hi> a wise and learned Counsellour, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at the Kings ready Disputes, expert and perfect in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
said, That he had read, that <hi>Rex est mixta persona cum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdote,</hi>
and now he sees the truth thereof in him.</p>
                     <p>A marvel to some, (in these our last times) why no more able
men to be found for them but four. I shall answer with a truth,
and no marvel, That some years after, when the Roles were
examined, that were deposed, they were found to be but nine
and fourty in all <hi>England;</hi> when in <hi>Scotland</hi> they were reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above nine thousand; so great a stir could so few make here:
or else they subscribed to keep their Livings; and no wonder;
they were ever loth to lose all, and many of them knew how to
turn.</p>
                     <p>And orderly afterwards the King put forth two Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the one,<note place="margin">Proclamation for Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
                        <hi>To satisfie his Subjects for Unifomity in Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the established Laws.</hi> And Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> and others
sent in Apostolical Embassie into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to settle the Church
and spirits of the Clergy there, as he had done here, that every
spirit led onely with piety, and not humour, might be therein
satisfied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The other Proclamation against</hi> Iesuits <hi>expresseth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Against Jesuits.</note> That a
greater contagion to our Religion was eminent by sundry persons
common Enemies to them both, namely, numbers of Priests, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
Iesuits, abounding here, of such as were before and since our
coming, and with greater liberty than they durst have done; upon
confidence of innovation in Religion, and general Pardon at our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
do exercise their Professions, and saying Mass, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to seduce the Subjects from their duty to us, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them to <hi>Rome.</hi> To prevent infection with Superstition, pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the soul, and corrupt against Alleageance, is to debar the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
such Instruments of infection; and they are Priests of all sorts,
ordained in forein parts, prohibited here by the Authority of the Laws
of this Land. And therefore against such, they shall before the 19th.
of <hi>March</hi> next depart out of this Realm and the Kings Dominions,
and not to return hereafter upon penalty of the Laws in force to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
without any favour. The Reasons and excuses for this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
severity toward that sort of Subjects is enforced from the peril of
his Person by late conspiracy of confusion, conceived by persons of
that sort onely. And this may satisfie forein Princes, proceeds from
providence, to prevent perils otherwise inevitable; considering their
submission to forein Iurisdiction, seems to dispence at pleasure, with
the power of their own Sovereign, or strictest bond of loyalty and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60657:173"/>
love, between a King and his People. And though it is civilly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
personal respects to the now Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (in state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a secular Prince) yet observing the course and clame of that
See, no Prince of our Religion and Profession can be assured of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
unless by assent of other Christian Princes to a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
free and lawfull, to pluck up those Roots of dangers and jealousies
arising about Religion, as well between Prince and Prince, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and their Subjects; and also to manifest that no State or
Potentate either hath or can challenge power to dispose of earthly
Kingdoms or Monarchies, or to dispence with Subjects obedience to
their natural Sovereigns; in which charitable action no Prince shall
more readily concur his power, not onely out of particular disposition
to peace with all States, but by such union, an amity might be settled
to resist the common Enemy.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>To answer them it was said, That all ancient Translatours did
review their former Works, and so got credit even with the
<hi>Iews,</hi> as accurately done. So did <hi>Origen,</hi> joyned with the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Original, and the <hi>Seventyes</hi> Translation. And Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
exhorted Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> to a <hi>Palinodia</hi> or Recantation. I am sure
the Papists have least cause of offence from us: How oft have

If fame hath nor over-spoken our Hierarchy of his time,
there were not other soils that yielded either so frequent flocks,
or better fed, and went not on more happily in those high steps
of true blessedness, to save themselves and others in the main
helps of tender Pastures and still waters; by the one I mean an
inuring of the people to the principles of Orthodox Doctrines,
by the other an immunity from factions, and disturbance of the
publick peace of the Church.</p>
                     <p>It was the Kings observation, <hi>That partly the miscarriage of
our People into Popery and other Errours, was their ungroundedness
in the points of the Catechism.</hi> How should such souls be other,
than <hi>turned about with every winde of Doctrine,</hi> that are not well
ballasted with solid informations? From whence it was that the
King gave publick order for bestowing the later part of the
Religious Day in familiar Catechizing.</p>
                     <p>It was the ignorance and evil disposedness of our Cavillers
that taxed this course,<note place="margin">Catechizing commended.</note> as prejudicial to Preaching; yet in truth,
the most usefull is Catechetical; this lays the Grounds, the
other the Walls and Roof; this informs the judgment, that
stirs up the affection; What use is there of those affections that
run before the judgment? or of those Walls that want Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation?
And when that was in use, I have heard it confessed by
some, that have spent the greater half of their aged life in the
station of Gods holy service, they repent nothing so much, as not
bestowing more hours in this Exercise of Catechism, and
might justly quarrel their very Sermons, and wish the greater
part of them had been thus exchanged for this speaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
Those other divine discourses enrich the brain, and the
tongue at best; this settles the heart; these but the descant to
the plain song. And if herein Ministers be too much curious to
satisfie the roving appetite of the tickling ears of curious Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
their favour will be no better than injurious. So may you
observe an indiscreet School-master, whilest he affects the
thanks of an over-weening Parent, mar the progress of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
childe, by raising him to an higher Form and Authour, ere
he have well learned his first Rules. Heat of zeal to hear, is as
natural heat to the body; there is no life of Religion without
it; but as the kindest heat, if it be not tempered with a due
equality, wasts it self and the body too, so doth zeal, not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with discretion. It is hard to be too vehement in contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for main and evident truths, but litigious and immaterial ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
may soon be over-striven, for needless seeking a scruple of
truth, to spend a pound of peace.</p>
                     <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whose motherhood we had just
cause to pride our selves, hath in much wisdom and piety deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
her judgment of all necessary points in so compleat a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60657:175"/>
of Divinity, as all hearts might rest therein, not their truths
onely, but their sufficiencies; the voice of God in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the voice of the Church in her Articles.</p>
                     <p>As for her Rules, Forms and Dress, in Discipline, let it
be examined whether the <hi>Luminaria magna,</hi> the Bishops were
so severe, as to introduce antiquated Orders, or to impose
novel Ceremonies, rather did they institute and discontinue
some, though of use, yet superfluous, offensive to weak ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
whose judgments could not concoct such fulsom mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though palliated heretofore under lively names of Order and
Decency.</p>
                     <p>And yet see what Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi> said then, prophetically

                     <p>The King thus far setled with his Parliament and people,
not without wonder of all our Neighbour Nations,<note place="margin">Ambassadours for Peace.</note> having
lain at watch for conveniencie and honor, to piece with so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
a Prince, the advantages alike to either.</p>
                     <p>They came almost together, The Constable of <hi>Castile</hi> from

from <hi>France,</hi> to treat of Peace, <hi>Barnevelt</hi> from the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.
Solia</hi> was a gallant Man, an excellent Courtier as they are
all. His business needed no other policy of State, but to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the Kings peacable and happy Possession, for they had a
Leiger in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that came in with the King. But the other
two were Enemies, and were to treat for establishing a firm
Peace, which was granted,<note place="margin">Co: and ch: pa.</note> and do doubt they might make up
of their <hi>Masters bounty to be so soon dispatcht,</hi> for <hi>France</hi> mightily

equally ready, so their desires for Convoy hither, came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and had order accordingly. Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for the Narrow-Seas attended at <hi>Graveling</hi> for the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
And his Vice-Admiral of the Fleet Sir <hi>Ierom Turner</hi> at <hi>Calais</hi>

the <hi>Admirals</hi> ship, but being told that he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Commission for the Other; <hi>Monsieur</hi> in much disdain,
put himself in the <hi>French Passage-boat,</hi> and in a brave, bore his
flag on the Top. <hi>Mansel</hi> commands <hi>Turner</hi> to shoot a warning
and after to hit, who took in his flag; but complained at
Court, where his faction was powerfull: yet the Justice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

                     </p>
                     <p>The next apprehended was <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> who in some
seeming compunction and sorrow,<note place="margin">Th. Winter's Confession of the Plot, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and success.</note> wrote his voluntary Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>That in the first year of King <hi>Iames</hi> to this <hi>Crown,</hi> 1603. I
was sent for to come up to <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Iohn Wright</hi> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi>
(called <hi>Faux Hall</hi>) where he first informed me of this <hi>Pouder-Treason,</hi>
to blow up the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the nature of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
required sharp Remedy, and so we agreed; and my Design
was to go over to <hi>Bergen-op-Zome,</hi> to petition the <hi>Constable</hi> of
<hi>Castile,</hi> ready there to come over <hi>Ambassadour</hi> for his <hi>Catholick
Majesty,</hi> by whose means here the <hi>Catholicks</hi> might have favor;
and there I met <hi>Guido Fauks,</hi> and brings him over to <hi>Catesby</hi>
about <hi>Easter Term,</hi> and met also behinde <hi>St. Clements Strand,</hi>
with <hi>Piercy</hi> and <hi>Wright,</hi> where we take <hi>Oath</hi> of secrecy, hear
<hi>Mass,</hi> and receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> (and so sorth, as <hi>Fauks</hi> hath
confessed) onely we resolved to convey their <hi>Pouder</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
unto <hi>Catesby</hi>'s house at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and so to be brought over
by Boat when the <hi>Mine</hi> was ready, and received one <hi>Keys</hi> as a
trusty man, for our purpose.</p>

                        <pb n="326" facs="tcp:60657:183"/>
In the time of their <hi>Mining,</hi> they framed their <hi>Plot</hi> into some
fashion, what to do for the <hi>Duke</hi> as next Heir, the <hi>King</hi> and
Prince <hi>Henry</hi> blown up, <hi>Piercy</hi> undertakes with his Confederates
to seize the <hi>Duke</hi> at <hi>St. Iames,</hi> whilest most of his Servants
might be about <hi>Westminster,</hi> and with Horses ready at the <hi>Court-gate,</hi>
to horse him away into the Countrey, whilest most men
amazed at the <hi>Blow,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> might easily be mastered.</p>
                     <p>And for the Princess <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Countrey, some Friends
gathered together under colour of <hi>Hunting,</hi> near my Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>'s,
might seize her to <hi>Catesby</hi>'s house, which was not far
off, at <hi>Ashby,</hi> and he undertakes for that.</p>
                     <p>They provide for <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Horses,</hi> and to save as many <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Lords, as could be advised to forbear the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Next,
that forein Princes could not be enjoyned secrecy, nor oblig'd
by <hi>Oath,</hi> nor were they sure that such would approve their <hi>Plot;</hi> if
they did, yet to prepare so long before, might beget suspition:
the same <hi>Letter</hi> that carried the <hi>News</hi> of the <hi>Execution,</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
for <hi>assistance</hi> and <hi>aid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>Spain</hi> his motion (like a large Body) was too slow, in his
preparations in the first of Extremities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>France</hi> too near and dangerous, who with <hi>Holland</hi> shipping,
they feared most.</p>
                     <p>And because the charge of the <hi>work</hi> hitherto, lay hard upon
<hi>Catesby,</hi> they called in Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> who frankly lent
fifteen hundred pounds to the <hi>business,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Tresham</hi>
two thousand pounds, and <hi>Piercy</hi> promised all the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>'s
Rents, which he would seize, near forty thousand
pounds, and ten Horses.</p>
                     <p>And because they were informed that the <hi>Prince</hi> would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> they resolved of more company to
seize him, and to horse him away on the other side of the <hi>Thames,</hi>
and let the <hi>Duke</hi> alone.</p>
                     <p>Two days after this discourse, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> comes news to
<hi>Thomas Winter</hi> of a <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Mounteagle</hi> to advise him to absent
from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which <hi>Letter</hi> was carried to the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury;
Winter</hi> tells this to <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Tresham,</hi> whom they
suspected: but all forswear the <hi>Letter,</hi> and resolve to see the issue,
which they feared would fail of their purpose; but on <hi>Munday,
Catesby</hi> resolves to go to <hi>Ashby,</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi> to follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tuesday</hi> early comes the younger <hi>Wright,</hi> and tells <hi>Winter,</hi> that
he is going to call up the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> at <hi>Essex</hi> house,
where they both finde one <hi>Lepton</hi> got on hors-back at <hi>Essex</hi>
gate, which was conceived to seek out <hi>Piercy;</hi> but <hi>Winter</hi> going
to <hi>White-hall,</hi> findes the Gates shut, and the way to <hi>Westminster</hi>
guarded; and being told that a <hi>Treason</hi> was discovered to blow
up the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he hasts to his Horse and gallops down to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60657:183"/>
                        <hi>Catesby</hi> to <hi>Dunschurch,</hi> the place of Rendezvouz. On <hi>Thursday</hi>
they meet there, seize Arms at the Lord <hi>Windsors,</hi> and that
night to Master <hi>Stephen Littleton</hi>'s house, one of their number;
when news came that <hi>Catesby</hi> was burnt by accident of drying
their <hi>Pouder, Littleton</hi> advises <hi>Winter</hi> to fly, he would not, till he
might see his Friends, <hi>Catesby</hi>'s body, and bury it; but finding
him reasonable well, with <hi>Piercy, Wright, Rockwood,</hi> and <hi>Grant,</hi>
they all resolved to keep together, to fight and die; when the
Countrey came in, both the <hi>Wrights</hi> killed, <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi>
with one Bullet, and <hi>Winter</hi> wounded and taken.</p>
                     <p>This was his <hi>Confession</hi> and true, but the whole story was thus
interwoven.</p>

morning the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and the first day of <hi>Parliament;
Winter</hi> and the two brothers <hi>Wrights</hi> hasten out of Town;
for <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi> were gone the morning before, and all of
them towards their Rendezvouz in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> towards <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventre;</hi>
where the very next day (about the hour that <hi>Fauks</hi>
was taken at <hi>Westminster) Iohn Grant</hi> with others his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(all <hi>Papists</hi>) broke open <hi>Benock</hi>'s Stable, (a <hi>Rider</hi> of great
Horses in that County) and carried away all, being eight of
them; and so both this company, as also those which fled out
of <hi>London,</hi> met at <hi>Dunchurch,</hi> Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi>'s house, on
<hi>Tuesday</hi> night, having appointed a Match of Hunting the next
morning, according to their former plotting.</p>
                     <p>But finding their treachery prevented, and not prevailing by
a private villany, they now resolve to practise publick <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
to make up their wickedness any way. And first, grounded
their cause, <hi>Religion;</hi> with some provisions of <hi>Ammunition,
Army, Pouder,</hi> and <hi>Horses,</hi> they roved up and down to gather
company; by whose example it was possible, some other such
like in other Counties might joyn Forces considerable to raise a
<hi>Rebellion:</hi> of themselves, never in number above eighty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-men
and Hors-boys, who were watcht hourly for fear of
quitting their Masters quarrel; and so wandring through these
Counties of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> were by the Sheriff of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
taken, killed, or disperst about <hi>Habbuch, Stephen Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
house.</p>
                     <p>Strange were the Accidents which brought the Countrey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; for as yet, the Kings <hi>Proclamations</hi> had not reacht
thither, nor was their <hi>Treason</hi> discovered to them. But the <hi>Riot</hi>
of <hi>Grant</hi> forcing the House for the Horses, was an insolency pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
with <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> among the Commons, that the Countrey
rise to know the reason. Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil</hi> the elder, was then
<hi>Lieutenant</hi> of <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> whose wisdom soon apprehended
the danger to be the <hi>Indices</hi> of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> instantly seizes <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition</hi>

and <hi>Arms</hi> of all; about him either absent from home,
or doubtfull, and with such further directions, that a poor <hi>Smith</hi>
got hold on <hi>Winter,</hi> who was rescued by his company, and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
taken by the <hi>Towns-men,</hi> and by the Sheriff Sir <hi>Richard
Verney</hi> sent Prisoners to <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Richard Walsh</hi> of <hi>Worcestershire</hi> pursues them to <hi>Littleton</hi>'s
house, as aforesaid, and there makes a stand, sends a <hi>Trumpet</hi> to
command obedience to him, as his <hi>Majesties</hi> Minister and <hi>Sheriff,</hi>
and not knowing more of their <hi>Treason,</hi> than was visible by the
Tumult, promises to intercede with the <hi>King,</hi> to spare their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Death. They as best witnesses to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences

                     <p>And accordingly sundry both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Laiks</hi> did freely
take the same,<note place="margin">Taken by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> when suddenly comes over a <hi>Breve</hi> from <hi>Pope

October</hi> 1606.<note place="margin">The Popes Bull against the Oath.</note> And the next year another <hi>Breve</hi> confirming
this, <hi>September</hi> 1607. And accompanied with a Letter of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> unto <hi>George Blackwell</hi> the <hi>Arch-Priest</hi> of the
<hi>English,</hi> being then in some bonds, whom therefore the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
suspected, would take the same as he did.</p>
                     <p>To all these the King most learnedly gives answer,<note place="margin">The Kings Apologie and Preface to take the oath.</note> and in
six days compiles and publishes in print, an Apologie for that
<hi>Oath,</hi> and in a week sets out a <hi>Monitory Preface, to that Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
and solemnly presents it by Ambassy to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and
to every <hi>King</hi> and <hi>State</hi> in <hi>Christendom,</hi> as a peculiar concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all, and each of them in the due temporal <hi>Obedience</hi>
of their <hi>Subjects.</hi> And herein the King instances Examples of

of <hi>Popes,</hi> ordaining their <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Dignities,</hi> and of all <hi>Bishops,</hi>
with <hi>Anathema,</hi> against all such as disobeyed their Sentence, as
also deposing of <hi>Popes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> maintained that doctrine in their
writings,<note place="margin">Justified by forein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and put it in Execution. The <hi>Sorbons</hi> did the like in
<hi>France.</hi> And those writers of their own that opposed it, were
so over-lashed, as that they were corrected and castigated by
Men of their Religion, <hi>Becanus</hi> his book corrected by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
of <hi>Rome; Bellarmines</hi> book burnt at <hi>Paris: Suares</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
burnt also in <hi>France.</hi> Certainly, by this his Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
Kings and Princes had a more perfect discovery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the injury offered to them by the Pope in the points of
their temporal power, and it followed to be throughly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Christendom</hi> by this occasion of the King.</p>
                     <p>This the King did for the present. But there was a swarm of
busie-heads, that measured the mysteries of State, by the rule
of their own conceited wisdomes, gave Arguments to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the Popish practises by <hi>Executing all their Priests.</hi> The
reasons may be gleaned out of their rash opinions.</p>
                     <p>That a dead Man bites not, that mercies offered for a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Malefactor, do but enlarge his adventures against King
and Countrey. That a hard hand suddainly remitted, is seldom
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:60657:185"/>
by the rude people interpreted to the best sence. No hope of
reformation, where there's no confession of the fault; and to
banish them, may be supposed a meer shift to rid the Prisons
of those, whom Conscience could not condemn of Crime:
whilst Justice seems to sleep, the time serves to raise factions;
for fearfull Spirits by sufferance grow insolent and cruel.</p>
                     <p>And to the Exceptions of their small Number it was argued,
that Union in a prepared conspiracie, prevailes more than Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>If that the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacie</hi> heretofore, choked not their
presumptuous imagination, nor now can the temporal power
of the King contained in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Alleageance</hi> preserve us,
or deter them. A Popish Priest his Character is a <hi>disloyal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado.</hi>
Delinquents in lesser degrees, may challenge easier
punishments, and so be incouraged. The penalty to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on them, they scandall, by pretending the conversion from
the Kings Exchequer to Our private purse. That being restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
will prove like <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardner</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

                     <p>To answer them it was urged.<note place="margin">Their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refuted.</note> That although death be the
end of Temporal misery, it is not the grave of memory:
Justice may execute the person; but his opinion made publick,
it is not subject to the sword: where poyson is diffused, through
the veins of good and bad blood, Evacuation is better than
Incision. Clemencie is divine, and works supernaturall effects,
though they merit by suffering: and though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; <hi>Parsons,</hi>
provoke them to thrust their finger into the fire, by refusing
the Oath of Alleageance; yet the wisest of them, had rather
see others act, then themselves feel the smart.</p>

would gladly have survived that <hi>Glory,</hi> if any such hopes had
remained. The <hi>English</hi> exceed the <hi>Romans</hi> in zeal of Papistry,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60657:186"/>
and are naturally better fortifyed to indure death; If so that terror
prevails not, Religion and Conscience less. <hi>Visne muliebre Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium,</hi>

assures more to their Sect, then ever their words could perswade:

not stir out of <hi>Rome, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Flanders</hi> (their several Nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
without his privity; and so forewarn'd, they may be catcht
at our ports, and removed to prisons: and if they escape there
and go disguised, yet they may be disclosed by many, if the
punishment were not death, but only immuring in dead walls.</p>
                     <p>The penalty of Recusants in a stock, would pay the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>

                     <p>And why not thus. Let Preachers use the spirit against them, not
as usual to wast an houre-glass, to skirmish against government
and discipline. How can we draw others to our Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>It was the Kings saying and distinction.</p>
                     <p>A great cause of continuance of <hi>Papistry</hi> in common people
is, That being fuller of <hi>Pagentry</hi> than <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the old
sent of <hi>Roman</hi> perfume; The common obedience of coming to
Church, more expected, than the instruction of private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
or by publick Catechising; The first Elements are to be
learn'd at home, and were orderly contained in the Book of
<hi>Common-prayer,</hi> by instruction first, and then Confirmation
of the Bishops. This excellent foundation laid by the fathers
of the Church, should not be despised by their children. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times Ministers haunted the Houses of worthyest men;
Countrey-Churches with the best of the Shire; Prayer, and
preaching hand in hand together: then Papists smelled ranck;
therefore for shame, they resorted to our Churches and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</p>

that Counsellours for Kings stand for thousands or hundreds, as
he pleases to place them. Their greatness growing from humble

they borrow his name as the <hi>Boutefeu</hi> to make him the Mark of
their malice; yet such as judg, the spirit of the <hi>Pasquil</hi> will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagine, but that this Faction follows, onely the body of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

of those, which ground their faith upon weak principles,

credit, but carrieth still the <hi>Iethro</hi> of order in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,

                     <p>And freely professes, though he doth not participate with the

of his Masters favour, as to be not so much his creature by
the undeserved Honours he holds from his Majesties grace and
power, as in desire to be the shadow of his minde: towards whose
royal Person, he glories more to be honest and humble, than to
command in any other Calling.</p>
                     <p>And to say, <hi>that men resolved to die are Masters over others lives,</hi>
such power hath the least Spider by permission; and if so, that
the days of his life were in their hands, to take from him some
moneths of joys; so, more years of sorrow: but he believes
not, that the Mountains shake when the Moles do cast, nor
thinks he, to purchace a span of time, as for the fear of any
mortal power, <hi>Aut Deo, aut Patriae, aut Patri Patriae deesse.</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates

therefore, <hi>Suadeat loquent is vita, non oratio.</hi> Besides, <hi>Romes</hi> powers
are discovered, her Towers taken, and it is suspected, that she will
play so long with the temporal powers of Kings, as their work
will break down her walls; so therefore it ill becomes their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

shall come upon them naturally, one after another; their faith
shall ascend before them, and their good fame shall follow after.

and concludes with Reasons undeniable, for unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
consent to admit of the <hi>Union.</hi> But to avoid their tedious
Disputes; I shall onely abbreviate the <hi>Kings</hi> Speech, in answer
to all.</p>
                     <p>He distinguishes his desires;<note place="margin">The Kings Speech in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to their Arguments.</note> the <hi>Union</hi> which he seeks is of
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> such a <hi>Naturalizing,</hi> as may compound
one <hi>Body</hi> of both <hi>Nations, Unus Rex, unus Grex, &amp; una Lex.</hi>
He unravels their intricate Arguments, and sweetens them with
his intentions.</p>
                     <p>1. That all hostile <hi>Laws</hi> should cease, because the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> cannot war with the King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That community of Commerce is necessary, He being no
stranger, but descended of their ancient <hi>Kings;</hi> It were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for him, to be their natural <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and the <hi>Nations</hi> stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to one another, and being both under the same <hi>Alleageance,</hi>
ought to have more freedom, and better respect, than <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
and <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. They all agree, that they are no <hi>Aliens,</hi> then must they be
allowed to be natural. That there was a difference, the <hi>Ante</hi> and
<hi>Post-nati</hi> of either <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and therefore his <hi>Proclamations</hi>
gave notice that the <hi>Post-nati</hi> were <hi>naturalized,</hi> by his accession;
but he confessed, that <hi>Iudges</hi> may err in that opinion, who told
him so; so may <hi>Lawyers</hi> on their side, but bids them beware of
abusing either, lest they endeavour to disgrace <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi>
who have power when <hi>Parliaments</hi> are not, to try them for
<hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. That there were some flatterers, and would prefer the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te-nati</hi>
upon a jearing pretence, <hi>to have their merit preferred in his
service. Mel in ore, fel in corde.</hi> But they shall know, his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60657:189"/>
can prefer at his own pleasure, to any <hi>Dignity,</hi> though he
is willing to restrain himself, for respects to the <hi>English.</hi> He ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it as a special mark of Prerogative, to endow <hi>Aliens</hi> with
freedom; and where the <hi>Law</hi> is not therein clear, <hi>Rex est Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi>
he being <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> supplying the <hi>Law</hi> where it wants;
thus he speaks as skilfull in the dues of Sovereignty, intends
not the pressure upon their love, but with conveniency to both
<hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The inconveniences as from <hi>Scotland,</hi> are pretended to be;
<list>
                           <item>1. An evil affection in them to the <hi>Union.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. The <hi>Union</hi> to be incompatible.</item>
                           <item>3. The gain small or none.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why then is there talk of Union?</p>
                     <p>They allege Reasons of the first, from the body of their <hi>Act,
To remain a free Monarchy, and not alter Fundamental Laws:</hi> and
yet it was urged heretofore, <hi>The</hi> Scots <hi>greedy of this Union, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the substance and end.</hi> These are contradictions; but for
their free <hi>Monarchy,</hi> he hopes they mean not that he should set
<hi>Garisons</hi> over them, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do, over <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples;</hi>
He need not do so, who governs them by his <hi>Pen</hi> and his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>-commands;
and his <hi>Chancellour</hi> there can govern their
Tongues too, not to speak as ye do, what and as long as ye list,
without contradiction?</p>
                     <p>1. He tells them the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> those of <hi>Tenures,
Wards, Liveries, Signiories,</hi> and <hi>Lands,</hi> are in effect drawn out of
the <hi>Chancery</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> brought by <hi>Iames</hi> the first, (who lived
here) and differ onely in terms.</p>
                     <p>2. The second, are <hi>Statute-laws,</hi> to which he wishes, they
would be no strangers.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Civil Law,</hi> brought out of <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth,
to supply the defects of the <hi>Municipal Laws.</hi> In these respects
the <hi>Laws</hi> alike, why not the People?</p>
                     <p>First, it is an Objection of yours, that the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>
hath not a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> in <hi>Parliament;</hi> he tells them, that the
Form of <hi>Parliaments</hi> there, inclines nothing to popularity:
their manner is, by <hi>Proclamation,</hi> to bring in their <hi>Bills</hi> to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> by a prefixt day; then to the <hi>King,</hi> to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, and then given to the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> to be propounded,
and no other. If any man offers otherwise, the <hi>Chancellour</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
him, and being past the <hi>King</hi> confirms them, rasing out
what he doth not approve, and if this be a <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> he
hath one.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that which seems so incompatible, is the <hi>Union</hi> of
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> He assures them, it was a <hi>League</hi> onely,
between the <hi>Kings,</hi> not the <hi>People;</hi> the occasion was, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>France</hi> at one time solicited a <hi>League offensive</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive</hi>
                        <pb n="340" facs="tcp:60657:190"/>
against each others <hi>Enemies.</hi> The reasons went for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> of one <hi>Continent</hi> strong and <hi>Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Nation,</hi> and so more security the <hi>Amity</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> than
<hi>France,</hi> far off beyond Seas, and hazarded to Accidents of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                     <p>Then, they who argued for <hi>France,</hi> alleaged that <hi>England</hi>
ever sought to conquer <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore never can be
<hi>Friends.</hi> The remoteness of <hi>France</hi> claimes no <hi>Interest,</hi> and
therefore more <hi>Constant</hi> and <hi>Faithfull,</hi> and so it was concluded
on their part. But then it was concluded meerly <hi>Personall</hi> from
<hi>King</hi> to <hi>King,</hi> and to be renewed by their <hi>Ambassies;</hi> And so
it was in his Mothers time, and without consent of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
else it would seem a <hi>League</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> And in his time when
it came to be <hi>Ratifyed,</hi> least it should appear <hi>In odium Tertii,</hi> it
was by <hi>Him</hi> left out, in respect of his <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. Who is so ignorant as can not see the profit and commodity
to <hi>England</hi> by this <hi>Union,</hi> is there not <hi>Gain</hi> by <hi>Wales,</hi> is not <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
greater? <hi>Lands, Seas</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> added to <hi>Greatness;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Two</hi> made <hi>One,</hi> makes them <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Stronger.</hi> He
desires <hi>Union</hi> for the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and for their security,
to condescend to reasonable <hi>Restrictions,</hi> And he will never say,
what he will not promise, nor promise what he will not swear,
nor swear what he will not perform.<note place="margin">Post-nati con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</note> And so dismisses them.</p>
                     <p>But, although the <hi>Parliament</hi> could not be drawn to it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
yet not long after, it wrought upon the Judges of this
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> that the chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi> confirmed the <hi>Post-Nati</hi>
in <hi>Calvins</hi> Case and <hi>Title;</hi> And adjudged for him also, by that
reverend States-man <hi>Chancelor Elsmere,</hi> and all the <hi>Iudges</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber,</hi> whose opinions do much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

                     <p>And yet all that this <hi>Session</hi> could be drawn to do, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Hostility</hi> between both Nations, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the fourth of <hi>Henry 5.</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
and from <hi>1 Iames 1.</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Some excellent <hi>Acts</hi> were
concluded this Session, which I refer to the statutes in print.</p>
                     <p>But because the Judges in that time are complained of,<note place="margin">Judg Nichols his true ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> as
too partiall for the Kings commands; Let me aeternize the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Judge <hi>Nichols</hi> of the common pleas. His Predecessor in
his Circuite <hi>Assize</hi> for the County of <hi>Northampton</hi> had reprieved
a <hi>Felon,</hi> indicted before him, and found guilty by the Jury and
condemned, but reprieved by him upon some observation of the
weakness of the <hi>Evidence.</hi> This <hi>Iudge</hi> dying, <hi>Nichols</hi> appointed
for that Circuite, continues the Prisoners reprieve. And the
complaint came to the King, who urgeth the Judg by letters
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60657:190"/>
for <hi>Execution,</hi> which yet he refused. His just excuse was, <hi>That
if his Predecessor who heard the Evidence, thought good in Iustice
to grant his reprieve, It became not his Conscience now, to condemn
him; seeing he never heard the Evidence at all. And that it was
part of his Oath,</hi> to do right, notwithstanding the Kings letters.

wise, learned, and just Judge, for though he might (perhaps)
<hi>have given just Iudgment, it could not be true Iustice.</hi>

of</hi> Vaison <hi>for obtaining the dignity of a Cardinal, that so he
might be better able to advance his affairs in the Court of</hi> Rome.</p>
                     <p>The King meeting with this passage in <hi>Bellarmines-Book,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
apprehended his Secretary somewhat Popish, to shuffle
such a Letter to the Pope, and the King signing it amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which he usually sent to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi>
The Secretary now come and soda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

written any Letter to the Pope, he answered, he had by his
Majesties Command. At which the King bending the brow of
Anger, the <hi>Secretary</hi> fell down and craved Mercy, Professing
that his meaning was by that Letter, to purchase the Popes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in advance of his Majesties title to <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the King remembred the challenge made by Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1599. unto the Secretary of such a letter, which said
he you then denied, and procured Sir <hi>Edward Drummond</hi> (who
was accused for carrying that Letter) to come into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
abjure the same. The Secretary in great perplexity, made his
excuse with his good meaning, and craved pardon of God and
the King, for his and <hi>Drummonds</hi> perjury. He was instantly
Committed to his Chamber, and so to the Council-Table, who
urged his <hi>Crime</hi> as the ground of all conspiracies since the Kings
coming into <hi>England,</hi> that of the powder Treason and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans

                     <p>But to our business in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In the next Assembly at

power of the Bishops. In which Assembly the Popish Lords
supplicate for absolution and to subscribe to the confession of

went about it too, but suddainly fell into such confused terror,
as offering violence upon his own person,, he was spared by
his intercession of tears and prayers, not to be forced against
the reluctancy of his Conscience, who in truth of all that sect,
shewed evermore much of tender minde, to endeavour satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to himself, and so received more civility from the Church
ever after. <hi>Angus</hi> was most averse and had leave to banish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

                     <p>There had been a good progress in <hi>Scotland</hi> for quieting the

the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glascow,</hi> with the Bishops of <hi>Brigen</hi> and

                     <p>Told them with what care and charge he had repossessed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
out of the hands of the Laity and other sacreligious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,<note place="margin">Scots Bishops consecrated in England,</note> and settled them upon reverend Men as he hoped worthy of
their places. But since he could not consecrate them Bishops, nor
they assume that honor to themselves, and that in <hi>Scotland</hi> there was
not a sufficient Number to enter charge by Consecration, he had
therefore called them into <hi>England;</hi> that being here consecrated
themselves, they might give ordination at home, <hi>and so the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
mouths stopped.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For they had maliciously and falsely reported, that the King
took upon him to create Bishops and bestow spiritual Offices,
which he never did, always acknowledging that Authority to
belong to Christ alone, and whom he had authorized with his
own power.</p>
                     <p>One thing admitted dispute The Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>

and so now this consecration might be taken as a voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection

performed it to them, and they ordained others at home,
And carried back Directions for a <hi>High Commission</hi> Court
also, for ordering of causes Ecclesiastical, which were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                     <p>From these good Men,<note place="margin">Council Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ordered.</note> The King fished out the behaviours
of his Council there; and therefore to settle them in terms of
honor and state at their Table, they were to convene twice a
week, and None to stay in the Room, but Counsellors, nor any
solicitations there. But being come instantly to take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
sitting, not standing, unless they pleaded for themselves,
and then to rise and stand at the end of the Table, <hi>(for they

                     <p>This great man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (at home) is there humbled before the Bishop of
<hi>Orkney,</hi> and is by him examined, (so soon is the Kings ordinance
obeyed.)</p>
                     <p>His Crimes grew up from his poverty (made so by his own
riot and prodigality) which now he seeks to repair by shifts of
Tyranny over the people, under his Command; and being by
the Bishop reported so to the Council, he was committed to
Prison, untill the pleasure of the King deals further, in Mercy
or Justice. But to exercise that Nation by degrees of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was afterwards released and returned home to better
behaviour, wherein he became for the future so faultie, that two
years after he was executed.</p>
                     <p>We have hinted heretofore the Kings business at home,<note place="margin">High com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission-Court.</note>
which in truth was his wisdom to wade through. To suppress
the trayterous designes of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and to settle the fiery
dispositions of the <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> for the first, their own vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
progression in their late <hi>Pouder-plot,</hi> drew upon them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
lawes of chastisement. But these <hi>Other,</hi> (alas) their Motion
now not so violent, yet perpetual, &amp; the more warily to be dealt
with. And because no disputes, Arguments nor Policies could
reduce them, therefore the spiritual <hi>High-Commission-Court</hi> took
some course, moderately to regulate their Insolencies.</p>
                     <p>Busie this Parliament had been in disputes, of the <hi>Common</hi>
and <hi>Civil Laws;</hi> The first strained to such a necessitary power,
as in short event, would mightily qualifie the other to nothing.
Besides, this Session sate long and supplyed not the Kings wants,
wasting time (as ever sithence) in seeking <hi>Grievances.</hi>

                     <p>The principal things (says he) agitated in this <hi>Parliament</hi>
were three. First,<note place="margin">The Kings Speech to both Houses:</note> Your support to me. Secondly, My relief
to you. But the third, How I would govern, as to former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
or by absolute power.</p>
                     <p>He begins with the last. That <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the supremest
thing upon Earth,<note place="margin">Of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> illustrated by three similitudes. First out
of <hi>Gods</hi> word, <hi>You are Gods.</hi> Secondly out of <hi>Philosophie, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
patriae.</hi> Thirdly out of Policie, the Head of this <hi>Microcosm</hi>
Man.</p>
                     <p>For the first, The attributes of God; <hi>Creation, Destruction,
Reparation,</hi> to judge and not be judged, and to have power of
<hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> so of Kings; and can make of Subjects as at
<hi>Chesse,</hi> a pawn to take a <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Knight,</hi> to cry up and down
their Subjects, as their coin; And as their Soul and Body to God,
so to the King, affections of the Soul, and service of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
And he justified the Bishops late Sermon of the Kings
power <hi>in Abstracto,</hi> to be true Divinity. But then as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
so to exhort them, how to help such a good King as now
they have, putting a difference between Power in Divinity,
and the setled state of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>For the second, fathers of families had <hi>Patriam potestatem,
vitae et Necis,</hi> for Kings had their original as heirs from them,
planted in Colonies through the world. And all laws allow
<hi>Parents,</hi> to dispose of children at pleasure.</p>
                     <p>For the last, The head judgeth of the Members, to cure or
cut off. But yet these powers are ordained <hi>ad correctionem, non
ad destructionem:</hi> and as God destroys not, but preserves na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so a father to his Children, a Head to his Members.</p>
                     <p>But then he distinguished the state of Kings in <hi>Original,</hi> and
of setled Monarchs. For as God in the old Testament spake by
Oracles, and wrought by Miracles, yet after the Church was
setled in Christ, and a cessation of both, he governed by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<hi>Will,</hi> his <hi>Words.</hi> So Kings beginning by <hi>Conquest</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi>
their <hi>Wills, Lawes,</hi> and being setled in a civill poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
set down their mindes by <hi>Statutes,</hi> and at the desire of the
people, the King grants them; and so he becomes <hi>Lex Loquens,</hi>
binding himself by a double Oath; <hi>Tacitly</hi> as King, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
by his Oath at Coronation, a <hi>Paction</hi> with his <hi>People,</hi> as

Law, and to which to press the <hi>King</hi> is misduty in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
knowing before hand he will refuse them. If not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
amend it by <hi>Parliament,</hi> but term it not a <hi>Grievance.</hi> To be
grieved at the <hi>Law,</hi> is to be grieved with the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Patron</hi> of
the <hi>Law;</hi> and he allows them to distinguish between a fault of
the <hi>Person</hi> and the <hi>Things.</hi> For Example.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>High Commission</hi> is complained of;<note place="margin">High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</note> Try the <hi>abuse</hi> and
spare not, but do not destroy the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Commission,</hi> that were
to abridg the <hi>Kings</hi> power. And plainly he resolves; seeing
that <hi>Court</hi> is of so high a nature, to restrain it onely to the two
<hi>Arch-Bishops;</hi> heretofore common to more. Nor shall any man
be to him more <hi>Puritan</hi> to complain, as well out as in <hi>Parliament,</hi>
of defects therein, onely, grieve ye not at the <hi>Commission</hi> it self.
He desires them, that their <hi>Grievances</hi> savour not of particular
mens thoughts, but rather rising out of the peoples mindes;
not of the humour of the Propounder; that mans passion will
easily discover him. <hi>Petitions</hi> also, though they be general, are so
to be distinguished.</p>
                     <p>The third general Cause concerns himself, which he always
leaves hindmost,<note place="margin">3. The cause of calling the Parliament.</note> (and had left it to his <hi>Treasurer)</hi> being distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
naturally less eloquent in his own concernment. That this
<hi>Officer</hi> had already accounted to them of the <hi>Kings Havings</hi> and
his <hi>Expendings,</hi> which he hopes they acknowledg as a favour, to
be particularly acquainted with his <hi>State.</hi> His <hi>Predecessor</hi> seldom
afforded the like.</p>
                     <p>Duty he clames of them; one of the branches being to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their <hi>Sovereign;</hi> but the quantity and time proceeds from
their loves; and therefore disputes not a Kings power, but
what, with their good wills; and wishes <hi>them,</hi> as <hi>he,</hi> to avoid
extremes; for if they fail in the one <hi>(Supply)</hi> or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Levy,</hi> both he and the Countrey shall have cause to blame
them.</p>
                     <p>And as the <hi>secular Nobility</hi> are hereditary <hi>Lords</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The quality how to give.</note>
and the <hi>Bishops</hi> live <hi>neuter, Barons</hi> of the same, and give but

more liberal: yet if too much, they abuse the <hi>King</hi> and hurt the
<hi>People;</hi> which he will never accept; their true love being the
greatest security to any wise or just <hi>Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So they need not the fear of that <hi>Item</hi> by one of their <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
In giving too much to endanger your Throats-cutting when ye
came home.</hi> He loves freedom of Gift with discretion. He never
laboured for their Voices to that end, detesting to hunt for
<hi>Emendicata suffragia.</hi> But then, as not to give him a <hi>Purse</hi> with a

alleging the <hi>Poverty</hi> of the <hi>People:</hi> To such persons, though he
will not be less just, yet not in reason to gratifie them when it
may come in their way, to want him.</p>
                     <p>He heard that it was propounded whether <hi>the Kings wants
ought to be relieved or not?</hi> Certainly, though it may seem his
particular, yet being <hi>Parens Patriae,</hi> and tells them his wants;
nay, <hi>Patria ipsa,</hi> by him speaks to them; for if the <hi>King</hi> wants,
the <hi>State</hi> wants; and therefore the strengthning of the <hi>King,</hi>

though of no fame in their merits, especially the last, <hi>of whom
(he says) [the King not finding sutable to his humour, his fancie
ran upon another young Gentleman]</hi> But the man is mistaken, for
though the King was no quareller, yet he hated a Coward, and

this favorite was urged to revenge, and backt by the <hi>English,</hi>
fourty to one to defend him: He basely put it up to his death,
and the dishonor of a Gentleman. What his after merits were
to his end, let the world judge; he living to full age, and having
had his opportunity and choice, to become an honest man.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the King was never without favorites, but changed
them often into one more close and intrinsick, who served the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Turner</hi> was the most of skill in that Profession, whom the
<hi>Baron</hi> challenges at three hits, and inforced upon him the first
of three, with over-much conceipt and clamour of his Scots

own Schoole too in the face of some Schollars; an affront to
all. The man sensible of his credit more than conscience, in
Malice to do mischief, opened his Body to the advantage of his
Adversary, who too neer pressing it home, <hi>Turner</hi> takes it on
his Brest, being sure thereby to pop <hi>Sanquire</hi> in the eye, so
deadly, that he dasht it out. The Baron guessed at this evil hap
by his own Intention, to have done worse himself. But by <hi>Turners</hi>
regret of this mischance, they parted, patience perforce.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Paris</hi> the King pittyed his loss, a great defect to a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
gallant, and asked him why the man dyed not that did it.
This <hi>Item</hi> the Divell so drove into his fancie, that hastily brings
him home again, where he hired two of his own kindred, <hi>Grey</hi>
and <hi>Carliel</hi> to kill him, which they did basely, by a brace of
Bullets in his own House <hi>White-Fryers,</hi> And all three got time
to fly. The one taken in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the other on Ship-board, and
the <hi>Barons</hi> head praysed at a thousand pounds; he fearing thereby
to be forced into Justice, thought it safer to throw himself into the
hands of Mercy, by presenting it; and so represented by the
Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he might appear an obiect of pitty. But
the wound was universall, and the blood-shed not to be wiped
off, but by his death ignoble as his Act, the Halter; equall guilt
had even punnishment, all the three Gallows.</p>
                     <p>Some difficulty there was, how to proceed with the <hi>Baron,</hi>
who first came in, for <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>Grey</hi> being Principals, and not
as yet convict, the Law could not proceed to the Tryall of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quair</hi>
being but Accessary. But then the other two flying, they
were out-lawed, and so attainted of felony, and then the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

most necessary to his story, which was thus:</p>
                     <p>There was, amongst other persons of <hi>Honour</hi> and quality in
<hi>Court,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">E. of Essex and his Countess, Car and Overbury their stories intermixt.</note> a young <hi>Lady</hi> of great birth and beauty, <hi>Frances</hi> the
Daughter of <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> married in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
unto the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> now become a forward stripling, she
two and twenty, and he three and twenty years; of him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fame had an opinion (grounded upon his own suspition)
of his insufficiency, to content a Wife.</p>
                     <p>And the effects of this Narration (with the sequel of his life
and conversation, with his second Wife) is so notorious, as
might spare me and the Reader our several labours, for any other
convincing arguments.</p>
                     <p>But with the first, when both were of years, to expect the
blessing of the Marriage-bed, he was always observed, to avoid
the company of <hi>Ladies,</hi> and so much to neglect his own, that to
wish a Maid into a mischief, was, to commend her to grumbling.
<hi>Essex,</hi> as they stiled him, and increased the jealousie of such men,
whose interests were to observe him, that he preferred the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
himself for a <hi>Separation;</hi> and which indeed from publick
fame, begat private disputation amongst <hi>Civilians</hi> of the <hi>legali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
thereof, wherein those <hi>Lawyers</hi> are boundless.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Case</hi> followed the heels of a former <hi>Divorce,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lady Rich divorced.</note> fresh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
between the Lord <hi>Rich</hi> and his fair <hi>Lady,</hi> by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
but because <hi>Mountjoy</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonshire</hi> married her,
whilest her Lord lived, the King was so much displeased, as it
broke the Earl's heart; for his Majesty told him, <hi>that he had
purchased a fair Wife with a foul Soul.</hi> But this of <hi>Essex</hi> was a
different Example, when you seek to parallel them together.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we may with more charity to truth, not admit
such hasty credit, as to believe, <hi>[that now the Kings delight was
onely for the love of the Viscount</hi> (who is supposed to be in love

                     <p>Upon this the Countess procures Process against the <hi>Earl,</hi> to

                     <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> appears before the Commissioners, by his <hi>Proctor,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses Libell against her husband.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>That the Earl and the Lady six years since in <hi>January, Anno

and now she is two and twenty, and he three and twenty years old.</p>
                     <p>That for three years since the Marriage, and he then eighteen years

alone, endeavouring to have carnal knowledg each of others body.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding the Earl neither did, nor could ever know her

carnally, he being before and since possessed with perpetual incurable

                     <p>That the Lady was and is apt and fit, without any defect, and is
yet a Virgin, and carnally unknown by any man.</p>
                     <p>That the Earl hath confessed oftentimes to persons of great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,

her, though he had often attempted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And therefore prayeth the Commissioners upon due proof hereof,
to proneunce for the invalidity and nullity of the Marriage.</p>
                     <p>The Earl by his Proctor denies the said Contents, <hi>Contestatio

                     </p>
                     <p>His Answer is required by Oath, by second Process,<note place="margin">Essex's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> where in

                     <p>The Earl <hi>viva voce</hi> confesseth the Marriage, and circumstance,
(as in the Libell) and were not absent above three Moneths, the one
from the other, in any of the said three years.</p>
                     <p>That for one whole year of the three, he did attempt divers times
carnally to know her; but the other two years he lay in bed with her
nightly, but found no motion to copulation with her.</p>
                     <p>That in the first year she shewed willingness and readiness therito.</p>
                     <p>That he did never carnally know, but did not finde any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in her self, but was not able to penetrate or enjoy her.</p>
                     <p>And believeth, that before and after the Marriage, he found in
himself ability to other women, and hath sometime felt motion that
way.</p>
                     <p>But being asked, whether he found in himself a perpetual and
incurable impediment towards her?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He answered,</hi> that in two or three years last he hath had no moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to her, and believes he never shall, nor that she is apt as other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
and that she is <hi>Virgo integra &amp; incorrupta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And confesseth,</hi> that he hath often before persons of credit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
thus much.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this his Oath, she produced sundry Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

                     <p>So then, that period of time limited by the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi>

                     <p>The next was, that notwithstanding she remained <hi>Virgo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra

the Council on both sides, (who had been present in all these

                     <p>In order, the Countess had an Oath administred to her, with

                     <p>That since the Earl was eighteen years old, for three years he
and she had lain in bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in her Libell.</p>

Thin,</hi> Mistris <hi>Katherine Fines,</hi> Mistris <hi>Dorothy Neal</hi> her
Kinswomen, being charged to speak without partiality, they did
all depose, that they believed the same was true.</p>
                     <p>1. And in particular, that <hi>post plenam pulvertatem utriusque,</hi>
they both endeavoured copulation.</p>
                     <p>2. That notwithstanding, ability on her part, <hi>per inspectatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
she remained a Virgin incorrupted.</p>
                     <p>3. That the Earl had judicially sworn, that he never had, nor
could, nor should ever know her carnally.</p>
                     <p>The Law being this, that <hi>impotentia coeundi in viro</hi> howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
whether by natural defect, or accidental means, whether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
towards all, or respective to his wife alone; if it precede

three years continuance, after the mans age of eighteen years,
there having been <hi>nil ad copulam,</hi> the Marriage not consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Law allowing the said proofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was abundantly
sufficient, to convince the said Earl of impotency.</p>

                     <p>And the Records extant, do mention the proceedings (you
see) modest, legal, parallel with any former of like kinde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Civil Laws are boundless; and this strict form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
had no room for corruption.</p>
                     <p>And the Commissioners that agreed to the Sentence were
four Bishops,<note place="margin">Signed by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient men.</note> 
                        <hi>Winchester, Lichfield</hi> and <hi>Coventrey, Rochester,</hi> and
<hi>Ely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Civilians were three Knights, <hi>Caesar, Parry,</hi> and <hi>Dunn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though thus sufficient, yet are they noted [<hi>for private
men for the purpose, and that Kings will never want such ministers
in corrupted times both in Church and State.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>The common people were offended with the Canons, and
wisht, that <hi>Essex</hi> might have as many Women to aspect him for
his sufficiency; That he might have justified himself upon
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:60657:215"/>
others, or have had Physicians (by art) to certifie his natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,

                     <p>Indeed the Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> took upon him the quarrel,<note place="margin">Arch-bishop Abbots Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Nullity.</note>
who (in truth) in the Civil Law was least able) his Doubts and
Queries were dispersed, and got some credit with the Clergy,
whilest the Civilians (with much civility, if not fear) of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
amongst them) forbore to give him answer, till the King
himself took the pains to pull him down.</p>
                     <p>The Bishops Arguments were six.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That all controversies concerning the Church are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the Scripture, and Marriage is there accounted sacred.</item>
                        <item>2. What Text doth warrant a Nullity after Marriage, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
maleficium versus hanc?</hi> The Scripture, indeed, makes Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Propter frigiditatem, Matth. 19. 12.</hi> Some born chaste, some
made Eunuchs, some made so by grace.</item>
                        <item>3, 4. What Councils or Fathers, or stories either <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
have ever mentioned <hi>Malesicium versus hanc,</hi> untill <hi>Hirca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Rhemensis Episcopus,</hi> four hundred years after <hi>Christ?</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5, 6. <hi>Essex</hi> is found defective, for whom we are bound to use
two Remedies, Eternal and Temporal.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the first, <hi>Non ejicietur, nisi per orationem &amp; jejunium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the second, <hi>Corporeal Medicines.</hi> But the Earl hath had
none of these.</p>
                     <p>The Answer.</p>
                     <p>To the first,<note place="margin">Answered.</note> It is a preposterous Puritan Argument without
some better distinction or explanation: for, the Orthodox, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
all controversies in points of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> Nullity
of Marriage cannot be one, and therefore the consequence
fails.</p>
                     <p>2. If the Scriptures want a Nullity, <hi>Propter frigiditatem,</hi> then
all the means which may make him <hi>frigidus versus hanc,</hi> must be
comprehended; for, why doth our Church condemn Marriage of
a man with his sisters daughter? or of two sisters, but <hi>ut paritate
rationis?</hi> for none of them are <hi>in terminis</hi> prohibited in Scripture,
and so all the other unlawfull matches, for ascending or descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in points of Consanguinity, <hi>quia par est ratio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like is in this case; for although <hi>Christ</hi> spake onely to
three sorts of Eunuchs, yet, <hi>Ratio est quia non potest esse copulatio
inter Eunuchum &amp; mulierem;</hi> and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
It is not <hi>Conjugium sine copulatione.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore <hi>a paritate rationis,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> did compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
under these three sorts, all inability, which doth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:60657:216"/>
tually hinder, <hi>copulationem versus hanc;</hi> whether natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental.
For what difference is there, between the cutting off
the hand, and being made impotent thereof? <hi>Amputatio &amp;
Mutilatio membri,</hi> being the same in <hi>Civil Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It being sufficient unto moderate Christians to believe out
of Gods word. That mariage is null, <hi>sine copulatione;</hi> and
those words, <hi>quos Deus conjunxit,</hi> are never found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where <hi>et erunt eis,</hi> doth not proceed, <hi>viz. And they two
shall be made one flesh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But however the impediment be, whether universal or <hi>versus
hanc,</hi> or <hi>born so,</hi> or by violence, or by disease, or ineptitude,
that is ever <hi>par ratio,</hi> he is <hi>Eunuch versus hanc &amp; omnes alias.</hi>
Seeing to him only she was married.</p>
                     <p>To the third and fourth; There may be something to this
purpose, or <hi>aliquid analogum,</hi> with a <hi>paritate rationis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides; it is an ill argument to say, that therefore it is
not lawfull, because Fathers nor Council, do not mention
it.</p>
                     <p>5. The same answer to the fifth; for till the four hundred
years after Christ (perhaps) that devillish trick was not discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and we know, <hi>ex malis moribus bonae leges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this, in dispute, is only a question of Order and Policy;
For the essential point of Matrimony, cannot be accomplished
<hi>sine copula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. The Devils have power over the flesh, and to exempt us
from the power of Witch-craft, was never maintained by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned man; and why not of Protestants, as well as of
Papists?</p>
                     <p>Remedies perhaps, have been used by themselves, but <hi>Non
interest Repub. nec Eccles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so to satisfie his conscience, this pains was taken with
the Arch-bishop, <hi>ut cum conversus fuerit, confirmet fratres suos.</hi>

                     <p>1. For the first, when Revenge is extorted out of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
hands into private men, presuming to give Laws to
themselves; It may grow from quarrels to banding, so to troo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
then to tumult and commotion, from private persons
to families and alliances, and so to national quarrel; and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the State to inflamations and convulsions, and herein Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of presumption are the greatest, and this to be done by
the <hi>aurorae filii</hi> sons of the morning, young men full of hope
and towardness.</p>
                     <p>2. The Causes no doubt, <hi>a false imagination of honour and
credit;</hi> bewitching <hi>Duels, Species falsa,</hi> against <hi>Religion, Law</hi>
and <hi>virtue.</hi> That men now adaies had lost the true Notion of
fortitude and valor; the one, <hi>Fortitude,</hi> distinguishing the grounds
of quarrels, whether they be just and worthy a mans life, being
to be sacrificed to honourable services, good causes and Noble
Adventures, Expence of blood is as the expence of money, not
to be profuse in either, upon vain occasion.</p>
                     <p>For the Remedies. Four things may be effectual for repressing
the depraved custome of Combates.</p>
                     <p>First, The State to abolish it: for then every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thinks himself thereby acquitted his reputation; when he
sees it an insult against Sovereign power. Like unto the Edict
of <hi>Charls</hi> the ninth of <hi>France</hi> against <hi>Duels,</hi> That the King
himself took upon him the honour of all, that were grieved or
interessed for not having performed the combate, when he shall
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60657:218"/>
see the rule of State dis-interest him of a vain and unnecessary
hazard.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This evil must not be cockered. The compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of quarrels is grown so punctual by private Noblemen and
Gentlemen, who is before hand, and wholly behind hand. It
countenances Duels, as if therein somewhat of right.</p>
                     <p>The most prudent, and best Remedy may be learned out of
the Kings Proclamation. The false conceated humour must be
punished in the same kind, <hi>In eo quis rectissime plectitur in quo
pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cat,</hi> such men to be banished the Kings presence and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Court for certain years, to be cast into that darkness,
not to behold his Sovereigns face.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, We see the Root of this offence is stubborn, for it
despiseth death the utmost of punishments, and therefore these
men to be executed by Law without all remission. The severity
of <hi>France</hi> had been more, where by a kind of Marshal Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by the King, the party surviving was instantly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
their wounds though bleeding, least a natural death should
prevent the example of Justice. Or, if not so to do, but with
greater lenity, yet of no less efficacy, which is to punish by
fines in <hi>Star Chamber</hi> the middle acts and proceedings, which
tend to the Duel.</p>
                     <p>3. Now for the Law of <hi>England.</hi> It is excepted against in
two points.</p>
                     <p>Not to difference between an infidious and foul murther, and
killing upon fair terms, as they term it.</p>
                     <p>The other, Not providing sufficient punishment for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely
of words, as thely, and the like.</p>
                     <p>These novelties are thus answered. The <hi>Law of God</hi> makes
no difference, but between <hi>Homicide voluntary</hi> and <hi>involuntary,</hi>
which we term <hi>Misadventure,</hi> and for which there were Cities
of Refuge.</p>
                     <p>Our Law hath a more subtil distinction. The <hi>Will inflamed,</hi>
and the <hi>Will advised; Man-slaughter</hi> in <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>Murther</hi> upon
<hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>cold blood.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> had restrained this privilege of
passion, but onely <hi>where the Husband took the Adulterer in the
manner.</hi> Yet <hi>Cain</hi> inticed his Brother into the Field and slew
him treacherously; but <hi>Lamech</hi> vaunted of his Murther, <hi>To kill
a young man, and if it were but in his hurt.</hi> So as the difference is

                        <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> had not this practice of <hi>Duells.</hi> It is said, <hi>fas

                     <p>
                        <hi>There was a</hi> Duel <hi>between two eminent persons of the</hi> Turks,
<hi>and one slain; the</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Bashaes <hi>reprehended the Other,</hi>
How durst you undertake to fight one with the other? are there
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:60657:218"/>
not Christians enow to kill? Did you not know, that whether of
you were slain, the loss would be the great Seigniours?</p>
                     <p>Tis true, we find <hi>Combates</hi> before an <hi>Army</hi> amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
which they called <hi>Pugna per provocationem;</hi> between
Generals themselves, or by their license to others.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>David</hi> asked leave when he fought with <hi>Goliah;</hi> And
<hi>Ioab</hi> when the Armies met, gave leave, <hi>Let the young Men play

                     </p>
                     <p>And of this kind was that famous example in the Warres of
<hi>Naples,</hi> between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> where <hi>Italians</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
                     <p>The second <hi>combate</hi> is a <hi>Iudicial</hi> Tryal of Right introduced
by the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and the <hi>Northern Nations,</hi> and more antient in

                     <p>The <hi>Civillians</hi> say, that an action of injury does not ly for

                     <p>That the Iury were either his Enemies or his Friends, if Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
they could not sit upon his Tryal; if Friends, they ought to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him at the Bar; That what he suffered was injurious, and not
Iustice; he had not offended, nor would crave Mercy. My Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<hi>(said he)</hi> was by command of my Superiour, and if I were

and I call, <hi>Saving of souls;</hi> I do decline the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and will do it still in matter of Religion, the most of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
maintain it; and if they be wise will continue in that
mind.</p>
                     <p>As for that Question, <hi>Whether the King being deposed by
the Pope, may be lawfully killed?</hi> Doctors of the Church hold
the Affirmative not improbably, and as it is not yet determined,
so if it should be concluded, I will dy in the defence. And (now)
to say, It were unlawful, I will not to save my life.</p>
                     <p>His insolent speech was shortned by the Jurors quick return,
who found him guilty, and had Sentence of Treason, and to
stop his rayling, was after Noon, the same day, hanged at

                     </p>
                     <p>He was a desperate second <hi>Ravilliack,</hi> and ready in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
doctrine of deposing and disthroning Kings, which he
urged the more (he said) as consonant to the Kirk Ministers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.
And that nothing troubled him but to be taken away
ere he had done that which all <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> should not
have prevented, and had it been performed, no torments would
have been by him refused.</p>
                     <p>So then we see the cause of his Execution. For the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,

                     <p>And all this Coast from <hi>Cape Florida</hi> of twenty Degrees to
five and forty, was first discovered by <hi>Iohn Cabot,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cabot.</note> with six sail of
ships, who had his <hi>Patent</hi> from <hi>Henry 7. Anno 1442.</hi> about the
time that <hi>Columbus</hi> discovered the middle part of <hi>America,</hi> for
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabel</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and is called the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first Colony from <hi>England</hi> was with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Virginia.</note>
assisted in company of Sir <hi>Ralph Lane,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Heriot,</hi> that
learned <hi>Mathematician, Anno 1584.</hi> who in honour of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> named it <hi>Virginia,</hi> leaving there sixteen men, which
were brought home by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> in his return from his
<hi>West-India</hi> Voyage a year after; and this part is contained from
<hi>Florida</hi> to the <hi>Chesiopech Bay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next Northward is a part of Land to which Sir <hi>Iohn Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
Lord Chief Justice sent,<note place="margin">New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> for Discovery and Trade, 1606.
but no success returned, and since it is called <hi>New England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Land adjoyning Northward was discovered by
Captain <hi>Gosnold,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Elizabeths Isles.</note> all that coast being studded with broken Lands,
and called by him <hi>Elizabeths Isles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then you come to <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> and to the discovery of Captain
<hi>Weymouth's</hi> Land, and large River, and so forward to other <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
sithence of the <hi>English,</hi> so far as <hi>Cape Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then to <hi>Nova Francia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nova Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</note> the Colonies of the <hi>French,</hi> which
Land in truth they have ingrossed, as being elbo-room for all, and
which ends at <hi>Cape Race;</hi> the Lands spreading from thence direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Northwards, and named <hi>New-found-land,</hi> untill you sail into
the <hi>Frozen Sea,</hi> where <hi>Davis, Basin,</hi> and <hi>Hudson,</hi> made large Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
many thousand miles.</p>
                     <p>But to our business, this year 1614. Captain <hi>Smith</hi> intended
for <hi>New England,</hi> with two ships, not to plant, but to take Whales
and other fish, and to trade for Furrs, and so returned.</p>
                     <p>And presently from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he went out again, with one ship,
and <hi>Michael Cooper</hi> with five from <hi>London,</hi> accompained with
four more from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> partly to <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>plant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed these people for Planters were suspected <hi>notorious
Schismaticks, Brownists, Anabaptists, Families of love,</hi> and the like,
under such notions, so together, and here and there strewed over
with a spice of Protestancy, but by the general name of <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
which term included good and bad in their distinct kindes,
truly and ingenuously distinguished into the <hi>Puritan Knave,</hi> and
the <hi>Knaves Puritan:</hi> but in truth, all of them (of the first rank
especially) Enemies to the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of our <hi>Protestant</hi> Profession
in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And away they would go, for elbo-room to model a new
Church-government, such as hereafter should happen; for God
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:60657:221"/>
knows, they were so diversly affected, that as yet they could
conclude of none, nor ever would agree to any.</p>
                     <p>It was not impossible also, but those Factions there might
breed into extremes, and become hereafter Nurseries for all
Non-conformants of Church or State, with some prejudice to
this Government at home.</p>
                     <p>And therefore then, there was a restraint for the present one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
untill by examination of some of their <hi>Principals</hi> remaining
behinde, a better account might be assured, concerning those
that are sent before, for whose good behaviour there, these were
responsible here, and so they had leave to go.</p>
                     <p>And in a word, at that time, and until these later days, most of
the violent pretenders for <hi>Plantations,</hi> either <hi>Governors</hi> or <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants,</hi>
here, in their several Courts, were a company of cunning
contrivers, who abused the honest <hi>Adventurers,</hi> and of long
time came loss to them in all their returns.</p>
                     <p>The Kings bounty had stretched beyond the liberty of his
Treasure,<note place="margin">Baronets cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</note> which he timely took up, and was free in rewarding
merit by Honour of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> upon such whose Estates were
not answerable in value to other <hi>Gentry,</hi> before whom they were
to take place of precedency.<note place="margin">Hist. gr. Br. p. 76.</note> And therefore it was designed
(twelve moneths since) by the late Treasurer <hi>Salisbury,</hi> to create
a degree of <hi>Knight Baronets,</hi> to precede all <hi>Knight Bachelors,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the earnest suit of themselves,<note place="margin">Court &amp; Ch. King James, pag. 12.</note> ninety persons in all of good
Birth and Estates; and each of them (except two and twenty)
were then <hi>Knight Batchelors:</hi> and this to my knowledg, for I
copied the List of them, before it was presented to <hi>Salisbury:</hi>
and as true, that his exception thereto was, that it would discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
the <hi>Gentry.</hi> To which themselves replied, that it would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
satisfie them, in advance of dignity before others, who now
come behinde those meaner men, whom indeed the King was

no other reward or money to spare, and therein not much
too blame, to oblige them that way; and <hi>Salisbury</hi> dying, it was
now established; the design having martial reference to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Arms, the Prerogative of every Sovereign, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Presidents</hi> of all <hi>Christian</hi> Princes and States <hi>Monarchical</hi>

must it now be a crime in this <hi>King,</hi> in the settlement of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi>
here, to take leave to advance the <hi>creation</hi> of one single
Order? A new erect distinct Title, with those Privileges to them

superiour or equal to them, no more to be made, but the full number of
two hundred, untill some of these dy, but the younger sons of Viscounts
and Barons (by Decree of the King and Council upon controversie)
were adjudged to take place before them, and that their heirs males at
one and twenty shall be knighted, and shall leave either in a Canton in
the Coat of Arms, or in a Scutchion at their Election, the Arms of
<hi>Ulster,</hi> Argent, <hi>a Hand</hi> Gules, their place in the Kings Armies to be
in the gross, near about the Kings Standard, for defence thereof.</p>
                     <p>Nor was this done but in the like example or noble way, for
each <hi>Baronet</hi> to maintain thirty Footmen for three years at eight
pence <hi>per diem</hi> each Souldier in service of the Kings Forces, for
the establishment of the Province of <hi>Ulster</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> not as yet
emptied of Rebells, which came unto one thousand nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and five pounds a piece. And it was their own humble suit
afterwards to compound the expence, at a certain value, and to
put the charge in general upon the King: and I know he lost
by the bargain, the Composition came but to ninety eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
five hundred and fifty pounds, and cost the King much more.</p>
                     <p>And for the honour of their degree and memory, it may
not be amiss to insert in order of precedency in their Roll,
threescore and eight of them being <hi>Knights</hi> already, and two
and twenty Esquires.</p>

                     <p>These Expences put the King to consider of the best means of
Recovery, so that several ways were proposed to make his
Disbursments answerable to his In-comes,<note place="margin">Propositions of Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of</note> and the way was;
the first work of Ordinary good Husbandry, and might well be
expected from a <hi>Paterfamilias,</hi> yet it would not for the present,
<hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> become this King, whose fame and honour
(as all other Sovereignties, so his in particular) stood more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reputation than profit; and therefore he (according to the
magnificence of Royalty,<note place="margin">Honoraries.</note> left that consideration, and he had
done reasonable well, if not too much, for satisfying his
Train.</p>
                     <p>His second way was, to consider of his great expence of
Houshold,<note place="margin">Houshold.</note> now enlarged into several Courts, <hi>King, Queen,
Prince,</hi> and <hi>Nursery;</hi> and these being lookt into, he was forced
(contrary to the royal and largest heart of any his Progenitors)
to come to <hi>Retrenchment;</hi> and truly in this, he was advised to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:60657:223"/>
use the means of mean people, and others subordinate, <hi>Ingram</hi>
and others.</p>
                     <p>And first he removed by <hi>Proclamation</hi> a number of useless
persons of his own <hi>Nation,</hi> that unnecessarily depended upon
the bounty of his Court, and returned them home again.</p>
                     <p>Then he proportioned to each Court their expence, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
rated for personal Diet and Dependance, Livery and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Charge and Salary.</p>
                     <p>And this was done without publick complaint of any pressure
upon the people (as hath been usual heretofore to Parliaments,
and by them redressed) but prudently considered, and so referred
to the Council-table.</p>
                     <p>In ancient time the Houshold was regulated by Book-order,
and continued so to <hi>Henry</hi> 8. when Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> (for more
honour to that <hi>Christmass</hi> King of immoderate expence) settled
it, and so remained a ground-work to this present time, being
now so corrupt, as that new ways were proposed, in effect to put
down Tables, and to allow <hi>Attendance-money,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> does;
or else by setting up the <hi>Hall</hi> again, to the best, first, and most
magnificent Order, that so being spent in publick to the Kings
honour, the secret waste of Chamber-diet, and purloining pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
for out at the Court back-doors, most of the meaner
houses at <hi>Westminster</hi> were maintained with food and firing, the
stealth of under-chamberers.</p>
                     <p>We all know what excess was usual in our ancient <hi>Retinue</hi> and
<hi>Servants</hi> with <hi>blue coats</hi> and <hi>badges,</hi> especially respecting the <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of <hi>St: George,</hi> who were now ordered to lessen their number,
and afterwards to fifty <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and no more, to each <hi>Knight</hi>
of that Order, heretofore an excessive number, to vie it out who
should bring most.</p>
                     <p>And to reform himself from the excess of his royal heart in
gifts and rewards,<note place="margin">The King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains his former boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> he published Orders and Articles in print, in

                     <p>But his free hand having stretcht his purse-strings, there was a

hath been, ever since the Statute of 20 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England</hi> together, and to send their Members
to sit in Our <hi>Parliament,</hi> where a motion being made in the
House of <hi>Commons</hi> for a <hi>Benevolence</hi> to be freely given to that
King, an honest Knight (for a <hi>Welch</hi> County) made answer.
Mr. <hi>Speaker, This word Benevolence is a pretty Word, but I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it not; Yet sure it is something His Highness should have:
If it be so, in Gods Name let him have it; the sooner the better; and
so may deserve thanks, else it will not.</hi>

Reason, and Religion</hi>] and <hi>Injustice and Impiety</hi> to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>And because his whole Reign was necessitous, and the want
of money for him to be liberal, was his disease; I think fit to
say somewhat here, in excuse to all the future ayms and ends
which he took to get money, which answers the third way of
Improvement.</p>
                     <p>There was much ado in Council to advance the <hi>Crown</hi> by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

the King made some Tryal; so be it examined from former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
whether or no, their bounties exceeded his Merits?
Some advised him to fall upon <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Resumption,</hi> of <hi>Lands,

it was wicked Counsel to work upon his Necessity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                     <p>Did he ever do, as others, <hi>Henry 3.</hi> to his Subjects, of

he found; might well distinguish him, and their less fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
calling from his Predecessor, and her often invitation, and
indeed discourage any Prince, that should next succeed her.</p>
                     <p>The Disposition and Spirit of the times considered were not
alike with him. Her people ingenuous, and un-inquisitive,
wrapped in innocence and humble obedience. But in his time,
their passions and disaffections had gotten loose Reins, the
snaffle in their teeth, contesting and capitulating; Reasons of
her actings were her own Will; for then she having just cause,
to complain of oppressions (as they did) they only conveyed
them to her notice, and left the time and order of redress to her
Princely discretion. And yet when it was not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, she would bid them meddle to amend their own
Manners; Nor were her Messengers choaked, by any reproach,
that came of such errands. In his time, so much degenerate
from the purity of the former, under pretence of reforming and
freedom, that their very inquiry extended to the privacy of the
King himself.</p>

                     <p>Afflicting themselves to search for mischiefs, and being found
to scandallize the State with them.</p>
                     <p>How these were nourished and afterwards fomented, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of time hath made obvious to all men, and saves me
the labour to set down the particulars.</p>
                     <p>It was no novelty then to applaud the former times, and to
vilifie the present, for indeed her fame carried it current in a
long continuance, to have lived and dyed Royally and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
without the disquiet of the peoples affections; and
being but a Sojourner in the World in respect of her Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-hood,
might be, and was a blessing to her own times: the
impression of her good Goverment, besides her happy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is not without some effect, which doth survive her; But this K
blessed already with Royal issue, and whose fruitful Bed promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
increase, It was more proper and agreeable with him to be
studious, not onely in the Transitory part of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but in those Acts, which are in their nature permanent
and perpetual to his posterity, rather to increase, than diminish
the Advantages of Soveraignty, which he aimed at, and for
his part and time did perform, but tis a tender subject to discuss.
I have done.</p>
                     <p>Yet I may add a truth. That all the force and power of his
Progenitours, and all their merits and policies to boot (for more
then an age before her) could never borrow so much credit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Privy Seals, as she did during her time, and left them
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60657:226"/>
all for this King to discharge, great and vast sums. Which
shews; that Necessities put her upon that piece of State, when
neither her Exchequer could afford relief, nor the urgency of
her affairs indure the delaies of Parliaments assistance. For
in truth, she had strained likewise from her people in that way
of Subsidies, more then ever any Prince (I will not say many)
that were before her.</p>
                     <p>She had the way to do it, by complaisance of a Princess;
and he a King, not affecting that Course, failed of such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                     <p>For he was by nature more reserved than popular, and had
his virtues fitter for estimation then Love, and did like a King;
his soul being planted higher, overshot such matter, as lay
level to anothers eye.</p>
                     <p>And so (as I have said) some of these ways, to get mony, was
set a foot, this year 1614. and upon several occasions in his reign
after proposed, but not effected.</p>
                     <p>In those times of Trade the Merchant-Adventurer usually
transported <hi>Our English Cloths,</hi>

and the <hi>Dutch</hi> had gotten the Art by the end, fitted and stretcht
them by their Knavery, and so returned them to us at high rates;
of this the Cloth-worker of <hi>London</hi> complains, which was soon
remedied by Proclamation, forbidding the transport; and to
countenance that Corporation, the King was feasted in their
Hall, and made free of their Company, the rather because their
Cote Arms, the <hi>Thistle,</hi> is the <hi>Scots Embleme.</hi> And over went
our <hi>Cloaths</hi> accordingly, dyed and drest, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
forbid to be bought by them; and therefore dealt with our
Fell-mongers, and got over Our <hi>Woolls,</hi> and the <hi>Mystery</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon we proclame and forbid the transport of our <hi>wools.</hi>
The Quarrel between those two Corporations, and their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
gain is by the <hi>Merchant Adventurers</hi> complained of, and
for mittigation of their Mischief, several warrants for some
thousands of Cloths were sparingly licensed by wisdome of
State, to be sent over, and so evenly moderating the mystery
of <hi>Merchants</hi> that cozen each other; and at their great Feast like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Prince was made free.</p>

                     <p>First,<note place="margin">The Case pleaded.</note> therefore Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> for a time was known to
have great interest and strait friendship with the Earl of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
both in his meaner fortunes, and after; in so much, that he
was in a kinde of oracle of direction unto him, and if you will
believe his own vaunt, (being indeed of an insolent and <hi>Thraso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>
disposition) he took upon him, that the fortunes, reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and understanding of this Gentleman (who is well known to
have an able Teacher) proceeded from his company and counsel:
and this friendship rested not onely in conversation and business
at <hi>Court,</hi> but likewise in communication of business of <hi>State;</hi>
for my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> exercising at that time, by his <hi>Majesties</hi>
special favour and trust, the Office of <hi>Secretary,</hi> did not forbear
to acquaint <hi>Overbury</hi> with the Kings <hi>Packets</hi> and <hi>Dispatches</hi> from
all parts of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and the <hi>Low-countreys;</hi> and this not
by glympses, or now and then rounding in the ear for a favour,
but in a settled manner: <hi>Packets</hi> were sent, sometimes opened
by my <hi>Lord,</hi> sometimes unbrokened, unto <hi>Overbury,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
them, copied them, registred them, made Table-talk of
them, as he thought good: so, the time was, when <hi>Overbury</hi>
knew more of the secrets of <hi>State,</hi> than the <hi>Council-table</hi> did,
nay, they were grown to such inwardness, as they made a play of
all the world besides themselves, so as they had <hi>cyphers</hi> and Iur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
for the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and great men of the <hi>Realm;</hi>
things seldom used, but either by <hi>Princes</hi> or their confederates,
or at the <hi>Court,</hi> or at the least by such, as practice and work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
or (at least) upon <hi>Princes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as it is a <hi>Principle</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> that the best things are in
their corruption the worst, and the sweetest Wine makes the
sowrest Vineger, so it fell out with them, that this excess, as I
may say of friendship, ended in mortal hatred, on my Lord of
<hi>Somerset</hi>'s part.</p>
                     <p>It hath been said, that <hi>Frost and Fraud ends foul;</hi> and I may

                           </gap>ship of ill men,</hi> which is truly
said to be conspiracy, and not friendship; for it happened, that
the Earl of <hi>Somerset</hi> fell into an unlawfull love, towards that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:60657:228"/>
Lady the <hi>Countess</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi> and to proceed to a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi>
with her; this <hi>Marriage</hi> and purpose did <hi>Overbury</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impugn, under pretence to do the true part of a Friend, for
that he accounted her an unworthy woman; but the truth is,
<hi>Overbury,</hi> (who (to speak plainly) had little that was solid for
<hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>moral virtue,</hi> but was wholly possest with ambition
and vain-glory) was loath to have any partners in the favour
of my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Somerset<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and especially not any of the House
of <hi>Howards,</hi> against whom he had professed hatred and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>And that this is no sinister construction, will appear, when
you shall hear, that <hi>Overbury</hi> made his brags, that he had won
him the love of the <hi>Lady</hi> by his <hi>Letters</hi> and industry; so far was
he from cases of <hi>conscience</hi> in this point.</p>
                     <p>And certainly, howsoever the <hi>tragical</hi> misery of that poor
Gentleman <hi>Overbury,</hi> might somewhat obliterate his faults, yet
because we are not upon point of civility, but to discover the
face of Truth, for that it is material to the true understanding of
the state of this cause, <hi>Overbury</hi> was naught and corrupt: in his
commendation the <hi>Ballads</hi> must be mended for that point,
which paint him out other, and partiality must be blamed, which
now a days favour him, in malice to the memory of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of these Times.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, when <hi>Overbury</hi> saw that he was like to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
of my <hi>Lords</hi> grace, which he had possessed so long, and
by whose greatness he had promised himself to do wonders;
and being a man of an unbounded and impudent spirit, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
not onely to disswade, but to deter him, from the love
of that <hi>Lady;</hi> and finding him fixed, thought to finde a strong
Remedy; and supposing that he had my <hi>Lord</hi>'s head under his
Girdle, in respect of communication of secrets of <hi>State,</hi> (as he
calls them himself) secrets of Nature, and therefore dealt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
with him to make him desist, with menaces of discovery,
and the like: hereupon grew two streams of hatred upon <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi>
the one from the <hi>Lady,</hi> in respect that he crossed her love,
and abused her Name, (which are <hi>Furies</hi> in women) the other
of a more deep nature, from my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> himself,
who was afraid of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s nature; and if he did break from
him and fly out, he would winde into him, and trouble his
whole fortunes; so as certainly it was resolved that <hi>Overbury</hi>
must dy.</p>
                     <p>That was too weak, and they were so far from giving way to
it, as they crossed it; there rested but two ways of quarrel, <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault</hi>
and <hi>Poyson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that of <hi>Assault,</hi> after some proposition and attempt they
passed from it, as a thing too open and subject to more variety of
shame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="418" facs="tcp:60657:229"/>
That of <hi>Poyson</hi> likewise was an hazardous thing, and subject
to many preventions and caution, especially to such a working
and jealous brain as <hi>Overbury</hi> had, except he was first in their
hands; therefore the way was, first to get him sent over Seas, or
into a Trap, and lay him up, and then they could not miss the
mark; and therefore in execution of this Plot, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that his pride should be designed to some honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
imployment in forein parts, and should under-hand by
himself my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> be encouraged to refuse it,
and so upon contempt he should be laid <hi>Prisoner</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi>
and then they thought he should be close, and <hi>Death</hi> should be
his <hi>Bail.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet were they not at their end, for they considered, that if
there were not a fit <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>Tower</hi> for that purpose, and
likewise a fit <hi>Under-keeper</hi> of <hi>Overbury;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, they should meet with many impediments in the giving
and exhibiting of the <hi>Poyson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, they should be exposed to note and observation,
that might discover them.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, <hi>Overbury</hi> in the mean time might write clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and furious <hi>Letters</hi> to his Friends, and so all might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the next Link of the Chain was, to displace
the then Lieutenant <hi>Wade,</hi> and to place <hi>Yelvis,</hi> a principal abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the impoysonment; to displace <hi>Carew,</hi> that was under-keeper
in <hi>Wade</hi>'s time, and to place <hi>Weston</hi> that was the Actor in
the impoysonment.</p>
                     <p>And this was done in such a while, that it may appear to be
done, as it were in a breath.</p>
                     <p>Then when they had this poor Gentleman in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where
he could not escape nor stir; where he could not feed, but by
their hands; where he could not speak, or write, but through
their trunks; then was the time, to act the last Day of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</p>
                     <p>Then must <hi>Franklin</hi> the Purveyor of the <hi>Poyson,</hi> in <hi>May 1613.</hi>
procure five, six, seven several <hi>Poysons,</hi> to be sure to hit his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;</hi>
then must Mistris <hi>Turner</hi> the lay-mistris of the <hi>Poysons,</hi>
advise, what works at present, and what at distance. Then must
<hi>Weston</hi> be the Tormentor, and chace him with <hi>Poyson,</hi> after <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Poyson</hi> in salt meats, <hi>Poyson</hi> in sweet meats, <hi>Poyson</hi> in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
and Vomits, untill at last his body was almost come by
use of <hi>Poysons</hi> to the state of <hi>Mithridates</hi> body, by the use of
<hi>Treacle</hi> and preservatives, that the force of the <hi>Poysons</hi> was
blunted upon him; <hi>Weston</hi> confessing, <hi>That when he was child
for not dispatching, that he had given him enough to poyson twenty
men.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="419" facs="tcp:60657:229"/>
And because all this asked time, impoysoning from <hi>March 9.</hi>
to <hi>September 14.</hi> courses were taken by <hi>Somerset</hi> both to divert
all the true means of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s delivery, and to entertain him
with continual <hi>Letters,</hi> partly with hopes and protestations, for
his delivery, and partly with other fables and negotiations,
somewhat like some kinde of persons, which keep in a Tale of
fortune-telling, when they have a fellonious intent to pick their
Pockets and Purses. Untill at last, they hastened his destruction
by an impoysoned <hi>Glyster,</hi> which wrought into his intrails, and
soon dispatch him. And this is the Narration of this Art,
which I have summarily recited.</p>
                     <p>Then comes his <hi>Countess</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess arreigned,</note> to her Trial, guilty of too much
contrivance and practice, though in Murder it be crime enough;

beholden to Nature, that she could vent her self in tears; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that sorrow which cannot bleed in the eys does often festor

                           <p>BY this Gentleman your Majesties Lieutenant, I understand of
some halt you made,<note place="margin">Somerset's Letter to the King.</note> and the cause of it, at such time as he offered
to your Majesty my Letters; but soon after, your Majesty could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
your self, and behold me nothing so diffident of you, but in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
language petitioning your favour;<note place="margin">Cabala, p. 1.</note> for I am in hope, that my
condition is not capable of so much more misery, as I need make my
passage to you, by such way of intercession.</p>
                           <p>This which follows after, I offer your Majesty, though not as to
your self, for upon less motive you can finde favour for me.</p>
                           <p>Now I need onely move, not plead, before your Majesty, as my case
doth stand; for what I seek to have done, follows, upon what you have
already done, as a consequence and succeeding growth of your own
act.</p>
                           <p>But to the effect, that your Majesty may see, that there is enough to
answer those, (if any such there be) as do go about to pervert the
exercise of your Power, and to turn it from its own clear excellency,
for to minister unto their passions. I have presumed to this end to
awake your Majesties own conceit, upon this subject, which can gather
to it self better and more able defences in my behalf upon this view;
for though the Acts of your Mercy, which are not communicable, nor
the causes of them with others, as derived from those sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap> motives,
which are onely sensible and privy to your own heart, and admit of no
search or discovery, to any general satisfaction; and that under this
protection, I might guard my particular sufficiently; yet, my case needs
not hide it self, but attend the dispute with any, that would put upon it
a monstrous and heavy shape; though that I must acknowledg, that
both Life and Estate are forfeited to you, by Law, yet so forfeited,
that the same Law gives you the same power to preserve as it doth to
punish; whereby your Majesties higher Prerogative doth not wrestle
with it, nor do you infringe those grounds, by which you have ever
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:60657:230"/>
governed; so as the resistance is not great, that your Majesty hath for
to give Life, and which is less in the gift of Estate; for that, the
Law casts wholly upon your self, and yields it as fit matter, for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of your goodness. Once it was your Majesties gift to me, so it may
be better not taken, than a second time given; for it is common to all
men, for to avoid to take that, which hath been once their own. And
I may say farther, that Law hath not been so severe, upon the ruine
of innocent posterity, nor yet cancelled, nor cut off the merits of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
before the politick hand of State had contrived it into these
several forms, as fitted to their ends and government.</p>
                           <p>To this I may add, that that whereupon I was judged, even the
crime it self, might have been none, if your Majesties hand had not
once touched upon it, by which, all access unto your favour was quite
taken from me. Yet as it did at length appear, I fell rather for want
of well defending, than by the violence or force of any proofs; for I
so far for sook my self and my cause, as that it may be a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I was more condemned for that, or for the matter it self, which
was the subject of that days controversie.</p>
                           <p>Then thus far, nothing hath appeared wherein your Majesty hath
extended for me your power, beyond the reasonable bound, neither
doth any thing stand so in the way of your future proceedings, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make easie your Majesties favour for my relief.</p>
                           <p>What may then be the cause that malice can pitch upon, wherefore
your Majesty should not proceed to accomplish your own work? Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are taken away by your Majesties letting me loose, to the utmost
power of Law, with the lives of so many offenders, which yieldeth the
world subjects of sorrow, rather than appetite to more bloud; but
truth and innocency protect themselves in poor men, much more in
Kings. Neither ever was there such aspersion, (God knows) in any
possibility, towards your Majesty; but among those, who would create
those pretences, to mislead your Majesty, and thereby make me mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
If not this (whereof the virtue and use was in the former
time and now determined) there is not any but your pleasure.</p>
                           <p>It is true, I am forfeited to your Majesty, but not against you, by
any treasonable or unfaithfull act; besides, there is to be yielded a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of men, as in faults; in which I am of both, under the
nearest degrees of exception.</p>
                           <p>Yet your Majesty hath pardoned Life and Estate to Traitors, and to
strangers sometimes the one, sometimes the other; nay, to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this business, wherein I suffer; you have pardoned more
unto them than I desire; who (as it is reputed) if they had come to
the test, had proved Copper, and should have drunk of the bitter cup
as well as others.</p>
                           <p>But I do not by this, envy your favours to any persons, nor seek I
to draw them into the yoak with my self, but applaud your Majesties
goodness, being in that respect, in a nearer possibility to come at me.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="422" facs="tcp:60657:231"/>
Besides this, to <hi>Elvish</hi> your Majesty hath given Estate, which is a
greater gift than Life, because it extends to posterity, who was the
worst deserver in this business, an unoffended instrument, might have
prevented,<note place="margin">Sir W. Elvish.</note> all after-mischief, who for his own ends suffered it, and by
the like arts afterwards, betraid it.</p>
                           <p>To this I may add, <hi>Tresham</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Sir Lewis Tresham.</note> in the Powder Treason, upon whose

arts of Law, and whom their own unfaithfulness made safe, I have
much ado to hold by ingenuity and confidence. How may it be, because
I distrusted not your Majesty, or because it returned in your power
from whom I had it? is it in danger to be broken or dismembred? Let
me hope that there is nothing which by favour may be excused, or by
industry might have been avoided, that will fail me, where your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
is to determine. It is not I that thus put your Majesty in minde opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely;
it is he that was your creature, it is <hi>Somerset</hi> with all your
honours, and envious greatness, that is now in question. Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are protected from the breach of Law, by being favourites and
Gods Anointed; which gives your Majesty like privilege over yours
as I took from Doctor <hi>Dun</hi> in his Sermon, that <hi>the goodness of
God is not so much acknowledged by us in being our</hi> Creator,
<hi>as in being our</hi> Redeemer, <hi>nor in that he hath chosen us, as that
nothing can take us out of his hand:</hi> which in your Majesties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
let me challenge and hope for; for the first accesses of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
they may be ascribed unto ones own pleasing themselves; but
that appears to be for our sakes, and for our good, when the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes
not our civil desires.</p>
                           <p>This Redemption I crave, not as to my own person, but with your
benesits once given; nor do I assume them very deep, for I have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
departed from the hopes of my Pension, Place, Office; I
onely cleave to that, which is so little as that it will suffer no paring or
diminution.</p>
                           <p>And as in my former Letters, so by this, I humbly crave of your
Majesty, not to let the practices of Court, work upon your Son the
Prince; not fearing the sufferance of my loss in that particular, so
much (for I cannot lose it, but willingly all with it) as for to take off
the stage, that which in the attempt may prove inconvenient.</p>
                           <p>And consider, I pray your Majesty, that my hope in desiring to pass
these bad times, was to be restored to my fortunes; others are made
unhappy by me, if otherwise; and then I lose my end: I speak of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing,
of changing, or supplying, as of any other way, all such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
and ruine are alike, without I be worthy of your gift, and
that I can be worthy of all, that Law can permit you to give, or
cast upon your Majesty by a more nearer Title, as it doth by this; I
shall account them equal evils, that leave nothing, or a patched and
proportioned one, changed, or translated from one thing to another.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="423" facs="tcp:60657:231"/>
But if your Majesty have any respects to move you, to suspend
your good towards me, let that which is mine rest in your own hands,
till that you finde all opposite humours conformed to your purpose.</p>
                           <p>I have done wrong to my self, thus to entertain such a doubt of
your Majesty; but the unrelenting of adversaries, which when you
will have them, will sooner alter, and that all this while, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
nothing of present notice for direction, or to comfort me from
your Majesty, hath made me to expostulate with my self thus hardly;
for God is my. Iudg, Sir, I can never be worthy to be, if I have these
marks put upon me of a Traitor, as that tumbling and disordering
of that estate, would declare the divorce from your presence, laies too
much upon me; and this would upon both.</p>
                           <p>I will say no further, neither in that, which your Majesty doubted
my aptness to fall into; for my cause nor my confidence is not in that
distress, as for to use that mean of intercession, nor of any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
but to remember your Majesty, that I am the workmanship of
your hands, and bear your stamp deeply imprinted in all the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of favour; that I was the first Plant ingrafted by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
hand in this place; therefore not to be unrootod by the same hand,
lest it should taint all the same kinde, with the touch of that fatal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and that I was even the Son of a Father, whose Services are
registred in the first Honours and impressions I took of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
favour, and laid there as a Foundation-stone of that building.</p>
                           <p>These, and your Majesties goodness, for to receive them, is that I
rely upon; praying for your Majesties prosperity. I am in all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</p>

                     <p>This case was to be farther argued in the Kings absence by all
the Judges, which he thought to protract, untill they consulted
with him;<note place="margin">Sir Fr: Bacon.</note> and so commanded his <hi>Attourney General</hi> to signifie
by Letters his pleasure to all the Judges.</p>
                     <p>The Judges notwithstanding, at the day argue the Case, and
return answer by Letter to the King, That they held those Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be contrary to Law, and such as they could not obey by
Oath, and therefore had proceeded at the day appointed, setting
down the Case to be upon construction of two Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3. and of 25 <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and now between Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for private interest and Inheritance. That their Oath is,
<hi>That in case any Letter come to them contrary to Law, they are not to
obey them, but to proceed to Iustice.</hi> And so they did the last Term,

to their own knowledg, his princely care for justice to be duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to his Subjects with all expedition, and how far he was from
crossing or delaying the interests of private persons. But on the other
side, where the case concerned the high Powers and Prerogatives of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:60657:232"/>
his Crown, he would not indure to have them wounded through the
sides of a private person; admonishing them of an ordinary custome
lately entertained, boldly to dispute the high points of his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in a popular and unlawful way of Argument, not heretofore u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual.
Making them senceable, how weak and impertinent the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of their Oath was in a case of this nature; as if the Founders
of their Oath, His Predcessors, were so intent in their zeal to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
to make a weapon to wound their Successors, being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
course to put off Hearings and Determinings, amongst pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

                        </gap>ogative;
though neither Law nor Lawyer can be respected, if the King be not
reverenced; And therefore it became the Iudges to bridle their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencies
in their several Benches; especially the Courts of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,</hi>
who had incroached upon all other Courts, <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,

his Majesties command to be against the Law, and their Oath.
He tells them, deferring upon just and necessary cause is not denying
or delaying of Instice, but rather wisdom and maturity. Nothing
more proper than to cousult with the King where it concerns the
Crown.</p>
                     <p>As for the Manner; The Kings absence before the Argument,
and yet his resolved return speedily; and the case, though lately
argued could not receive Iudgement till Easter. Term after, as the
Iudges confessed.</p>
                     <p>And for them to say, that the case was private interest of party
and party; One of the Parties is a Bishop, that pleads for the
<hi>Commendam</hi> onely by vertue of his Majesties Prerogative. And
that they could not prove any Solicitation of either Parties for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
                     <p>And for the form of the Letter, it was undecent; besides to
proceed, and to return a bare Certificate, without giving reasons
therefore</p>

                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:60657:233"/>
Upon this all the Iudges fell down on their knees, acknowledging
their Errour, and craving Pardon.</p>
                     <p>But for the Matter, the Chief Iustice <hi>Cook</hi> entered into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
That the stay by his Majesty, was a delay of Iustice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
against Law and their Oath, that as they meant to handle the
Pleading, it should not concern the King's Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To which the King told him,</hi> That for them to discern the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of his Prerogative without consult with him, was preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
And for those of Law and Oath, he had said sufficient before.
Therefore he required the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi>'s opinion herein, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against Law and their Oath?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chancellour</hi> excused himself as to that of Law, referring
it to the opinion of the <hi>King</hi>'s Council; whereupon the Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
General <hi>Bacon</hi> said,</p>
                     <p>That to put off the Day was no Delay of Justice, nor endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
their Oath; for the <hi>King</hi>'s Reasons were onely, that it
concerned his Prerogative, and required therefore a stay for a
small time; and advised the Judges, whether this refusal of
their did not rather endanger their Oath; which was, <hi>To counsel
the King when they are called:</hi> but to counsel after the matter is
past, was a simple refusal to give him Counsel at all. And all the
rest of the Council concluded with him.</p>
                     <p>The Chief Justice <hi>Cook</hi> excepted, <hi>That the King's Council
should plead against the Iudges; being their duties to plead before
them, not against them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whereunto the Attourney replied,</hi> That the King's Council
were by Oath and Office, not onely to plead, proceed, and declare
against the greatest Subject, but also against any body of Subjects
or persons, nay, were they Iudges or Courts, or <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and concluded, That the Iudges challenge
was a wrong to their Places, and appealed to the King, who was firm
for them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Chief Justice replied,</hi> He would not dispute it with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
<hi>The King replied,</hi> Nor with my Council. So then whether
you do well or ill, it may not be disputed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chancellour</hi> gave his opinion with the King, and his
Council.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hereupon the positive Question was put by all the Lords,</hi>
Whether in a Case depending, which the King might conceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
concerned in power or profit, and requiring to consult with them
they ought not to stay proceedings?</p>
                     <p>All the Judges submitted thereto, onely the Chief Justice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
saying, <hi>When that Case should be, then he would do his duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Chief Justice of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> said, <hi>For his part,
He would always trust the justice of the King's command.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Day drawing nigh, the next <hi>Saturday,</hi> for arguing
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:60657:233"/>
the <hi>Commendams,</hi> the King desired the Judges to express, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would then argue upon the Kings general power of granting</hi>
Commendams, <hi>yea or no.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They all concluded, Not to draw into doubt his power, but
to insist upon the point of <hi>Lapse,</hi> which they conceived to be
of a form different from former <hi>Commendams;</hi> and concluded
to correct the insolencies of bold arguing the Prerogative.</p>
                     <p>Judge <hi>Doderidge</hi> concluded for the King, That the Church
was void, and in his gift, and might give a <hi>Commendam</hi> to a
Bishop, either before or after Consecration, during Life or
years.</p>
                     <p>The Judges being gone, the privy Council resolved that the
Kings desire was not against the Judges Oath, nor against the
Common Law to require; and all of them subscribed to the
same.</p>
                     <p>This Dispute was publiquely scanned and censured in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Judges, and on the contrary for the King, but the
truth I have really extracted out of the Records of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
Table; That you may thereby see the true scope of those
times.</p>
                     <p>The State of <hi>Spain</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spain and France cross Mariage with Savoy.</note> having little to do in Martial affairs; K.

King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, had 3. daughters; the one maried to the
Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> misliking to have those

without his Interest, conceived it good policy to indeer the

<hi>Infanta Anna,</hi> and to marry his son <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Princess E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth;</hi>
the second daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth.</p>
                     <p>And thus those cross Nuptials might seem to cement the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the three States, lately so imbroyled in War, which
no doubt either of them had good cause to accept; though it
was said <hi>S. P. Q. R. Spain, Pope, Queen-Regent</hi> had the chief

                     </p>
                     <p>For the Father <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> had made Wars upon the

King of <hi>Spain</hi> under colour to aid the Duke (his Brother in Law)
sent him <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>foot</hi> of <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the peace concluded,
by exchange of <hi>Saluses,</hi> with the <hi>Countries</hi> of <hi>Bresse</hi> and <hi>Gex;</hi>
the <hi>Spanish Auxilliaries,</hi> being muzled in warm quarters, at

                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:60657:234"/>
and so staid, until that valiant Duke, in this danger very despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
cut all their throats.</p>

His story was; that his Ancestors at Plough with those

his Train; for which service, had so much Land,

rested. And all this great purchase could not keep him from
seeking livelyhood in <hi>France;</hi> where he was bred no other than
a <hi>Gens d' Arms</hi> unto <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, but quitted that service
in hopes of better preferment of his own Sovereign.</p>
                     <p>And over he comes to meet the King at his entrance into
<hi>England,</hi> upon recommendation of the <hi>French Lieger</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who continued so here; and presented <hi>Haies</hi> upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
knowledge in <hi>France.</hi> This, and his other good parts (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well accomplished) hastened him higher in esteem, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his Countrey, whose neerer attendance had merited
more.</p>
                     <p>But, to boot, he sought out a good Heir (<hi>Gup my Ladie</hi>
Dorothy) sole Daughter to the <hi>Lord Dennie,</hi> and to fit him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
after Knighthood he had honour; and was made a Lord,
for reasonable riches his wife brought with her.</p>
                     <p>In grateful acknowledge of his first preferment, he feasted
the former <hi>Embassadour</hi> (being lately returned extraordinary to

of his first Match, which was not much while her Father

disdaining the Mariage, denied <hi>her a Groat to a beggerlie Scot,</hi>
as he called him.</p>
                     <p>This first Embassie was for no other end, than to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
for certainly he had no Commission nor Credential to make
scrutiny for matching our Prince with the other Sister, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then too young, and overtures were then thought on with
<hi>Spain,</hi> and so it was advertised from Sir <hi>Dudley Charlton,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour

                     </p>

(partly for that purpose) at this time also, upon the like errand,
to give joy to that King, for the counter-match of his Son, and
had his Instructions to feel the pulse of that Court concerning
the same, (for I waited on him neerer in his affairs, than any of
his Train) and both these Ambassadours sent away at the same
time. It was remarkable how each of them strove for the prize
to out-vy in the vanity of these Voyages; the <hi>Baron</hi> to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to put down the <hi>English,</hi> as in that great Feast at <hi>Essex-House,</hi>
and many his <hi>Masqueradoes</hi> afterwards at Court, for he
medled not with the Tilt, as being no Swordman; but in the

                     <p>Amongst many others that accompanyed <hi>Haies</hi> Expedition,

afterwards Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> natural son to the then Earl of
<hi>Warwick;</hi> He took his initiation of expence, from this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and continued the practice afterwards to the weakning of
his (long time) unsettled fortunes, being forced through custom
of the Court to follow the other in all his fashions; and which
infection, by after-custome, became his disease also, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
(not over-mastering) yet over-shadowing his natural emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
parts, with which his inside was habited, and perspicuous
to such as afterwards knew him.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I had occasion to say heretofore, to which hath
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:60657:235"/>
been exception; as if I undertook him besides the Text, in a
wanton pleasure of my own pen to blazon his memory with the
foyl of his friend.</p>
                     <p>Truly, it was not so! by any <hi>unequal disparity to pride out the
other:</hi> For, let me here take the freedom to speak more of him;
who from henceforth being received into publick, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in by his own endeavours to the place of Cap. of the Band
of Yeomen of the Guard to the Kings person, a place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and profit; and increasing with years and experience into
some favour now, and afterwards in high grace and esteem with
the succeeding Sovereign; was yet (I must confess) in the
fate of State and Court, circumvested now and then with some
prejudice.</p>
                     <p>And it may be uneasy for a stranger (not for me) to research
with due distinction into the Actions of his whole life succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(not to enliven him by a line) whom envy heretofore, and
now malice after his decease, have endeavoured to blemish
more than his own former felicity did, or could any way cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
                     <p>If we deduce him from his Cradle, we shall find him, as it
were, begotten to an inheritance of true Nobleness and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
grace, in more real splendour than others, that seemed to
appear compatible with him, they being onely made so by
hand.</p>
                     <p>His life indeed was intricate, sometime struggling with the
by-paths-of Sovereign-favour, and afterwards of State-affairs.
Which at last (and at worst) infected him with the disease of the
times, more malignant in his Counsellors, and other his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents,
then in his own conscience or inclination; and so drew
him on by various disguises of subtilty, with the composition
of his good nature, till the remain of his life was involved
into Ingagements unstable; the effects whereof smothered
him in the uncouth deluge of destruction.</p>
                     <p>I have no adverse aim or end, on either side of these two
Lords to embase the freedom of my Opinion or Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tryed into some purity of truth by my own knowledge of
the former. and of this other by more exact account, than by
most men, or by any other pen may be expected.</p>
                     <p>But I am not delighted to urge out this story of the Lord
<hi>Haies,</hi> as not willing to speak evilly of any person of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
unlike Our Adversaries that spare none; For we should
know that virtue and vice are inherent in Man.</p>
                     <p>And as it becomes us to tell truth when we speak of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
so with modesty and compassion to discover their vices.
Either of them being examples for the future, that to imitate,
this to shun. And I cannot but with compunction remind, that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:60657:235"/>
the monstrous excess of the Belly and the Back, by his first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
became then, the mode of those Times for great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
(the most part) to follow, and for ordinary people to put
in practice, even to this day, and may be feared, for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>The Sword being sheathed up in the Scabberd, Peace and
Plenty brought the Law into esteem, the onely over-ruling
power to set men (even) by the ears, and make them the more
quiet ever after.</p>
                     <p>But then Cases increased so common, that Conscience was
troubled to reconcile them, and made a Quarrel of Justice it
self, between Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> Chief Justice of Law, and the
Lord <hi>Elsmore</hi> Keeper of the Conscience, who had the better of
the Cause, to the others ruine.</p>
                     <p>The Case was thus:</p>
                     <p>Sundry Citizens got Judgment in the Court of Common-Pleas
by a juggling Trick, that staved off an opposite Witness;
the Plaintiff nevertheless exhibits his Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> against
the Defendants, who sit out Process of Contempt, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to answer, are committed to the <hi>Fleet.</hi> And for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
exhibit their Bill in <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> against the Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour

That the Iudgment given in the Kings Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Chancellour</hi> acquaints the <hi>King,</hi> who sends to <hi>Bacon

leaves the <hi>Seat</hi> of deciding, and sits down himself to his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

                     <p>The Common-pleas, or <hi>Comunia Placita,</hi> is the Kings Court,
or <hi>Bancus Communis, Anno 2. Edw. 3. cap. II.</hi> so called, <hi>Quia
Communia Placita inter subditos,</hi> or controversies between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
persons, it was now held in <hi>Westminster-</hi> Hall. But in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times moveable, as appears by <hi>Magna Charta cap. II.</hi> And
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:60657:237"/>
that upon grant of that Charter, the Court of common-pleas
was erected and settled, and one place certain, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
wheresoever the King lay, and that after that time all the
Writs ran, <hi>Quod sit coram Iusticiariis meis apud Westmonast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas before, the party was commanded by them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<hi>Coram me vel Iustitiaris meis,</hi> simply without addition
of place; see <hi>Glanvile</hi> and <hi>Bracton,</hi> the one writing in <hi>Henrie</hi>
the seconds time, before this Court was erected; the other in
<hi>Henrie</hi> the thirds time, who erected this Court. All Civil cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
real and personal are (or were in former times) in this Court
according to the strickt Law of this Realm. And by <hi>Fortescue
cap. 50.</hi> it seemeth to have been the only Court for real causes.
The chief Judge thereof is called, <hi>Lord Chief Iustice of the
Common-pleas,</hi> accompanied with three or four Assistants or
Associates, who are created by Letters pattents from the King,
and are installed (as it were) upon the Bench by the Lord <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour,</hi>
and Lord <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> of that Court. See <hi>Fortescue ca. 51.</hi>
who sets down all the Circumstances of their admission.
The rest of the Officers are these; the <hi>Custos Brevium,</hi> three
Proto-Notaries, or principal Notaries, called also Pregnotaries;
<hi>Chirographer, Filazers</hi> in number fourteen, <hi>Exigenters</hi> four;
<hi>Clerk of the Warrants, Clerk of the Iuries,</hi> or <hi>Iurata Writs,
Clerk of the Treasury, Clerk of the Kings Silver; Clerk of the
Essoines; Clerk of the Out-laws.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Common Law</hi> is so antient,<note place="margin">Lex terrae, what?</note> we know not the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Lex Angliae</hi> peculiar onely to this Land. Of long time
following the Conquest, ever more quarrelled for enjoyment of
antient Liberties; until <hi>Henrie</hi> the third allowed <hi>English</hi> men
<hi>English Laws,</hi> add in his ninth year granted the great Charter,
which himself infringed, and thereupon followed fourty years
<hi>Barons Warrs</hi> (as Histories stile them) until in his fifty two year,
that Charter was again reviewed and compiled, and solemnly
sworn unto by succeeding Sovereigns.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ground of which binds the King</hi> per Legem terrae, <hi>and
what is this</hi> Lexterrae? Leges Anglicanae fuerunt approbatae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu
utentium &amp; Sacramento Regum confirmatae. Lex facit Regem;
attribuat igitur Rex legi, quod Lex attribuit ei, viz. dominatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
&amp; potestatem; ubi non Lex, ibi non Rex. <hi>So then</hi> Lex fecit
Regem. <hi>Not so neither; Kings in</hi> England <hi>before Lawes; but
indeed</hi> Communis Consuetudo Regni fuit Lex terrae.</p>
                     <p>This being the Law without commencement; as the <hi>Genius</hi>
to all, and Parliaments Statutes, Prerogatives of Princes,
Customes of Counties, Cities, Burroughs, Mannors, are but
the species of it. For general Customs made the Law, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
Parliaments, Limits Prerogatives and Customes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
or disonant to Reason; so much for <hi>Communis Lex.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:60657:237"/>
But in practice (say some) the <hi>Chancery</hi> is above Law, and yet
duely examined, that also is allowed <hi>per Legen terrae,</hi> as a species
of that.</p>
                     <p>The reason thus.<note place="margin">Cancelaria, what?</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Common Law</hi> grounded upon general Maxims, they
might be too severe, or too relax; and therefore necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring

                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>And this Chancelour notwithstanding limitted by Law and
erected by Law, although it seems above Law. For</p>
                     <p>No Judge hath Jurisdiction without some grant or commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of that Court under the Great Seal, which is intrusted to
the <hi>Chancelor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Judge can hold plea without an Original Writ framed in
<hi>Chancerie,</hi> and by his appointment returnable before the Judges,
and yet all these considered, the King, the Law, the <hi>Chancery</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chancerie</hi> then must needs be erected (subsequent) by
the common Law, to relieve and supply the Law in some cases,
where the simple subject was cosened by craft; ignorance, also
may offend, without malice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moses Law,</hi> in divers cases Political and Ceremonial, he could
not decide (uncleanness by touching the dead) but referred it
to God.</p>
                     <p>The name of this Officer is, <hi>Dominus Cancelarius Angliae,</hi> a
a Cancelour; do but then quere what he might cancel?</p>
                     <p>Some say it is, <hi>Cancelare Iniquom legem comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nnem, Iudicare
secundum conscientiam;</hi> but this is an errour; will the Law give
power to deface her self that made it?</p>
                     <p>The Chancelour cannot stay the course of Law, but onely
injunct the person not to follow the Law; not to cancel the
Law; for notwithstanding this injunction, if the party will
sit out contempt, and proceed at common Law, the Judges can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny him.</p>
                     <p>Indeed rhis Officer hath his name of <hi>canceling</hi> the Kings Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
pattents, so much of honour to the Law, as the other way
had been dishonourable.</p>
                     <p>The nature of Letters pattents bind the King and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and all Subjects, though unfit or unjust; the Judges of
Law are co judge it void, but cannot deface it nor the Seal, but
the Chancelour, as a Judge of Law may, (but not by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
authority) by his ordinary power and course of common
Law, is to judge of it, and to hold plea of it, and to call the
party interessed by process of Law, and so to repeal it by
Judgement; and then cancel it: which no person can do but</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="436" facs="tcp:60657:238"/>
And this was done, <hi>Transversa linea circumducere vel conscin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
aliquod Edictum decretum contra Principem, aut jus Reipubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae
impetrari;</hi> which cancelling is made with Lines drawn across
like <hi>Latices,</hi> and it is said that Judgement seats were of old
compassed with <hi>Latices,</hi> or Barrs cross waies, to defend the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Officers from the prease of people, and yet not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their view. Chancells were so divided from the body of the
Church, and thereupon so called.</p>
                     <p>And the Lord <hi>Chancelour</hi> and Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> have one power,
by <hi>Stat. anno 5. Eliz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then you see how, and for what he hath his name.</p>
                     <p>And though his Authority be highest, yet it is given to him
by the Law, and proceedeth in course of Law, not according to
conscience, but Law.</p>
                     <p>That all Justice runs from the Supreme power; so by the
Chancelour to all Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>A man complains of wrong or sues for right in Chancery;
from which Bill of complaint issues a precept commanding the
Defendent to appear at a Day; So then a man may not be sued
before he have a <hi>Writ</hi> or <hi>Breve</hi> from the Chancelour, a singular
regard to the meanest.</p>
                     <p>The very Writs of <hi>Chancerie</hi> are prescribed by Law, and a
form registred in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and if not accordingly issued out,
the Judges will reject them, called in Law, Abating of the
Writ.</p>
                     <p>His Authority to judge,<note place="margin">Authority in Judging.</note> is of two sorts, by common Law,
or Positive Law, <hi>Potentia Ordinata,</hi> Processe, pleading judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Potentia Absoluta;</hi> by Processe according to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> to send for the party, to answer upon Oath; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
if he will not answer, yet the <hi>Chancelour</hi> cannot condemn
him in the cause for obstinacy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Potentia Ordinata,</hi> mispleading on either part, may mar the
matter, and the judgement must be according to Law, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Equity of the case fall out.</p>
                     <p>But if the pleading be by Absolute Power, though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
misplead, if the matter be good, the Iudgement must be by
equity, and not as the pleading, be either formal good or bad,
or as the law will in the case.</p>
                     <p>The Question followes, whether, that conscience whereby
the Chancelour be <hi>simpliciter;</hi> and to be <hi>simplex conscientia,</hi> or

Hereupon we may conclude that his Authority judicial, both

                     <p>For in the <hi>Ordinary</hi> he is tyed to the strict rule of Law, and
by the <hi>Absolute,</hi> he is ruled (though not by the course of law)

his turn, <hi>That the King would rather punish by Imprisonment,

                     </p>
                     <p>And those good times accounted it Bribery.</p>

condemned of Extortion and Bribery, and the Bishop soundly
paid for it, by his purse and imprisonment.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> He imprisoned <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> with punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

he compounded for eighty <hi>per centum,</hi> and 30. for 40. by which

Compounder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So did the <hi>Baron Nevil</hi> bought the Kings debts of the Army,
and though he pleaded that they forgave him the Remainder
freely, yet was he fined.</p>
                     <p>Such like as these were brought Examples to raise the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of this Lord Treasurer; of himself as of high birth, so most
Noble, and without doubt disdaining to commit base crimes;
but whether the guilt of <hi>Sir Iohn Dingly,</hi> one of the Tellers
in <hi>Exchequer,</hi> an intimate Servant to the Secrecies of <hi>Suffolks</hi>
Countess; or some necessity to make bold to borrow such sums
as his Fabrick <hi>Awdle-End</hi> had need of; Or the vain and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
expence heretofore of that family. All that could be
(besides the necessity of Court-Fate) cast in his dish, was the
imbezeling the monies lately paid by the States of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
for redemption of the cautionary Towns <hi>Flushing</hi> and
<hi>Bril;</hi> and he fined thirty thousand pounds, and <hi>Dingly</hi> two

his designing.</p>
                     <p>But the Treasurer was from thenceforth for some time trusted

O God, and thy righteousness to the Kings Son; the literal sense
upon the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> and his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> godly and wise;
the mystical sense upon God and Christ his eternal Son, just and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
from which imitation all Governments, especially <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi>
have been established. Kings are properly Iudges, and sit
in the Throne of God, and thence all Iudgement is derived, from
the King to his Magistrates, not to them <hi>Privative</hi> but <hi>Cumulative.</hi>
So the Council of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> the Iudges were deputed for
easier questions, the more profound left to <hi>Moses.</hi> So, all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

not to speak here in fourteen, years as his Predicessors have done often,
especially <hi>Henry 7.</hi> from whom the King is descended doubly to this
Crown, and so desires to follow him, in his best actions? 2. Why he
comes now?</p>
                     <p>For the first, Though he had been an old King, when he came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and well practised to Government, from twelve years of age,
yet here he resolved with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to keep silence for seven years.
That Apprenticeship ended; the Impediment was the choice of some
worthy Cause, betwixt King and some Subject, or Subject and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
The one might seem partial as for himself, the other oblique in
favour of a party.</p>
                     <p>But twice seven years his whole Reign here brings him open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to speak now publickly, concerning the reformation of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature</hi>
in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> which heretofore he had in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in private occasions.</p>

                        <hi>First,</hi> He protests that as <hi>Confirmation</hi> follows <hi>Baptism,</hi> so
now he renews his Oath of Coronation, in <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> the
common Law of the Land. He never pressed to alter, but (as in the
union of his person) so he eudeavoured it real, to conform <hi>Scotland</hi>
to <hi>England,</hi> not this to that, anent the prophecy of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Henry 7. That the lesser Kingdom by marriage would
follow the greater,</hi> not the greater the less; and therefore married
his eldest Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> to <hi>James</hi> the fourth, the Kings great
Grandfather. And so blames that nice opinion, that the Union of
<hi>Great Brittain</hi> would alter our Laws, which he ever declined, as a
Maxim in matters of State and Policy, Innovation and alteration
makes it worse; that he was sworn to these Laws, and to alter them
had been perjury in him, Iustice may be moderated by him with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but in matters of Iustice he will be blind to partiality: to hasten
Iustice, never to delay.</p>
                     <p>He distinguishes the Law; The Inheritance of King and Subject
to be determined by the Common Law, set down by our Forefathers,
and expounded by learned men in their Comments, and called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsa
Prudentum,</hi> or by Statute-Law, and this is Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</p>
                     <p>The other Law, Gods Law, governs all, Common and Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palls
as Dependents; and he complains of the neglect of Divine
Laws, and disrespect to the Ministers of the Church, which is the
most pure, and neerest the primitive and Apostolical Church in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and discipline of any in Christendome.</p>
                     <p>Next to this is the <hi>Civil Law</hi> (the Law of Nations) It satisfies
strangers, and his own subjects in matters of Pyracy, Mariage,
Wills, which Law he divides, <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> and complains
of the contempt upon it, and concludes his own charge, to maintain
so to purge it from two corruptions. <hi>Incertainty</hi> and <hi>Novelty</hi> to
cleer it to the people by advice of Iudges, and to purge it of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties
introduced by Iudges themselves. And so as the Pastor takes
the Sacrament himself, and then distributes, so he to them, least
it be said, <hi>Turpe est Doctori, cum culpa redarguit ipsum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The charge to the Iudges consists of three parts, To do Iustice,
<hi>Generally; Indifferently, Fearfully. Generally,</hi> uprightly
as to answer God, and the King aud punishment from either. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently</hi>
to all parties, King and Subject, Subject and Subject,
without delay partiallity, clean and uncorrupt. <hi>Fearfully,</hi> Not your
own conceits, for you are no Law makers, but Interpreters. <hi>Jus dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
not <hi>Jus dare.</hi> For you have no voice in Parliament but to advise.
And though some Laws are obscure and may be better known to you
by Books and Presidents, yet their interpretations must be subject
to common sense and reason, <hi>Ratio est anima Legis,</hi> cleer Law, or
solid Reason.</p>
                     <p>But where the formality hath no place, as in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the State
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:60657:240"/>
is governed by written Law, no Advocate or Proctor; only the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
plead and the Law is read, and so sentence. He complains of
our curious wits; Various conceipts; different actions; and several
examples which breed questions in Law. But if plain, it speaks it
self, if otherwise (as inventions abound) they are to enterprete
and draw a good Minor of natural Reason out of a <hi>Major</hi> of direct
Law, and so will follow a true Conclusion; though common Law be
a Mystery, and your interpretation be not understood, yet by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Logick and common sense, it will be false. And as they are
Iudges and divided into Benches, so they must confer, debate, not
single opinions, <hi>per emendata suffragia;</hi> and thus in generall to
their Office.</p>
                     <p>And as to their Limits.</p>
                     <p>First, Not to incroach upon Prerogatives of the Crown, deal not
in difficult questions ere you consult with the King and Council, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
is to wound the King through the sides of a Private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and herein commends some of the Iudges, that of late rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and blunted the sharp edge, and vain popular honour of some
Pleaders at the Bar for meddling therein. The mystery of the Kings
power is not lawful to be disputed, which seems to wade into the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sovereigns; diminishes the mystical reverence of them that
sit in the Throne of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, One Iudicature not to invade upon others, unsit and
unlawful, and herein he inlarges himself. That besides Common-Law
there are Courts of Requests, Admiralty, President and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the North. High Commission, and every Bishops
Court. These shall keep their limits and bounds, so the common Law
shall not encroach upon them, nor they on that.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> four Courts; Two Civil, <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi>
and <hi>Exchequer;</hi> Two Criminal, <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi>
The <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> is a Branch of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi>
being first in one Court, and after the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
it was so called, as <hi>Pleas</hi> of private men. The other, the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi>
for the Kings Revenue, the principal institution thereof,
and their chief study; and as other things come orderly thither so to
administer justice.</p>
                     <p>Keep you within compass, give me my right of private Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
I shall acquiesce; as for the Prerogative of the Crown, it is
not for a Lawyers tongue, nor lawful to be disputed. It is Atheism to
dispute what God can do, his revealed Will ought to content us, so
is it contempt in a subject to dispute what a King can, or cannot do;
the Law is his revealed Will.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Kings Bench</hi> is the principal Court for Criminal causes, and
in some respects it deals with Civil causes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chancery,</hi> a Court of Equity, and deals likewise in <hi>Civil.</hi>
The Dispenser of the Kings Conscience, following the intention of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:60657:241"/>
Law and Iustice, not altering Law, nor <hi>e converso;</hi> It exceeds
all Courts, mixing Mercy with Iustice. Other Courts are onely for
Law: and where the strictness of Law might undo a subject, there
the Chancery tempers it with Equity, and preserves men from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chancery</hi> is undependent of any other Court; only under the
King <hi>Teste me ipso;</hi> from which no appeal, yet am I bound, so to
maintain others, as this, not to suffer wrong.</p>
                     <p>My Chancelour that now is, I found him Keeper of the Seal, the
same in substance with the other stile. He is witness, my warrant was
to him, to go on according to Presidents in time of best Kings, and
most learned <hi>Chancellours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The duty of Iudges is, to punish such as deprave the Kings Courts,
and therfore it was an inept Speech <hi>in Westminster-Hall,</hi> to say, that
a <hi>Praemunire</hi> lay against the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> yet it should not be
boundless, the King is to correct it, and none else, and therefore
the King was abused in that attempt, and now commands that none
presume to sue a <hi>praemunire</hi> against it.</p>
                     <p>As all inundations are conceived Prodigious by Astrologers, so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowings
of the banks of Iurisdiction is inconvenient and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
to the State; Let there be a concordance and musical accord
amongst you; keep to your Presidents, authentick, not controverted,
but approved by common usage of best Kings, and most learned
Iudges.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Star-Chamber Court,</hi> hath been shaken of late, and last
year had received a blow, if not prevented by a few voices. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scants

<hi>Bishops;</hi> to give Greatness and Honour to the Court; the other of
Learning in Divinity, and the interest of the good Government of
the Church. So divine and humane Laws, Experience and practice
in Government, are conjoined in the proceedings of this <hi>Court.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No Kingdom without a Court of Equity, either by it self, as in
<hi>England,</hi> or mixed in their Office that are Iudges of the Law, as
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and here in <hi>England</hi> where the Law determines not
cleerly, there the <hi>Chancery</hi> does, having equity, which belongs to
no other <hi>Court;</hi> punishing Attempts, other <hi>Courts</hi> only facts, and
where the Law punishes facts lightly, as in Riots or Combates, the
<hi>Star Chamber</hi> punishes in a higher degree, as in <hi>Combinations,
Practises, Conspiracies:</hi> so being instituted for good, give it the
more honour.</p>
                     <p>Keep your <hi>Courts</hi> in harmony; Iudges are Brethren, the <hi>Courts</hi>
Sisters, the Muses: to differ breeds contempt to either, and disputes
against each other, turns pleas from <hi>Court</hi> to <hi>Court</hi> in circular

                     <p>To the Auditory he hath but little to say; As he hath confirmed

from you expect <hi>Lex Talionis;</hi> to accuse an upright Iudge deserves
double punishment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In your Pleas, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or honour: if you do, the Iudges will punish you; if they do
not, I will them and you. Plead not new <hi>Puritanical</hi> strains; to
make all things popular, keep the antient limits of pleas.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, change not your <hi>Courts,</hi> as if to mistrust the justness of
your cause, but submit where you begin. So he sums up all; The
charge to his Self, Iudges, and Auditory; his excuse why he came
not till now; why now.</p>
                     <p>And because of his custome to deliver a charge to the Iudges of
circuits; He tells them now also, As they are Iudges with him in
that <hi>Court,</hi> so Iudges under him and his Substitutes in circuits;
Itinerant to his people; a laudable custome to go to the people in their
<hi>Counties,</hi> as they come up to them at <hi>Westminster-Hall.</hi> That
you go to punish, as to prevent offences; charge the Iustices of peace
their duties, take an accompt of them, and report their Services
to the King, for the King hath two offices, 1. To direct; 2. To
take an accompt from them to his <hi>Chancellour</hi> in writing, and
so to him.</p>
                     <p>Of these two parts, the <hi>Nisi prius</hi> is profit for them, and the other
necessary for him, therefore as <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>Hoc agite,</hi> yet <hi>&amp; illud
non omittite,</hi> and commends the office of Iustice of peace of high
honour and repute.</p>
                     <p>They are of two sorts, good and bad; the good he will reward and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:60657:242"/>
prefer, being as capable of his favour, as any about him whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
the farther off in distance of place, the more desert, and his
providence must reach to the end of his limits; the good are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious;
the bad idle; contemplative Iustices are of no use. And for
the number, <hi>as many hands make light work,</hi> so too many make
slight work.</p>
                     <p>As to the charge, he will but repeat what he hath said heretofore,
<hi>Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit,</hi> anent Recusants
and Papists, my greef when they increase; there are three sorts of
Recusants.</p>
                     <p>The first, such as will not be themselves, but their wives and
families shall be, and they shall appear at <hi>Church</hi> sometimes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
by Law, or for fashion; these are formal to the Law, and false
to God.</p>
                     <p>The second sort are Recusants whose consciences are misled, and
therefore refuse the Church, otherwise peaceable subjects.</p>
                     <p>The third are practising Recusants; they will force all persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their power, and infect others, to be as they are Recusants;
these are men of Pride and Presumption.</p>
                     <p>His opinion can bear with the person of a Papist so born and bred,
but an apostate Papist h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hates, such deserve severe punishment.</p>
                     <p>He is loth to hang a Priest for Religion and saying Mass, but if he
refuse the Oath of Allegiance, which is meerly Civil, he leaves
them to the Law, against whom it is no persecution, but Iustice;
and the like against those Priests that return from banishment; such
also as break Prison; they can be no Martyrs that refuse to suffer for
their conscience; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not go forth, when the doors
were open, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> came not out, till led by the Angell of
God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then he concludes</hi> with the Ordinary charge against the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and also the extreme resort of the Gentry to the City; bids them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
the religious Clergy against all Papists and Puritans, and
God and the King will reward their service.</p>
                     <p>Let us remind <hi>Scotland,</hi> It was eight years since the <hi>Marquess</hi>

to time of his conformity and reconcilement; but increasing
insolencies was lately committed, and as soon inlarged by the
Chancelour; underhand favouring too much the Papists. The
Church complain hereof to the King, the Marquess posts to
<hi>England</hi> to palliate his displeasure, but a Messenger meets him
at <hi>Huntington</hi> with command to return him home to Justice.
Yet here he staies, until he receives new authority to appear at
Court, where he humbly submits and offers to communicate;
But being contrary to the Canons before absolution, a great
debate followed, how to hazard him to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
                        <pb n="445" facs="tcp:60657:242"/>
lest by the way, he should recant, and indeed, the <hi>King</hi> evermore
endeavouring to rectifie his <hi>conscience,</hi> and to recover him to be a
<hi>Proselyte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The adventure was thus pieced, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Catnes</hi> now at
<hi>Court,</hi> must consent in the name of the <hi>Scots</hi> Kirk, for the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to absolve him, and the Form new devised
so to do, in respect of the correspondency of that <hi>Church</hi> with
<hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Church hears of this, and interprets that Act as an
usurpation upon their <hi>Rites,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> is fain to excuse in a
long Letter to satisfie that curiosity; and lest he should seem to
take upon him to palliate so great a presumption of himself one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> also gave his <hi>Reasons</hi> in writing, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching
upon the independencies of so free, absolute, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

now convened at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> for their <hi>confirmation</hi> and his <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> which was solemnly performed.</p>
                     <p>And because it was about the end of the General <hi>Assembly,</hi>
we shall shut it up with inserting such <hi>Articles</hi> as may enlighten
the Reader to the knowledg of the Kings elaborate care and
wisdom, in reducing perverse Jurisdiction to this moderate issue,
in conformity to the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by
which we may conclude the evident signs and hopes of a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
in time from their peevish Hierarchy, which had been
prosecuted in some measure, from the very time that this King
took Government to himself, and brought it before his death to
a semblable conformity with <hi>England,</hi> and might so have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered
to perfection, had not their and our sins since set a period
to us both.</p>
                     <p>1. That for more reverence of the holy Communion, the same
should be celebrated Kneeling, which always had been standing.</p>
                     <p>2. Not to be denied the Patient desperate sick in his Bed with
three or four of religious conversation to communicate with him.</p>
                     <p>3. The Sacrament of Baptism not to be longer deferred, than the
next Sunday after the Birth, and in necessity, in a private house
by the Minister, and publication thereof the next Sunday in the
Church.</p>
                     <p>4. That the inestimable benefits received from God, by our Lord
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> his Birth, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Holy Ghost, having been commendably remembred at
certain days and times by the whole Church of the world; every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
upon these days should therefore commemorate the said benefits
upon those set days, and to make choice of several pertinent Texts of
Scripture to frame his Doctrine and Exhortations thereto.</p>
                     <p>And because Confirmation after Baptism stuck in their stomachs,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:60657:243"/>
and indeed the King was unsatisfied therein, terming it a meer
Hotch-potch, and not clear to his apprehension. But yet thus much
was concluded, That seeing the Act of Confirmation of Children is
for their good Education most necessary, being reduced to the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
integrity, the Minister shall catechize them after eight years old,
to rehearse the Lords Prayer, the Belief and ten Commandments,
with Answers to Questions in the small Catechism used in the
Church. And that the Bishop in their Visitations shall bless them
with Prayer for their increase of Grace and continuance of Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
gifts with them.</p>
                     <p>So much was done indeed, and presented humbly to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
with some Reasons, why the same being novel to them,
were not as yet inserted with the <hi>Canons,</hi> which the King did not
then otherwise press, as resolving to effect his desire, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
personally into that Kingdom, when his presence should sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
with Reasons all scrupulous aversion.</p>
                     <p>About this time happened that difference in the Family of
Sir <hi>Thomas Lake,</hi> one of the Secretaries of State, between his
Wife and Daughter, and the Countess of <hi>Exeter,</hi> which invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him and his into ruine.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Lake</hi> was a learned Gentleman,<note place="margin">Sir Th: Lake hisstory.</note> brought up under Sir <hi>Fr:
Walsingham,</hi> (that subtil Secretary of State) as <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to
him. And after good experience of his deserts, was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and read to her <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi>
in which Tongues, she would say, that he surpassed her Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and was so imployed all her time, for he was reading (as to
quiet her spirits) when the Countess of <hi>Warwick</hi> told him, that
the Queen was departed.</p>
                     <p>But not long before she received him Clerk of her <hi>Signet.</hi>
And he was chosen by this State, in that Place, to attend King
<hi>Iames,</hi> from <hi>Berwick.</hi> And so sufficient he was, that the King
made use of his present service, in some <hi>French</hi> dispatches by the
way that he came hither; which indeed Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to resent, as too much trenching on his Office.</p>
                     <p>And therefore craveed leave of the King, that he might not
attend, beyond his Moneth, to prejudice the other Clerks, which
was excused, and he kept still at Court.</p>
                     <p>These sufficiencies of his, enabled him in these times of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with much repute and direct honesty to purchace large pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.</p>
                     <p>And now the place of Secretary was joyned in two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals,
Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> and him, and so he continued with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
esteem untill malice and revenge, two violent passions
over-ruling the weaker sex, concerning his Wife and Daughter,
involved him into their quarrel, the chief and onely cause of
his ruine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="447" facs="tcp:60657:243"/>He had by his Wife Sons and Daughters; his eldest married
unto Baron <hi>Rosse</hi> (in right of a Grand-mother) the Son of <hi>Thomas</hi>
Earl of <hi>Exeter,</hi> by a former venter; this <hi>Baron</hi> therefore and
upon <hi>Lake</hi>'s credit, was sent <hi>Ambassadour Extraordinary</hi> into
<hi>Spain, Anno 1611.</hi> in a very gallant equipage, with hopes of his
own to continue <hi>Lieger,</hi> to save charges of transmitting any
other.</p>
                     <p>In his absence, here fell out a a deadly feud, ('tis no matter for
what) between the Lady <hi>Lake</hi> and her Daughters Step-mother
the Countess of <hi>Exeter,</hi> which was particularly described in a
Letter, and sent from <hi>England</hi> to me at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of my near relations in that Ambassie, I shewed the same
to my <hi>Lord Ambassadour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A youthfull Widow this Countess had been and virtuous,
the relict of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Clerk of the <hi>Council,</hi> and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and so she became Bed-fellow to this
aged, gouty, diseased, but noble <hi>Earl,</hi> and that preferment had
made her subject to envy and malice.</p>
                     <p>Home comes the Lord <hi>Rosse</hi> from his Ambassie, when he fell
into some neglect of his Wife and her kindred, upon refusing to
increase allowance to her senttlement of Jointure, which was
promised to be compleated at his Return.</p>
                     <p>Not long he stays in <hi>England,</hi> but away he gets into <hi>Italy,</hi>
turn'd a professed <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> being cozened into that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
here by his publick confident <hi>Gondamore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this his last absence, never to return, the Mother and
Daughter accuse the <hi>Countess</hi> of former incontinency with the
Lord <hi>Rosse,</hi> whilest he was here, and that therefore upon his
Wifes discovery, he was fled from hence and from her Marriage-bed,
with other devised Calumnies, by several Designs and
Contrivement, to have impoysoned the Mother and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>This quarrel blazened at <hi>Court,</hi> to the Kings ear, who as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
as could be, singly examines each party. The <hi>Countess</hi>
with tears and imprecations professes her innocency; which to
oppose, the Mother and Daughter counterfeit her hand to a
whole sheet of paper; wherein they make her with much
contrition to acknowledg her self guilty, craves pardon for
attempting to impoyson them, and desires friendship for ever
with them all.</p>
                     <p>The King gets fight of this, as in favour to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the time, place, and occasion, when this should be writ?
They tell him, <hi>that all the parties met in a Visit at</hi> Wimbleton,
(the Earl of <hi>Exeter</hi>'s house) <hi>where in dispute of their differences
she confessed her guilt, desirous of absolution and friendship, consents
to set down all under her own hand, which presently she writ at the</hi>

                     <p>But now they being gone, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> the King forthwith
sends Master <hi>Dendy</hi> (one of his <hi>Serjeants</hi> at <hi>Arms,</hi> sometime a

false and scandalous, and confirm it by receiving their <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi>
in assurance of her honour and his innocency.</p>
                     <p>Besides several Letters of her hand, compared with this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
concluded it counterfeit.</p>
                     <p>Then the King tells the Mother and Daughter, that this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
being denied by her, their <hi>testimonies</hi> as <hi>parties</hi> would not
prevail, without additional witness.</p>
                     <p>They then adjoyn one <hi>Sarah Wharton</hi> their Chamberess, who
they affirm, stood behinde the <hi>Hangings,</hi> at the entrance of the
Room, and heard the <hi>Countess</hi> reade over what she had writ.
And to this she swears before the King.</p>
                     <p>But after a <hi>Hunting</hi> at <hi>New Park,</hi> the King entertained at
<hi>Wimbleton,</hi> and in that Room, he observes the great distance
from the <hi>Window</hi> to the lower end, and placing himself behinde
the <hi>Hanging,</hi> (and so other Lords in turn) they could not hear a
loud voice from the <hi>Window;</hi> besides the <hi>Hangings</hi> wanted two
foot of the ground, and might discover the <hi>Woman</hi> if hidden
behinde. The King saying, <hi>Oaths cannot deceive my sight.</hi> And
the <hi>Hangings</hi> had not been removed that Room in thirty years
before.</p>
                     <p>Nay, more than all these, the Mother and Daughter counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
a <hi>Confession</hi> in writing of one <hi>Luke Hotton,</hi> that for fourty
pounds the <hi>Countess</hi> should hire him to poyson them, which
man, with wonderfull providence was found out, and privately
denies it to the King.</p>
                     <p>And thus prepared, the King sends for <hi>Lake,</hi> whom in truth
he valued, tells him the danger to imbarque himself in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
advising him to leave them to the Law, (being ready for a
<hi>Star-chamber</hi> business.)</p>
                     <p>He humbly thanked his Majesty, but <hi>could not refuse to be a

which our <hi>Historian</hi> (with his <hi>Pasquil</hi> observations) [spends in <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Riot.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>But it was indeed, by his presence, to warm those cold

powers of some Officers in trust; to give grace to the humble,
and content to all.</p>
                     <p>And forthwith a <hi>Proclamation</hi> was advised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
there published, of the Kings <hi>Solomon-</hi> like instinct, <hi>to visit that

                     </p>
                     <p>These directions were accompanied with others of <hi>State,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The King was angry at their ignorance, and sent them word
to distinguish <hi>betwixt Pictures intended for Ornament and Decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

with all the expressions of cost and glory, that ever that
poor Nation had been put unto, that some effects might seem to

                     <p>

and since, for placing Iustices and Constables, to preserve the

by the small regard shewed unto them from others of higher rank.
But as he would have them know, such Officers to be of honourable

Indeed the Countrey affords more of</hi> Stone <hi>than</hi> Tile-shard.</p>
                     <p>They come to vote Commissioners upon the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
whom the King commends, they refuse; and evermore
<hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>State</hi> are suspected partial for the King, and therefore

                     </p>

                        <hi>That what soever should be

should be an Ecclesiastical Law.</hi> Not that the King was against the

to the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, against that <hi>Article,</hi> and therein if remedy be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
they shall be forced to other effects, <hi>For freedom of their
Church, and discharge of their Consciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their <hi>Reasons</hi> they reduce into <hi>Arguments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Their Reformation, That the purity in Doctrine, Sacraments,
Discipline and Order thereof, hath been acknowledged rather as a
Patern to be followed by all Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> than now
to be put to seek it from such as never attained to it.</p>
                     <p>2. That their General Assemblies formerly established to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and make Canons will be utterly overthrown.</p>
                     <p>That hitherto their Church, nearest the divine and Apostolical
Institution, and so hath lived long without Schism and rent, may
now by introducing Novelties be miserably overthrown.</p>
                     <p>That his Majesties gracious assurance by his Letters this last Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>against all alteration of Religion,</hi> and so hath been intimated in
Pulpits, when Rumours were dispersed of intended conformity with
<hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="453" facs="tcp:60657:246"/>These they pray may be sufficient to warn the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not to oppress their poor Church, and give grief to millions of
men, that otherwise would rejoice at his Majesties presence. And so
they resolve, that rather than submit, they are prepared to incur cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and to oppose.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Protestation</hi> they commit to the most mad-headed man
amongst them, one <hi>Hewet;</hi> but some of the wiser sort, fearing
the success, desire the Arch-bishop of <hi>St: Andrews</hi> to suppress it.</p>
                     <p>He meeting <hi>Hewet,</hi> desires to peruse it, and blaming the man,
keeps the <hi>Writing,</hi> the other seizes the <hi>Paper,</hi> and thus striving
in the next Room, the King hastily comes out, and sternly fronts
the Fellow, who falls down of his knees, and craves pardon for
the <hi>Protestation,</hi> professing never more to meddle therein.</p>
                     <p>However, the King wisely suspecting some others of the
same Phrensie, for the present commanded that <hi>Article</hi> of the
Kings Crown-prerogative not to be read, till the policy of a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time; the rest of them being read and concluded, the King
takes his leave and loving farewell.</p>
                     <p>But the Bishops had warning to summon some principal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and with them to meet him at <hi>St. Andrews, 10.</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi>

for private use of both <hi>Sacraments;</hi> a third, for reverend ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the <hi>Communion;</hi> and a fourth, for catechising
and confirming children by Bishops. I was answered, that they had
not been moved in any of the Churches Assembly, and so I was si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
And lately desiring but my Prerogative to be declared, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Ecclesiastical Laws, ye mutined, and protested against me. But
I pass all, amongst many other wrongs frequent from you.</p>
                     <p>The Errand I have now, is to know your Arguments, why the same
ought not to be granted? Reason shall ever guide me; and if my
Demands are so, just, and religious too, I will not be refused nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.
<hi>And with that browing upon them with a full eye, maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
and stern, They all fell down on their knees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The King went on,</hi> It is a power innate, a princely special Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,

<hi>I,</hi> says the King, <hi>but what assurance have I of their consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
They protested, that they saw no reason to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>But if it be otherwise, and your reason now, be none of theirs then,

                     <p>They craved the Arch-bishop of <hi>St: Andrews</hi> to answer for

not court-like, and therefore injoying perhaps the greater
greatness, <hi>self-fruition;</hi> yet in time he had preferment to the
Government of <hi>Ulster</hi> Province in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The other Sons
were three, and in order of Birth, but not in Preferment, <hi>Iohn</hi>
was Viscount <hi>Purbech, George</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>

Travels,<note place="margin">Court &amp; Ch. K. James,</note> and sought his Preferment in Marriage with any body,
but mist of a Match for want of an hundred Marks] and so
pieces him for the Court, (like the story of <hi>Demetas Caparisons)</hi>
borrowing of each one by piece-meal, to put him forward for
the Kings Favourite.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is thus, His Mother a Widow, was afterwards
married unto Sir <hi>Thomas Compton,</hi> whose Brother the Lord
<hi>Compton</hi> by chance falling upon a wonderfull Match for match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
wealth with the Daughter and Heir of Sir <hi>Iohn Spencer,</hi>
Alderman of <hi>London,</hi> and her Father then lately dead, this Lord
was Master of all, which was of more than credible, and so
might be enabled bountifully to set up a <hi>Kinsman,</hi> without
[<hi>other help or Alms of the Parish.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>It was plotted long before, and <hi>Villiers</hi> sent for, to the same
purpose, by practice of some <hi>English</hi> Lords, to ballance with the
<hi>Scots,</hi> who by the help of the last Favourite <hi>Somerset,</hi> and others
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:60657:248"/>
of great affection with the King, had the better of the poor
<hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There had been a private Intertainment of a Supper at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi>
Castle by the family of <hi>Herbert, Hertford</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> and
some others; by the way in <hi>Fleet street,</hi> hung out <hi>Somersets</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
at a Painters stall; which one of the Lords envying bad
his foot-boy fling dirt on the face, which he did; and gave me
occasion to ask my companion, upon what score that was done?
He told me, this meeting would discover. And truly I waited
neer and opportune, and so was acquainted with the Design, to
bring in <hi>Villiers,</hi> who was entred before.</p>
                     <p>He had need to be well backed, against enough that envyed
his neerness, and aimed by any affront to discountenance him,
until he made them know that his courage over mastered his
sweetness. For having bought the place of Cup-bearer to the
King, and taking the upper end of the Board at dinner before
some other Waiter, which not his due, was told of it, and so
removed; nor was it done with overmuch kindness; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the other was <hi>Somersets</hi> creature, who urging a second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civility,
<hi>Villiers</hi> gave him a Box on the Ear. For which the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of Court condemned him to have his hand cut off. And
which <hi>Somerset,</hi> as then Chamberlain, ought to prosecute the
Execution, which he did. And here the Kings pardon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any satisfaction to the other party, made him suspected, a
<hi>budding Favourite.</hi> Who was indeed raised, with, or by <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets</hi>
ruine, so drew envy, from him as his competitor, and from
others his Friends compartners in his fall, being then as one cast
out of the passions of the King.</p>
                     <p>We shall find him come up degrees, and to stand firm in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to the death of this King, and his second Master till his
assassination.</p>
                     <p>The King minding to shew his own power to raise him from
nothing, and his will to advance him for nothing, the others
study therefore was the Kings inclination, and so to leave on
him, whose affection was sufficient to hold up his head. He
waited hard and close, his first years rising; but having remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all the whole Line of <hi>Somersets</hi> lincks, (his Wives interests
the <hi>Howards)</hi> being boldly fixed in his Masters favor; he would
adventure to take leave, but not too long, to be absent. And
so by degrees inured the King from his custome of overtyring
his Favourites, and at last, fortifies himself, by raising out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
if in case of assault; His own mariage with an heir, the
daughter of the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> rich and Honourable, twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        </gap>olemnizing of Divine service, the Servants and Workmen,
were not usual to discompany from their accustomed moderate
Pastimes; such as the most rigid (heretofore) could not justly
but admit.</p>
                     <p>The King, not so over-affected to his own sports, that the
sense of the peoples sufferings, might take advantage by his
Example, and so of Liberty in the like (for much of his most
serious affairs, were shadowed from the vulgar, nay from the
observing Politicque, by his own publick Pastimes.)</p>
                     <p>But in truth it came to be a business of consequence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how the intemperate zeal of our then rigid Reformers,
(to countenance their own design of deforming) strook at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

of the <hi>Holy seventh day,</hi> called then, as of old, <hi>Sunday,</hi> which
they would have named <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and thereafter would have it

                     <p>This being discussed in some Counties, the people forbore
their Recreations. Then the Reformers took the like exceptions
against the peoples lawful pleasures on Saints and Holy-daies,
and at last against all sports and publick Pastimes, exercises in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and harmless, such were Leaping, Dancing, Running,
or any Mastery for the Gaol or Prize, May-pole, or Church-ale,
as debauched Idols.</p>
                     <p>In some of these Pastimes several Counties excelled, and to
entertain community with their Mirth, the Court Progresses,
took delight to judge of their wagers, in their journey to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which the people observing, took occasion to themselves
to petition the King in his return for freedome, and leave to be

                     <p>And thus by this means, this Mans [<hi>Monstrum Horrendum;</hi>

                     <p>He confessed, <hi>That he had been often solicited from thence, and

                     <p>Much he said of these as to the publick, and of more things
as to private, which he did not deny, but traversed.</p>
                     <p>So then there were other businesses of a second charge, and
confederacy, which made him lyable to a new Tryal; for <hi>Treason</hi>
is so comprehensible, as to take in even circumstances, and out
of them to make such conclusions as the jealousie of State
shall interprete either for safety or Revenge.</p>
                     <p>But the prudence of the King would not hazard more, having
sufficient upon the old score; and because he could not in Law
be judicially called to accompt for his last actions, his former

(or wickedness) of the event. For the truth is, the design
though hatcht in a corner, was published on the house top, to

                     <p>He had been blessed with ample possessions and fruitful issue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
only in a younger son, who taking liberty from his Fathers
bounty, and with a crew of like condition, that wearied on Land,
they went roving to Sea, and in a small Vessel Southward, took boot
from all whom they could Master, and so increasing force and wealth,
ventured on a <hi>Turks</hi> Man in the <hi>Streights;</hi> but by mischance their

swimming, got shore upon <hi>Rhodes,</hi> with the best of his Iewels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him; where offering some to sale to a <hi>Iew,</hi> who knew them to
be the Governours of <hi>Algier,</hi> he was apprehended, and as a Pyrate
sentenced to the Gallies among other Christians, whose miserable sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
made them all studious of freedom, and with wit and valour
took opportunity and means to murther some Officers, got aboard of
an English Ship, and came safe to London; where his Misery and
some skill made him Servant to a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> and sudden preferment
to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> There, by this means he got money, with which
returning back, he designed himself for his Native County <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall.</hi>
And in a small Ship from <hi>London,</hi> sayling to the West was
cast away upon that coast. But his excellent skill in swimming, and
former fate too boot, brought him safe to shore; where since his fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years absence, His Fathers former fortunes much decayed, now
retired him, not far off to a Countrey habitation in Debt, and
Danger.</p>
                     <p>His Sister, he finds married to a <hi>Mercer,</hi> a meaner Match than
her Birth promised. To her at first he appears a poor Stranger, but
in private reveals himself, and with all what Iewells and Gold
he had concealed in a Bow-case about him. And concluded that the
next day he intended to appear to his Parents, and to keep his disguise
till she and her Husband should meet, and make their common joy
compleat.</p>
                     <p>Being come to his Parents, his humble behaviour, suitable to his
Suit of Cloths, melted the old couple to so much compassion, as to give
him covering from the cold season, under their outward Roof, and
by degrees, his travelling Tales told witn passion to the aged people
made him their Guest, so long by the Kitchen fire, that the Husband
took leave and went to bed. And soon after his true Stories work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compassion in the Weaker Vessel, she wept and so did he; But
compassionate of her tears, he comforted her with a piece of Gold,
which gave assurance that he deserved a Lodging, to which she
brought him; and being in Bed shewed her his Girdled wealth, which
he said was sufficient to relieve her husbands wants, and to spare
for himself, and being very weary, fell fast asleep.</p>

the last night; the Parents slightly denyed to have seen any such,
untill she told them that he was her Brother, her lost Brother; by
that assured scar upon his Arm cut with a Sword in his youth she
knew him, and were all resolved this morning to meet there and

                     <p>Peace and Plenty with them bred up these Schisms into as
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:60657:253"/>
many factions, the old way to work designs and changes in
State, both of the <hi>Gown</hi> and of the <hi>Sword.</hi> The one mightily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
by the wisdom of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> the other commanded by the

                        <note place="margin">The Prince of Orange his Opposite.</note> This <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> was worthily
descended, and well-bred; his travels abroad and Counsels at
home, which his great age 70 years, gave time to ripen for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
advice in the Magistracy and Council in the Army im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by five Embassies abroad, and thirty two Leaguers
at home.</p>
                     <p>And it is counsel to some, whether conscience or ambition
over-ruled his last actions; but he made himself Head of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which got the name of <hi>Arminians;</hi> a common custom
with Opposers, to colour their own designs by laying infamy,
or at least scandal upon their Adversaries; and this did the
Prince do to destroy <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> for envy and fear. The other
finding the pulse of the people to beat in a high feaver of that
disease, was forced for the present to tack on that side, where
he was sure to have hearts and hands to keep him up, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
state, otherwise to be overwhelmed in the deluge of
Destruction.</p>
                     <p>Thus in some condition to balance the Prince with assistance
of several the <hi>Provincial States,</hi> of his opinion and jealousie;
that if the power of the <hi>Prince, Generalissimo</hi> of their <hi>Armies,</hi>
were not limitted, his greatness would ere long increase without
coutroul. And therefore by way of Counsel (for pretended
good of the Common-wealth) they did Confederate to leavy
new companies, far from view or suspition of the Prince, whom
<hi>Barnevelt</hi> kept close to business of the publick Council, with the
States General; And so was it not discovered untill <hi>Midsomer,</hi>
But then perfectly understood. The Prince in secret with his
Kinsman Count <hi>Ernest,</hi> and the best of his Confidents, leaves
the Court at <hi>Hague,</hi> gives Intelligence of his Design to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
Ogle</hi> Commander of the Garrison at <hi>Utrecht</hi> (the place of
the others greatest strength) who on the sudden receives them
in, surprize the Town and that State, in close Council. And
at hand had the Garrisons of <hi>Arnhem,</hi> and others to master that
part, and so other places of force, whom he suspected had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with <hi>Barnevelts</hi> faction.</p>
                     <p>The snccess of this sudden expedition gave such authority to
the Prince. that being returned in Martial manner, he seized
<hi>Barnevelt, Grotius, Hogenbert,</hi> and other Confederates at
<hi>Hague,</hi> and committed them to prison, upon pretence of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
his power with the Army and interest with the States might
do this and more.</p>
                     <p>Not long after <hi>Lydenburgh,</hi> Governour of <hi>Utrecht</hi> imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

Yet <hi>Hogenbert</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> had sentence of miserable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Barnevelt</hi> had friends with the State, and a strong faction
with the people, and though his Sentence pronounced him to
the <hi>Scaffold,</hi> yet it lasted a long Dispute, ere they brought him
to the <hi>Block,</hi> which was not effected till <hi>May</hi> the next year. His
Sentence indeed made his Crimes capital, as Author and Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

for thirty seven years; even from 1618. until 1656. And not

promotes them as Signs and Causes, prognosticating some

not of the Ecclipse that fell then; for that might be foreseen of a

for they were created four daies after the light, to warm

fatal and unlucky. <hi>Naturale est magis nova, quam magna, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi>

drinking with any person, from the Marriage-bed, from wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

of the offence, for thirty days or more: he may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at <hi>divine Service,</hi> to teach or to learn others: if impenitent,
his punishment was increased, doubling or trebling the <hi>Sentence</hi>
for time, or to his death. His male-children were not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And if he died unrepentant, a stone was cast upon his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin,
as deserving to be stoned: and was buried without lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ceremony, and not in common Burial.</p>
                     <p>The second was called <hi>Cherem, A giving over to Satan, 1 Cor.
5. 5.</hi> It differed from the first degree, because it was not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
in a private Court, but in the whole Church, and Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
and Curses added out of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> At the
publishing Candles were lighted, and when the Curses were

call in more then Christian aid, to the effusion of much bloud.
And professed that no Prince of the Empire, should exceed his

                     <p>The times when these Negotiations set forward, were usuall

were resident upon the Confines and Borders of the <hi>Welch,</hi>

besides a pension of one thousand pound <hi>per annum</hi> during his

the <hi>Lower House,</hi> in their proceedings. And always the like
from the Lords, especially by relation of his son, of them all in
general and particular; and the like (he said) by One that sits
there, <hi>Buckingham,</hi> a proof whereof the <hi>Earl of Arundel</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
in his report to them, of the privileges of <hi>Nobility,</hi> how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
he was therein.</p>
                     <p>Acknowledges the free gift of this <hi>Parliament</hi> of two <hi>Subsidies,</hi>
and so accepted by him, which he will re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ribute by a <hi>General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
at the end of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and will do somewhat in ease of
the people till then.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Ale-Houses,</hi> he refers to the Iustices of Peace. For
the <hi>Gold and Silver Thread,</hi> he damm's the <hi>Patent,</hi> which may
serve for a <hi>Pardon</hi> to the Actors therein.</p>
                     <p>Another Bill against <hi>Informers,</hi> he desires may be put to an end,
for (he sayes) that heretofore he hath shewed in <hi>Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
his dislike of such people. And that <hi>Buckingham</hi> told him,
that since this <hi>Parliament,</hi> he was not haunted with such spirits, as
usually he had been vexed.</p>
                     <p>Tells them plainly, he is assured, That this external Government
for learned Iudges, and hopes honest administration of Iustice,
and with Peace and Plenty, yields to every one safety under his Vine
and Fig-tree; yet he understands his Subjects vexations by vile ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of Projects, Patents, Bills of Conformity, and such like,
which more exhaust the peoples purses than Subsidies.</p>
                     <p>Then he comes close to the Lords, the effect of his errand, He
advises them of their Iudgement; <hi>Agere bonum, &amp; bene bonum</hi>
is good proof before Iudgement. <hi>Bene</hi> is the formality and legality
to advise with the Iudges, so the ground good, the form orderly,
it will befit the Court of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The Sentence he observes in two parts; that which is worthy the
Iudging and censuring; And secondly, to proceed as against these
<hi>Delinquents,</hi> so against such like crimes. Complaints are of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
justly distinguish, innocent from guilt, and do it legally; for
Moral Reason supposes, breach of Laws, standing in force, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they punish by predestination.</p>
                     <p>And concludes, against his late Atturney General, Sir <hi>Henry
Yelverton</hi> Prisoner in the Tower, upon Sentence in <hi>Star-chamber.</hi>
That he being accused besides concerning a Warrant-<hi>dormant;</hi> he
freely delivers him over unto their Iudgement.</p>

Thus we see what the King sayes; But as in this Speech,<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> so
in all others of his, our Historian fails not to let in his conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
descant, not worth the Dispute, and excuses <hi>Yelverton,</hi> as
he does all Offenders against the King.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> was Atturney General, and by his place
of Imployment, it was his duty to mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against <hi>Somerset,</hi> or any Subject whatsoever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dispute, which yet he refused, as receiving that place by his
favour; for which contempt to the Kings service, not without
more than suspition of concealment of some passages concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Overburies</hi> death; he was for those reasons (and deservedly)
by the whole Court of <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> unanimously sentenced,
and so of course committed to the Tower, close Prisoner; where
we are to be perswaded also by the Pamphleter,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Lieutenant of the Tower</hi> Balfore,<note place="margin">Co. &amp; Ch. p. 156.</note> 
                        <hi>admits</hi> Buckingham <hi>to
treat with him in prison, and then to piece out a peace between them
both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certainly, <hi>Yelverton</hi> had law to teach him (or any other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
of Reason) that this was Treason in <hi>Balfore,</hi> and in <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
also to attempt. And therefore to cleer it, <hi>Balfore</hi>
himself hath since avowed to a Prisoner, sometime under his
Guard, that there was never any such act done by <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
or any other by his permission. But afterwards upon <hi>Yelvertons</hi>
humble submission for his former fault, and his innocency (in
some doubts) cleered from other suspitions, he was set at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And in truth according to the merit of the Man, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
intrusted with the judgement Seat.</p>
                     <p>But what was this secret information, which we are told he
should tell <hi>Buckingham?</hi> That which the King spake in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>viz. Not to spare any that was dearest, or lay in his bosome,</hi>
by which he pointed to you, saies <hi>Yelverton</hi> (meaning <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And must <hi>Buckingham</hi> adventure his and the Lieutenants
head to learn this news; which no doubt the Favourite heard
before, being at the Kings elboe.</p>
                     <p>And this discourse pretended by our Pamphleter betwixt

to all that I say I shall go on but with a very strange entrance,
as may seem to your Lordships at first; for in the midst of a State
of as great affection as I think a mortal man can endure honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above life I shall begin with the professing of gladness in some
things.</p>
                           <p>The first is that hereafter the greatnesss of a Iudge or Magistrate
shall be no sanctuary or protection to him against guiltiness, which is
the beginning of a golden work.</p>
                           <p>The next that after this example, it is like that Iudges will flie
from any thing in the likeness of corruption, without it were a great
distance, as from a Serpent which tends to the purging of the Courts
of Iustice and reducing them to their true honour and splendour.</p>
                           <p>And in these two points God is my witness I thought it be my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be the anvil upon which these two are broken and wrought, I
take no small comfort but to pass from the motions of my heart wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
God is my Iudge to the merits of my cause, whereof your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
are Iudges under God, and his Lieutenant; I do understand
there hath been expected from me some Iustification, and therefore I
have chosen one onely Iustification, instead of all others out of the
Iustifications of <hi>Job,</hi> for after the dear submission and confession,
which I shall now make unto your Lordships, I hope I may say, and
justify with <hi>Job,</hi> in these words, I have not hid my sin as did <hi>Adam,</hi>
nor consealed my faults, in my bosom; this is the only Iustification,
which I will use.</p>
                           <p>It resteth therefore that without Fig-leaves, I do ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
and acknowledge that having understood the particulars of the
charge not formerly from the house, but enough to inform my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and memory, I finde matter sufficient and full both to move me
to desert my defence, and to move your Lordships to condemn and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
me, neither will I trouble your Lordships by singling these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
to which I think I might fall off. <hi>Quid te exempla
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:60657:271"/>
juvant spinis de pluribus una?</hi> Neither will I promise your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
to observe upon the proofs where they come not home, or the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
touching the credits of the Witness; neither will I represent to
your Lordships, how for a defence I might in divers things extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the offence, in respect of the time and manner of the guilt, and
the like circumstances, but only leave these things to spring out of
your more noble thoughts and observations of the evidence and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
themselves, and charitably to wind about the particulars
of the charge, as God shall put into your minds, and so submit my
self wholly to your piety and grace.</p>
                           <p>And now I have spoken unto your Lordships as Iudges, I shall
say a few words unto you as Peers and Prelates, humbly commending
my cause to your noble minds and magnanimous affections.</p>
                           <p>Your Lordships are not simply Iudges, but Parliamentary Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
you have a further extent of arbitrary power than other Courts,
and you are not tyed by ordinary course of Courts or Presidents, in
points of Strickness, and severity, much less in points of mercy, and
yet if any thing which I shall move might be contrary to your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and worthy end, the entroducing a reformation, I should not
seek it, but herein I beseech your Lordships to give me leave to tell
you a story.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> took his Sons life for giving battail against the
prohibition of his General; not many years the like severity was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by <hi>Papinius Cursor</hi> the Dictator, against <hi>Quintus Maximus,</hi>
who being upon the point to be sentenced, was, by the intercession of
some particular person of the Senate, spared; whereupon <hi>Livie</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this grave and gratious observation, <hi>Neque minus formata
est disciplina militaris periculo</hi> Quinti Maximi <hi>quam miserabili,
supplicio</hi> Titi Manlii; The Discipline of War was no less establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by the questioning of <hi>Quintus Maximus,</hi> than by the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> and the same reason is in the reformation
of Iustice: for the questioning of men in eminent places hath the
same terror, though not the same rigor with the punishment. But my
cause staies not there, for my humble desire is, that his Majesty would
take the seal into his own hands, which is a great downfal, and may
serve, I hope, in it self for an expiation of my faults.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if mercy and mitigation be in your Lordships power and
no way cross your ends, why should not I hope of favour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration.
Your Lordships will be pleased to behold your chief pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
the King our Sovereign, a King of incomparable clemency,
and whose heart is inscruteable for wisdome and goodness. And your
Lordships will remember there sat not these hundred years before a
Prince in your House, and nevee such a Prince, whose presence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be made memoriable by Records and Acts, mixt with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Iustice. Your selves are either Nobles (and compassion ever
beateth in the veins of noble blood) or reverend Prelates, who are
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:60657:271"/>
the servants of him that would not break the brused Reed nor quench
the smoking flax. You all sit upon an high Stage, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be senseable of the changes of humane condition, and of the
fall of any from high place.</p>
                           <p>Neither will your Lordships forget, that there are <hi>Vitia Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
as well as <hi>Vitia Hominis;</hi> and the beginning of Reformation
hath the contrary power to the Pool of <hi>Bethesda;</hi> for that had
strength to cure him only that was first cast in, and this hath strength
to hurt him only that is first cast in, and for my part I wish it might
stay there and go no further.</p>
                           <p>Lastly, I assure my self your Lordships have a noble feeling of
me as a member of your own body, and one that in this very Session
had some taste of your loving affection, which I hope was not a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before the death of them, but rather a spark of that grace, which
now in the conclusion will more appear. And therefore my humble
sute to your Lordships is, That my penitent submission may be my
Sentence, the loss of my Seal, my punishment, and that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
will recommend me to his Majesties pardon for all that is past.
Gods holy Spirit be amongst you.</p>

all, procured pardon also from the King, with the loss only of
his Peerage and Seal; for so weak a husband he had been to lay

at the Kings last being there, and such a distance, might
deal some disadvantage to a Wiser Man. Yet the King at first
intending but to let him loose, only to exercise him with the
change of his chance, like as a rub to an overthrown Bowl,
which proves oftentimes an help to the Caster, by hindering its
course; but it fell out more fatal to him which lasted to the end,

of <hi>Scotland,</hi> within one hundred years space. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Arch-bishops and Bishops within three hundred years,
not only Chancelours, but Judges of the Law, Master of the
Robes, and other Offices of Judicature; By which means,
(their onely Bishopricks too poor) they advanced to degrees
of wealth, enabling them to erect most of those sumptuous

                     <p>So ran the Channel, till <hi>Bacons</hi> father had it from a Bishop,

                     <p>But at his entrance into this Trust, comes two Bills signed

                     <p>The first (though with some regret in those unseasonable
times to receive such large pensions), which yet he sealed, but
took upon him to trench upon the Lord Treasurer <hi>Middlesex,</hi>
(who willingly gave way to it) for which they both had enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     </p>
                     <p>The later he refused upon these Queries.</p>
                     <p>1. Whether in the Delivery of the Staff to the Earl, his
Majesty did not declare it to him for ease of the other Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
that executed it before with him, and so to imply no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of power, which this Patent doth?</p>
                     <p>2. Whether his Majesty means, that this Patent, leaping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the powers of the three last Earls, <hi>Essex, Shrewsbury,</hi> and
<hi>Somerset,</hi> should refer only to <hi>Arundels</hi> own Ancesters, <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>

by Inheritance? the usual way and reference of Patents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto the last, and immediate Predecessor, and not to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote;
whose powers heretofore in these troublesome times,
were vage, uncertain and impossible to be limitted.</p>
                     <p>3. Whether that this Lord, should bestow those Offices set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in the Crown, as Sir <hi>Edward Zouches</hi> in Court, Sir <hi>George
Reynolds</hi> in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and divers others, all which this
Great <hi>Patent</hi> sweeps away, being Places of Worth and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
                     <p>4. Whether my <hi>Lord Stewards</hi> place shall be (for all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Judicature is in the <hi>Verge)</hi> either altogether extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or at least subordinate to the <hi>Office?</hi> A point considerable
because of the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> who was Steward, his greatness
of Person, and neerness of blood to the King. And here he
claws him.</p>
                     <p>5. Lastly, whether that the Offices of the Earl <hi>Marshall</hi> of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:60657:273"/>
                        <hi>England,</hi> and the Marshall of the Kings house (in former times
distinct) shall be now united to this great Lord?</p>
                     <p>A power limitted by no Law or Record, but to be searched
out from <hi>Heralds, Chronicles, Antiquaries,</hi> and such absolute
<hi>Monuments;</hi> and thereupon this sixty years (for <hi>Essex</hi> his power
was cleerly limitted, only as <hi>Marshall)</hi> unfit to be revived by the
Policy of this State.</p>
                     <p>And by these queries the Patent was pared, which increased
malice to the end of their Days.</p>
                     <p>Certainly there is a difference between the Earl Marshal of
<hi>England,</hi> and the Marshal of the Kings House: See <hi>Lambert
Archiron,</hi> or of the High Courts of Justice in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Marshall of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Constable</hi> are united in a
Court, which handleth only Duells out of the Realm, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within, as <hi>Combats Blazon, Armory,</hi> but may not meddle
with any difference tryable by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                     <p>The Marshal of the Kings Houshold is united in a Court
with the Steward, which holds Plea of Trespass, Contracts
and Covenants made within the Verge; and that by the Laws,
<hi>Articl. super Cart. cap. 3, 4, 5.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The honour of Lord Marshal is so antient, as <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord
<hi>Mowbray</hi> by <hi>Richard 2.</hi> was created <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the first
Earl Marshal of <hi>England, anno 1397.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so successively unto <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Mowbray,</hi> who dyed the
15. of <hi>Edward 4. anno 1475.</hi> and had issue one only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
married unto <hi>Richard Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> second son of <hi>Edward</hi>
the fourth, and was by his Father created Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and
<hi>Earl Marshall</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> murthered in the Tower, <hi>anno 1483</hi>
without issue.</p>
                     <p>Then comes <hi>Iohn Howard</hi> (Son of the Daughter, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir
of <hi>Thomas Mowbray Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi>) and was by <hi>Richard
the third</hi> created <hi>Duke of Norfolk,</hi> but not <hi>Earl Marshall.</hi> Nor
was his Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> but <hi>Thomas</hi> his son was by <hi>H.</hi> 8. created
<hi>Earl Marshal</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards was <hi>Seymer</hi> by <hi>Edward the sixth</hi> created <hi>Duke of
Somerset,</hi> and <hi>Earl Marshal</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And after him came the
Grand-child of <hi>Thomas Mowbray,</hi> and was by Q. <hi>Mary</hi> created
<hi>Earl Marshal</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Robert Devereux</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> made <hi>Marshal</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
by Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now this <hi>Thomas Howard Earl</hi> of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and the last
Earl <hi>Marshall</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in time this Patent was divided, which his greatness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to swallow up whole.</p>
                     <p>And because we have done with the Keeper and his Office,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:60657:273"/>
we will take our leave of him with this Character which here
follows.</p>
                     <p>His Acts of Piety to the ragged and ruinous Church of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>

and Structures of the antient <hi>English</hi> Saints, and in truth

though he sucked not the Milk of <hi>Oxford</hi> University, yet he
founded a decent compleat Chappel to <hi>Lincoln</hi> College there,
and erected the <hi>Library</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as also that Eminent
Structure the Library of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he
had been Master for many years. He had a large heart to men of
learning and Arts, and though his Stately gait, at a blush might
present him to appear proud to the common Man, yet abating
the nature of his Birth-place a <hi>Welch man,</hi> he was not so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
for he made himself more familiar at the College
School at <hi>Westminster,</hi> than at Court, not leaving that socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Mr. <hi>Osbastons</hi> Company, for the consort of Courtiers at
<hi>Whitehall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His bounty like that of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who gave gifts like a
King, even to mean Beggars; witness a hundred pound gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
to <hi>Monsieur du Molin</hi> a Minister of <hi>France,</hi> to welcom him
hither, when, in the Judgement of his Chaplain 20 l. had been
sufficient.</p>
                     <p>His blaze at Court lasted out this King, which by quarreling
with <hi>Lawd</hi> the Arch-bishop afterwards, retired him to <hi>Bugden,</hi>
where he lived the most Episcopal of any Priests his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours;
how he fell from that, and other waies after, from worse
to worst of all, evil example being no rule to a Prelates consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
we leave him dead to his last account, the time of Gods
grace and mercy, 1652.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the factious party of this Parliament, were a knot

by Treaty to procure their peace and safety, shall not take that good
effect which is desired in Treaty (wherein they humbly beseech his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
not to suffer any longer delay) that then upon signification of his
Majesties pleasure in Parliament, they shall be ready to the utmost of
their powers, both with their Lives and Fortunes to assist him so, as
that by the Divine help of Almighty God (which is never wanting
unto those who in his fear shall undertake the Defence of his Cause)
he may be able to do that with his Sword, which by a peaceable course
shall not be effected.</p>
                     <p>This is well said, and the King put them to Tryal sor assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

settlement of the future effects by the Sword in case the other
failed.</p>
                     <p>And sundry overtures and propositions amongst themselves
somewhat resolving, then again declined, and as with the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the like between the King and them, that nothing was

                     <p>That the Emperours Letters addressed him to the Duke, wishing

signifie unto us, that we should have contentment herein, and that
there should be a Session, if we our Selves were not in fault, taking
now notice that we forbear to proceed with any Bills until the return
of the Messengers lately sent to his Majesty, hath warned me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the House in his name not to lose time in their proceedings,
for preparing good Laws in the mean while, and in consideration of

But some captious pates take exceptions, as tending to breach
of privilege, by commanding them to proceed with Bills, and
so spun out the time and did nothing till the return of their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,

knowing the effect of their former petitions, and observing the

                     <p>VVE must here begin in the same fashion that We
would have done if your first Petition had come to
our hands before we had made a stay thereof; which is to repeat
the first words of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
used by her in answer to an insolent Proposition which
a <hi>Polonian</hi> Ambassadour made, that is, <hi>Legatum expitamus,
Heraldum accipimus.</hi> For we had great reason to expect that the
first message from your house should have been a message of
thanksgiving for our continued gratious behaviour towards our
people since your last Recess. Not only by Our Proclamation
of Grace, wherein were contained six or seven and thirty Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
all of several points of Grace to the People; but also by
the labour we took for the satisfaction of both Houses in those
three Articles recommended unto us in both their Names by
the right Reverend Father in God. the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and likewise for the good Government of <hi>Ireland</hi> we are
now in hand with at your Request. But not only have we heard
no news of all this; but contrary great complaints of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Religion within this Kingdom, tacitly implying Our
ill Government in this point. And we leave you to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be your duties, that are the Representative Body of our
People, so to distaste them with our Government, whereas by
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pntrary it is your duty with all your endeavour, to kindle
more and more in duty for our gratious Government.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas in the very beginning of this your Apology,
you tax us in fair terms, of trusting uncertain Reports, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
informations against your proceedings. We wish you to
remember that We are an old and experienced King, needing
no such Lessons, being in Our Conscience, freest of any King
a live from hearing or trusting idle Repotts; Which so many
of your House that are neerest Us can bear witness unto you, if
you would give as good ear unto them as unto some Tribuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Orators amongst you; And for proof in this particular We
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:60657:277"/>
have made your own messengers confer your other Petitions
sent by you with the copy thereof, which was sent us before,
between which there is no difference at all, but that since the
receiving the first Copy, you added a Conclusion unto it;
which could not come to our hands till it was done by you, and
your messengers sent, which was all at one time. And if we
had had no Copy of it before-hand, we must have received your
first Petition to our great Dishonour, before we had known
what it contained, which would have inforced us to return unto
you a far worse Answer then now we do. For then your Messing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
had returnd with nothing, but that we have judged your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
unlawful &amp; unworthy of an Answer; for as to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
therof it is nothing but <hi>Protestatio contraria facto;</hi> for in
the body of your Petition, you usurp upon our Prerogative
Royal, and meddle with things far above your reach; and then
in the Conclusion you protest the contrary; as if a Robber
would take a mans purse, and then protest he meant not to rob
him. For first you presume to give us your advice concerning
the Match of Our deerest Son with some Protestant, we cannot
say Princess, for we know none of these fit for him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
Us from his Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> urging Us to a present
War with that King, and yet in the Conclusion, forsooth, you
professe you intend not to press upon our most undoubted and
Regal Prerogative, as if the petitioning of Us in matters that
your selves confess you ought not to meddle with, were not a
meddling with them.</p>
                     <p>And wheras you pretend that you were invited to this course
by the Speeches of three honourable Lords, yet by so much
as your selves repeat of the Speeches, nothing can be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but that we were resolved by War to regain the <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
if otherwise we could not attain unto it. And ye were invited to
advise forthwith upon a Supply for keeping the forces in the
<hi>Palatinate</hi> from disbanding, and to foresee the means for the
raising and maintaining of the Body of any Army for that War
against the Spring.</p>
                     <p>Now what inference can be made upon this? that presently
we must denounce War against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> break our
dearest Sons Match, and match him to one of our Religion, let
the World judge! The Difference is no greater than if we would
tell a Merchant that we had great need to borrow money from
him for raising an Army, that thereupon it should follow, that
we are bound to follow his advice in the Directions of the War,
and all things depending thereupon.</p>
                     <p>But yet not contenting your selves with this excuse of yours,
which indeed cannot hold water, ye come after to a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the Conclusion of your former Petition, saying,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:60657:277"/>
that the Honour and safety of Us and our Posterity, and the
Patrimony of our children, invaded and possessed by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the welfare of Religion and State of our Kingdome, are
matters at any time not unfit your deepest consideration in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                     <p>To this generality we answer with the <hi>Logicians,</hi> That where
all things are contained nothing is omitted. So as this <hi>Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie</hi>
of yours invests you upon all power upon Earth; lacking
nothing but the <hi>l'opes</hi> to have the Keys also both of Heaven and
Purgatory. And to this vast generality of yours, we can give no
other answer, for it would trouble all the Lawyers in the House,
to make a good Commentary upon it. For so did the <hi>Puritan</hi>
Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> bring all kind of Causes within compass
of their juris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iction, saying, that it was the Churches Office,
to judge of slander, and there could no crime or fault be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
but there was a slander in it, either against God, their
King, or their Neighbour, and by that means they looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselves the cognizance of all Causes; or like <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
Distinction of the Popes power over Kings in <hi>ordine ad spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
whereby he gives him all Temporall Jurisdiction over
them.</p>
                     <p>But to give you a direct answer to the matters of War, for
which you are so earnest; We confesse we rather expected you
should have given us thanks for the so long maintaining a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Peace in all our Dominions, when as all our Neighbours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
are in miserable combustion of War, but <hi>dulce bellum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expertis,</hi>
and we indeed find by experience, that a number of our
Subjects are so pampered with Peace, as they are desirous of
change, though they know not what.</p>
                     <p>It is true that we have professed (and in that mind with Gods
grace, we will both live and die) that we will labour by all
means possible; either by Treaty or force to restore our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to their antient dignity and Inheritance, and whatsoever
Christian Princes and Potentates, will set themselves against it,
we will not spare any lawful means to bring ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> so just and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
purpose to a good end. Neither shall the Match of
our Son, or any other worldly respects be preferred to this our
Resolution.</p>
                     <p>For by our credit and intervention with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and the <hi>Arch-Dutchess</hi> and her Husband, now with God, we
preserved the <hi>Lower Palatinate</hi> one whole year, from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conquering in it, which in any eight dayes space in that
time might have easily been swallowed up by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s <hi>Army,</hi>
without any resistance; and in no better case was it now at our
Ambassadour the Lord <hi>Digby</hi>'s coming through <hi>Heidleburgh,</hi> if
we had not extraordinarily succoured it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="516" facs="tcp:60657:278"/>
But because we conceive that ye couple this War of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi>
with the cause of Religion, we must a little unfold your
eyes herein.</p>
                     <p>The beginning of this miserable War which hath set all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome</hi>
on fire, was not for Religion but only caused by Our
Son in law his hasty and rash Resolution, following evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
to take to himself the Crown of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and that this is
true, himself wrote Letters to Us at that time, desiring Us to
give assurance both to the <hi>French</hi> King, and to the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
that his accepting of the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had no refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the cause of Religion, but only by reason of his right
of Election (as he called it.) And we would be sorry that that
aspersion should come upon our Religion, as to make it a good
pretext for disthroning of Kings, and usurping their Crowns.
And we would be loath that our people here should be taught
that doctrine.</p>
                     <p>No, let Us not so far wrong the Jesuits, as to rob them of
their sweet Positions and practice in this point. And upon the
other part, we assure our selves so far of your charitable thoughts
of us, that we would never have constantly denyed our Son in
Law both the title and assistance in that point, if we had been
well-perswaded of the justice of his quarrel. But to conclude
this unjust usurpation of the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria</hi>
from the <hi>Emperour,</hi> hath given the Pope, and all that party,
too fair a ground, and opened them too wide a Gate for curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and oppressing of many thousands of our Religion in divers
parts of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas you excuse your touching upon the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> upon occasion of the incidents by you repeated in that
place, and yet affirm, it is without any touch to his Honor. We
cannot wonder enough that ye are so forgetful, both of your
words and writs; for in your former Petition you plainly
affirm, that he affects the Temporal Monarchy of the whole
Earth, then which there can be no more malice uttered against
any great King, to make all other Princes and Potentates both
envy and hate him.</p>
                     <p>But if you list it may be easily tryed, whether that speech
touched him in honour or not, if we shall ask him the question,
Whether he means to assume to himself that Title or no? For
every King can best judge of his own Honour; we omit the
particular Ejaculations of some foul-mouthed Oratours in the
House against the honour of his Crown and State.</p>
                     <p>And touching your excuse of not determining any thing
concerning the Match of our dearest Son, but only to tell your
opinion, and lay it down at our feet.</p>
                     <p>First, we desire to know, how you could have presumed to
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:60657:278"/>
determine in that point without committing of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>And next, you cannot deny but your talking of his Match
after that manner, was a direct breach of our Commandment
and Declaration out of our own Mouth, at the first sitting down
of this Parliament; where we plainly professed, that we were
in Treaty of his Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and wished you to have that
confidence in our Religion and Wisdom, that we would so man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it as our Religion should receivt no prejudice by it. And
the same we now repeat unto you, professing that we are so far
ingaged in that Match, as we cannot in honour go back, except
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> perform not such things as we expect at his
hands: and therefore we are sorry that ye should shew to have
so great distrust in us, or to conceive that we should be cold in
our Religion, otherwise we cannot imagine how our former
Publick Declaration should not have stopped your Mouths in
this point.</p>
                     <p>And as to your Request, that we would now receive your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Petition. We wonder what could make you presume that
we would not receive it; whereas in our former letter, we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared the contrary unto you, and therefore we have just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejected that suit of yours. For what have you left un-at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
in the highest points of Sovereignty in that petition of

nay with any Popish Princess, and also Affirmatively, as to the
matching with one of our Religion; which we confess is a strain
beyond any Providence or Wisdom God hath given to us, as
things now stand.</p>
                     <p>These are unfit things to be handled in Parliament, except
your King should require it of you; <hi>For who can have wisdome
to judge of things of that nature, but such as are dayly acquainted

would make any Prince neglect to treat with us, either in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

from some Treaty which before he had made, was afterwards
refused Treating with any other Princes to his great reproach,
unless he would first procure Assent of his States to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.

                        </gap> the late times, you
shall find that the late Queen of famous memory, was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
petitioned by a Parliament to be pleased to marry; but her
answer was, that she liked their Petition well, because it was
simple, not limitting her to any place or person, as not befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her liking to their fancies; and if they had done otherwise,
she should have thought it a high presumption in them. Judge
then, what we may do in such a case: having made our publick
Declaration already (as we said before) directly contrary to that
which you have now petitioned?</p>
                     <p>Now to the point in your Petition, whereof you desire an
answer as properly belonging to the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The first and greatest point is that Religion, concerning which
at this time, we can give you no other answer then in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
which is, that you may rest secure, that we will never be
weary to do all we can for propagation of our Religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
Popery. But the manner and form ye must remit to our
care and providence, who can best consider of times and Seasons;
not by undertaking a publicb War of Religion through all the
World at once; which how hard and dangerous a Task, it
may prove, ye may judge. But this puts Us in mind, how all
the World complained the last year of plenty of Corn, and
God hath sent us a cooling card this year for that heat. And
so we pray God, that this desire amongst you of kindling war
(shewing your weariness of peace and plenty) may not mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
God permit us to fall into the Miseries of both.</p>
                     <p>But as we already said, our care of Religion must be such as
on the one part, we must not by the hot persecution of <hi>Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants</hi>
at home, irritate Foreign Princes of contrary Religion,
and teach them the way to plague Protestants in their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with whom we dayly intercede, and at this time princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
to ease them of our profession that live under them. Yet
upon the other part; we never mean to spare from due and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
punishing of any Papist that will grow insolent for living
under our so mild Government.</p>
                     <p>And ye may also be assured we will leave no care untaken, as
well for the good Education of the youth at home, especially the
children of Papists, as also for preserving at all times hereafter,
the youth that are, or shall be abroad, from being bred in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
places, and so poisoned in Popish Seminaries.</p>
                     <p>And as in this point, concerning the good education of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
youth at home, we have already given some good proofs,
both in this Kingdome and <hi>Ireland,</hi> so will we be well pleased
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:60657:279"/>
to pass any good laws that shall be made either now or any time
hereafter to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>And as to your request of making this a Session, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a general Pardon, it shall be in your defaults, if we make
not this a Session before <hi>Christmass.</hi> But for the Pardon, you
crave such particulars in it, as we must be well advised upon,
least otherwise we give you back the double, or treble, we are
to receive by your entire Subsidie without Fifteens. But the
ordinary course we hold fittest to be used still in this case is, that
we should of our Free Grace send you down a Pardon from the
Higher House, containing such points as we shall think fittest,
wherein we hope you shall receive good satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>But we cannot omit to shew you how strange we think it,
that you should make so bad and unjust a Commentary upon
some words of our former Letter, as if we meant to restrain
you thereby of your antient Liberties and Privileges in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Truly a Scholar would be ashamed so to mistake, and
misjudge any Sentences in another mans book.</p>
                     <p>For whereas in the end of our former Letter, we discharge
you to meddle in matters of Government, and Myste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

State, namely, matters of War or Peace, or our dearest Sons
match with <hi>Spain;</hi> by which particular denominations, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete
and restrain our former Words; And then after we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
you to meddle with such things that have their ordinary
course in <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Iustice;</hi> yet couple together these two sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and plainly leave out these words, <hi>of Mysteries of State,</hi>
so as ye erre, <hi>a bene divisis ad male conjuncta,</hi> for of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part, concerning Mysteries of State, we plainly restrain
our meaning to the particulars that were after mentioned; and
in the later we confess we meant it by Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> foolish
business.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it had well becomed him, especially being
our Servant, and one of Our Council, to have complained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, which he never did, though he was ordinarily at Court
since, and never had access refused unto him.</p>
                     <p>And although we cannot allow of the stile, calling it your
antient and undoubted Right and Inheritance, but could rather
have wished that ye had said, <hi>That your privileges were derived
from the Grace and permission of Our Ancesters and Us</hi> (for most
of them grow from Presidents, which shews rather a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than Inheritance) yet we are pleased to give you Our Royal
assurance, that as long as you shall contain your selves within
the Limits of your duty, we will be as careful to maintain and
preserve your lawful Liberties and Privileges, as ever any of
our Predecessours were, nay, as to preserve our own Royall
Prerogative.</p>

                        <pb n="520" facs="tcp:60657:280"/>
So your House had only need to beware to trench upon the
Prerogative of the Crown; which inforce Us, or any just King
to retrench them of their Privileges, that would pare his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
and flowers of the Crown. But of this we hope there
shall be never cause given.</p>

is, we cannot endure Subjects to use such Anti-Monarchical words

in former times, nor what they have right unto, or hy Grace now;
and so we made that distinction, either by Law, or Statute, or long

Our publick Resolutions and actions; intending to have made this
the happiest Parliament in our time, without imputing (however)
to the Major part of the Members any want of their duty, as hath
been mutually exprest from either party.</p>
                     <p>Beginning in <hi>January</hi> with good harmony betwixt us, so as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages past could not parallell the like. Their love to us, our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to them, extended not only to private persons, but even upon
the prime Officer of Our Kingdome, we found notwithstanding they
mispent time in cavils; yet we gave longer time, continuing the
Session till the eight and twentieth day of <hi>May,</hi> then the Recess till
the fourth of <hi>June;</hi> Expressing that our Progress approaching, the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:60657:281"/>
necessity of our Council to attend us; the disfurnishing our Courts
of Iustice so many Terms, and the long absence of Iustices of
Peace and deputy Lieatenants, from their necessary duties in the
Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Then we sent them word, we would hear and answer all busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
at an appointed time. They are notwithstanding in jealousie and
expressed discontent; yet made not their address to us; and thereof
we signified our pleasure to both Houses. The Lords submitted to our
Resolutions, passed the Act for some especial Bills with commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Commons, which they neglect. We therefore continued
the Session for a Fortnight longer. Our self in person offered to the
Lords the passing Bills, had thanks from them, which the Commons
the same day refuse. The Grievances of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi>
(though not presented to us) were rectified by Proclamations in both
Realms.</p>
                     <p>But during this time of Recess we mediated with the Emperour by
Our Ambassadour <hi>Digby;</hi> upon promise of assistance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in case that failed; then we reassemble the twentieth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
and made known in particular all the transactions abroad,
yet some Members took inordinate liberty to treat of Our prerogative
not fit to be medled withall, of which we gave them warning.</p>
                     <p>[And so reciting all the particular passages before-mentioned.]</p>
                     <p>And therefore concludes, whereas the Assembly of Parliament was
adjourned untill the eight of <hi>February</hi> now next ensuing, we min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
not to continue it any longer, have thought fit to signifie our
Resolutions with these reasons, willing and requiring the Prelates,
Noble men and States, as also the Knights, Citizens, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses,
and others, &amp;c. to forbear to attend on the said day prefixed,
and that the said Convention of Parliament, shall not be esteemed

for the most dangerous words, were table talk between
them; They were all close imprisoned, and often examined;
truly their friends were much afraid, that either their own guilt
or the policy of skilful Examiners, of each Prisoner a part,
might involve them all, into destruction. <hi>Southampton</hi> was

more to blame to whisper against his <hi>Soveraign</hi> now, that resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

with the Court, upon a mean account; a rough West-Countrey-Blade
he was, and being too bold at a Mask in Court, had his
Ear-ring torn out in the bussle, by a dogged ill-natured <hi>Scot,
Maxwell,</hi> an Usher in Office there; who being challenged for
the injury, <hi>Hawly was</hi> in hazard to suffer more by seeking his
satisfaction this way, and for the present was committed to the
<hi>Marshalses,</hi> until it increased muttering amongst the Inns of
Court Men; who upon the like occasion) sided in this quarrel.
The King, that knew how to caresse such Students, sent for
<hi>Hawly,</hi> and told him, that he had considered of the Challenge
occasioned from <hi>Maxwells</hi> duty to his Service, and therefore
now, unwilling to take advantage of his restraint, sets him at
liberty, only upon condition, to make good his Challenge,
and himself would be second to his Man <hi>Maxwell;</hi> and bids de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to <hi>Hawly</hi> to go on; if he durst; or else (quoth he) in true

                     <p>But in this now, the King full of mercy, made not much of
this Treasonable matter, but lodged them all, too long a time
for such Spirits; It might be thereby to draw voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
or Petitions for pardon, but then, they all, being so
neer a kin in the Crime must not dissent in the design, which
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:60657:282"/>

of her Fathers lodgings. Where, after a Collation, they might
be trusted into the neither end of his long Garden, but by no
means to advance towards the Chamber window where <hi>Oxford</hi>
lodged; who in this time and noise in the Garden, looked out
upon them, and had Items by signs from the Gentleman (whom
<hi>Oxford</hi> knew) to observe the disguised <hi>French</hi> Wench, and

                        <hi>Digby</hi> the trouble and discommodity of riding many leagues to
<hi>Madrid,</hi> to meet there, though it is to be understood by those
that know, that the Court and Council, and State of <hi>Spain,</hi>
are said to be alwaies residing in <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>New Castile,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Ambassadours, and making dispatches; yet the amity
of <hi>Digby</hi> with that Council, hoped now to alter that Custome,
in favour of this urgent affair and him. And therefore lands, as
the time and weather would afford, the neerest Port <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>

to signify to <hi>Cottington</hi> his arrival, and reason for resting there,
as yet, intimating that if he could surprize the King at <hi>Burgos</hi>
or <hi>Lerma,</hi> so far neerer his return home, might there also hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
his dispatch upon that so reasonable consideration.</p>
                     <p>The King in complement told <hi>Cottington, That he hoped the
Ambassadours business was of more weight than to be taken up in
the road, where it became not his Majesty to return him back to his
Master without entertainment of the Court of</hi> Spain.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Digby</hi> understood this as State formality, and pressing
his own conveniency, was at last ordered to have audience at
<hi>Lerma;</hi> whereupon <hi>Digby</hi> might say, without merit of a scoff.
<hi>[That it was the first President of honour to an</hi> English <hi>Ambassador,</hi>

                           <p>The Directions sent with the Letter in six Articles.</p>
                           <p>1. That no Preacher <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>nder the degree of Bishops or Deans, fall

                                 </gap>es</note> or in some of the Homilies by authority of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>2. That none shall preach after noon, on Sundays, or holy days, but
on some part of the Catechism, or of the Creed, Decalogue, or the
Lords prayer; and to incourage such Preachers as exercise children in
their Catechism, which is the most landable custome of teaching in
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>3. That no Preacher under the Degree of a Bishop or Dean, do
preach the deep points of Predestination, Election, Reprobation, or
of the universality, efficacy, resistibility of GODS GRACE,
but leave these Theams for godly and learned men, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
and modestly, by way of use and application rather then of
positive Doctrines, being fitter for the School, then simple Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
                           <p>4. That no Preacher soever shall presume in any Auditory, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
limit or bound out, by way of positive doctrine, the Power,
Prerogative, Iurisdiction, authority, or duty of Sovereign Princes,
or meddle with matters of State, and the differences between Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the people, but rather confine themselves to faith and good
life, which are all, the subject of the antient Sermons and Homilies.</p>
                           <p>5. That no Preacher shall causlesly (without invitation from
the Text) fall into bitter invectives, undecent railing Speeches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the persons of Papists or Puritans, but rather free both the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the aspersing
of either Adversary.</p>
                           <p>6. That the Bishops be more wary in the choice and licencing of
Preachers. And that all the Lecturers throughout the Kingdom (a
new body severed from the antient Clergy, as being neither Parson,
Vicar, nor Curate) be licensed henceforth in the Court of faculties,
but only from a Recommendation of the party, from the Bishop of
the Diocess under his hand and Seal, with a Fiat from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:60657:286"/>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a Confirmation under the Great Seal of
<hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I well remember these times, the invectives of the Pulpits,<note place="margin">The misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of the Pulpit.</note>
which truly the wisdom of State thought fit to suppress. The
Non-conformist nestled himself into a <hi>Lecture,</hi> by that means
depending onely upon the devotion of the Parish, was that way
preferred without the favour of the Bishops. And first insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into the women, Wife, Daughter and Maid, infusing at
their homes such doctrines as might easily catch their weak pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and thereupon begat the frequent writing of Notes from
their preaching in publick, as it would astonish the indifferent
Reader, to meet with their Blasphemies and miserable Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense Notes. And truly, those Lectures, wounderfully haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by such people, in after Noon Sermons on working days,
with such Stuff as savoured nought but railing against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
or our Church discipline.</p>
                           <p>The looseness of Servants took liberty almost every day in
the week to be easied in their Labour and Callings to pretend
devotion in this Ordinance of hearing Lectures in some or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church, untill their Masters complained of that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</p>
                           <p>These Articles therefore were seasonably published to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Ministery,<note place="margin">Catechising again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> and to order the catechising of children and

observes.</p>

party, that held the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>And it is somewhat true as he remembers Us</hi> [That the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier

                           <p>But (<hi>saies he</hi>) the well-affected by writing and discourse sought
to warm the Kings cold temper with fresh spirits into his chilled

                           </p>
                           <p>This stuff smells rank of the Doctor, that refined our dead
Historians work, and put it out in print as we have it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he had heretofore passed the Pikes to be a Preacher, and
run through this <hi>Ordial-Tryal</hi> of his Text-ship; who in those
daies might well deserve a <hi>Duns-ship,</hi> but of late went out Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
to arm his <hi>Republicans</hi> (if any such men are) to be as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Rebels as himself, in what estate soever they shall chance to
be lodged.</p>
                           <p>But because the Reader may have better satisfaction of those
times,<note place="margin">A modest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> and Ecclesiastical policy then towards the Lay-Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
(for such only was it needful to favour) the King was so
<hi>Popishly addicted</hi> (as our Calumniator would inforce) that to the
incredible exhaustment of his Treasure, he most zealously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
for refreshment and favour unto all the Protestants in
<hi>Europe</hi> (His Crown and Dominions and <hi>Denmark</hi> excepted.)
The <hi>Swedes</hi> having lately provoked the <hi>Pole,</hi> had no other
hope of Peace, those of <hi>France</hi> for the exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
those of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and all the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
the least conveniency to say their prayers, but by the
Kings Mediation, And being advised by the late Assembly of
Parliament, into this Milky way of Intercession and treaty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
what a preposterous Argument would it have been to
desire those Mighty Princes, crowned and victorious, to grant
clemency to them, and for himself to execute <hi>poenal Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>
the Papists.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>English Iesuit in France</hi> did design to frustrate this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
indeavour of the King, by writing a most malicious Book
to the <hi>French King,</hi> inciting him and his three Estates to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
their Statutes upon the <hi>Hugonotes,</hi> as the like (they said)
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:60657:287"/>
were here enacted against Catholiques. I would therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
with the most subtil States-monger, to chalk out a way for
his Majesty to have mediated for grace to the Protestants, by
executing at this time the severity of lawes upon the <hi>Papist.</hi> But
hat this favour should amount to a Tolleration, is a most dull,
and yet a most divilest construction.</p>
                           <p>A Toleration looks forward to the future, this favour back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">Calumnies against the K.</note>
only to offences past; and the <hi>Lord Keepers</hi> letter to the
Judges is so to be understood; whereby if any Papist by them
should be set at liberty, and should offend and laws again, the
Justices may, nay must recommit him, and leave favour only
to the King, to whom only belongeth Mercy.</p>
                           <p>Nay, more, let these two writs directed to the Judges be
perused, by any rash censurors (as they were resolved by grave
and learned men; to whom the King committed the penning)
and it will appear the Papists were no more out of Prison, then
with shackles about their heels, sufficient Sureties, and Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizances,
to present themselves at the next Assizes. So they
being grasped in the custody of law, or rather imprisoned still,
than with any liberty.</p>
                           <p>And in truth they were by this tender favour, to be reduced
into a better behaviour, or otherwise upon tryal, the King was
to recall his writ, and leave them to extremity. But if a <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
will</hi> conclude an <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>Devils Topicques, a
converto ad abstractum,</hi> from a favour to some well-minded
<hi>English Catholique,</hi> reasonably to be distinguished from others,
what therefore, is the King turned <hi>Roman Papist,</hi> whose wise
discourses, learned Writings, pious Exercises, Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

                           <p>But the Spirits of wisemen are now satisfied that (those airy
Representations of ungrounded fancies set aside) this Island of
all the Countreys of <hi>Europe,</hi> was then the sole Nest of Peace,

(and that justly) that in time of Confederacy, Treaty,

of <hi>Spain,</hi> and no more interest of Confederacy with

our King, than we with his Master. To balance both the King
grants freedome alike to his Subjects to be called by Drum to
either service, when it was evident that only one Regiment
went away with the <hi>Lord Vaux</hi> to re-inforce the Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>

was intended more policy to the one, then equality to both, to
be rid of the Papists, (which he sayes) infected the Kingdome.

                     <p>But ill news hath wings; the loss of the <hi>English</hi> Men, and
the <hi>Palatines</hi> Country, came faster to the King, then could be

in suspence, for any other to negotiate; or, by discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Spanish</hi> deceipt, to give end to any absolute breach;

                     <p>
                        <hi>Weston</hi> (now Chancelour of the Exchequer) and the Lord
<hi>Chichester</hi> from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> having trusted to Treaties, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
might have secured the remainder of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the
<hi>English Garrisons</hi> being rather maintained in honour to keep

Friendship by Treaty, then of force by fighting.</p>
                     <p>And therefore to put the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to it, he was to demand,

join with the <hi>English</hi> for recovery thereof, thus lost upon this

                     <p>Thus the King fights and treats, not as in love with a match
absolute, upon any uneven Terms then, as our mad World
would make us believe them now, from whose pens and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quils,
the Kings mind is pretended to be unmaskt, [<hi>as mean and

from his Parliament and people, the King to satisfie in

that he withdrew not his affection from his children for
fear of any Enemy, to cosin himself with a <hi>Spanish Cheat,</hi> never
meant him in a Match, these proceedings will unmask.</p>
                     <p>And why to be charactered [<hi>Studious of Peace somewhat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much</hi>]
truly not so for a Christian King,<note place="margin">Reign of K. Charls p 3, 4.</note> and therefore not to
be [<hi>imputed to Pusillanimity</hi>] admitting [<hi>His Son-in-laws extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

not the King. Nor is it handsome to say to his dishonour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
[<hi>That the</hi> Austrian <hi>Family cojol'd him in delusory chat, with
specious falasies</hi>] whilest the Author is pleased to abreviate that

whole <hi>Palatinate</hi> into three lines, with this Observation [<hi>That
the moity of the Money spent in Ambassyes would have modelled an

                     <p>And so the short Relation, with unskilful Surgery to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize,
not truly to characterize the Wisdome of this King, in
such difficult designs as were intent, more against him, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
many other Princes his Predecessors.</p>
                     <p>But these proceedings (I say) will unmask all; for from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
force, he was left in the lurch even by his own people
that put him forward, and yet having more desperate conditions
to work out at home, then was urged abroad; He in this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi>

                           <p>The King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> finds himself equally ingaged in

that he thinks are secretly in his Kingdom, and so to be
assured of them, as likewise the honour in Mariage, with one of
the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the best born Lady in the World.</p>
                           <p>The other is the Restitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in which he is yet
more engaged; for besides that his Reputation is at stake, there is
added the love and interests of his Grand-children, Sons of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

what soever conveniencies might follow by dissembling what

with that blemish that never hath befaln any of your <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Besides, the King of <hi>England</hi> will remain offended and disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
seeing neither interests nor helpers do follow; the allyance of
this Crown, is likewise the pretext of particular resentment, for
having suffered his Daughter and Grandchildren to be ruined in
respect hereof.</p>
                           <p>For the Emperour, though he be well affected and obliged to us,
in making the Translation at this time, as business now stands (the
Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being possesed of all the Dominions) and though
he would dispose all to our conveniencyes, it will not be in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to do it; as your Majesty may see by the Memorial, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Ambassadour gave you yesterday who make it certain. Since
in that List of the Souldiers, that every one of the League is to pay,
<hi>Bavaria</hi> alone will pay more, all than the rest joined together, Which
shews his power and intention not to accommodate matters, but to
keep to himself the superiority of all in this broken time; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
is now in the Dyet, and the <hi>Translation</hi> is to be made
in it</p>
                           <p>I propose then for this Estate, to conserve the means for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with your Majesties Ministers; for the Difficulty will be to
find a Way to make the present Distracted Affairs straight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
which with Lingring, both the Power and the Time will
be lost.</p>
                           <p>The Emperour (as your Majesty knows by his Ambassadours)
desires to marry his Daughter with the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Son, and
I doubt not, but he will be likewise glad to marry his second daughter
with the <hi>Palatines</hi> Son.</p>
                           <p>Then I propound that these two Matches be made, and set on foot
presently, giving the King of <hi>England</hi> full satisfaction in all his
propositions, for the more strict Union and Correspondence, that he
may agree to it.</p>
                           <p>And so all the conveniencies of allyance with us, will be as full
in this; for it accommodates the matter of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:60657:291"/>
Succession of his Grand-children, with his honour, without blood or
treasure, together with the interest of the Emperour, the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and to reduce the <hi>Prince
Elector,</hi> that was an enemy to the obedience of the Church, by bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Sonnes in the <hi>Emperours Court</hi> in the <hi>Catholique</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, the business is great the difficulties greater, than
perchance have been in any other Case.</p>
                           <p>I am obliged thus to represent it to your Majesty, and shall further
shew what I think fit foe disposing of the things, to the great Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of State if your Majesty please; being helped with the good
zeal of <hi>Count Gondamore,</hi> and God his blessing therein: so
much for his Honour, and your Majesties service.</p>

                     <p>And therefore a false scandal on the King to have any Design

                     <p>The Prince hastens to the Sea-side, waited on by numbers
of the <hi>Spanish, Cardinal Zapata,</hi> the <hi>Marquess Aytone,</hi> the

                     <p>The beauty of Our gallant Navy (for in bigness of bulk

aboard his Ship, then called the <hi>Prince Royal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The pleasant evening invites the Prince to accompany his
Guests in his Barge,<note place="margin">Danger to be drowned.</note> back to the Shore; they had day enough,
and coolest when latest, the best recreation. Besides, they gave
it as a complement to take a Round of the whole Fleet, which
took up more time, that had like to have been their last, for they
were all almost lost.</p>
                     <p>It becomes a Story of Princely hazard to tell out the Tale;
when the Recovery takes delight from the danger.</p>
                     <p>The Barge-men have a custom at the Oar to be cheered up
by the Boat-swains whistle,<note place="margin">The Strorm.</note> to which <hi>One and All,</hi> with courage

with such a gird, as might seem hazardous to divide the Barge,

too much daring, put them to want it, when they came to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
For now the damp fog fixes, and descends to the deeps,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:60657:297"/>
the Sun in shame sincks down to she Sea; the winds begin to
whistle, and ere they apprehend danger, death seems to seize
them with several distractions. A monstrous shower of Rain
thickned the face of Heaven, so dark as Hell; and yet the Stars
were seen, affording but light to discern more dread. The Sea
with flames do burn, and yet sad clouds do sink down shores
(of tears) as if to quench them: Yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the waves to heaven had wrought, and heaven to seas had sank,
No place for Art or force. The Sea-men inured to Tryals, yet
now grow fearful, horrour possesses all. No Card or compass
aboard; They steered to and fro, doubtful what to do but to
drown, and first to pray, which they did; and thereby were
directed with wondrous chance to the glimpse of a candle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lanthorn of an outlying ship. Hope helpt the worn-out
Rowers to recover their faint hearts, and yet with difficulty,
doubling the former danger, it was impossible to clap a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
so mighty were the billows to bulge the Barge. But up
they get, and all safe, for his sake, the Prince of men, and of
such a mind above the Power of all (but fortune) Seas or

and particular administration of Iustice; and by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

been without errour, he cannot say, but does truly avouch it before
God, and his Angels, that never King governed with more pure,
sincere and uncorrupt heart, from intention and meaning of Error,
or imperfection in his Reign.</p>
                     <p>The other part he imparts as a secret importance to his estate and

                        <hi>His Reasons;</hi> Advancement of his Estate and Children, and

who are returned, not with such effect as was desired; nor altogether
without profit. For it took forth a point of Wisdome; <hi>Qui versa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

others, ways to evade, and means to avoid effects.</p>
                     <p>The particulars too many for him to relate, he refers them to the
Prince, to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Secretaries; that so <hi>Super totam

of the Commonwealth, Religion, His Son, and His children of the

                     <p>And for his Estate, it is considerable, as consisting with theirs;
And as <hi>Res Integra</hi> is presented to them, so he professes himself free

for they are of a strange depth.</p>
                     <p>And cleers himself in the presence of God, of either Remissness
in Religion, or maintenance of Toleration; what suspition might
be, was when he connived at some things, which hindred weighty
affairs, but never to overthrow or disagree with Our Laws; For a
good Horse-man spares the spur, and sometimes suffers the Reigns;
so a Wise King (as his age and experience informs) to quicken,
and execute Laws, and upon just occasion to be remiss.</p>
                     <p>And closes with that, which he would have take best impression,
as most averse from their faith; their Privileges. He never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
Lawful Liberties, antiently warrantable, therefore he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns
them (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Timothy</hi>) to avoid Genealogies and

was highly esteemed as the Preserver of the Nation,
contrary to that natural custome of incompatibillity of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                     <p>In these cases he would be loath to shew his Teeth, and cannot bite.

                     <p>What horrid infamy is here cast on them both?</p>

then, but that I was present, and acquainted with all that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action

meant to do it home, and to involve the Prince too in

upon the Prince.</p>
                     <p>And thus (<hi>Machevils</hi> rule) lay the scandal high enough, no
matter to prove it.</p>
                     <p>Himself the Brocher, to be free from Examination, being
qualified an <hi>Ambassadour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A great noise there was (I remember well) more in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
resentment than any way considerable at Court. And yet
the Duke was not so dull to neglect the means of satisfying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Himself and Prince needed not, nor truly did it any way
interfear (as it was devised) to startle the King.</p>
                     <p>And being generally cryed down as a false scandal, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of all three could not question an Ambassadour, though it
was scanned at the Council Table, and put to vote in the house
too, how to proceed with him: <hi>That the Shield of his Ambassy
was too weak to defend him from the Sword of Iustice, for then he
resolves into a private man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Duke not satisfyed,<note place="margin">See before pa. 74.</note> had the opinion of a learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary
who with much circumstance advised and directed a
tedious Ceremony of State to be used therein.</p>
                     <p>Both Speakers to remonstrate to the Ambassadour the crime, and
if he reveal not the Informers, then is he <hi>Author Scandali,</hi> and
so the Houses to petition the King to confine him, and restrain his
person till his Master know his offence, and satisfy Iustice. If he
does not; then is it <hi>Transactio Criminis,</hi> upon himself, and draws
a denounce of War.</p>
                     <p>But the wisdome of the King would have none of this Geer.
Yet the Prince and Duke complained hereof to <hi>Spain,</hi> and a
command returned to <hi>Inojosa</hi> to crave forgivenesse, which he
did,; and the Duke in confidence of his own Innocency,
suffered it to passe without much more trouble to seek satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in publique: for he would always say, <hi>Lyes are not long
liv'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed more he could not have; Examples vary, some
Ambassadours in like cases have been secured and punished, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
freed by privilege; for in the times of the <hi>Scots</hi> Affairs,

                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> this while in <hi>Spain,</hi> received command

                     <p>But these branglings here, feigned there to be high Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<note place="margin">Hist. Gr. Br. p. 272.</note> gave him courage to return [<hi>where no sooner appeared but

it should move jealousies, that it was his design thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
his Tryal; and this to my knowledge, for I acted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease.
He being earnestly pursued by the Duke, and had the
Parliament lasted, it might have proved his destruction, who

suspected the wealth of that nation on their backs.</p>
                     <p>The presence of a Stranger, somewhat publique, presented
to each persons caress made most men (acquainted with State)
to judge the plot of his Journey, was rather to set an edge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Spain;</hi> to cut off delayes, than to cut the throat of that
business.</p>
                     <p>The Kings weakness or indisposition to affairs, gave leave
and time to Queen Mother to mannage all; who receiving an
humble visit by <hi>Kensington</hi> to kiss her hands, she entered dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the <hi>Spanish Allyance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Treaty</hi> (said he) <hi>had suffered many Delaies, and was annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
Though the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour there, had given it out
to be concluded, on purpose to prevent conjunction with <hi>France</hi>
which he suspected, and his design got credit with some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of power, seeing <hi>Kensington</hi> had no Credentials positive
to speak to the purpose. Yet from others,<note place="margin">France how affected.</note> and not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
he apprehended the affections of that State, generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to receive offers of Amity and Allyance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the other shall be declared.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the <hi>Savoy</hi> Embassadour there said, <hi>That the intention</hi>
of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was for a Cross Match with <hi>France</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>But the late abuse upon the <hi>English</hi> in that way, made the
<hi>French</hi> wary, and hastily to bite at that bate. Yet the reasons of
State were not unequal. Our Design was double, both Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and League against <hi>Spain.</hi> And if the <hi>French</hi> should
match with <hi>Spain,</hi> and so hold us to hard conditions, they have
the safer ground; for they may expect restitution of the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi>
as we do demand the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> these two being the open
quarrels on both parts to ground.</p>
                     <p>And these doubts were suspected to draw on a tedious <hi>Treaty</hi>
and therefore it was thought fit by the <hi>English</hi> to insist upon
the Match, and bring on the League, necessarily to follow, and
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:60657:304"/>
to have reasonable conditions concerning <hi>Catholiques</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed the necessity of the <hi>French Affairs,</hi> least <hi>Spain,</hi> that
hath begirt them, should in time swallow them up, was like to
make this Match easie enough for the <hi>English;</hi> the alarm being
fresh in Court, from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> raising a fort upon the ruin,
to command the Town of <hi>Liege.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> suspecting that <hi>Kensingtons</hi> errand was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
by degrees, gave him incouragement to speak plain though
it was his part to plead and wo too, without any signal.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Chevereux</hi> and <hi>Le Grand,</hi> of credit and power
both, were the men this Design most affected. <hi>Kensington</hi> bore
the Princes Picture tackt to his Breast, limm'd in little in a Case
of set Diamonds, which the Queen would offer to open, as to
shew the Ladies, which they would as often desire, to please
her Majesty, who (me thought) did love to look on it, She
wishing that some good occasion might make them meet, and
she might see him like himself. But because <hi>Madam.</hi> could not
in modesty or honor get a glance of his shadow, she in private
delt with a <hi>Madamoselle,</hi> that had some interest in one of the
Lords Family, to borrow the Picture, and so in secret to gaze
her fill, where in much hast she opened the Picture, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
her passions, her blushes not concealing her inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to his person, which she prized by praising his <hi>Picture</hi> in
presence of him that saw her.</p>
                     <p>Two mouths calmed the way unto the Mother, she and <hi>Le
Grand</hi> advised to move the King, if this business were fitted to
the full.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Kensington</hi> declined, as not to deliver the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
inclination, unless he might receive the return, answerable
to a due respect and value of the Proposition. Of which being
assured, he took his opportunity to withdraw the K. towards
the window, and told him,</p>
                     <p>That his journey to <hi>France</hi> was singly his own inclination to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and serve him, and therein to discover how the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> would be free and disingaged from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treaty, not
finding them to his expectation in such particulars as principally
should invite a Conjunction. And therefore the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had exercised his interest with the King and Prince to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
those thoughts towards his Majesty, from whom it was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
nothing but truth and honour would be returned, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to both Nations; And believed that if the King would
shew a disposition inclineable, the effects would soon confirm the end
of his comming, free from other Designs, than what he now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
                     <p>The King (often uncovered) said,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="569" facs="tcp:60657:304"/>He had not heard, that the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> was as yet broke,
the just cause for him to be reserved. But assured him in general,
That any propositions from the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> should be
heartily received.</p>
                     <p>This was short,<note place="margin">His Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> for his Imperfection of extream stammering
by nature, made him usually speak very little, whose affection
(if one might Guess by his courtesy) would have said more, as
most of the Ministers of that <hi>State</hi> did, <hi>And that nothing to
them was more equal than Amity and Allyance with</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>This entrance encouraged <hi>Kensington</hi> to discover himself and
letters of Credence to the King, and so was quallified to treat

resented so ill, as were it not the behalf of so great a Prince, he had
a heart to cut</hi> Kensingtons throat; And so retires out of

                     <p>This boldness of him, to aver Corrival with our <hi>Prince,</hi> and
abuse of his Minister, made <hi>Kensington</hi> begin the quarrel with
a Challenge, which the <hi>Count</hi> accepts, but the former passages

                     <p>Yet in honour to the Office, the King raised other Men to

                     <p>In our Camp at <hi>Mede,</hi> we had a flying report of the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

himself, too much assured of good effects, had revealed.
But when it was blasted and better known, the Prince to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
his Countrey-men, complained only of their quick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
confidence, and too much hast in the execution. It was
my chance to be there when <hi>Brouchen</hi> came in to yield up the
accompt of his miscarriage; and with him an <hi>English</hi> excellent
<hi>Engeneer,</hi> one <hi>David Collet,</hi> who over a sip or two of <hi>Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine,</hi>
protested to me that he by Boat and wading was got up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bridge-end, and fixed his <hi>Pittard</hi> upon the Castle-Gate,
that the <hi>Century</hi> called (indeed) <hi>qui-va-la,</hi> as but suspecting,
for after a good while silence, he seemed satisfyed, when (said
he) the cowardly <hi>Dutch</hi> scared at his voice only, left the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and ran away, leaving him to wade and swim back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in cold weather, with a hundred shot, by guess, about
his ears, for then the <hi>Century</hi> discharged his Piece, and not
before.<note place="margin">A second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</note>
                     </p>

kept by twenty two of their men for discovery,<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> back by an
Horse Troop. The <hi>Dutch</hi> with a Pittard blew up the Steeple,
and retired; the fire ascends to the place of their Powder, which
with great difficulty they removed, and flung away; and with
stones from above (their best weapons) killed some below, but
the poor <hi>Spaniards</hi> above burnt to death, except three or four
escaping with wonderful hazard, scrambling down without
the Steeple, and horridly scorch'd, with honourable scars, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their black patches all their lives after.</p>
                     <p>And (another Design, not the least) so they set fire on <hi>Ginne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
Church, where <hi>Spinola</hi> had six thousand Sacks of Meal,
with a Granary of <hi>Oats,</hi> and much other Magazine provision,
which put the Enemy to the inconvenience of Recruit.</p>
                     <p>These and such like were endeavours to have done more.</p>
                     <p>After thirty daies encamp at <hi>Mede,</hi> the Prince very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and sad, fires his quarters, leaving the place to the Enemy,
and warily retreats in two divisions, Himself and <hi>Count Ernest</hi>
to <hi>Rosendale,</hi> from whence he retires home to the <hi>Hague,</hi> never
appearing in publick to his death, not long after. His Brother
<hi>Henry</hi> with the other division fortifies <hi>Sprang;</hi> some hopes were

                     </p>
                     <p>And besides the good hap of <hi>Count Mansfield</hi> was come out
of <hi>Germany</hi> into the Skirts of <hi>Brabant,</hi> with his roving Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and scattered troops of the Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> both
beaten out of <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Tilly</hi> and <hi>Cordoua.</hi> And these men
(God knowes) more like Travellers than Fighters, were rather
rumored than numbred to be ten thousand, in truth not six
thousand, without Arms, Money or Provision, and as outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
where relieved which unwillingly was every where, to
be rid of such Guests; necessity inforced them into those ways,
which hath taught that practice of late daies to the Duke of
<hi>Lorain.</hi> But in fine they having no means nor maintenance their
Men forsook their Masters, and <hi>Mansfield</hi> and <hi>Brunswick</hi> became
Courtiers at <hi>Hague.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus at leasure the <hi>Count</hi> was invited by Projectors in

into <hi>England,</hi> moved Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> the new General, to have
the honour of an Attempt, to break into <hi>Spinola</hi>'s quarters.
The design was by the Causey, that leads from <hi>Guitrudenbergh</hi>
to <hi>Treheida,</hi> which was fortified with two dry ditches, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt,
a breast work, and a large Fort. His forces were six
hundred foot choice <hi>English,</hi> assisted with the person of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that tryed excellent Souldier Sir <hi>Horatio Vere,</hi> with fifteen
hundred more <hi>English</hi> the Vantguard, and some <hi>Germane</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> following, in all four thousand. In the Rear the <hi>Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery</hi>
and some <hi>Troops</hi> of Horse. The Enemy got warning, and
prepared to receive us that way, but where to fall he knew not.
But whilst we gave them of <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Camp, false alarms, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fell upon the <hi>Italian</hi> quarter <hi>Carlo Roma,</hi> and surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a foot <hi>Centinel per du,</hi> and so got to the Redoubt, which
we forced with fire Balls, and drove them to retire, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
our men about the Redout in dry Ditches, with undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
courage we won the half Moon before the Fort; labouring
with hands and feet to scale the Rampire, upon which <hi>Oxfords</hi>
Ensign fixt his colours, and with therest leaped into the Fort,
where the <hi>Italians</hi> fought well ere they were beaten out. Those
also of the other causey, which leads to <hi>Sevenbergh</hi> adjoining,
quit their Trenches and fled.</p>

that fury and resolution, as if no other occasion could make proof of
their worth and valour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Enemy thus engaged, began to disorder and fly into the
face of a fresh company of Foot sent to their Relief, and so
mixing routed the rest to a plain retiring, proving a means to
make their danger greater than before; untill <hi>Carlo</hi> himself
with his Sword and Target forced them back, and getting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
led them on again, with such Fury on either part, as till
then had not been seen since the first of this siege; and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowred
by fresh men, wrought the <hi>English</hi> out again, who
indeed could not mount the second Fort so soon, but with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
difficulty, the Waggons not able to march with our sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Ladders, the Canon playing continually upon us in the
windings and turnings of the causey, with great disadvantage
to the <hi>English,</hi> and so narrow, that the Rere could not advance
timely to our Succour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oxford</hi> in the head of all gave excellent testimony of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and in mishaps, impossible to be releived he retteated as
punctual and orderly as his onset, each Souldier observing his
rank, not stepping one foot a side, as if duty and obedience,
could oppose the Canon, which had advantage on us all with
certain execution, to the loss of some hundreds on all sides.
And this, though daringly done, as was possible for men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not successful, and the last Attempt on this wondrous
Siege.</p>
                     <p>The Earl and his Uncle untouched, returned with much
honour, and <hi>Oxford</hi> two daies after, in the heat of the day,
took leave of the Army, riding hard upon a great Horse, to
several Quarters, himself very corpulent, came home to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> but with heat and cold got an <hi>Ague,</hi> and died there in a
Fortnight after.</p>

                     <p>This was the ill success of the Last Attempt, whereof the

Person, but a man intemperate, which hastened his sudden
death, by his high feeding very late at Nights, and at all times
most diseasonable. Which Physicians did forewarn, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for his constitution, enclining to humours, long to
continue; insomuch, as feasted late at the Lady <hi>Udalls,</hi> a

                     <p>A very stout reason. Certainly had the Duke been but at

                     <p>In the entrance of the Spring,<note place="margin">His sickness and disease.</note> the King was seized with a
<hi>Tertian Ague;</hi> which to another constitution was not pestilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
but rather might prove Physical. But all men then knew his
impatience in any pain, and alwaies utter enmity to any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick;
so that nothing was ministred to give him ease in his fits,
which at length grew violent; and in those Maladies, every
one is apt to offer advice, with such prescriptions as have been
helpful unto others, and in truth, those as various as the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
is common.</p>
                     <p>In this time of the Kings rerire, the Duke got leave to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
his Estate at <hi>New-Hall</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>
told him, that a neer <hi>Neighbour,</hi> Dr. <hi>Remington at Dunmow</hi> had
cured many and him also, of a <hi>Quartane Ague,</hi> which had lasted
a long time. The King being told this, commanded the Duke
to send for the Medicine; which was a Plaister of <hi>Mithridate,</hi>
made and spread upon Leather, and delivered from his hand to
One Mr. <hi>Baker,</hi> a Servant of the Dukes then, and now living
neer to the Earl; and so by that Messenger brought to the King
and shewed to the Doctors, and lay ready prepared upon the
Table untill proper time to be applyed to his stomach; Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:60657:317"/>
with a Possit-drink of milk and Ale, Harrs horn, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-gold
Flowers, ingredients harmless and ordinary, which the
Duke gave him to drink, and so took leave and went to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King fallen into slumber about Noon, the Physicians
took opportunity to retire, having watcht all night till that
time. When in the interim of their absence, the King awakes,
and falls from a change of his fit, unto timelyer effect, then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
it had happened before; which to allay, this Plaister was
offered and put to his Stomach. But it wrought no Mittigation,
and therefore was removed by the Doctors, who were much
offended, that any one durst assume this boldness without their
consent. But by after examination, all men then were assured
of the composition, and a piece thereof eaten down by such as
made it; and the Playster many moneths afterwards in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for further tryal of any suspition of Poyson; which if not
satisfactory now, it must and ought to lodge upon their scores,
Sir <hi>Matthew Lister,</hi> Doctor <hi>Chambers,</hi> and other Physicians
worthy men, who were herein examined, with very great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to cleer that calumny, and are yet living to evince each
ones suspition.</p>
                     <p>Otherwise to blame was <hi>Montgomery,</hi> that precious Earl, of
successive merit towards the Kings Posterity [<hi>whom</hi> (it is said)
<note place="margin">Co. &amp; Ch. p. 174.</note> 
                        <hi>the King trusted above all men, and imprecates him, for Gods sake

should neglect his duty, falsify his trust, or connive with the
composition of any poison, if it were so.</p>
                     <p>It was indeed remembred the following Parliament, and
whereof the Duke was questioned, as a boldness unpardonable,
but in the charge (which I remember <hi>Littleton</hi> mannaged at a
Conference in the painted Chamber) it was not urged as poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
but only in him criminable. The Duke asked of me the
effect of his Speech, and answered me, <hi>Well, In that as other

plot, that great Astonihment of Men and Angels, one of the
most unparallell'd and merciful Miracles, that ever the
Church of God tasted, &amp;c. And to crown all with wonder of
greatest Astonishment, do not we all (that are of the Kings

That King <hi>Charles</hi> the flower of Christendom, &amp;c. <hi>And

                     <head>Sir Francis Bacon in honour of K. Iames.</head>
                     <p>WHerefore representing your Majesty many
times unto my mind,<note place="margin">Advancement of Learning, page 2.</note> and beholding you not
with the eye of presumption to discover that which
the Scripture tells me is inscrutable; but with the
observant eye of duty and admiration, leaving aside
the other parts of your virtue and fortune; I have
been touched, yea and possessed with an extreame
wonder at these your virtues and faculties which the
Philosophers call <hi>Intellectuals. The largeness of your
Capacity, the faithfulness of your Memory, the swiftness
of your apprehension, the penetration of your Iudgement,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:60657:319"/>
and the facility and order of your Elocution.</hi> And I have
then thought that of all the persons living, that I have
known, your Majesty were the best instance to make
a man of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>That all knowledge is but
Remembrance,</hi> and that the Mind of man by Nature
knoweth all things, and hath but her own Native
and Original Notions (which by the strangeness and
darkness of the Tabernacle of the Body, are seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred)
again revived and restored; such a Light of
Nature I have observed in your Majesty, and such a
readiness to take flame, and blaze from the least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
presented; or the least Spark of anothers
knowledge delivered. And as the Scripture saith of
the Wisest King, <hi>That his heart was as the Sand of
the Sea,</hi> which though it be one of thr largest Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
yet it consisteth of the smallest and finest por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
So hath God given your Majesty a compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of understanding admirable, being able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
and comprehend the greatest Matters, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
to touch and apprehend the least; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it should seem an impossibility in Nature, for
the same <hi>Instrument</hi> to make it self fit, for great and
small Works. And for your gift of Speech, I call
to mind what <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> saith of <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
Augusto <hi>profluens u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with labour and difficulty; or <hi>Speech</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of the affectation of Art and Precepts: Or
<hi>Speech</hi> that is framed after the imitation of some pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of <hi>Eloquence,</hi> though never so excellent. All
this hath somewhat Servile and holding of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
But your Majesties manner of Speech is indeed
Princelike, flowing as from a Fountain, and yet
streaming and branching it self into Natures Order,
full of facility and felicity, <hi>Imitating none, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by any.</hi> And as in your Civil Estate, there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:60657:319"/>
to be an emulation and contention of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Virtues with your Fortunes; a virtuous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
with a Fortunate Regiment: a virtuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
(when time was) of your greater fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with a prosperous possession thereof in the due time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a virtuous observation of the Laws of Marriage, with
most blessed and happy fruit of Mariage, a virtuous
and most <hi>Christian</hi> desire of Peace, with a fortunate
inclination in your Neighbour Princes thereunto.
So likewise in those <hi>Intellectual Matters,</hi> there seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be no less contention, between the excellency
of your Majesties gifts of nature, and the Universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and perfection of your Learning. For I am well
assured of this that what I shall say, is no Amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all, but a positive and measured Truth, which
is, <hi>That there hath not been since Christs time, any King
or Temporal Monarch, which hath been so learned in all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature
and Erudition, Divine and Humane.</hi> For let a
Man seriously and diligently revolve and peruse the
succession of the Emperours of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
the <hi>Dictato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> who lived some years before Christ,
and <hi>Marcus An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>onius,</hi> were the best learned. And
so descend to the Emperours of <hi>Graecia,</hi> or of the
<hi>West,</hi> and then to the lines of <hi>France, Spain, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Rest,</hi> and he shall find this
Judgement truly made. For it seemeth much in a
King, if by the compendious extractions of other
Mens Wits and Learning, he can take hold of any
superficial Ornaments and shews of Learning: Or
if he countenance and prefer Learning, and Learned
Men. But to drink indeed of the true Fountain of
Learning, nay to have such a Fountain of Learning
in himself, in a King, and in a King born, is almost
a Miracle. And the more, because there is met in
your Majesty a rare conjunction, as well of Divine
and Sacred Literature, as of Prophane and Humane.
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:60657:320"/>
So as your Majesty stands invested of that Triplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which in great Veneration was ascribed to the
antient <hi>Hermes,</hi> The power and fortune of a King,
the knowledge and illumi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ation of a Priest, and
the Learning and Universality of a Philosopher.
This propriety inherent and individual Attribute in
your Majesty, deserveth to be expressed not only in
the fame and admiration of the present time, nor in
the History or Tradition of the Ages succeeding,
but also in some solid work, fixed memorial and
immortal Monument, bearing a Character or Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature,
both of the power of a King and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and persection of such a King. <hi>So he.</hi>

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>HItherto, having pursued the <hi>Descent,</hi> following the Union
of the two <hi>Roses</hi> by Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. of <hi>England;</hi>
and the re-union of both Kingdoms Sovereignty, by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull
inheritance of King <hi>James,</hi> and then left to a son and Heir,
and also to the numerous issue of a Daughter and her Descendents;
and suddenly into the present possession of King <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Great
Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the first; who though affianced
forthwith in Marriage with the Princess <hi>Maria</hi> Sister to the <hi>French</hi>
King <hi>Louis</hi> the 13. Blessed also afterward with a numerous Issue,
Sons and Daughters, as a full Period (in shew) of all former Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and change, through them and their posterity, perpetual.</p>
                  <p>So indeed it appeared to a State-observer, but not seemed good to
the Eye of Providence, whose powerfull Hand hath ordered it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for He is taken away in the strength of his years and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and none of his (in possibility of Reason) to succeed to any
part or portion of his Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>But, to proceed in the continuation of this History to these Times,
and to branch into such particulars, as to draw down to discover
Truth to after-Ages, may seem to some very difficult; the common
Excuse of such as cannot or will not undertake it; and therefore

                  <p>For first, that King <hi>Charls</hi> was lawfully possessed and crowned

                  <p>That He being necessarily imbroiled into some forrein Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
