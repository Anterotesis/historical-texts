         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Shall not long detain thee in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rch; only give we leave in a few words to acquaint thee with the Occasion and scope of this following discourse.</p>
            <p>For the Occasion, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> having taken upon him to be a Champion in the Tents of most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-evangelieall, and often-routed Errors, and in a pompous Treatise, by him published, having thrown much defiance in the face of Truth and her Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: many of them triumphing in glory after their Warfare, others still in Conflict here below. Upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall of this peece of his, I found it a meer white<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sepulchre, specious in the style and pretense of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but made up for the substance, of roiten Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, by broken Arguments, and perverted Scriptures seemingly supported. Whereupon I thought it very seasonable, having by me a little Manuscript compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing certain main Truths opposite to his Errors, to send it abroad, if through the blessing of God it might help to establish some, and prevent those snares of death which he had spread. And I hope the Lord hath blest it unto divers. The Title of that small piece and the Epistle reflecting upon Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and his Book, he found himself very angry, and in great Indignation prints an invective Letter, pen'd by him sitting in the scorners chair, sends it to me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring satisfaction for a charge of some particulars in mine Epistle against him. The particulars char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon him were; sometimes Imperiall dictates, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Arguments; sometimes monstrous Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; sometimes wrested Quotations; sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coth Philosophy; sometimes consequential Blasphemy: to these I may now adde, frequently, packing Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
<pb facs="tcp:58777:3"/>
And he will needs perswade himself that his book is so clear of these crimes, as that I had not lookt into it when I put in this charge against it Now though I had no thoughts of writing any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Book, partly conscious of mine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, partly he having provoked so many of the ablest of men, the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Assembly of Divines, and indeed the whole Orthodox name; yet he pressing upon Me in his Letter after much scorn, and high contempt, to give instances of my charge against him, I thought my self in equity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged so to do, for their satisfaction especially who have not read his Book; for as for such as shall read it, they, if judicious, and impartiall, will easily observe the particulars over and over. Hence Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame my self, otherwise unwilling to think of such an answer to his Letter, as wherein I might give him the instances he required; but weighing withall how useless it would be to the publique, onely to answer a taunting Letter, and produce those particulars, I thought it expedient to adde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further that might be of reall usefulness to Christianity, and thereupon resolved the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Preface, which abounding with two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Errors, <hi>Socinianism</hi> and <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> was most necessary to be called to Account; as likewise the examination of the four first Chapters of his Book, wherein is the Foundation of his Building, but a miserable sandy one. The former through the good hand of God upon me, I have dispatched, and here present it to thee; the latter, I hope, though in the midst of many employments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances by degrees to perform too, if not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily prevented by some better furnished for the Work. Thus for the Occasion; now for the Scope:
<pb facs="tcp:58777:3"/>
It is partly to discover those dangerous Errors all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long carryed on in his Preface against the Grace of God; and the authoritie of Scripture, against both which Mr. <hi>Goodvvin</hi> hath enormously ex al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Reason and Will of man: partly to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and clear up the main Doctrins of Gospel-Truth against those his Errors. And forasmuch as the Doctrins of the Grace of God were with much strength, clearness, and evidence of the Spirit maintained by those famous Lights of the Church who lived in the time of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and the times immediately succeeding, especially <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> and the Fathers assembled in the <hi>Milevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> Councill, where <hi>Augustine</hi> was present, and in the second <hi>Arausican</hi> Councill, I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore distinctly layd downe the severall states of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie, and the refutation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of out of the forenamed Champions for the Truth of Christ, not for their Authority, but for their strength, clearness, elegancy, and excellency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, debasing Man, exalting God, and assigning their peculiar Privileges to the Elect of God. In perusall whereof thou wilt find Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> a son of Error, a disciple of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and easily find a wide difference between the spirit of his Pen, and that of these renowned Antients, the Assertors of the Churches Faith. Reader, I hope thou wilt think it worth thy labour, when thou hast made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to take a view of the main Doctrines of Grace, as by such excellent hands layd out, against such dangerous and destructive Errors, so many Ages since. As for my charge against Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> thou shalt find it made good in the particulars in my Answer to his Letter, wherein thou wilt find him guilty of absurdities enough, and yet the particulars
<pb facs="tcp:58777:4"/>
there produced are but some gleanings for Instanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. I have only One thing more to advertise thee of. It is very likely Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> will make what hast he can to reply upon this my Essay against him. My in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is (the Lord assisting) and as I may gain fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> many employments, and distractions, leisure for the same, to go through his four first Chapters, before I will take any notice of what he shall reply; thou shalt find him in this discovery that I have made, a <hi>Star without Light,</hi> in that which I hope to make, a Builder without a Foundation. For where as in those Chapters should be the Foundation of his after-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, what a miserable One he hath there layd, I hope God will in time discover: and indeed I cannot still but expect, that my further endeavours will be prevented by some more strenuous Undertaker, raised up by the Lord in zeal to his Truth, however, till such a blessing shall appear, I shall be moving, though very slowly, onwards. Now the Lord command his blessing upon thy spirit in the perusall hereof, sanctifying thee by his Truth.</p>

I shall therefore touch upon other things, as no better than impertinent, generally, and hasten to that.</p>
            <p>First, you find some exception against my reflection upon you in the Title and Epistle of my former Book, that you never saw my face, never heard of my name before; Your meaning, I suppose, is, to render me a son of the Earth, an obscure and worthless man. I confess my self such an one: But what if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58777:5"/>
God will by the foolish and weak things of the World confound the Wise and Mighty? You might have made this construction thence, that I had no animosity against your person upon any private interest, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never done me harm neither, which you mention as another aggravation; but onely upon the publick interest of Truth and Christianity did I touch upon you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the main of your grief and distaste is, that I have uttered hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings against the Truths of God. If they had been Truths which you defended, you had sayd something. That which follows, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting me according to the practice of the Heathen, cloathing the Christians in Wolves, and Bears skins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As likewise your high scorn of my expectation to give any stop to your <hi>Gangrene,</hi> may pass for a strain of Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwins</hi> Rhetorique: But whereas you charge the Truths of God by me maintained, as monstrous Principles, uncouth, hard, and horrid Notions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, this passage I must put amongst your consequentiall Blasphemies.</p>
            <p>In the next place you declame against my Book as a dead Drug, lying upon my hands; it is now in the hands of men, let it answer for it self: But whereas you so magnifie your self, as though you was another <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> a man of such name, weight, and worth, that great preferment is little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to discourage any to oppose you, you are in a pleasing dream. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but divers hands will be against you;

Truths maintained in that little Book of mine, which overturn your <hi>Babel.</hi> In the next place you tell me, that I, or some Factor of mine, purchased the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries of two <hi>Diurnalists,</hi> whereas indeed I neither knew, nor thought of any such thing till I saw it done: but howsoever, it is a thing of common course, and for ought I know without offence, for them to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of such Books as are newly printed.</p>
            <p>After this you fall into a raving fit of pride and bitterness, where I leave you to come to your self. Then you beseech me by the love I bear, or pretend to bear to the Lord Christ (which, comparing your sweet water with your bitter, I conceive a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prophanation of the name of Christ) to tell with what goodness of Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I can say that the main Truths of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Electing and Redeeming Grace have been highly assaulted by you. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I refer you to my instances of your consequential Blasphemies, at the end of this my Rescript, and so your admonition here subjoyned may pass. After this you run
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58777:6"/>
your descants, that I termed you an unhappy man. But, Sir, to let aside your trifling, I therefore call you an unhappy man, because you are a bold instrument to serve Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth, and that not onely whiles you live, but in after Ages too, when your bones shall be as rotten in the Grave, as your Errours are now in the World.</p>
            <p>Next you tell me what a daring hand you have for the Truth. Happy was you if you sayd true; less unhappy, if the contrary was not true, That your hand is daring against the Truth. For the Title of your Book, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption Redeemed,</hi> whether right or no, you shall be judged you say by a streighter Rule than my notion: No doubt, and that to your shame.</p>
            <p>In the next place, you tell me that I little know what <hi>Arminianism</hi> indeed meaneth. If I be amongst those that know not the depths of Satan, I am not much the worse; but so much I know of it, as I know that <hi>Arminius</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> are Master and Scholar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth of the Gospel. Then you tax me for dictating rather than arguing. Sir, I was then doing another thing, than ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your book to task; I doubt not but you shall find that in this following discourse I have argued with you.</p>
            <p>In the next place you resent it very deeply, that I should pray that the Lord would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke you. Our Saviour divers times rebuked his Disciples, and Satan in one of his great Apostles: why we may not pray that in Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> he would rebuke the spirit of Error,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58777:6"/>
I know not: I think we pray it in effect as often as we pray, that <hi>His Kingdom may come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this you challenge me to shew you, where you at all, much less seriously, despise the peculiar Grace of God, &amp; boldly bid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to it. I answer, the whole bent of your discours, is both against it, &amp; against Election the ground of it, &amp; carried on with much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance; And even here where you would wipe off this spot, you shew what an adversary you are to it, by a famous contradiction. You demonstrate (you say) the peculiarity of it; that is, in your interpretation, the signal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency &amp; glory of it to consist in this, that it encompasseth the whole world about, and particularly addresseth it self to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind. A worthy demonstration! peculiar, because common; such a thing is light, because it is darkness. Would any man have thought that Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Logick could not distinguish between particular and peculiar? And that what is common, that is, belonging to all (suppose particularly presented and tendered) should yet be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, that is, belonging onely to some?</p>
            <p>I do not much wonder that you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all Orthodox Writers of Primitive and Modern times to be with your self <hi>Pelagian,</hi> forasmuch as you can prove one opposite species to be another, therefore the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause opposite; here is a way of demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which neither <hi>Euelide</hi> nor <hi>Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Concerning the saving Grace of God, you say that we hold it so decreed to them that shall be saved, that there is an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessity

for them to embrace it: You knovv that we maintain the necessity flowing from the Decree of God. In this argument is an hypotheticall necessity. For your own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net here it may well be added to your mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous conclusions. For your challenge of the University, here you lay down my words, where you make much a do about the word <hi>it,</hi> when I say that you may set it off brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what this <hi>it</hi> should refer to. Briefly, it is an indefinite expression very usuall, as much as if I had sayd, that you might set off the matter bravely. Then you deny that you challenge the University: It is evident hence that you do; because though disjunctively you desire their attestation or contestation, yet so confident are you, that if your doctrin be not (as indeed it is nothing less) the Truth of God, you are an high Blasphemer more than once.</p>
            <p>Upon this occasion you inform me of some gracious characters found in <hi>Arminius,</hi> and hereupon I must crave leave to inform you, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was an errant Heretique, though a man so far of name for Piety, that <hi>Austin</hi> in his first Writings against him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to name him, that he might preserve his honour. By this time you are come to the particulars of my charge, and here you are very willing to tell me that I had not read your book. Truly, Sir, I had been a very adventurous man, if I had proclamed you a nourisher of those evil beasts, and had not taken notice of their dens, that I might point them out when called thereto. Though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58777:8"/>
this I will grant you (how much or little soever I had read) a man need not read one quarter of your Book to make good such a charge. But why did I not with one pointed Argument draw blood of this evill beast? That which then I had to do, was onely to give warning against it, and the book by me published doth afford many Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your Doctrins, though it be no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall answer to your Book.</p>
            <p>And whereas here you twit me proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in these words, <hi>Is it fair for you to say, that you never indeed read all</hi> Chrysostoms <hi>Works, whereas you never read so much as one line of them?</hi> I shall for answer return you a few lines out of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks run very cross to your Doctrin (in your long digression contended for, but all in vain) of the Apostafie of True Beleevers. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. I care not if I English it for the Readers sake. <hi>Again by what is past, what is to come is confirmed; for if it be he that establisheth us in Christ (that is, that suffers us not to be moved aside from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58777:9"/>
the Faith in Christ) and he that hath annoynted us, and given the holy Spirit in our hearts, how shall he not give us the things to come? For if he hath given the beginnings, and the foundations, and the root, and the fountain (as the true knowledge of himself, the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit) how shall he not give us the rest? For if those things be given for these, much more he that hath given these will also give those. And if he gave us these things whilst we were yet enemiet, much more will he freely give those things to us being made friends: Wherefore he said not simply the Spirit, but called it the Earnest, that thence thou mightst trust boldly for the whole; for except he would give the whole, he would not have chosen to give the Earnest, and to lose it vainly, and to no end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that which next followes, you please your self with vain talk, then you pick a quarrell with me for my Antithesis, when I say M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Goodwins</hi> boldness will excite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, you like it better to oppose impudence to modesty, take what you like; I hoped a soft word might have found pardon.</p>
            <p>Hence you pass to the particulars of my Charge, all which I shall give you in a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue by and by, mean time touching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particulars.</p>
            <p>First, Imperiall dictates, the sum of what you say here is, 1. That you abound with Arguments no less than <hi>Newcastle</hi> with Coles: Well, sometimes good <hi>Homer</hi> may be taken napping. 2. You fly upon the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Divines, as if the Confession of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58777:9"/>
Faith by them set forth was not proved. Sir, by Scripture it is proved, but whether all those Scriptures you will allow, or not, I cannot tell; this I know, they are many of them above, many of them cross to your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and therefore it is not according to your rule to allow them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, monstrous Conclusions, these you tell me are the genuine issue of mine own Principles, you shall see the contrary presently. Then you give me as my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Founders of my Faith, in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. <hi>Calvin, Musculus, Bullinger, Martyr,</hi> &amp;c. And this, &amp;c. takes in <hi>Beza, Luther, Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Who now are the men of your Faith? What obscure names compared with these? <hi>Armi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Thirdly, your wrested Quotations; if I should instance in the Scriptures wrested by you, together with Authors, I must instance your whole Book—<hi>Tolli tota theatra jube,</hi>—I shall therefore in this place give you a taste of Quotations out of Authors onely. The speciall reason of your quoting Authors,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58777:10"/>
you say is to shew, that your Doctrine wants not an arm of flesh to stand by it; that is, that it hath been held by Orthodox and pious men; but the defence of the truth by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox and pious men, according to the Word of God, is the arm of the Spirit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an arm of Flesh: indeed it hath been onely an arm of Flesh that hath stood by your Doctrines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the greatest opposers of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine were inconsistent with themselves; in this endeavour you shew not them inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent, but your self a Jugler.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, uncouth Philosophy. This by and by with the rest of his fellowes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Consequential blasphemies, here you want my Heifer to plow with, to sinde out the riddle; and then you sweat and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle, and seem to be wandring in a filthy dream, your expressions are so immodest and unchast. I will tell you my riddle briefly. I suppose you rather blinded with error than sinning of malice against the truth, and therefore your blasphemy not intentionall: but upon supposition that they are the truths of God which you oppose, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are his main Gospell Truths) your revilings are so high against them, as they amount to no less than high blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, such as <hi>Paul</hi> was guilty of, when yet he sinn'd of ignorance and unbelief; which I was willing to allay with the term consequentiall; but forasmuch as you are at such a loss about that term, I am content you substitute, blasphemy express. Neither
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58777:10"/>
doe I pass that your Critick Learning will here finde fault with my Antithesis again.</p>
            <p>Here you take occasion to tell me of a Triumphant Argument of yours against E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Reprobation, that it contains this blasphemy in it, That God should repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate himself. Hem I here is a Gorgon indeed! Sir, we shall see the vanity and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous foppery of this Argument when we come to examine it in your Book; in the mean time let me put one question to you that teach that God created all things at once, and that from eternity, did he create himself.</p>
            <p>In the next place you modestly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly (as you say) intreat me to shew you one instance of any of these, yet your humble modesty subjoyns that I may take ten Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities to my assistance; I shall Sir give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of every one of them, and borrow no help in a case so obvious and gross of any one University. But then you require an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility, that I would shew you one spot of your darkness, but that I would not shew you darkness. Sir, whilst I shew you those things, I have nothing but darkness to shew you: Indeed here ten Universities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assist me to satisfie your contradiction. Then you would know why I call your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Arminianism, and being one that loves to hear your self talk, you run an idle wordy descant hereupon. I have shewed you in the following discourse, wherein your Doctrine is not Arminianism onely, but Jesuitism, Pelagianism, and Socinian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, as I had occasion from your Preface, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58777:11"/>
I hope to shew you more of the same kinde hereafter from your Book. As for my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons you have promised to destroy them by the fall of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> upon them, crushing them into Atomes no doubt. Sir, when this great wrack comes, I shall believe the Astrologers of our times, that the last Ecclipse of the Sun portended some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing. In the mean time I thank you that you have given me the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> now for a recompence take you the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell me the nineth to the <hi>Romans</hi> is a wrong field wherein to dig for absolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; but your word is no whit cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with me. You add, that I my self ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my Elect ones liable to be seduced by a spirit of Error, doe little less than shake the foundation of absolute Reprobation. Here first prophanely you call them mine elect, then you argue to this purpose, this liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to seduction is such, as indangereth the salvation of the seduced, or not. If not, 1. Care against it is in vain, because thus, Men whether Elect, or not Elect, will be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thus far at least to be seduced, though all errors in the world were supprest. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; 1. Men not elect shall certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselves, and be seduced by Satan to the loss of salvation. Your limitation (thus far at least) in reference to such, is very Atheological, nor will your Parenthesis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my notion salve your error here. 2. Granting what you say for the elect, yet there is a latitude in this liableness, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb facs="tcp:58777:11"/>
of error are instruments fitted to seduce further, than otherwise they were likely to be; and therefore care is to be had against them, because their salvation as the end en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the care of all means tending to that end, and against all things that tend to cross that end; though it be familiar to you in spight of all Logick to argue from the end to the exclusion of the means, whereas the end infers them; again, because the more they are seduced, the more they dishonor God. 2. Care against it is for their hurt, say you; to this end you add that according to my principles, all the sins of the Elect shall work for good to them, and not only be forgiven them immediately upon the Commission. But, 1. Where do I say they shall be forgiven them immediately upon the Commission? 2. Suppose the sins of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the conclusion turn to their good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their sins not excluded that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive promise, <hi>All things shall work together for good to them that love God;</hi> What then? Then you say a care of preventing their seduction would be a care to keep them from a certain benefit. For answer, let me tell you out of what School you had this Argument, truly out of the same with that prophane Caviller, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5. &amp; 7. who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues thus; but our unrighteousness com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the righteousness of God, therefore is God unrighteous if he take vengeance? and if the truth of God hath abounded through my lie to his glory, therefore should I do ill to forbear lying. 2.

is gross and sordid, things in themselves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, though accidentally of good issue are to be avoyded, and what puny Sophister knows not this? Art thou a Master in Israel and knowest it not? And now having thus far wandred in the first member of your distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you come to the second, that if this liableness to seduction may end in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Elect, then Election staggers, and if so, then Reprobation too: I answer, no such liableness do I understand, as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of the Elect ever did or ever shall perish. Then you tell me, but that you are unworthy to teach me, I might have learned from the 359. and 360. pages of your book, how impertinently I cited these words of the Apostle, the foundation of God stands sure, there will be time and place I doubt not, to shew the falshood of your interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, in the mean time you are unfit indeed to teach me or any man els, because you are such a stranger to the Truth, but ere long you hope to vindicate the nineth to the <hi>Romans</hi> from the monstrous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Doctrine of absolute Reprobation. Once again, the Lord rebuke thee thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring tongue: In the close, you profess your hopes, that I will be more tender of your name and reputation; the Lord make me tender of his Truth, and in tenderness thereof a poor instrument in his hand to blast your errors, whereupon if your name be built, it must take part with them. Now Sir, I have only a basket of your rotten figs and wilde grapes to present you with, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which we have to doe in the Examination of this Preface is, to discover the errors of it, and to cleare up the truth against them. The errors wherewith it is fraught, are of two sorts, yet near a kin, and mutuall supporters each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; both very dangerous, and against the very heart of Christianity; <hi>Socinian,</hi> against the authority of the Scriptures; and <hi>Pelagian</hi> against the grace of God. According to our intention for the discovery and refutation of these, wee shall diligently insist upon those passages in this Preface, where those monsters appear, passing by, or lightly touching upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58777:20"/>
the rest, to avoid tediousnesse and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rtinency: And therefore, whereas we have four parts of this insuing Discourse, the first, his invitation to read his booke, the second, his motives therunto, the third a prevention of objections there-against, the fourth an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for his change of judgement, as he calls it. The first part, or his invitation we shall passe by (what ever observations might be made, shewing the spirit of the Authour) as but the sounding of his trumpet to bid battle to the truth. Upon the same account for his first motive to read his Booke, which is a long and plausible discourse against error in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; we shall not speake much to it; onely a word or two for caution about it. It is, though a discourse against error, yet itself very erroneous. 1. In the aime and tendency of it, which is insensibly and by covert insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, to instill those errours into the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which afterwards are more openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. 2. In the Contexture of it, which manifests together with his insuing discourse, what was the aime of it. To make this clear, we shall take notice of a passage or two in it, and then adde some thing afterwards exprest, which will satisfie, concerning the aime we speake of. 1. For the insinuation of his <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> doctrine against the authority of the Scriptures, we have this expression from him; <q>That a man or woman, who have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years profest the Gospell, may in processe of time come to discover vanity in some erroneous principle or tenet, where-with their judgements had been leavened, for some <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58777:20"/>
considerable space formerly, and so grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a disapprobation or contempt of it; and yet may very possibly think and suppose, that the Gospell favours or countenanceth it, and that otherwise they should never have owned nor approved it. </q> What <hi>Socinianisme</hi> is here vented, against the authority of the word of God, we shal shew hereafter; where we have occasion to insist against this error, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desire the Readers patience till he shall meet with it in due place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the insinuation of his <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the nature of man against the grace of God; generally his high declaiming against errour, as the onely cause of sinne, is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to undermine the doctrine of originall sinne, as to the corruption of the will. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, wee shall transcribe a passage or two wherein he so derives both our ignorance and sinfulnesse from errour, voluntarily by our selves, in our owne persons contracted, as thence hee evacuates the Scripture-doctrine concerning both our naturall blindnesse of mind, and corruption of will, to this purpose, he hath this passage, <q>That errour, and all mis-notions of God, &amp;c. pollute, corrupt, and imbase the mind and understanding of a man, by their union, and communion with them; as a person of a noble house and blood, staines his honour, and reputation by couple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe in marriage with a woman of base parentage and conditions. </q>This is a cleare insinuation, as if the understanding in the naturall man was in a state of great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and honour, contrary to the doctrine of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58777:21"/>
originall sin concerning it, there is none that understands, &amp;c. <hi>vaine man would faine bee wise, though he be borne like a wilde Asses Colt.</hi> But of this more hereafter; Another passage of like import, speaking of erroneous and lying ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions and conceites concerning God, he addes wherwith <q>men willingly suffer their mindes and consciences to bee imbased and corrupted even to a spirituall rottennesse and putrifaction. Againe, that errour disposeth the soule which drinkes it in, and converseth with it, to a spirituall death. </q>In both which he supposeth nothing lesse, then that the soule is by originall sin, through the corruption of the will in a state of spirituall death, rottenesse and putrifaction.</p>
               <p>And thus having shewed from his discourse it self his erroneous aim and insinuation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. It is now time for me further to shew the same by what is afterwards exprest, as I promised, which I shal do by quoting his own words, which in the tenth page of this preface are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is a thing as unquestionable, as that the Sun is up at noon-day, that <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> in men are competent to judge of the things of God, at least of some, yea, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them; or rather indeed of all that are contained in the Scriptures, according to the degree of their discovery and manifestation there: </q>And after some instances whereby he would confirm this doctrine, he comes to this conclusion pag. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Therefore certainly those noble faculties and endowments of <hi>Reason</hi> &amp; <hi>Understanding</hi> in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58777:21"/>
men, as they are sustained, supported, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted (here are, as ever, words enough) by the spirit of God in the generality of men, are in a capacity of apprehending, discerning, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding (plenty of words still) the things of God in the Gospell; yea, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is from the Scriptures, that men act beneath themselves, are remisse and slothfull in awakening those principles of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> that are vested in their natures, or else willingly choke, suppresse, and smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them </q>(who may complaine for want of words, but this is his perpetual manner, which I shall not need after these hints to take much notice of) <q>if they remaine in the snare of unbeleefe. </q>Then after a little more discourse he hath (with reference to a text of Scripture which wil not own his inference) these words; <q>Which clearly implyeth that men who act and quit themselves, according to the true principles of that reason, which God hath planted in them, cannot but beleeve and be partakers in the precious faith of the Gospell.</q> To the same purpose in the fourth chapter of his book, pag. 41. He professeth his opinion, <q>That that life and salvation, which Christ in reality of designe, and with semblable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the sight of God, had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning purchased by his death for men; did, or doth (as it were) in the first breake, or dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, appear and discover it selfe in those principles of naturall light, reason, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conscience, understanding, &amp;c. which are found in the generality of men upon their coming into the world: Then he tells us,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58777:22"/>
That men generally, as they grow up in the world, convert those principles of light and understanding to make provision for the lusts of the flesh; and that partly by an un-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ossitancy, partly out of an inordinate propenfity to comport with the world, they suffer their judgements and understandings to be corrupted, adulterated, imbased, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by many false and foolish Principles, and notions, which turne them quite a side from a regular and due prosecution of that life and salvation, which is in Christ for them, and might have been obtained by them; and that ignorance, or incapacity rather, of the things of eternal life which is in men, they have voluntarily contracted and brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves.</q> By this time, Reader, thou wilt discern something of the mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity lurking in this discourse of his against error; the refutation of what is here averred, we must defer a while, til we shall meet with it in its proper place, where, the Lord assisting, we are resolved to grapple close with Master <hi>Goodwin,</hi> and to make it (we hope) cleare as the Sunne, that he is not only a Teacher of falshood, but of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie; in the meane time we must follow him, as he goes on, and in the first place we shall finde him a <hi>Socinian.</hi>

conscience, heart and soule, and all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee, to strengthen ttine hand to a diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall of the Treatise ensuing is, the high necessity that lyeth upon thee (as it doth upon all the world besides respectively) to awake, raise, and engage all those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy faculties, and endowments which God hath vested in thee, reason, judgement, memory, understanding, about the things of thine eternall peace; and because this Iron I feare hath of late been much blunted with the earthly conceits, and suggestions of many, I am desirous to put so much the more strength to it; but to me it is the first borne of wonder and astonishment, that amongst men, professing the glorious Gospell of Christ, who is the wisdome of God; yea, amongst the Teachers themselves of this wisdome; men should be found, who thinke they doe God and men very good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in perswading men wholly to lay aside their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, judgements, understandings in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and not to make use of, or engage any of these in their enquiries after matters of a Spirituall, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall concernment; doubtlesse Satan is a debtor to those persons, who have seasoned the world with the unsavoury salt of such a Principle as this, for all the religious respects, and high entertainment, that have of late been given by many amongst us, to all those wicked, sencelesse, saplesse, hideous, and blasphemous Doctrines and Opinions, which like the dead Froggs of <hi>Aegypt</hi> make the Land to stinke; for if men may not interpose with their reasons, and judgements, to distinguish between Spirit and Spirit, Opinion and Opinion, why should not one Spirit be beleeved as well as another? and one Opinion received as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or if the difference be not to be made by the interposure and exercise of reason in a man, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by what other principle or meanes ought it to be

                  <p>Now he begins to come closer to his work, and by bolder steps then hitherto, moves on to the open venting of such Doctrines, as he durst but nibble at till now.

But let us enquire into his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58777:23"/>
Doctrine, and the mystery of deceit working in the bowels of it, and that by distinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in particulars, which he hath fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently wrapt up together in generall.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Then it is true, that in some sence Reason is to be made use of in these enquiries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Spirituall concernments, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Suppose an Heathen, not yet owning the true God, and his Word, he is by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments propounded to his reason to be dealt with; by the Booke of the Creation to prove the one true God, as likewise by extrinsecall arguments to be drawne to read the Word of God, that by the word it selfe, as the Spirit shall please to enlighten by it, he may come to owne the Divine Canon, for the true word of the true God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Granting the Scripture the un-erring Word of God, in whatsoever it shall deliver, we are diligently to employ our reason, in searching into the minde of God by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as our light to enlighten, and rule to direct our reason, as that word, which is able to make wise unto Salvation, and to make the man of God perfect, throughly furnisht to every good worke. And in two things here are our reasons to be exercised; 1. The Grammar of the Scriptures, or the formes of expression, to finde out the truth of them. 2. The Logick of the Scripture, or the true discourse thereof, and this in three things; the Scope, the Context, and Selfe-consent; Scripture compared with Scripture, the more obscure places interpreted by the clearer, and so in all the analogy of faith held. Now, Sir,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58777:24"/>
you know very well that in this sence, and upon these termes, none of those, against whom you bend your stile, deny the use of reason, for they doe not teach that men in seeking into the meaning of the Scripture must become either fooles, or mad-men, or Enthusiasts. And was it in this sence only that you require the use of reason, or in any such sence as preserves the due authority of the Word, as for it selfe to be beleeved, as the perfect rule, you had never raised such Tragedies about the use of reason, or the laying it aside, as here you have; but we shall now passe to the enquiry, in what sence it is to be laid aside, and there I am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid we shall finde you requiring the use of it, so as to evacuate the authority of the Word, therefore we say,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is true, that in some sence man must lay aside his reason, in matters of religion, and in enquiries after matters of Spirituall, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall concernment; as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That our assent to such truthes, as the Scriptures hold forth, may be the assent of Faith, the immediate ground of it must not be the Selfe-evidence of the thing testified by the Scriptures unto reason, but the authority of God testifying. Hence that knowne Doctrine of the Schooles, that the formall object (I like as well to say the proper ground) of faith is the first truth, or God himselfe revealing his minde. Hence suppose a truth taught in the Scripture is likewise demonstrated to my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by Philosophicall arguments; (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, That God created the world, that is, made it of nothing;) so farre is my assent to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58777:24"/>
this truth, the assent of Divine faith, as it is grounded upon the authority of Divine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that assent which is grounded upon Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall demonstration, is not Divine faith, but only Humane knowledge. He that trusts a man no further then he sees him (as we say Proverbially) trusts him not at all. Hence the Apostle, <hi>Through faith we understand</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 3</note> 
                     <hi>that the worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that things which are seene were not made of things that doe appeare.</hi> It is only the Christian, sure, not the meere Philosopher, that by faith under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands this, though haply both of them may understand it by demonstration, but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian alone by Divine testimony for its owne authority assented to.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 We may not oppose our naturall concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Word of God, or make our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions before-hand the rule of what we will receive, for the Word and revealed Will of God, and what we will reject; but what the Grammar, and Logick of the Word holds forth, must be the rule of our apprehensions, whether we can discerne how in reason the things affirmed should be, or not (we must not <hi>Afferre sensum Scripturae,</hi> but <hi>referre)</hi> otherwise we subject the authority of Gods Truth to our owne apprehensions, and beleeve him not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath said it, but because we by reason see it; neither shall we ever otherwise embrace the Word of God, for as much as the Word it selfe teacheth many things; 1. Above reason, <hi>Great is the mystery of godlinesse,</hi> saith the Apostle; yet it is no great mystery, if reason may comprehend it. What reason of men or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58777:25"/>
Angels could ever have thought of such a thing, as the three Persons of the God-head, as the Personall union of God and Man in the Mediatour, the imputation of the Mediatours righteousnesse to beleevers; of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne to his Posterity, with many others? or who comprehends clearly these things, at least some of them, when revealed in the Word?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Many things against reason, that is, crosse to the apprehensions of corrupt reason, as it is now in all naturall men; <hi>The mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the flesh is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. The naturall man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse unto him, neither can hee know them, because they are Spiritually discerned.</hi> (Your fruitlesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to avoyd the strength of this text of Scripture, we shall consider in due place.) It is one vertue of the VVord preached, to cast downe the reasonings of the naturall man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. Many others of like import we shall have occasion afterwards to mention. On the one hand such is the blindnesse and wickednesse of man by Originall sinne, which are withall daily encreased by themselves and Satan; on the other hand, such is the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious height, and transcendent purity of the Word of God, that mans reason must receive light from it, is not a light, otherwise then as enlightned by it, whereby to judge of it.</p>
                  <p>And as the truth we are now upon is evident by the Word, so is it by all experience; name me any one people, or any one person, since man was Created upon earth, that without the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58777:25"/>
word or voyce of God for direction, by the light and ducture of reason, either worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the true God, or did not fall upon a most abominable way of Worship, or light upon the Gospel-way of Salvation, to omit all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deviations. Nay, you your selfe, who leane so much to your owne wisdome, and are so much in advancing the Rush-Candle of reason, against the Sun of the Scripture, are amongst others an evidence, even in this the Master-piece of your reason, the Treatise in hand, of the incompetency of mans reason not enlightened by the Word, through the Spirit, to judge of the things of the Spirit of God, whilst you fall so wretchedly foule upon the maine Doctrines of Predestination, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Perseverance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now if in this sence Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that reason is to be laid aside, why doth he raise a Controversie with those, who in the other sence, formerly specified, not only grant, but urge the use of it? But that Master <hi>Goodwin</hi> in this sence denies the laying it aside, and exalts it as the Judge of the VVord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and above the word, seemes in the first place not obscurely insinuated, in the second place openly exprest, by some passages of his Pen.</p>
                  <p>For the first not obscurely insinuating it, what shal we say to that Doctrine of his, which he sayes is much to be observed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. of this Preface? That a man or woman, who have for many yeares profest the Gospel, may in processe of time come to discover vanity in some erroneous Principle, or Tenet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<q>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58777:26"/>
their judgements have been leavened for some considerable space formerly, and so grow into a dis-approbation or contempt of it, and yet may very possibly think the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell favoureth, or countenanceth it, and that otherwise they should never have owned, nor approved it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it appeares, that in your account er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour may be discerned by reason, which yet shall be thought by the Gospell to be owned, so that the Gospell shall not be the rule by which to judge of truth and errour, but reason shall be the rule by which to judge, whether the Gospell it selfe (to wit, that sacred Writ which is received in the Church of God for the Gospell) be true or false. Then you goe on to the same purpose; <q>Now when a person shall be brought into the snare of such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, or imagination as this, that the Gospell in some of the veins or carriages of it, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or asserteth things that are vaine. </q>But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you goe any further (allowing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority of the Gospell) it is unpossible that such a conceit should have place, that the Gospell in any of the veines or carriages of it should assert any thing that is vaine. He goes on; <q>Or if no good consistency with reason or truth; </q>here is your rule, to judge of any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in matters of Faith, and that whereby the Gospell it selfe must be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the consistency or inconsistency of it with reason; so farre it must be truth, as vaine mans blind reason judgeth it consistent with it selfe. You conclude, He is in a ready posture to throw from his soule all credence of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58777:26"/>
Divine authority of the Gospell, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme it no better then a Fable devised by men; so farre then as you comprehend by reason, the things taught in the Gospell, to be agreeable to reason, neither above it, nor crosse thereto, so farre you will embrace the Gospell; if any thing you finde in it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, you are in a ready posture to esteeme it no better then a Fable: I doubt you are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by your discourse here, and other-where, for most certaine it is, that there are many things in the Gospell both above your reason, and crosse to it.</p>
                  <p>But Sir, allowing the divine authority of the Gospell, It is impossible that any man should discover an errour in matter of faith, and religion, but he therein discernes it to be dis-owned and condemned by the Gospell, and the Gospell it selfe was the rule and the light whereby he discovered it; and the fruit of his discovery will not be (as you reason here) the blame of the Gospell, but of his owne former ignorance of the Gospell. But if here you have not spoken openly enough, you have discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your selfe fully, <hi>pag.</hi> 335. of your booke, where disputing against a maine Gospel-truth, namely, the unchangeable love of God to the Saints, your words are these. <q>Besides whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any such assurance of the unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the love of God, to him that is godly, as the objection speaks of, can be effectually and upon sufficient grounds given unto men is very questionable; </q>yea, I conceive there is more reason to judge otherwise then so. But let us hear what you say next; Yea, (that which is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58777:27"/>
more, it is indeedmore then enough) I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that in case any such assurance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse of Gods love were to be found in, or could regularly bee deduced from the Scriptures, it were a just ground to any intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and considering man to question their authority, and whether they were from God or no. Now have you spoken out; evident it is, as the light of the sunne, that you make mans reason (blind and corrupt as it is) a rule above the Scriptures, whereby to try them, and the only touch-stone of them; for that which may be found in, or regularly deduced from the Scriptures, must needs be the voyce of the Scripture in concordance with it self, by what rule now shall we question it, but that of our reason, as above it?</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, you must give me leave to tell you that your owne pen hath proclaimed you a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Socinian.</hi> And now let us see, whether this conclusion leads, even to the utter overthrow of the Scriptures: By the same reason that you may question this doctrine, found in, or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deduced from the Scriptures, you may question any other, and the authority of the Scriptures thereupon; a ready way for all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and erroneous Teachers. The Papists may question the authority of the Scripture, if Gods hatred against Image-worship, may bee found in, or regularly deduced from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; you may question the authority of Scriptures, if holinesse of life, or whatsoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truth (as wel one as another) may be found in, or regularly deduced from them. Let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you a more compendious way to maintain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58777:27"/>
your errours against personall election, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, against the dominion of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exprest, against the confinement of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the elect, against the perseverance of the Saints, against the efficacious influence of grace upon the will of man; and even this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour concerning the light and ability of the naturall man, for discerning and applying the things of the spirit of God, held forth in the Gospell; trouble not your selfe to torture the Scriptures, that they may seeme to witnesse for you; but for as much as they speake so much against you, question their authority, and whether they be from God, or not. And why should you not doe as your elder brethren of the <hi>Socinian-</hi>family have done before you? Let us first see their doctrines, as like to yours, as one egge is like another, what saith <hi>Smalcius?</hi> It is certaine, that whatsoever is contrary to reason, is neither extant in the holy Scriptures, neither can it be gathered from them, <hi>De Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto vero &amp; naturali Dei filio, C.</hi> 6. What saith <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storodius,</hi> another head of that Tribe? If rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or understanding expresly prove the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of persons in God to be false, how may it come into the minde of any man, right in his wits, that yet notwithstanding it is true, and may be proved by the Word of God? Now adde Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> doctrine, and see if it speak not the same language. I verily beleeve (by the <hi>Secinian</hi> not <hi>Apostolicall</hi> faith) that in case any such assurance of the unchangeablenes of Gods love, was to be found in, or could regularly be deduced from the Scriptures, it was a just ground to any intelligent and considering man, to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58777:28"/>
their authority, and whether they were from God or no? These doctrines, plainly allow not the Scripture in the Grammar and Logique of it, the rule and light to guide and conclude mans reason; but exalt the reason of man, as judge above it; whence, whatsoever Article of faith they dispute about, nothing is more usuall with them then this objection, this or that is false, because contrary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>We have now seen their doctrines, let us see their deductions, which likewise must be yours, your doctrine being the same. Hence they proceed to deny many Articles of the faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause contrary to reason, at least in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions. The <hi>Racovian Catechisme,</hi> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their Theology, or Heresie rather, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the doctrine of the three persons in one essence, <hi>p.</hi> 49. the two natures in the one person of Christ, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. Danies that Christ by his death satisfied for us, and merited eternall life for us, <hi>pag.</hi> 261. And all, because these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, say they, to right reason. <hi>Smalcius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Franzius</hi> opposeth Originall sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (if he say true) it is utterly contrary to reason, that an innocent person by once sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning should infect all his posterity. These for a touch of your Doctrine, and whither it leads.</p>

                  <p>To what end are these waste words? 1. The Scripture is the rule, and reason is the eye; but as the Scripture is the rule, so is it the light too, by which this eye must be enlightened, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it is too darke to apply this rule. It is by the Scriptures that a right understanding is had of them, and a dextrous faculty for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them, they being the meanes by the Holy Ghost appointed, and sanctified, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening and sanctifying the reason of man. The Scripture is not only a rule for tryall, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> is that of the Architect, but for instructing too; it is such a rule, as gives rules for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and directing in all matters of Religion, and even for the use of it selfe, as a rule; and indeed that you may the lesse wonder hereat, all Arts are such rules, as give rules for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing themselves.</p>
                  <p>Suppose this Geometricall question was to be debated', whither in a right angled Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle the square of the Hypolemise be equall to the square of the sides? I thinke you will grant, that we must fetch the demonstration from Geometry it selfe, and the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must conclude us; we must not say, though this proposition be demonstratively concluded in Geometry, yet we will question it, only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed here is the difference; A Geometricall demonstration renders the conclusion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to Principles, and former propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in Geometry, by which it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but withall cleare to reason; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of a Divine truth by Scripture is many times obscure to reason, though clearly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

to Principles, and other Doctrines in Scripture, because even those Principles and Doctrines proving it, are to mans reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not for want of light in them, but through the blindnesse of it obscure. Yet shall reason see the legitimacy of the proofe, from Principles and Doctrines, in Scripture laid downe, when it hath very obscure apprehensions, both of the thing contained in the conclusion, and the things contained in the Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines proving it; these things faith belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the authority of the word affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. You deale with the Scriptures, as he, that because the rule and plummet doth not verifie the judgement, which he made by his eye at a guesse, he will therefore by his eye question the rule and plummet themselves; whilst you take liberty to question the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures, and whether they be from God or not, upon supposall of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found in them, or regularly deduced from them, which relisheth not with your reason.</p>

                  <p>Words to no purpose still; 1.

                  <p>Now if the Scriptures themselves be upon no other termes, nor in any other case serviceable, or usefull unto men, for the tryall of Doctrines and Opinions, but only as and when they are clearly understood by them, it clearly followes, that whatsoever is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and necessary to bring men to a true understanding of the Scriptures, is of equall necessity for the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing of Doctrines, and to interpose, or be made use of in all affaires and concernments in Religion; if then the reasons, judgements, and understandings of men must of necessity interpose, act, argue, debate, and consider before the true sence and minde of God in any Scripture can be duly apprehended, understood, and beleeved by men, it is a plaine case that these are to be

used, and to be interessed in whatsoever is of any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious consequence, or concernment to us.

                  <p>For example, If there be another sence to be given of such, or such a passage of Scripture, either contrary unto, or differing from that, which I conceive to be the minde of God here, which hath the same rationall, or intellectuall savour and taste with this, that is, which as well suits with the words, agrees with the Context, falls in with the scope and subject matter in hand, is as accordable with Scripture-assertion else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, suppose such a thing possible, how is it yet possible that reason should determine which is the true sence? If both sences have both Scripture and reason equally for them, as is here supposed, whence shall reason frame a judgement for this rather then that, or for that rather then this?

                  <p>We have here an Answer to the Objection, first begun with an hardy and venturous asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with great confidence set off, that the naturall man may discerne of all the Truthes of God contained in the Scriptures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their degree of discovery, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation there, that is, according as they are more or lesse clearly laid downe there; That it is affirmed here of naturall men, is evident both from the Objection it selfe, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58777:34"/>
in divers passages of it. Secondly, This assertion endeavoured to be proved by severall instances, but neither any of them, nor all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reach the proofe, there being nothing at all in them thus applyed, but meere fallacies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the part to the whole; Suppose these instances were obvious enough to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, it doth not therefore follow that he can discerne all Scripture-truthes, this is too slender an induction of particulars to prove the generall; And as all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labour of this fallacy,, so the last instance particularly. Suppose the naturall man may discerne some things to be beleeved, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, it doth not thence follow, that he may discerne all things of that kinde.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From unequals, as if equals; 1. The Naturall man hath light to discerne some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Law of God unto Conviction, yet in divers cases this light is very glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and vanishing; it doth not hence follow that he hath light to discerne all the Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truthes of the Gospel. Instances belonging to the Law are, the first, second, and third. 2 By Naturall light may in divers cases a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy fulfilled be discerned, comparing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with the Prediction of it. Thus in the fourth instance might the dayes of the Messiah have been discerned by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who owned, and conversed with those Prophesies, which fore-told them, and that being discerned, a granted duty likewise, depending on it, must needs be discerned, as that the Messiah was to be embraced, and sins to be repented of; but neither doth it hence follow, that all Gospel
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58777:35"/>
Mysteries might be discerned: as for your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the meaning may very well be, why not without a Monitor? 3. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by Naturall light the Omnipotency of God may be discerned, and thence the possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Resurrection of the dead (for that is it the Apostle urgeth;) why should it be incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to men, as though impossible with God? Still will it not hence follow, that more Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel truthes may be discerned, though many Attributes of the Divine Nature may in some measure be discerned by Naturall light, and workes thereon depending; yet doth it no wise hence follow, that therefore all Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell truthes are discernable; of this kinde is the fifth Instance, there being a great disparity betwixt these and those.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From the Argument to the Question, this in the fourth Instance, the Question to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is of Naturall men, the instance here for proofe of it is of the Saints; an Argument al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impertinent. <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 From the Object: The Command of God, to the Adjunct related to it, mans abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for discerning it, the Command, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation aequivalent: <hi>Why doe yee not discerne? and why of your selves doe yee not judge?</hi> and when God cals men to beleeve, and repent, he must suppose them in a capacity to distinguish and discerne betwixt the things, &amp;c. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer hereto from the command of discerning, to the power of discerning, there is no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, except God who commands, give that power, man commanded cannot understand many maine things; otherwise why doth <hi>David</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58777:35"/>
pray so earnestly, that God would open his eyes, <hi>that he may behold the wonderfull things of his Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Psal. 119. ver. 18. <hi>That he would give him understanding, that he might keep his Law,</hi> ver. 34? Why doth the Apostle pray for the <hi>Ephesians, That God would give unto them the spirit of Wisdome, and revelation in the knowledge of Christ, that the eyes of their understanding being enlightened, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ey might know what is the hope of his calling,</hi> 1 Ephes. 17, 18? Why doth the same Apostle teach, <hi>That the Naturall man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God?</hi> adding the reason, <hi>because they are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually discerned;</hi> If the Naturall man can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all the truthes of God, all Gospel My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. In a word, to argue from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in generall, to ability for performance in things of Spirituall nature is an old <hi>Pelagian</hi> errour; the Lord commands the <hi>Iewes</hi> to make to themselves new hearts, but otherwhere he declares himselfe the Maker thereof; to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise their hearts, but otherwhere it is his promise to doe it. Christ commands the <hi>Iewes</hi> to beleeve on the light, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 36, yet could they not, as being hardned, and of whom it was long since Prophesied that they should not 39, 40. A thousand instances might be given to confirme this truth: but we shall have more occasion afterwards; in the meanetime, when the <hi>Pelagians</hi> were thus wont to argue, from the command to the power, as <hi>Austine</hi> every where refutes them, by the promise of God to worke in the Elect by peculiar grace, what he requires, and by the prayers of the Saints, and by their thanksgivings, and the like; so he layes downe this generall conclusion.

                  <p n="5">5 From <hi>Disparates,</hi> as one and the same, he affirmes such a knowledge in the power of the Naturall man, as whence he may repent

and beleeve, nay must, for thus he inferres; that men, who act and quit themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true Principles of that reason, which God hath planted in them, cannot but beleeve, and be partakers of the precious faith of the Gospel; and repentance he requires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, as is evident in that passage of his, God cals upon all men every where to repent, and so to beleeve; if they cannot but beleeve, and that they may beleeve they must repent; then from this knowledge in the Naturall mans power, both faith and repentance necessarily ensue. That this knowledge is in the power of the Naturall man, according to his Doctrine, is evident, because the Objection and Answer is about the Naturall man, whence he inferres this conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Now for answer, here is the fallacy, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds that knowledge which may be in the Naturall man, with that which cannot be but in the Spirituall.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold knowledge about Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things:

The former Historical, or of Logical apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Propositions rather then of things; or of Propositions only distinctly, of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Propositions confusedly, and afar off; as when a man reads an History of persons, places, &amp;c. but sees them not with his eye.</p>
                  <p>The latter <hi>Iniuitivè,</hi> or of Spirituall Vision, the things themselves in the light of the Spirit, beheld, as it were by Vision, distinctly, and at hand; the former like that knowledge which

                  <p>Reader, here we must grapple close with him; observe in his owne words what here he saith about the understanding of the Naturall man, and his power to make use of it for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and beleeving: now one of these two he must needs affirme, either that he may so use his naturall understanding, as thence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any peculiar and higher worke of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, he may repent, and beleeve, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he must; or else upon such use of it, as he may make, he shall certainly receive such a worke of the Spirit upon his soule, as thence not only may, but must faith and repentance be produced: whether of these he affirmes, I charge it with 1. Evident falshood, 2. With <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, for the falshood of both these I shall use only foure Arguments to evince it.</p>
                  <p>I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the doctrine of Naturall corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we be not sufficient of our selves, as of our selves, to thinke a good thought; If there be none in the state of naturall corruption that understands, that seekes after God; If that that is borne of the flesh be flesh; If in this flesh there dwels no good thing; If the naturall man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, but they are foolishnesse unto him, neither can
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58777:38"/>
know them, because they are Spiritually discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; If the flesh, and the lustings thereof be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit, and the lustings thereof; If in the regenerate with the flesh, the Law of sinne is served in opposition to the minde, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law of God; If vaine man though he would faine be wise, yet is borne like a wilde Asses Colt; If the naturall man be dead in trespasses and sins; If he be darknesse; If the minding of the flesh be enmity against God; If it be not subject to the Law of God, neither can be, so that they that are in the flesh cannot please God; then in neither of those sences is faith and repentance in the Naturall mans power.</p>
                  <p>But the Antecedent, or the former is true.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Consequent, or the latter.</p>
                  <p>As for those frivolous exceptions, which you have against some of these particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning naturall corruption, we shall blow them away when we come to them, for they are light chaffe.</p>
                  <p>II.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the Doctrine of the Naturall mans subjection to Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Satan be the Prince of the world, the god of the world; If the course of the world in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, be according to the Prince of the power of the Aire, the spirit that workes effectually in the children of disobedience; If Satan, the strong man, have such possession of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, as without the peculiar worke of the Holy Ghost, as the stronger, he cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:58777:38"/>
Then is not repentance, and faith, in either of the two named sences in the power of the naturall man.</p>
                  <p>But the former is true.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the latter.</p>
                  <p>III.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the subjection of the Naturall man to the Law, as the Covenant of Workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If in this estate of naturall corruption and subjection to the Devill therein, all Naturall men be under the Law, as the Covenant of Workes, and the Law only reveales sinne, and wrath, stirres up and increaseth finne, but gives no strength against it; <hi>When we were in the flesh, the motions of sinne, which were by the Law, did worke in our members,</hi> Rom. 7. 5. <hi>Sin tooke occasion by the Commandement, and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence,</hi> ver. 11.</p>
                  <p>Then as formerly.</p>
                  <p>But the former is here true likewise.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the latter.</p>
                  <p>IV.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the Doctrine of Regeneration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Regeneration be (as the word sounds) a New Birth, a birth of the Spirit, in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the naturall Birth, as the birth of the Flesh; a birth not of bloud, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God; a quickning of such as were dead in trespasses and sins; a resurrection from the dead, a new creation; If none can come unto Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept drawne of the Father; If not of workes that we have done, but of his owne grace; <hi>If not of him that wils, nor of him that runs, but of God who sheweth mercy; If a calling out of darknesse; If

                  <p>But the former is true.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the latter.</p>
                  <p>Further consideration of the falshood of this Doctrine we shall have in that which followes, shewing the <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Now for the <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> of this Doctrine.</head>
               <p n="1">1 SUppose it acknowledge no supernaturall grace, (and therefore no grace) but only toying with the word Grace, ascribes saving vertues and operations to Nature, and an assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from God, proportion'd and attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd to the heedfull exercise and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of naturall abilities, then is it evidently <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and that of the first stamp.</p>
               <p>But if this be not the spirit of this Doctrine those conclusions here laid downe are very closely exprest.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <q>That men act beneath themselves, </q>(and here he speakes of the generality of men) <q>are remisse, and slothfull, in awakening those Principles of light and understanding that are vested in their Natures, or else willingly choake, suppresse, and smother them, if they remaine in the snare of unbeleefe.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <q>That men who act, and quit themselves according to the true Principles of that reason which God hath planted in them, cannot but beleeve, and be partakers of the precious faith of the Gospel. </q>Let us now adde a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58777:39"/>
in his owne words presently after, and this will yet more clearly appeare to have been his meaning which we here suppose; his words are as followeth. <q>That about the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Grace of God vouchsafed unto men, there is a great abuse of the word Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and so of the word Supernaturall, a word not found in the Scriptures, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, or vertually;</q>  (the grosse falshood whereof we shall see in due place) and that <q>the Scripture knoweth not the word Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in any such sence, wherein it should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the unregenerate state of a man from the regenerate,</q> (as false as the former, as in due time shall be demonstrated.) Now this Commentary of his owne is so manifest for the sence we here suppose, as needs no insisting upon; for if the efficacy of Grace be not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, then neither is Grace it selfe as the Principle, nor any effects of Grace, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, repent, &amp;c. supernaturall; for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, operation, and effects are all of one kinde, naturall or supernaturall; and so Grace is nothing else but a naturall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and improvement.</p>
               <p>But then, what shall be his meaning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in his explication of the Parable of the Talents, where he speakes thus: <q>That in case men will stirre up, and lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves accordingly, in the improvement of such abilities and gifts, as shall from time to time be vouchsafed to them, they may by vertue of the bounty, and gracious decree of God in that behalfe, attaine, and receive from God what proportion, and measure of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58777:40"/>
the Spirit and Grace of God they can desire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I answer; The worke of this Spirit of Grace upon their hearts, if it be supernaturall, he contradicts himselfe, who will not allow that word either formally, or vertually about the efficacy of Grace; if he doe not contradict himselfe, this worke of the Spirit must be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing slse but such an influx, as is attemper'd, and proportion'd to mans Naturall acting, and therefore naturall. But this was the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent manner of his great Apostle <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to play fast and loose at every turne with the words <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> I much suspect that very Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> which <hi>Austine</hi> layes downe in his owne words, <hi>Lib. de grat. Christi, &amp;c. c.</hi> 4. to be here touched: <hi>We,</hi> saith <hi>Pelagius, distinguish thus these three; In the first place we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, to be able; in the second, to will; in the third, to be; To be able, we place in Nature, to will, in free Choyce, to be, in effect. That first, to be able belongs properly to God, who hath conferred it upon his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the two others, that is, to will, and to be, are to be referred unto man, because they descended from the fountaine of Free will; therefore in the will, and in the good worke, the praise is of man, yea, both of man and God, who hath given to him the possibility of the will it selfe, and of the work, and who alwayes helps that possibility it selfe with the ayde of his Grace, but that men may be able to will good, and to finish it, this is only of God.</hi> See now what <hi>Austine</hi> here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiseth, concerning <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Concession of Grace, (which, how rightly it suits Master <hi>Goodwin,</hi> let the Reader judge. <q>Whensoever (saith he) we heare that he confesseth the aide of Divine Grace, we ought to know, that he

SUppose it acknowledge no habitual grace upon the will renewing it, nor effectuall acting, and determining it, but all the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of grace acknowledged (be it naturall or supernaturall) is onely for inlightening the understanding, and exciting the will to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it selfe; whence it may come to passe, that the will may, as to the event, obey, or not obey the call of God. This is partly no more then what <hi>Pelagius</hi> acknowledged, partly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to that grace, which the Orthodox Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers maintained against him.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Observe here, that he puts all upon the Understanding, as if all the assistance of grace necessary, was onely for enlightening it.</p>

and effectuall, and peculiar, and of infallible issue for conversion, and therefore not common to those who were converted, with those who were not, but peculiar to the converted. But let us see the truth of what is here asserted.</p>
               <p>And first, What <hi>Pelagius</hi> acknowledged (as much for ought I can discern as Mr. <hi>Goodwin,) August. lib: de gratiâ Christi contra Pelag. &amp; Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest. chap,</hi> 10. Thus reports him, <q>When he had a long time affirmed, that not by the aide of God, but of our selves in our selves, the will is made good; he objected against himselfe, out of the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians chap.</hi> 2. and how (saith he) shall that of the Apostle stand, <hi>It is God that workes in us, both to will and to doe;</hi>
                  </q> Then, that he might, as it were, answer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which he saw so vehemently against his opinion; going on he addes, <q>He works in us to will what is good, to wil what is holy, whilst he inflames us, who are addicted to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, after the manner of the dumb beasts, loving only the things present, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the glory to come, and with promise of rewards; whilst by the revelation of wisdom hee stirs up the listlesse Will to desire after God, whilst he exhorts us to all that is good.</q> To the same purpose, <hi>c.</hi> 7. and <hi>c.</hi> 41.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What <hi>Austine</hi> requires in his answer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when he had first discovered his subtlety, that all that he intends here, by revelation of wisdome, and exhortation may be nothing else but (according to his former doctrine) <note place="margin">Effectuall and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining grace upon the Will.</note> the law of God and doctrine of his word; (as all that Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> means by his concession of grace is nothing but what is natural) He addes,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58777:41"/>
                  <hi>But no such grace will we owne:</hi> Let him at length acknowledge that grace, whereby the greatnesse of the glory to come, is not onely promised, but is withall beleeved, and hoped for; nor only is wisdom revealed, but withall it is belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; nor onely is all that is good exhorted to, but perswaded; for all have not faith, who by the Scriptures hear the Lord promising the Kingdome of heaven; neither are all perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who are exhorted that they would come to him, who saith, <hi>Come unto me all yee that labour.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial grace but what is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that grace which gives to be able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the cal of God, gives effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to obey. The grace of Christ not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but peculiar to all those and onely those, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by it. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version from God.</note> But who they are that have faith, and who are perswaded to come to him, hee hath showne clearly enough, where he saith, <hi>No man can come unto me, except the father draw him;</hi> and a little after, where he speakes of unbeleevers, <hi>I have said unto you</hi> (saith he) <hi>that no man can come to me except it be given him of the father, Iohn</hi> 6. 44. and 65. This grace <hi>Pelagius</hi> must confesse, if hee will not only be called, but likewise be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. Hearken to this Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> least your Christianity be called into question. And <hi>chap.</hi> 12. speaking of the same grace; <q>by this grace, saith he, we not only know what to do, but we do what we know; nor only doe we beleeve what we should love, but we love what we beleeve. </q>Then he goes on <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <q>If this grace must be called doctrine, let it be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but so, as that we beleeve, that God poures it into the soul more deeply and inwardly by an unspeakable sweetnesse, not only by those who plant and water outwardly, but also by himselfe, who gives the increase in secret, so as not only to shew the truth but to bestow love.</q> For so doth God <hi>teach those who are called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to his purpose,</hi> giving at once both to know <note place="margin">The teaching of divine grace, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall upon the wil.</note> what they should doe, and to doe what they know; whence the Apostle to the <hi>Thessalonians 1 Epistle 4. 9.

               <p>But hee that knowes what he ought to doe, and doth it not, hath not yet learned of God according to Grace, but according to the Law; not according to the Spirit, but according to the Letter. Then <hi>chap.</hi> 14. speaking of the same effectuall teaching of grace, Of this manner of teaching, saith he, the Lord sayes, <hi>Every one who hath heard and learned of the father, comes to me;</hi> whosoever therefore hath not come, it is not rightly said of him, he hath heard indeed, and learned that he should come; but he will not doe what hee hath learned: In no wise is it <note place="margin">The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of grace determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58777:42"/>
done, but that likewise it may doe what it knowes. And hence, when God teacheth not by the letter of the Law, but by the grace of the spirit; he so teacheth, that what any one hath learned, he doth not onely see by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but also desire by willing, and performe by doing; and by that divine manner of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even the Will it selfe, and the operation it selfe, not onely the naturall possibility of willing, and working is assisted. For if onely our power was helped by grace, the Lord would have said thus, <hi>Every one who hath heard, and learned of the father, may or can come to me:</hi> but hee saith not so, but <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But every one who hath learned of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not onely can come, but doth come, where there is now both the advance of possibility, and the affection of the will, and the effect of the action.</p>
               <p>Reader, It is easie for thee to observe from these testimonies out of this most learned and pious Father, how powerfull upon the will, how effectuall in the worke, how infallible, how peculiar, the grace of God is, according to what I affirmed before, and all with cleare evidence, and much strength of Scripture made good: But indeed this great assertion of Grace doth so abound in this doctrine, which he

doth most strenuously maintain, that it is very hard to make an end of quotations out of him, not so much for his authority, as for his demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration by Scripture, and his singular excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in discussing it.

                  </q>It is certaine, that when we doe, we doe, but he makes us to doe, affording most effectuall strength to the will; who hath said, <hi>I will make you to walke in my Statutes, and yee shall keep my Iudgements and doe them:</hi> When he saith I will make you to doe, what saith he else, but that <note place="margin">Habitual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wil together with effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</note>

Therefore that wee may wil, he works without us; but when we will, and so will, as that we doe, he works with us: But without him, either working that we may will, or working with us, when we will, wee have no strength to the good workes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. upon that text of Scripture, <hi>Let us love one another, for love is of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 7.

Whosoever shall say, that the Grace of God by Jesus Christ our Lord, helps against sinning in this regard only, because by it the meaning of the Commands is revealed, and opened to us, that we might know what we ought to desire, and what to eschew, but that by it is not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that what we know ought to be done, we also love to doe, and are enabled thereunto, <hi>Let him be Anathema;</hi> for when the Apostle saith, <hi>Knowledge puffes up, but charity edifies,</hi> it is very wicked to beleeve, that we have the grace of Christ for that which puffeth up, but that we have it not for that which edifies, when both is the gift of God; both to know what we ought to doe, and to love that we may doe it, that <hi>charity edifying,</hi> knowledge may not be able to <hi>puffe us up;</hi> but as it is written of God, <hi>That be teacheth man knowledge,</hi> so is it written likewise, that <hi>Love is of God.</hi> Here we have the Doctrin of the Church in that age against the Hereticks in this point.</p>

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident it is, that he makes faith, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he cals Grace, so to depend upon the good use of the naturall understanding, as upon that account it is given unto men, how farre, and in what sence soever it is given; and as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident it is, that no good use can be made of the understanding in order to Grace, without some good use of the will; for except a man will, he shall not, without the use of his will he cannot provoke, and stirre up himselfe, so much as to meditate of God, and the things of God; but whosoever teacheth Grace to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon, or for the improvement of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall will in any kinde or degree, falls under that so famously damned Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> That Grace is given according to merits; for clearing this, let us briefly represent the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> Heresie in its four-fold state, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Austin,</hi> and other Fathers, and in them the Doctrine of the Church there-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.</p>
               <p>In the first place, <hi>Pelagius</hi> denyed all ayde of supernaturall Grace (which Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at this day, if he meane as he speakes) affirming, that the naturall strength of Free will was sufficient to fulfill the Commands of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58777:45"/>
God, and to obtaine eternall life, denying O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin all sinne to the last.</p>
               <p>In the second state he admitted the ayde of Grace, but 1. He acknowledged this ayde only in the Law, and externall Doctrine, as also in the example of Christ. 2. He ascribed only this to it, that by it man might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily fulfill the Commands of God, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it he could fulfill. He likewise by Grace understood remission of sins.</p>
               <p>In the third state, he at least seemed to admit inward illumination of the understanding, <note place="margin">Many Learned men hold, that at length he came to this, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall work of inward illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the second state; but he that shall vveigh well what <hi>Austine</hi> saith, <hi>Lib. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth and last state was in the hands of certaine <hi>Pelagian</hi> Bishops, who wrote two Epistles against <hi>Austins</hi> Doctrine, which he answers in foure Bookes; their Doctrine the Father layes downe in these words: <q>They will have the desire of good in man to begin from man, that the grace of finishing may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the merit of this beginning, if yet this at the least they will have.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They differ from the last recited, in this;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58777:45"/>
That they require this Grace, as simply neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the consummation of those vertues, the beginnings whereof were in Nature; but for the first motion unto good they required no internall grace; of this, <hi>Austine, Lib. 2. Contra duas Epistolas, Pelag. l. 8, &amp;c.</hi> where after the stating of the question, in the prosecution of his answer, he strongly concludes all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and therein against Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> (taken in the best sence) that he that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that any the least motion to good in man prevents the Grace of God, he teacheth that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>igmatized Doctrine of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> that Grace is given according to merits, which as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where formerly, so here againe he with much clearnesse refutes.</p>
               <p>The Question is stated in these words: Now <note place="margin">Subduing Grace.</note> that is the thing which we have to attend, whether or no God inspires into man unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <note place="margin">Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by Grace made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the least desire of good how small and impe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect soever from grace</note> and resisting the desire of good, so that now he be not resisting, he be not unwilling, but consenting unto good, and willing good. A little after, for this they thinke is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against us; That we say, God inspires into man unwilling, and resisting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not of how great good soever, but of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect good. It may be then that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so farre keep a place for Grace, that they thinke without it a man may have a desire of good, but that good imperfect; but for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect good, he cannot more easily have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of it by Grace, but without Grace he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all have the desire of it. Having thus sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, he refutes the <hi>Pelagian</hi> tenet.</p>
               <p>But so likewise they say, the Grace of God

               <p>But the Lord, that he might answer <hi>Pelagius</hi> yet to come, saith not without me somthing ye may doe, with much adoe, but he saith, <hi>Without me yee can doe nothing.</hi> And that he might answer these likewise yet to come, in the same Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentence, he saith not, without me yee can fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish nothing, but, <hi>yee can doe nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. for if he had said finish, they might have said, That the ayde of God was necessary not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that which is good, this being of our selves, but to finish it; but let them heare the Apostle too, for the Lord, when he saith, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me yee can doe nothing,</hi> in this one word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the beginning, and the end.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hilary</hi> relates it thus, <hi>They agree that all men perished in</hi> Adam, <hi>neither can any man thence be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his owne free will;</hi> But this they affirme to be agreeable to truth, and meet to be preached, that when the occasion or opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining salvation, is declared to them that are utterly downe, and never able by their owne strength to rise, that by that merit, whereby they may will, and beleeve, they may be healed of their disease, and may obtain the increase of faith, and the effect of their thorow holinesse: But to begin any work, much lesse to finish it, they grant that no man is sufficient to himself.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58777:48"/>
Then he addes to this purpose, <hi>That to beleeve, and will their owne healing by Christ, to seeke to the Phisitian for cure.</hi> These things they number not amongst workes, but these they will have to prevent the healing grace of Christ.</p>
               <p>Upon the relation made in these two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Austin</hi> wrote his booke, <hi>De praedestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one sanctorum, &amp; de bono perseveranti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> where he with great strength and clearnesse refutes these opinions, proving at large, what <hi>Prosper</hi> brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hints in his Epistle, that in those reliques of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> pravity, is nourished a strein of no mean virulency, if the beginning of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be evilly placed in man; If the will of man shal wickedly be preferred before the wil of God; If therefore any man shall be aided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would, and not therefore he would, because he was aided; If he that is originally evill, shall evilly be beleeved to begin the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of good, not from the highest good, but from himselfe, If God be pleased from some other thing then what he hath given.</p>
               <p>We have therefore thus shewed the severall states of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie, that our new <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> might be unmasked.</p>
               <p>And because the Doctrine of Grace is so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently cleared by <hi>Austin,</hi> and some other Fathers against these sacrilegious Tenets, I shal yet bring some things more out of their rich treasures. <hi>Austin</hi> therefore, <hi>lib. de praedestinatione sanctorum,</hi> c. 2 thus states the Question, That according to his adversaries, faith is not given of God to us, but it is encreased by God in us, by that merit wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it begun of us. Against this he argues.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Here they depart not from that Doctrine
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58777:49"/>
which <hi>Pelagius</hi> himselfe was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, in a Court of Bishops in <hi>Palestine,</hi> to wit, That the Grace of God is given according to our merits; As though it belonged not to the Grace of God, that we have begun to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but rather belonged to his Grace, which for our beginning is added to us, that wee should beleeve more fully and perfectly; and hence we in the first place give the beginning of faith to God, that the fulfillings of it may be recompensed to us, as likewise whatsoever else we faithfully aske. But against this, why doe we not rather heare, <hi>Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompenced againe unto him? for of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, Rom.</hi> 11. The beginning it selfe of our faith then, of whom is it but of him? for it is not, this excepted, <hi>of him,</hi> are all the rest, but <hi>of him, and through him, and to him, are all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Truly was it said of the Apostle, <hi>To you it is given not onely to beleeve, but to suffer for Christ;</hi> he sheweth both to be the gifts of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saith both are given; neither doth he say, that yee might more fully and perfectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, but that yee might beleeve in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither did he say that <hi>himselfe had obtained mercy,</hi> that he might be more faithfull, but <hi>that he might be faithfull,</hi> for he knew, that he did not first give the beginning of his faith to God, and had the increase thereof recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to him, but by him was he made a beleever, by whom he was made an Apostle: For being averse from the faith, which he wasted; &amp; most vehemently adverse thereunto, he is of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine converted unto it, by a more powerfull
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58777:49"/>
grace: Nor only made of unwilling, willing to beleeve; but of a persecutor, a sufferer, in the defence of that faith, which he did persecute, <hi>For unto him it was given of Christ, not only to beleeve on him, but likewise to suffer for him:</hi> And therefore commending that grace, which is not given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any merit, but makes all good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (we saw formerly in how large a sence the Fathers understand this word <hi>Merit)</hi> he saith.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Not that wee are sufficient of our selves to thinke any thing, as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God.</hi> Let them attend here, and weigh these words well, who think the beginning of faith is from our selves, the accomplishment from God. For who doth not see, that thinking is before beleeving? for no man beleeves any thing, unlesse he have first thoughts that it is to be beleeved; For although certaine thoughts doe most hastily, most swiftly flye before the will of beleeving, and it presently so followes, that it doth even most closely, as it were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, yet must it needs be, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is beleeved, is by a preventing thought beleeved, although to beleeve is nothing else but to thinke with assent; for not every one that thinkes, beleeves: when many therefore think, that they may not beleeve; but whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeves, thinks; and by beleeving thinks, and by thinking beleeves. Wherefore as to things that belong to religion and godlines, of which the Apostle spake, <hi>if we be not sufficient to think any thing, as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are not sufficient to beleeve any thing, as of our selves, which without thinking we cannot, <hi>but our sufficiency,</hi> whereby we begin to beleeve, <hi>is of God.</hi>

               <p>In the tenth Chap. speaking of this same thing, <hi>It is</hi> (saith he out of the Apostle) <hi>of faith, that according to grace the Promise may be firme to all the seed;</hi> not from the power of our will, but from his owne Predestination, for he promised not what men, but what himselfe would doe, because though men doe those good things which belong to the Worship of God, he makes them to doe the things he hath commanded; they make not him to doe what he hath promised, otherwise that the promises of God may be fulfilled, it is not in the power of God, but of man, and what is promised by the Lord, is by them returned to <hi>Abraham;</hi> but so did not <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeve, but he beleeved, giving glory to God, because he that hath promised is able to doe; he doth not say to fore-tell, he doth not say to fure-know,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58777:50"/>
for the deeds of another he may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and fore-know, but he saith he is able to doe, and therefore not the deeds of others, but his owne.</p>
               <p>We returne now to the second Chapter, <note place="margin">The whole of faith from God.</note> where it followes; Furthermore, if God worke our faith, acting in our hearts after a wonderfull manner that we may beleeve, shall we feare left he should not be able to doe the whole? and therefore man shall challenge the first part to himselfe, that he may merit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the last from him? See if any thing else be done by this meanes, but that the Grace of God, which way soever, may be given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our merit, and so Grace shall be no Grace, for thus it is returned as due, it is not freely given; for this is owing to him that beleeves, that by the Lord faith it selfe may be encreased, and faith encreased may be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of faith begun.</p>
               <p>Neither doe they observe when thus they speake, that that reward is imputed to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, not according to Grace, but according to debt. (We see here againe the large signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word Merit, for any thing that may be supposed in man of himselfe, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to God for giving his Grace) But why the whole should not be ascribed to man, that he that could begin what he had not, might himselfe likewise encrease what he had begun, I cannot at all see, but only, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resist most manifest Divine testimonies, by <note place="margin">Godlinesse from faith.</note> which <hi>faith,</hi> whence godlinesse takes its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, is shewed to be <hi>the gift of God;</hi> As, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath distributed to every one a measure

               <p>Of that minde was not that godly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">2.

               <p>Farre removed from the apprehensions of the flesh is this Schoole in which the Father is heard, and teacheth to come to the Sonne. There is likewise the Sonne himselfe, because he himselfe is the Word of the Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he so teacheth; neither deales he with the eare of the flesh, but of the heart; there is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether likewise the Spirit of the Father, and the Sonne, for neither doth he not teach, nor doth he teach apart, because we say, <hi>the workes of the Trinity are inseparable,</hi> and he is verily the Holy Ghost, of whom the Apostle saith, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same Spirit of faith.</hi> Farre removed (I say) from the apprehensions of the flesh, is this Schoole, in which God is heard, and teacheth; we see many come to the Sonne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see many beleeve in Christ, but where, and how they have learned this of the Father we see not, verily this grace is secret, but that it is grace who doubts?</p>
               <p>This Grace therefore, which by Divine

bounty is after an hidden manner given unto <note place="margin">Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting. subduing, renewing, effectuall.</note> the hearts of men, is by no hard heart refused, because it is therefore given, that the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heart may first of all be removed; when therefore the Father is inwardly heard, and teacheth to come to the Sonne, he <hi>takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the stony heart, and gives a heart of flesh,</hi> as he promised by the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. for so doth he make the sonnes of the Promise, and the Vessels of Mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory; why therefore doth he not teach all that they may come to Christ? but because all whom he teacheth, in mercy he teacheth; but whom he teacheth not, in Judgement he teacheth not, because, he <hi>will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens;</hi> but he hath mercy, bestowing good, he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, recompencing according to desert. But why he teacheth not all, the Apostle opens so farre, as he thought fit to be opened, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. Hence it is that <hi>the word of the Crosse is foolishnesse unto them, that perish, but to those that are saved, the power of God. All these God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to come to Christ, all these he will have saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> for if he would have taught those to come to Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to whom the word of the Crosse is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without doubt even they had come too, for he neither deceives, nor is deceived, who saith, <hi>Every one that hath heard, and learned of the Father, comes to me;</hi> farre be it therefore that any man should not come who hath heard, and learned of the Father.</p>

For he did not distinguish Hearers of the Gospell from no Hearers, who said, <hi>No man can come to me, except it be given him of the Father;</hi> but Beleevers from unbeleevers: <hi>Faith</hi> therfore both begun and finished, <hi>is the gift of God;</hi> and that this gift is given to some, and not given to all he cannot doubt, who will not oppose most manifest holy Scriptures.</p>

               <p>The like instance for thanksgiving, he brings from 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. Then for Prayer, <hi>c.</hi> 20. That the beginning of faith is the gift of God, the Apostle admonisheth us saying, withall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, That <hi>God would open unto us the doore of his word, to speake the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds, that I may make it manifest, as Iought to speake,</hi> Col. 4. How is the doore of the word opened, saith he, but when the sence or understanding of the hearer is opened, that he may beleeve? and faith being begun, he may admit those things which are preached, and disputed for building up of wholesome doctrine, least the heart being shut up by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe, he may disallow and reject the things that are spoken: whence to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I <hi>will stay at Ephesus</hi> (saith he) <hi>till Pentecost, for there a great doore and effectuall is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. What may we here understand, but that the Gospell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there first of all preached by him, many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved? and there were many adversaries of the same faith, according to that of the Lord, <hi>No

The seeds therefore of vertue, which by the benefit of the Creator were planted in us, were by the transgression of our first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over-turn'd, neither can they be had, but by his restoring who gave them; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is reformable by the former there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and capable of those good endowments

which it had, that by the <hi>Mediator betwixt God and men, the Man Christ Iesus,</hi> in that very thing which remaines to it, it may recover what it hath lost; but there remaines to it a rationall Minde, which is not vertue, but the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-place of vertue; for by the participation of Wisdome, Justice, and Mercy, we are not Wisdome, not Justice, nor Mercy, but wise, and just, and mercifull, which good things, though our rationall (Soule) be possest of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and we transgressing, the uncleane Spirit hath seiz'd the Temple of God, yet may they againe flow together into our rationall (Soul) by him <hi>who casts forth the Prince of this World, and binding the strong Man, takes away by force his ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and the spirit of this world being chased away, gives unto us that Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God;</hi> but <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> Thus farre against any seeds of good in man by nature since the fall; then he shewes the ground of mistake in his Adversary, as followes; But I conceive he is deceived with the semblance of truth, and mistakes, through a shew of false vertues, whilst he thinkes that those good endowments, which cannot be had, but by the gift of God, are found even in the mindes of the wicked; therefore, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many of them are followers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, temperance, continence, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, all which they have not in vaine, nor unprofitably, and much honour and glory doe they in this life obtaine by them; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in those pursuances they serve not God, but the Devill, though they have a temporall

And it is most manifest that in the mindes of the wicked no vertue dwels, but all their workes are uncleane, and polluted, they having not Spirituall, but Naturall, not Heavenly, but Earthly, not Christian, but Devillish wisdome; not from the Father of Lights, but from the Prince of Darknesse, whilst by those very things, which they could not have, but by the gift of God, they are brought into subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him who first departed from God; he therefore that saith, that the seeds of vertue are naturally in every soule without the worke of Grace, what doth he endeavour to shew, but from those seeds some twiggs of merit sprouting, going before the Grace of God?</p>

               <p>First, Prevenient, and Subsequent; that prevenient grace, findes many unwilling, and resisting; makes him of unwilling, willing; of resisting, obeying: that subsequent Grace carries on, what by prevenient Grace was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in man; that subsequent grace, though in reference to that first grace, whereby conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was wrought, it be subsequent, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all after gracious operations by man, it is prevenient all along.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Operating, and Co-operating, operating the same with prevenient, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating the same with subsequent; so that co-operation is on Gods part all along, in reference to all gracious operations by man, pre-operation, and on mans part it is sub-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; Man all along depending upon the grace of God, upon the inspiration of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost; so as the whole of every gracious operation, and worke in, and by man, is of God; and by man moving under the power and efficacy of the divine motion, upon his understanding and will, as the lower wheele, under and by the motion of the higher, the whole motion by both performed.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, Common and peculiar grace. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, or grace of saving kind is common to all the regenerate, and peculiar to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is evident from the last.</p>

That man cannot without the ayde of grace, resist temptation one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with many others of the like kind, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeing with the doctrines of the Fathers formerly all edged.</p>
               <p>Hence likewise, we may observe the doctrine of the merit of congruity, and that so highly extold by the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> that he that doth what lyes in him by the strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, towards eternal life (Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> owne doctrine in that paragraph we have been upon all this while) shall thereby obtaine grace at the hands of God; are one and the same, and both of them one with that of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and for which he hath past for an Heretick this one thousand two hundred yeares; that grace is given according to merits, and thus by the best of the School-men is this Doctrine cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</p>
               <p>Reader, these things and much more, if thou beest any thing attentive, thou mayest in this Discourse observe excellently cleared, and strongly proved by <hi>Austin, Prosper,</hi> and the Fathers in the fore-mentioned councells. I have now done with this Paragraph; as for that saying of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> with which hee concludes here, it is true, but impertinent. It is the property of a soule unreasonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy not to beleeve, but such are the soules of all natural men.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly, Whereas it was objected, that <hi>men in their naturall estates, are</hi> by the Scriptures termed <hi>darknesse,</hi> and in this respect presented as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to comprehend the light of the Gospell: I answer, there is in the controversies about the extent and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the grace of God vouchsafed unto men, as great abuse of the word <hi>Naturall</hi> (and so of the word <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,</hi> a terme not found in the Scriptures, either formally or vertually) as there is of the word <hi>Orthodox,</hi> in this and many others. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knoweth not the word <hi>Naturall,</hi> in any such sense or signification, where in it should expresse or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the unregenerate estate of a man, from the regenerate: Our Translators indeed render <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> Christian,</hi> we shall see in its proper place:</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Whereas he denyes the word <hi>naturall</hi> to be found in Scripture in any such sense as should distinguish the unregenerate state of man from the regenerate, and the word <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall</hi> in the argument of the efficacy of grace to be found either formally or vertually: I must charge this bold assertion of his, 1. With selfe-contradiction. 2. With notorious false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. 3. With ranke <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, With selfe-contradiction: <hi>pag.</hi> 9. of his Preface hee chargeth them with great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who will have reason laid aside in enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after matters of a spirituall and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall concernment, which he there makes the same with matters of Religion; what is then spirituall, and what is of religious nature, by your own confession there, is supernaturall. But all Christian graces (Faith, Hope, Love, &amp;c.) are spirituall and of religious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; therefore, grace and the efficacy of it, are supernatural. Vertually then at the least, this word supernatural is found in Scripture, in this argument of the efficacy of grace, for those graces are by the efficacy of a gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, and in them is there an efficacious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of spiritual nature, otherwise, how are they spirituall?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 With notorious falsehood, so obvious, that

was not the sword upon his right eye utterly darkening it, I cannot imagine how such a doctrine should have escaped his pen. Let us bring it to the touch-stone of the Scriptures, singling out of many texts a few, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8 Is not there a first, and second birth; the first natural, the second supernatural? and is not this the effect of grace? is it not by divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon the soule by the spirit of God, that any one is borne of the spirit? <hi>Iohn 5. 25. The hour is coming, and now is, that the dead shall hear the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it not a supernatural work, <hi>To quicken such as were dead in trespasses and sinnes, to raise them up together with Christ, and make them sit together in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Christ Iesus?</hi> This union with Christ, and these spirituall advancements of the soule in Christ, are they not supernatural, and by the efficacy of grace? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. Is not that change, <hi>In putting off the old man, in being renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and putting on the new man,</hi> which is created, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the operation, and efficacy of Grace, and is it not supernaturall? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. to the 15.</p>
                  <p>Is not that revelation of the spirit discovering <hi>what eye hath not seen,</hi> &amp;c. Searching the deepe things of God, things as farre above the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the naturall man, as the things of man, are above the spirit of a beast? Things which the spirit of the World, that is, that spirit
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58777:71"/>
which is common to men, cannot discover, things, that can no otherwise be discovered but by Spirituall light, things, <hi>which the Naturall man</hi> therefore <hi>cannot receive, because they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually discerned;</hi> Is not the revelation of these things supernaturall? A revelation which flesh and bloud makes not, <hi>Titus 3. 5. The wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Doth it report nothing supernaturall to your eare? We might adde, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. that new Creation there; and <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18. that new generation there; and <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. 44, 45. that drawing, and teaching of the Father, with many others of like kinde; are all these natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, nothing in these above the power and operation of Nature, and that in this corrupt state? By this time I hope it appeares, that the word Naturall belongs to the unregenerate, and that Regeneration is by supernaturall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and that the unregenerate, or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, as such, is in Scripture Language darknesse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, with ranke <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> I call it ranke, because thus farre it agrees with the first and second state formerly declared, as to admit no supernaturall operation upon the Soule, for conversion, or recovery from sinne, if this be not your meaning, I pray disclose your Riddle, for no man I thinke can judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise by your words.</p>

                  <p>Those <hi>Ephesians</hi> of whom the Apostle saith, <hi>They were sometime darknesse,</hi> had been not only, or simply unregenerate, but had <hi>walked in sins and trespasses, according to the course of this

world,</hi> and <hi>after the Prince that ruleth in the Aire, that worketh effectually in the Children of disobedience, by whom their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding had been darkned,</hi> and they possessed with many false, wicked, and blasphemous conceits concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, and the Gospel, &amp;c. All which imply on unregenerate estate most dangerously encumbred, and from whence it argued the high and signall grace and favour of God, that even they should be delivered. The <hi>Jewes</hi> also, <hi>(Joh,</hi> 1. 5.) are termed darknesse upon a like account, viz. because they were strangely and desperately prejudiced, and pre-possessed with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Notions, and conceits against Christ, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the estate of their <hi>Messiah's</hi> first coming unto them, they expecting the forme of a great Monarch, rejected, and Crucified him in the forme of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; it was this darknesse, which they had through an oscitant, loose, and sensuall converse with their owne Scriptures, voluntarily suffered to grew, and spread it selfe upon the face of their mindes and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, that was a snare upon them, and occasioned the sad event here mentioned, viz. That <hi>when the light shone upon them (i. e.</hi> when sufficient and pregnant meanes were vouchsafed unto them, to have brought them to the knowledgement of their <hi>Messiah) they comprehended it not,</hi> i. e. did not by the meanes of it come to see, and understand that, for the sight and knowledge whereof it was given them; for that (by the way) is to be observed, that the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi> doth not say, that the darknesse, in which the light shined, could not, or was not able to comprehend it, but only that it did not comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>Now it is a knowne Principle in reason, that a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatione actus, ad negationem potentiae non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58777:72"/>
or performance, where there is no defect of power for action. And the very observation and report which the Evangelist makes of the Non-comprehension of the light by the darknesse, in which it shone, plainely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough imports, that the defectivenesse of this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in not comprehending the light, did not consist in, or proceed from any Naturall or invincible want of power to comprehend it, but from a blindnesse vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily contracted, and willingly, if not wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in; for how can it be reasonably supposed, that this Evangelist, who flyeth an higher pitch then his Fellowes, in drawing up his Evangelicall Tidings for the use and benefit of the World, should in the very entrance of his Gospell, and whilst he was thundring out on high, (as one of the Fathers speakes) the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Christ, insert the relation of a thing that had nothing strange, nothing more then of ordinary and common observation in it? or is any thing more then ordinary, or what is most obvious, that men doe not fly in the Aire like Birds, or that Fishes doe not speake on the earth like men? Or is it a thing of any whit the more savoury consideration then these, that men voyd of all capacity, and destitute of all power to comprehend the light, should n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the god of the world. Nay, the Apostles, and first converted <hi>Iewes,</hi> borne and bred in the visible Church, before conversion, had their conversation among them, and were children of wrath together with them; here was then nothing peculiar to them in their unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of force to quit the Naturall man of this charge of darknesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 These sins and trespasses, wherein they walked were the fruits of Naturall corruption, whereby all men are dead in sinne, they here, though dead in actuall sins, yet dead by ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne; Thus the Apostle describes this sinfull conversation to be <hi>in the lusts of the flesh,</hi> and <hi>a fulfilling the wills of the flesh,</hi> and of the minde, all these sins of theirs were the workes of the flesh; and what is the flesh but corrupt Nature found in all men, to them derived from the first man? <hi>Ioh. 3. 6.

The deadly strength of this corruption we see further by singular instance in <hi>David,</hi> a Person so holy, yet how upon advantage and surprisall did it prevaile against him, to put forth those dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruites of Adultery, and Murther, which sins he derives from Naturall corruption, that had seized him in the wombe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.

It was then by the corruption of Nature common to all, that these <hi>Ephesians were dead in trespasses and sinnes,</hi> covered over there-with, as with the deadly streames of that spring of death running over them; but the state of death is a state of darknesse to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.

                  <p>As for your following Discourse it is not worth a deafe nut, though you flourish it as much as you can: an ill face needs a good dresse; triviall matter must have words to set it off; the sum of your Rhetorication is, that if there be that naturall darknesse and impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon all men, it was impertinent for the <hi>Evangelist</hi> to charge it upon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he was entring upon Gospell-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, beginning with that high and maine doctrine, the Divinity of Christ. But 1. His charge is here upon all men as we have seen, not upon the <hi>Iewes</hi> alone, 2. Is it such a wonder, that he that is about to set forth Christ, as mans

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>(And lastly) that the incapacity of these things of God which is here asserted to be in the Naturall man or weake Christian, is not an utter or absolute inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or such, which by a diligent use of means he may not very possibly and according to the ordinary course of providence out-grow, but only a present or actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity or indisposition, which is regularly, and (at it were) of course curable: these things I there evince from the expresse tenor, and carriage of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Hee saith, the place speakes not of the Naturall <hi>i. e.</hi> the unregenerate man, but of the weake Christian, the babe in Christ. That the place speaks of the Naturall or unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, is evident against his demonstrations he tels us of, which indeed are of no affinity with <hi>Euclia's,</hi> we have only night for a vision in them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Of him that hath not the spirit of God,</hi> v. 11. <hi>But the spirit of the world opposite to the spirit of God,</hi> v. 12. 2. <hi>The things of the Spirit of God are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse

Now to whom is <hi>the preaching of Christ crucified foolishnesse? to them that perish,</hi> V. 18. <hi>But to them that are saved, the power of God,</hi> to the uncalled, <hi>i. e.</hi> the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, foolishnesse, but to the called of God, the power of God, and the wisdome of God, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The things of God here (he saith) are such, as are not absolutely necessary to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the high and deep things of God. But 1. The things absolutely necessary to be knowne, are as high and deep as any; the Trinity of the persons, the union of the two Natures in the Mediator, the oblation and intercession of Christ, the imputation of his righteousnes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 These are the things absolutely necessary to salvation, for they are the things in the preaching whereof, Christ crucified is preached, <hi>v.</hi> 2. the <hi>things of the hidden wisdome of God ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the glory of the Saints,</hi> v. 7. <hi>the things freely given of God to the Saints,</hi> v. 12. Whereas you say in the close here, that the spiritual man onely, that is, the strong and wel grown Christian is, <hi>de praesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> and immediately capable, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 If onely the strong and wel growne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian be the spiritual man, then is the meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man a weak Christian, and so all the world by nature Christians, <hi>i. e.</hi> beleevers: welcome all, Turkes, and Insidels, to Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Whether do you allow the spiritual man, to be above the natural man or not? if not, (as indeed you cannot, if you will be constant to your selfe as here, so formerly, neither can
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58777:78"/>
you deny it, if you wil be constant to your self, as formerly we observed; but you are a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous self-subverter, then is the Naturall man capable, <hi>de praesenti,</hi> &amp;c. Contrary to your owne interpretation of the Apostles expresse doctrine here; if you doe allow him above the natural man, then you grant the word Supernaturall vertually in that sense, wherein you formerly denyed it; so that you are full of interwoven contradictions, at every turne refuting your selfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 You deny here an utter incapacity of these things in the Natural man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but such as he may out-grow, according to the ordinary course of providence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your Doctrine is evidently false. 1. These things of the spirit of God are discerned by another light, and another principle then the Natural man hath, <hi>He neither knowes, nor can know them,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>because they are spiritually discerned:</hi> and this light of the spirit, specifically distinct from the light of Reason in the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, as the light of reason is from the light of Sense in the bruit beast, <hi>v. 11. And this spirit the world hath not</hi> (therfore not the Natural man) <hi>v.</hi> 12. Formerly he made such an observation, as this, his refuge, that the <hi>Evangelist</hi> said, not <hi>Darknesse</hi> could not, but did not comprehend the light, which, how slender a refuge it was for him we there saw: here the Apostle is expresse, <hi>Cannot,</hi> yet he attempts an evasion. There is no end of this mans sophistry, nor can be upon his principles, that the Grammar and Logick of the Scripture must vaile to his Reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Your Doctrine here (as all along) is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58777:78"/>
                     <hi>Pelagian:</hi> for you acknowledge no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity in the Natural man, of discovering all Gospel-truths leading to salvation, but what by the diligent use of meanes hee may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow, &amp;c. therefore of himselfe, not onely may he make use of the means, but so make use of them, as that thence, he shall certainly be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly inlightened: Which must bee one of these wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Either the seeds of naturall light shall hereby grow up into a saving light, so Nature improves it selfe into Grace, and this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Doctrine, that there is nothing supernatural in the efficacy of Grace; and this is highly <hi>Pelagian,</hi> for it makes Nature Grace, <hi>(Sub laude Naturae, latent inimici Gratiae)</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before this improvement must be Grace, in the seed, as by it, it becomes grace in the fruit, Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 By this use of means, he shall procure the giving of saving light and grace from the hand of God, which is still the <hi>Pelagian</hi> doctrine, that the grace of God is given according to mans merits; but still it is a Riddle to mee, how you can allow thus much, and make good your doctrine, against the supernaturall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of grace.</p>
                  <p>As for your glosse upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Apostle calls them <hi>carnall,</hi> opposed to spiritual; not absolutely, as formerly he had opposed the natural man, but in part, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he addes by way of limitation, <hi>babes in Christ;</hi> but when he expostulates with them <hi>v. 3. are yee not carnall, and walke according to max?</hi> he there implies, that the meer man is wholly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58777:79"/>
for as much as the weake Christian, so farre as he is carnall, he is according to man, and wherein he walkes carnally he walkes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to man.</p>

                  <p>For the summe of this Paragraph concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Philosophers, and Heretiques, you say in the first place, That though they were able to apprehend the things of the Gospell, yet doth it not follow that they must; but 1. We have seene that no Naturall man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 2. Finde one that ever did advance his reason to apprehend the Gospell-Mystery without the Spirit of illumination, revealing it by the Word, if not one, then none could, for from the Universall deniall of the Act, to the deniall of the Power, the consequence is undeniable. 3. Whether might those Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers (according to your apprehension) without the word of the Gospell, have found out in the Booke of the Creature the Gospell-Mystery, or might they so improve their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son about inquiry after God? That thereupon he must send his Word unto them, thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening them? whether soever of these you
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58777:80"/>
take, you fall into the <hi>Relagian</hi> Heresie, as we often formerly evinced against your Discourse of the same batch with this.</p>
                  <p>As for your instance of men bewitched with a corrupt desire of drawing Disciples after them, and <hi>speaking perverse things;</hi> pardon me, if I be apt to beleeve that you speake feelingly, and from selfe-experience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 You teach that men must bend their minds and intentions to Gospel-enquiries, that they may have the knowledge thereof; Tis true, so doth the Spirituall man: But the Naturall man wants Principles for bending his minde thereto, as discerning nothing worthy in them, and his heart's set against them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 You say, That God punishing the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers for their unthankfulnesse, addicting themselves to other things, &amp;c. their foolish heart was darkned: this is true too, but the conclusion you ayme at here, <hi>scil,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were able to have addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Gospel-enquiries is both false, and <hi>Pelagian,</hi> as hath been proved before; as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that man is able to performe all his duty.</p>
                  <p>As for Hereticks, it is true, you say, They are led aside by some uncleane Spirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must I alwayes suspect an Heretick, though his conversation be never so specious, to be but <hi>a whited Sepulchre;</hi> whereas in the close of this Section you say, That whatsoever any mans errour, &amp;c. be, it is not to be imputed to deficiency on Gods part, in the vouchsafement of meanes; I answer, deficiency sounds cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably, and therefore not to be imputed to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58777:81"/>
God; but evident it is, that God doth not) yet without deficiency vouchsafe the necessary meanes of Gospel-knowledge, to many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his Word, to more his Spirit, who have no more, nor otherwise deserved this deniall, then those to whom he affords both, who is sought of those that asked not for him, and found of those that sought him not, of whom it is, as of <hi>him that shewes mercy, not of him that wills, nor of him that runs.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, concerning the Spirit of God, by which alone, and in opposition to reason many affirme and teach, That the things of God, and matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are to be apprehended, discerned, and knowne; I answer, that such an Opinion as this, is a conceit as uncouth, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulpably weake, and ill-coherent with it selfe, as lightly can be; for if only the Spirit of God within me apprehends the things of God, and I my selfe apprehend them not (and apprehend them I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but by my reason or understanding, having no other faculty, where with to apprehend or conceive them) such an apprehension of them relateth not at all unto me, nor can I any whit be said the more to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, because the Spirit of God apprehends them in me; then I may, or might, in case the same Spirit should apprehend them in another man; That which another man meditates, or indicts in my house without imparting it unto me, no whit more concernes me, then in case be should have meditated or indicted the same in the house of another man. Besides, the Spirit of God being but one and the same infinite, and invisible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all men, he cannot with any tolerable propriety of speech, nor with truth, be said to apprehend, discern, and concerve that in one man, which he doth not after
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58777:81"/>
the same manner apprehend, discerne, and conceive in another, yea, in every man; therefore if there be any thing more apprehended, or discerned of the things of God, in one man then in another, the difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not from the different apprehensions of the Spirit in these men, but from the different apprehensions of these men themselves, and this by their owne reasons and understandings, they having (as hath been said) no other faculties, principles, or abilities where-with to apprehend, but these.</p>

                  <p>You affirme here, That many teach that by the Spirit of God alone, in opposition to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in man the things of God are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: who those many are, or one of those many, I know not; the Doctrine of your knowne Adversaries is, That by mans reason are the things of God apprehended, but that they may be savingly so, reason must be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enlightned, and the whole soule sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that by preventing and differencing Grace, so that all you say further in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are wast words; you may make great webs, if you spin thus plentifully, yet when all is done they will be but Cobwebs.</p>

Or do you with the <hi>Iesuiticall</hi> Schoole hold such lustings natural to that state?</p>

3 You lay down your maine doctrine that there is such a light vouch safed to all men, by the procurement of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your former doctrine, every man in the world may improve it to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Here,</p>

                  <p n="2">2 For the doctrine it self, which you ground upon <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 9. It is such, as that Scripture will not at all countenance. 1.

In him was life, he is life of himselfe; and he is the spring or author of life, to all living creatures: more particularly, of that life of light, which the rational creature, Man, lives, <hi>v.</hi> 4. the same light with that, <hi>v.</hi> 9. The Author of which light, the Creator of man, <hi>Iohn</hi> testifies him to be giving witnesse to his God-head, <hi>He that commeth after me is preferred before me, for he was before me, v.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>Of this light <hi>Austine</hi> speakes, <hi>Tract. 2. in cap. 1. Ioan. This life was the light of men,</hi> did hee say the light of beasts?—There is a certaine light of men, whereby they differ from beasts. Let us now see, and understand what is this light of men. Thou differest not from a beast, but by thy Understanding; whence art thou better then the beast? from the image of God; where is the image of God? in the minde, in the understanding. If therefore thou beest better then a beast, because thou hast a mind, by which thou understandest what the beast cannot understand, and thence thou art a man, that thou art better then the beast; The light of men, is the light of minds; the light of mindes, is above minds, and excels all minds. This was that life by which all things were made, here then the Creator of man is set forth his restorer.</p>

thus; He <hi>enlightens every man that comes into this world,</hi> who is enlightned; that is, there is no other fountaine of Light but he, to all that are enlightned; here we may fitly bring in that illustration of that eminent light, <hi>Austin</hi> upon that text, <hi>They shall all be taught of God;</hi> who when he had according to truth interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it onely of the Sons of the Promise, and the Vessels of Mercy, according to Election—he addes for further clearing. <q>But as we speake rightly, when we say of any Schoole-master who is alone in the City, this man teacheth all, not because all learne, but because none learn but of him, whosoever doe there learne; so we rightly say, God teacheth all men to come to Christ, not because all come, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man comes otherwise, <bibl>Lib. de praedest.

                     </q>  so here, Christ <hi>enlightens every man that comes into this world,</hi> not that every man coming into the world is enlightned, but of all commers into the world, whosoever is enlightned, he alone is the enlightner; though as I said the former interpretation seemes most genuine; but whether the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or this, or whatsoever other interpretation may be the truth, it is evident, that Mr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins,</hi> who will have such a gift of illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vouchsafed by Christ unto all, as that every man may improve to faith and repentance, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the truth.</p>

All impressions, all principles of Light and Truth, which are found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the hearts and consciences of men, are here written by the finger of God himselfe; therefore what Spirit, or Doctrine soever symbolizeth in notion, and

If it be further said, But Reason is not able to apprehend or conceive how three should bee really and essentially one, and the same; how a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin should conceive and bring forth a Son, &amp;c.

                  <p n="1">1 Whereas you say, these mysteries here mentioned of the Trinity, Incarnation, and the virgins conception, are pretended to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, at least above Reason, it seemes you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny even these to be above the reach of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in fallen man, which yet in your discourse immediately insuing, you grant in deed though not in termes: but contradictions are no rare things in your discourse.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 It is false, for Faith hath the proper, and immediate ground of beleeving them, the authority of the Word revealing them; But Reason hath not an immediate ground of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, <hi>viz.</hi> such a light, as whereby they of themselves are visible to the naturall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, therefore when they are within the reach of Faith, yet are they not within the reach of Reason upon the same termes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 You equivocate, for seeming to carry on your former doctrine, you relinquish it. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly you made Reason the touchstone of the Scriptures; and whatsoever text of Scripture should not be found to agree with Reason, and to be relished by it, must be rejected: here you make the Scripture to be above the tryall of Reason, as appeares by that which followes: For how can I beleeve? <hi>&amp;c:</hi> If it be said I am bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a rationall ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the light of Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here you grant that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58777:94"/>
is to beleeve what the word affirmes, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the authority of the word. But 1. This is contrary to your former doctrine, requiring that Reason finde a rationall tast and savour in the thing it selfe to bee beleeved. 2. Here Reason beleeves, rather then discernes the thing beleeved; it discernes the ground of beleeving, but not the nature or manner of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved: therefore as before, the thing beleeved is not upon the same terms, out of the reach of Faith, as of Reason.</p>

the grounds of Nature, and so to Principles of Reason, that a virgin should conceive a childe; and if so, how can such a doctrine, according to what you have asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be received as from God, or as a truth?

Nor is it contrary to Reason or any Principle thereof, that God or the first Being, being infinite, should have a manner of sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting or being, far different from the manner of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, which is appropriate to all created and finite beings, or that this manner of subsisting which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto him, should be unto men incomprehensible.

                  <p>This Section is of the same stamp with the former; the sum of it is this, That it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reason, to conceive of God, that he is, and that he can doe above the course of Nature, and comprehension of Reason, and that when God shall declare that such is his being, and his doings such, it is likewise agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to beleeve him upon his word. But</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Who denies this, but Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and his associates in error? This is the very Doctrine of your adversaries, against which you dispute.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This no way agrees with your former Doctrines. 1. That which affirmes, that all men have that light of Reason and Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which according to Gods dispensation towards all men, they may improve to saving Faith and Repentance; For saving Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the knowledge of these mysteries, which you grant here come onely so far within the reach of Reason, as that when God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them, it is rational to beleeve his Word; without which, Reason could never find them out: But the greatest part of the men of the world have not the Scriptures. 2. That which affirmes Reason to bee the touchstone of the Scriptures; you said but lately of Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that whatsoever should be taught about it, otherwise then according to the Scriptures, and the truth, might be clearly disproved by the grounds of common Reason. You affirme <hi>page</hi> 16. That whatsoever doctrine or saying
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58777:96"/>
beares hard, or fals foule upon any undoubted Principle or ground of Reason within you, must of necessity be an errour: Now this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and ground of Reason must be such, as in the account of men generally passeth for such a principle or ground. Now doubtlesse, that three should be essentially one, bears hard upon whatsoever grounds of Reason in you, or any man since the fall: That a Virgin should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, beares hard likewise upon Reason; I am sure it did so in the blessed virgin her selfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 34. therefore according to your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine formerly laid downe, these mysteries should be rejected, and indeed the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of godlinesse, which the Apostle tels us <hi>is a great mystery,</hi> and therefore beares hard upon Reason.</p>
                  <p>Neither do you salve your former discourse when you say, it doth not bear hard upon any principle of Reason, that God should be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to doe as strange a thing, as to cause a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conceive: For because the thing it selfe beares so hard upon Reason, and is so strange; therefore according to your former doctrine, the word affirming it, should be rejected. So for the manner of his subsistence, three in one, because it bears so hard upon Reason, as you here grant, that it is incomprehensible, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your former doctrine, it ought not to be beleeved, as you know upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, your good friends, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> beleeve it not; But when you meet with such instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as you dare not deny; as these now in hand, and yet they cannot be made to close with your doctrine, then you wind out of your
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58777:96"/>
owne doctrine it selfe, yet so, as you would seem still to hold it. In other instances, as about Election, and Reprobation, Redemption, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, the perseverance of the Saints, you will hold stifly to your grand doctrine of the preheminence of Reason, because the doctrine of personall election, and reprobation, and the dominion of God therein, relisheth not with your Reason; because the dependance of redemption upon election, and the doctrine of the Saints perseverance, and of the efficacy, and peculiarity of grace relish not with your Reason, therefore they must be rejected, though the Scriptures be as evident for them, as for the Trinity and Incarnation. And hee that should argue with you, as you doe here; that it is not contrary to Reason, neither doth it bear hard upon any principle of Reason, that God should have a dominion, to man incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, would be rejected by you upon this account, that such a Doctrine it selfe was not according to Reason. Look over your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, concerning the unchangeable love of God to the Saints; and your questioning of the Scriptures, in case they either in terms, or by just consequence, avouch the same, <hi>pag.</hi> 335. of your book formerly alleadged, and tell me if it be not as I say.</p>
                  <p>As for the close of your Section. 1. That there is nothing in Christian Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what fairly comports, &amp;c.

But for as much as this sleep is the sleep of death, as is here evident, in that the waking from it, is standing up from the dead; where is now that mighty Reason, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Judgement, you have so often
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58777:99"/>

                  <p n="2">2 The time now is (you say) wherein the spirit is not given unto the world, according to the preparations of the royall bounty, and magnificence of heaven, because, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is (as formerly we have seen at large) the <hi>Pelagian</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine so famously branded; that grace is given according to our merits, the <hi>Popish</hi> doctrine of the merit of congruity: the <hi>Iesuiticall</hi> doctrine, That he that doth what in him lyes by the strength of Nature, shall thereby obtaine Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Word of God (you say) makes it one argument of the wicked and sensuall waies of men, that <hi>they have not the spirit, Iudg.</hi> 5. 18, 19. what then? you adde; yea, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> by charging the <hi>Ephesians</hi> to be <hi>filled with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> clearly supposeth it to be a voluntary strain of sinfull unworthinesse in men, if they have not a very rich and plentifull anoynting of the spirit.</p>
                  <p>Answ. 1. These <hi>Ephesians</hi> were regenerate, and spoken to as regenerate; therefore this concludes nothing for the natural man.</p>
                  <p>2. Tis true, what you say concerning the Naturall man, but false that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that therefore the Naturall man hath power to obtaine this anoynting of the spirit; from mans duty, to his ability, is a meer <hi>non sequitur.</hi> It is the duty of the naturall man, to fulfill the law of God (otherwise the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Law is not sin) yet it is impossible for him. <hi>The flesh is not subject to the Law of God, neither can be.</hi> It is the duty of the natural man

when the Gospell is preached to him, to come to Christ, and a sinful straine of voluntary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse, that hee comes not; <hi>Yee will not come to me that yee might have life,</hi> saith Christ to the Jewes, rebuking them: <hi>Yet none can come to him except the Father draw him;</hi> and this drawing of the Father is not according to any prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man drawn; <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> and compassion on whom he will have compassion; <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> It is the duty of the naturall man, <hi>to receive the things of the spirit of God</hi> revealed in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which yet he cannot do, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing work of the spirit, whereby he becomes a spirituall man, because they are <hi>spiritually discerned</hi> But to obtaine this renewing worke of the spirit, is not in his power, hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon any thing by him done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto. <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth, thou bearest the sound thereof, but knowest not whence it comes nor whither it goes; so is every one that is born of the spirit.</hi>

that which he hath, hereby declaring that he hath what he hath; nor is that which he is here said to have, any thing of a Spirituall or superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall import, this likewise is evident from the said Parable, for here one of the three, who all had received talents, one, or more, all which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents must needs by the course of the Parable be supposed to be of one and the same kind; nor is the least intimation of any difference, especially of any specificall difference between them, is said to be an <hi>evill and sloathfull Servant,</hi> notwithstanding his talent, and because of his sloathfulnesse, to be <hi>cast into utter darknesse;</hi> these are no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters (especially in the judgement of those, with whom we are to conflict in the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) of persons that had received any thing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or supernaturall.

                  <p>Now if either God or Christ, be signified or meant by the Master of these Servants (as I suppose no man questions, but that either the one or the other are typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hereby) by entring into their joy, cannot be meant a receiving of greater measure of naturall gifts or endowments, nor of receiving any reward, which belongs to persons qualified only with such endowments;

as these, but salvation or eternall blessednesse and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; if so, it roundly followes, that by what Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth shall be given to him that hath (in the sense de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) is meant somewhat of a saving consequence, as regenerating Grace, the sanctifying Spirit of God, Faith, and the like.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath here led us to that famous Scripture, the Parable of the Talents, a Scripture so much abused by the whole nation of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> in whose steps the <hi>Arminians</hi> tread, and amongst them this Author.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Let us see his Interpretation hereof. 2. The true Interpretation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For his; It labours with two very great diseases. 1. Self-contradiction. 2. <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi> 1. For selfe-contradiction, spiritual and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, are here one and the same with him;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58777:101"/>
as appeares in these words. <q>Nor is that which he is said to have, any thing of a spirituall or supernaturall import. A little after saving and supernaturall are one and the same with him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n these words. These are no characters of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that had received any thing saving or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall. Presently after spirituall and of saving nature are one and the same in these words. By that which is here promised to be given, must of necessity be meant some thing of a spirituall, and saving nature,: and this in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: to naturall, in these words; by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Masters joy cannot be meant a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of a greater measure of naturall gifts or endowments, nor of receiving any reward which belongs to persons quallified onely with such endowments as these. But salvation, or eternall blessednesse and glory: If so, it roundly follows, that by what Christ promiseth shall be given, &amp;c. is meant somewhat of a saving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, as regenerateing grace; the sanctifying Spirit, faith and the like, thus he; </q>Whence it is evident, that grace is not here naturall, that what is naturall is not saving, that regenerating grace is spirituall and supernaturall given upon the improvement of naturall endowments: but how doth this accord with his former Doctrine, about which he laboured so much that in the argument of the efficacy of grace, the word super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall was no where in Scripture so much as vertually found, that the word naturall distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth not the unregenerate from the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We observed formerly that what he speakes here presently after concerning mens attaining
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58777:102"/>
what proportion and measure of the Spirit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> such gifts and abilities as they shall from time to time receive, doth involue him in a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what he there had taught; if he here meane the worke of the Spirit, to be any other then such an influx as is attemperd and proportioned to mans naturall acting, and therefore naturall, but if that be his meaning, then doth he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himselfe here, making all that is saving to be supernaturall as we have now observed, but he hath drunke deepe of an intoxicating cup, wonder not if he Stagger like a drunken man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> as plaine and palpable as may be; that regenerating grace, the sanctifying spirit, faith and the like is given to men upon the use, employment and improvement of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall endowments, which is that Stigmatized do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Pelagius</hi> so notoriously refuted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as formerly hath been cleard; where we had this very doctrine in the hands of the <hi>Massilians</hi> related by <hi>Prosper</hi> charging them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with high <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> onely Master <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath another fetch for it, that new vouchsafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> unto all in their naturall birth, he tels us of, which how miserable a shift it is, hath formerly been discovered.</p>
                  <p>But that we may have the whole mistery of Master <hi>Goodwins</hi> doctrine about this point, and see his vaine, and selfe-subverting Sophistry. I shall add and examine a notorious passage, <hi>Page</hi> 329. and 330. of his Book, the summe whereof is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>1. <q>Regeneration (saith he) imports a reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58777:102"/>

 I answer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is a generation over andabove a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer generation. 2. It cannot import a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of naturall generation: true, therefore it must import a repetition of spirituall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

As children are radically rationall, though in their infancy reason cannot expresse it selfe in many fruits: so are they radically sinfull, and that unto death in sin, though sin in that age cannot expresse it selfe as to many fruits of it.</p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58777:105"/>
with the Parable, and is withall the sence of the Fathers generally who have spoken to it; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, (at least the prime sence) of diverse Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Divines of the best note: See the text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 14. to the 31. to which is Paralel, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. to the 28.</p>
                  <p>The maine parts of this Parable are three: the</p>
                  <p>First, Of <hi>a man,</hi> (a noble man <hi>Luke 19. 12.) travelling into a far Country (to receive a Kingdome Luke,</hi> ibid) and committing to his servants his goods, and these goods (talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 15. pounds, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 13.) by them to be imployed for encrease to their Lord. <hi>vers.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>This noble man is Christ, this far Country heaven, his journey thither, his ascention; the Kingdome he is gone to receive, the Kingdome of glory at the resurrection; these servants, the Ministers of the Gospell, these talents or pounds the doctrine of the Gospell, committed to their Ministry; their employment for encrease, the faithfull discharge of their Ministry, with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent labour against manifold hazzards, whereby the Gospell-Kingdome of Christ takes place in the world and is enlarged, as in the Parrable <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 41. to the 49. the servant there is not the Christian in generall, but the Minister of the Gospell, <hi>viz.</hi> the Steward of his Lords house, whom upon his faithfull discharge of his trust in the houshold, <hi>his Lord will make him Ruler over all that he hath,</hi> verse 42. with 44. So here the servants are the same; <hi>si</hi> Ministers of the Gospell, to whose trust the Lord hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mannaging &amp; improvement of his estate, <hi>si</hi> his Kingdome here upon Earth, till his next

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>g, whom upon their faithfull discharge of this their trust, he will in like manner advance to further Rule, as in the third part of the Parrable is exprest, vers. 21. and 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quere.</hi> But what may the inaeqality of the talents here signifie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> In Parables there are some essentiall parts, some amplifications for ornament; the essentiall parts are of speciall signification, in close connexion with the scope, the amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of more generall signification, which if they should be too presiesly restrained, would many times pervert the true interpretation; as to give one instance. In the parable of the rich man in Hell, he is represented as taking care for his friends upon earth, that they may not come into those torments; we may not hence conclude that the damned in hell, have a loving affection towards, and a tender care of their friends yet living in the world, such an amplification no es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall part I conceive the inaequality of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents here to be of this general signification, that the Lord doth in much wisdom, and with due circumspection commit the Gospell ministry to the Ministers thereof, good &amp; bad; of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> immediately follows viz. to every one according to his several ability; that is ingeneral, the Lord requires a faithfull discharge of their Ministry, from every one of them; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the meanest, but he that should give such a speciall interpretation as this; that even those Ministers who prove unfaithfull, and inbane condemnation in the end, had the least charge committed to them, and the least opportunities of Gospell-ministration, should swerve from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58777:106"/>
the truth; therefore to shew that this is no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of the Parable, in <hi>Luke</hi> there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequality of the pounds, nor different ability of the Servants mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the parable vers. 16. 17, 18. the carriage of those servants in the absence of their Lord; two of them trade with their talents and make encrease; these are the fruitfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who give diligent heed to the worke of the Ministery which they have received of the Lord, their increase is the fruits of their labours in the conversion and edification of soules, in planting and propogating the Churches of Christ; By the faithfull discharge of the Gospell ministery, the Kingdome of Christ in the world increaseth, as when leaven is put into dough, the Masse encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, or as when a graine of Mustardseed growes into a spreading tree. The third diggs into the earth and hides his Lords money; this is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull Minister, who neglects the charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, the doctrine of the Gospell, by Christ committed to his hand, as a lighted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which <hi>he puts under a bushell,</hi> or under a bed, so <hi>that it gives no light to the house;</hi> the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Steward that gives not the family their meat in due season; too sloathfull to endure the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the Ministery, too fearefull to abide the hazards, and undergoe the sufferings, too worldly and sensuall, to minde the spirituall concernments thereof, with the necessary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the things of this life. Now ensues the third part of the Parable, the returne of this Noble man, his calling these servants to account, and rendring to them according to their carriage in his absence, v. 19, to the 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:58777:106"/>
The returne of this Noble man, is the coming of Christ to judgement; his reckoning with his servants: his calling the Ministers of the gospell to account; A word of weighty caution here to them: with them shall Christ begin, in the day of judgement: The accounts of the first and second here, are the accounts of the faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, the ministery in their hands hath been fruitfull, the recompence rendred them by their Lord, making them rulers over many things, and receiving them into his joy, is the State of glory conferd upon them; a state of highest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and fullest joy, agreeable hereunto is that of the Apostle. 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>The account of the third servant, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the evil and unfruitfull Minister who to colour his own sloath and wickednesse, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Lord with austerity and unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; the manner of hypocrites, and wicked ones, to cast their faults upon the Lord, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at once of disobedience and insolence. The labours and hazards which are indeed required of the faithfull Minister, he looks at as intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and therefore takes and easier course, but to the destruction of himself and his hearers, repining in his spirit against the Lord, who hath made the ministeriall charge so laborious and hazardous, vers. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>The answer of his Lord unto him. vers. 26, 27. is such, as makes way for his condemnation out of his own mouth <hi>Lu.</hi> 19. 22. Because he had such hard thoughts of Christ, to whom he must give account, he should therefore have used his utmost diligence to have fulfilled his ministry; Christ shall need no other testymonies against

                  <speaker>Goodwin.</speaker>
                  <p>Concerning the Grace of God and the freenesse thereof, I hold and teach nothing but what fayrely and fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with these positions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the originall or first spring of the salvation of the world, and so of every particular person, that comes to be saved, was in and from the Grace, the free Grace and good pleasure of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the whole method or systeme of the Councels by which and according to which God effecteth and bringeth to passe the salvation of all that are saved, did proceed wholly and entirely from the same grace and good pleasure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And more particularly, That the gift of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ for a Mediatour and Saviour unto the world, and so the Grant or Promise of Iustification and salvation unto men, by or upon beleeving, issued solely and wholly from the same grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That men by nature and of themselves, i. e. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in and under such a condition, as they were brought into by <hi>Adam,</hi> and wherein they should have subsisted (in Case they had ever been borne, and lived in the world.) Had not the free grace of God in Christ inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to relieve them and better their Condition, have no strength or power, not the least inclination or propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of wil, to doe any thing, little or much acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God or of a saving import.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That notwithstanding this restauration or healing of the naturall condition of man by the free grace of God, yet there is not one of a thousand, possibly not one through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world but so farre corrupts himselfe with the lusts of the flesh and wayes of the world, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58777:109"/>
a second reliefe from the free grace of God, as, <hi>viz.</hi> in his patience and long suffering towards him, ever comes to repent or beleeve, or to persevere beleeving and so to be saved.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That it is from the free and undeserved grace of God, that any person of man-kind, is so much as put into a Capacity of beleeving or hath power and meanes vouchsafed unto him sufficient to enable him to beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That a man is put into this capacity of beleeving by an irresistable acting or working of the free grace of God.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That when any man by vertue of the power and meanes vouchsafed unto him by the free grace of God comes actually to beleeve, the exercise and acting of this power proceeds also from the free grace and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, so that no man ever beleeveth without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and actuall assistance from the free grace of God, in order to this his beleeving, over and above his ability or power to beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. (And lastly) That the Act of beleeving whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is performed by any man, is so inconsiderably and at so low a rate of efficiency from a mans selfe, that (to helpe apprehension a little in the case) suppose the Act of beleeving, could be divided into a thousand parts or degrees, nine hundred ninety and nine of them are to be ascribed unto the free grace of God, and onely the one remaining unto man; yea this one degree of the Action is no otherwise neither to be ascribed unto man then as gratiously supported, strengthened and assisted by the free grace of God.</p>
                  <p>The Reader will finde none of these Positions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by any thing affirmed or denyed in the di course: I attribute as much as possible can be attributed to the free grace of God, in and about the Act of beleeving, salving the attributablenesse of the action unto man himselfe, in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58777:109"/>
the lowest and most diminutive sence that can well be conceived. It is man that beleeves, not God; therefore so much efficiency about it must be left to man, as may give it denomination of being his.</p>

                  <speaker>Resbury.</speaker>
                  <p>Reader, one word in generall; doth not he seeme to speake fairely for grace here? but never did any man play more fast and loose with sound and sense of his doctrin, then this Author doth; how Orthodox soever any of these posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be in their sound, not any one of them is so in the sense by him intended.</p>
                  <p>Read over his-first Position and his second, which are very generall, &amp; the third where thou hast some explication of the former; then add the sixt, and thou hast a further explication; they all together come to this. <q>That God of his meer good pleasure appointed that all beleevers should be saved by Jesus Christ; that of the same good pleasure or grace, he gave Jesus Christ for the world; that by him all men are in their naturall generation put into a Capacity of beleeving, and have means sufficient afforded them for salvation: that in all this God hath an equall respect of grace to all men. </q>By this time then thou mayst discerne, how different this grace which he teacheth, is from that Grace which the Scriptures teach, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God chose from all eternity by a speciall Decree of peculiar grace, the persons of those unto salvation, who in the end are saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Decree (wherein the grace of it appeares) not founded upon Faith or Workes, or any thing in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58777:110"/>
Man foreseen, but meerly upon his owne good will and pleasure, that according to this Decree, he gave them to Christ, and Christ for them, by his Redemption to bring them certainly to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that of the same meere grace he doth in his owne time effectually call them, thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating them in their actuall state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as formerly he had in his Councel, from the rest of men; in their Call uniting them to Christ, blessing them with all spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in him to the effectuall obtainment of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is such grace as which notwithstanding the greatest number of persons by farre to whom it belongs, perish everlastingly; for he makes it equally belong to all the world, the greatest part whereof by far (I thinke he will not deny) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth Position; The sinne and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of Mans condition in <hi>Adam,</hi> is meerly noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall: He doth not allow, that one man living is in that condition by his naturall conception and birth; whereas the Scriptures teach and with them the Fathers against the <hi>Pelagian</hi> heresie, that all men are borne in that condition, and remaine therein till they be regenerate by the peculiar grace of God, as we have formerly seen at large.</p>
                  <p>For the fifth: 1. He teacheth the <hi>Pelagian</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the naturall and unregenerate man, casting a false glosse over it of restauration and healing, as we discours'd above.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He teacheth the <hi>Pelagian</hi> method of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that Grace is given according to Mans merit. This second reliefe from the free grace of God, being nothing but his patience and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58777:110"/>
through which man being spared, mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> such use of his naturall endowments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles, as thereupon the Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ration (whatsoever it is to which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes that name) is given, as we saw lately in his explication of the Parable of the Talents.</p>
                  <p>For the sixth and seventh: What is here affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, we must understand of all Men at their birth or conception rather, according to his explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. formerly. And so Originall sin, at least that which he himselfe granted by <hi>Adam</hi> in his fourth Position here is prevented to all men, never takes hold of any; the very thing by <hi>Pelagius</hi> maintained, and in him condemned; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a new fetch for it.</p>
                  <p>For the eighth: As in his Preface hitherto and in his following Booke, whensoever he hath occasion to speak to the influx of God for the operation of grace in man; he hovers in the Clouds and keeps in Generals (well acquainted with that rule <hi>Dolus in Universalibus.)</hi> So here he tels us of a present and actuall assistance; but if the Reader here conceive that he grants an effii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious impression upon the will of man, by the spirit of God, determining it to the Act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and working in man to beleeve, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himselfe; for against such a doctrine he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth bitter Tragedies.</p>
                  <p>For the ninth: He denyes the whole act of beleeving to be from God, and he renders his reason, because then it could be Mans act. The falshood of this position, and the vanity of the reason annex'd may thus appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the position: God is the Author of all being, he being the onely Creator; but every
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58777:111"/>
part or degree of the act of beleeving (supposing it divided into whatsoever parts) is something, a being <hi>Contra-</hi>distinguisht to nothing: If Man be the Author of any part, whereof God is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Man creates.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is the Author of all good, he being the one unchangeable and necessary Good. He good of himselfe, all other things by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but every part of the act of beleeving is good; therefore from God the onely foundation of all good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Act of believing is specially good; all parts of that act are uniforme in nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Man be the Author of any part, whereof God is not, Man apart from God is the Author of something specially good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Man may be the Author of one part of being, of good, of speciall good; why not of more? Why not of the whole? and so Man shall be the Creator of the noblest operations; why should we then have inferiour operations for God to be the Author of, and not deny him the Author of all or any?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the Reason: That God is the Author of the whole, doth no way deny Mans efficiency, or take the denomination of the act from him: Where causes are subordinate, the whole effect is produced by both; thus when in writing the teacher guides the learners hand, they both write the whole, every letter, and every part of every letter. In the motion of higher and lower wheeles, the lesse within the greater, the whole motion is performed by both; In causes thus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, but of different kindes, the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is from the dependent cause. Thus when
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58777:111"/>
the Plummet moves the wheele of the clock round, we say the wheele, not the Plummet turnes round; but the Plummet is the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Thus when the Earth springs forth her fruits, God is the Author of them, of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of them; yet the Earth springs them, though he produce them; he springs them not, but makes her to spring them. The denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the action ever belonging to the inferior cause, because in it is the principle whence the action Emergeth: In the production of Faith then, God works, and man works, and Man not one part onely, but the whole, but this in subordination to God who works the whole likewise; yet Man beleeves, not God, because in Man is the principle whence the act of beleeving issues: His will, but his will by grace renewed; His wil the principle which beleeves: Grace renewing the will the principle by which he beleeves: He beleeves in whom is the act of beleeving produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; It is not produced by God in himselfe, but by influx from himselfe in Man.</p>
                  <p>It is no immanent action in God, but in Man, in him produced by a transient action of God upon him. Therefore I say with <hi>Austin;</hi> 
                     <q>It is certaine that when we will, we will, but it is he that makes us to will that which is good, who <hi>works in us both to will and to doe.</hi> So that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that when we beleeve, we beleeve;</q> but it is he that makes us to beleeve, and that not in part, but in whole. Appositely <hi>Bernard,</hi> ascribing all that is good in man to the grace of God; <q>Not partly grace (saith he) and partly free will, but each of them by an undivided work, performes the whole.</q>This, the whole; and that, the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58777:112"/>
whole; but as the whole is in this, so the whole is from that: Excellently <hi>Austine,</hi> proving not only the whole of Faith to be from God, but the denyall of it to be <hi>Pelagianisme.</hi> Having first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Faith to be of God, he adds (as formerly we have quoted him) <q>Furthermore if God work our Faith, acting in our hearts in a wonderfull manner, that we may beleeve, shall we feare least he be not able to do the whole? </q>Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the <hi>Pelagian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sme</hi> of the denyall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Man challengeth to himselfe the first part of it, that he may deserve from him to receive the last. S e if any thing be done by this meanes, but that the grace of God, one way or other may be given according to our merits; and so grace shall not be grace.</p>
                  <p>Then in the prosecution of this discourse, he blames the pride of Man, that he will (as it were) Compound with God, so as to challenge part of his Faith to himselfe, and leave part thereof to God; and which is yet more arrogant, he will take the first part to himselfe, (and pray say Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> if this be not your part) leave the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part to God: and in that which he saith belongs to them both, he makes himselfe to goe before, and God to behinde.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we seen the vanity, fraud, and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of your positions; as for the close of this Section, it may well passe for Smoak, and so may indeed all that follows, in the rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
