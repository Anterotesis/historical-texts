         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſheweth who they are that ſhall be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and deceiued thereby, namely, they that are caſtawaies, and ordeined to deſtruction: and he addeth therewithall a reaſon thereof: the contempt of the trueth, whereby they might be ſaued: and that this ſhall be the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to giue them therefore ouer to the ſtrong illuſion of ſeducing, and erroneous ſpirites, to their vtter confuſion, &amp; deſtruction.</p>

As for the title Chriſt, the writinges<note place="margin">Chriſt.</note> of the Prophetes, and Apoſtles doth with one conſent witneſſe, that it hath bene geuen vnto him by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, For whatſoeuer hath bene, by the one foreſhewed, and promiſed of the Mesſiah: the other ſheweth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, after his comming to haue bene performed.

               <p>Secondly, we learne how tender a thing the vnitie and conſente of the church in Chriſt is, and how eaſilye it is ſhaken and diſſolued, if once any chinke be made: and this enemie get in by neuer ſo litle a creuice, he ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly breaketh the whole lincking together thereof.

               <p>Laſtly, to paſſe ouer many other thinges which this plentifull and god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly place of the Apoſtle doth offer. It is euidently perceaued by the reaſons

which he bringeth, and vttereth with great vehemencie: that they which cleaue not wholy vnto Chriſt, &amp; depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<note place="margin">They that ſtick not wholy to Chriſt, deuide him and deceue themſelues.</note> not altogether of him, but are caryed with affection els where, and doe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie as the Apoſtle him ſelfe ſaith in men, doe deuide him and breake their promiſe made vnto him: and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe cut of themſelues from him, and therewithall he cleerely ſheweth, euen by the things which he chargeth them with, to their ſhame, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting thereof: that they knew ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fully, neither rightly, Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in his name. But in ſtead of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſt, to ſpeake plainly, that they had deuiſed vnto themſelues a certain ſhadow, and a very image or idole of him. Which thing not onely to haue happened vnto them, hee ſhall eaſelye perceiue, who ſo hardly wayeth thoſe beginninges, with the proceedinges, euen vntill our time, and ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with a iudgement voyde of all preiudice, the firſt and latter together, thoſe thinges that the Apoſtle did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand write of in bot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Epiſtles

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16682:29"/>
Let vs beholde, as it were through a window, what hath bene his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, and his procéedinges, when he purpoſed to weaue this long web, to wit, when he once determined with him ſelfe either to ouerthrow or ſhake the kingdome of Chriſt, which againſt his will he ſaw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to encreaſe: he woulde craftely begin with ſmall beginninges, that hys craft might not eaſily be eſpyed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he woue his web ſuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Satan began with ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings to hide his intent.

For this deceauer knew that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion could not be more ſharplye aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, then vnder the viſor of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He knew that the deſire of honeſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarines, hatred of the world, or (as Iohn deſcrybeth it) of the things that are in the world, made a goodly ſhew in mennes eyes: that ſecrete places gaue great oportunitie to the reading and meditation of holy Scripture, to continuall prayers, and the endeuour of all kinde of good works. All which things ſeme to geue a taſte as it were of the heauenly and euerlaſtinge life. With this pretence of religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16682:29"/>
into ſolitarines, men began to<note place="margin">The ſimplicitie and puritie of the Goſpell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</note> departe from the ſimplicitie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the puritie of chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The way was forſaken which Chriſt and his Apoſtles by worde and déede ſet forth. And the eyes of many being bewitched with theſe ſleightes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and their mindes being mooued with noueltie, (ſuch is mans vanitie and curioſitie) they ſuffred themſelues wholy to be ouertaken, and poſſeſſed of the enemie of true godlines. For after he had once made his way, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this goodly cloake, to change, and innouate thinges, he ſo procéeded in<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Satan in corrupting the Goſpel more and more.</note> changing, innouating, and adding to, that at laſt he lefte nothing of the olde trade, and made all thinges new: the thing it ſelfe ſheweth how true that common ſaying is, A little error at the beginning, proueth to be greate in the end. Becauſe theſe beginnings were not ſtopped, and ſuch remedy was not applyed as Paul vſed in the church of Corinth: this peſtilent diſeaſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran welnere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole church of Chriſt For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy ſo by litle &amp; litle brought in, and ſet out to lyking, his darcknes,

               <p>As touching Chriſtian ceremonies which the Sonne of God would haue to be verie fewe in number, but in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, (as Auguſtine well wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) moſt effectuall: Good God who<note place="margin">The Church of Chriſt loaden with Iewiſh and Heatheniſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note> is able to declare with howe manye, and what ſupplies hath this deceauer loden and ouerwhelmed them?

(theſe two partes as I haue ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted) did ſo wholye deraye: that it ſeemed rather to be called Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh then Chriſtian.

Wherunto agree thoſe things, which

Mathew and Luke doe write, that he ſaide of his comming into this world. The ſonne of man (ſaith he) came to<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 11 Luke. 19. 10</note> ſéek, and to ſaue that which was loſt.

This is the teſtimonie of God, that he hath geuen<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 11. 12.</note> vs life euerlaſting, and this life is in his ſonne. He that hath the ſonne hath life, he that hath not the ſonne, hath not life.

               <p>And hetherunto doth plainlye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, that the Apoſtles call him in ſome places, the ſauiour of the world. Now this title in Gréeke, as it very well agreeth with the Hebrue name

name, whereof I haue ſpoken before, ſo is it ſo great (if we beléeue Cicero, a fitte witneſſe herein) that it cannot be vttered and expreſſed with one latine worde. For it noteth him that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth health, or ſaluation.

But as touching men, this honour is for no other cauſe geuen vnto them, then for that they are choſen and appoynted by our Sauiour Chriſt, that he might diſtribute and poure abroade vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by them as his in ſtrumentes, that power of ſauing which he hath of his own, and reſting in himſelf, which

Againe where is that fréedome, continuance, frankneſſe of ſpéech, and holy boldnes, which the ſame Apoſtle commandeth, in teaching, exhorting, reprouing in ſeaſon, and without ſeaſon: where is the feruencie of Spirite, and zeale of the houſe of God? Briefly, where are the fire, and burning yrons agaynſt dangerous diſeaſes, and ſuch that can not bee cured with lighter remedies? And if they are not able to cut them of by excommunication from their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by reaſon of the great power they haue, why do not they cut themſelues

So Paule ſéemeth to haue excommunicated the Iewes, whiles forſaking them, he turned him ſelfe vnto the Gentiles, as the Lorde commanded him. If a man may iudge<note place="margin">Act. 13. ver. 46</note> by the effectes, (which is a readie rule in this kinde of matter) theſe gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or rouing Marchants haue ſome other purpoſes in their mindes, and do followe ſome other reſpectes. It is not the deſire, and hope to cure euils, not the loue of trueth and godlines, not the endeuour of holy life, which dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth them to the porches &amp; precinctes of Prelates: but the ſame deſire that allureth Dogges, and Rauens to ſeeke carcayſes and carraine.

So farre of is it, that they doe bridle the olde riot, and madneſſe, that they incite them, being of them

What ſhould I ſay? we finde by experience that the former tyrannie is ſo increaſed, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it may ſéeme that theſe new counſellours were heard, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Popes, euen as the hiſtorie of the olde Teſtament declareth, that Roboam ſometime accepted the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell<note place="margin">1.

There were alſo amongſt the people very many, which were oftentimes ſtirred vp by thoſe bellowes. Amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles there were diuers kindes and ſtates, as thoſe times did require, of the which perhaps ſomewhat ſhal be ſpoken at an other time. Now I will ſpeake of a certayne kind, which that perpetuall enimie of Chriſt, and hys Church had ſet foorth by a ſpeciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and inſtructed with a peculiar ſubtiltie. It was a kinde of men both very craftie and very peſtilent: the<note place="margin">The Nazareans deſcribed, and their practiſes, agaynſt Paule.</note> which as it did the more ſecretly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the Church, ſo did it hurt it more daungerouſly. Firſt it crept in ſubtilly to the duetie of teaching: for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:16682:80"/>
it inſinuated it ſelfe, as it appeareth, vnder the colour of ſpreading abroad the Goſpell. And for as muche as the name of Paule was very famous, for his marueilous dexteritie in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpell, and his happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in publiſhing thereof, (whiche thing alſo gote him the hatred of very many) theſe hypocrites thought beſt chiefly to ſet them ſelues agaynſt him: thinking that to be very profitable for their purpoſes, and deuiſes. For they thought that to be the readyeſt waye for them to come to glory, and gayne, which they onely regarded, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they turned all their doctrine. Therfore taking vpon them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">The Nazareans tooke vppon them to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</note> of Apoſtles, they ſought by all kinde of lyes &amp; trecheries, to remoue Paule from his place, and to thruſt him from his ſeate: that is, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all authoritie from him, and they troubled him wonderfully with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſlaunders. Nowe as they had taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to vexe, and to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite him aboue others: ſo he dealing with a good conſcience in this his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, did ſet him ſelfe ſtoutly, and

As therefore he well vnderſtoode the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of theſe deceiuers, ſo he moſte clearely diſcouered them vnto all congregations, paynting them out, as it is ſayd, in their owne colers, and that not in worde onely, but alſo by writing, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> memory therof might remayne with the poſteritie, to their great profite. For the Church hath in<note place="margin">Paule in theſe paynteth out al falſe teachers to the poſteritie for euer.</note> that deſcription of the Apoſtle a liuely picture of all falſe teachers, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: whiche if all that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, did marke, and note, it would be farre better with a great number, and the Church of Chriſte ſhould féele leſſe hurt. Verely in that picture of the Apoſtle, theſe new kind of deceiuers of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we now ſpeake, ſéemeth vnto me moſt of all to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.

Herein they doe agree well firſt, that as that enemie of Chriſt, ſo ſoone as the Goſpell began to be publiſhed amongſt the Gentiles, brought them in ſubtelly vnder the pretence of the lawe, and religion of Moſes: So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly when the light of the goſpel began to ſhine again, &amp; to be reſtored, craftily he ſtirred vp, &amp; not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed into the Church, but alſo by, and by aduaunced theſe, béeing coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the title of Ieſus, and decked with the ſhewe of godlynes, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with many practiſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.

What the doctrine of Paule was, his Epiſtles doe witneſſe: but what his aduerſaries was, it maye certaynely bee knowen, partely by Luke, Acts 15. chapter: partely by Paule him ſelfe, namely out of the

Epiſtle to the Galathians: and partly by Hierom, eſpecially out of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon Ezechiel, 16. chap. and certayne other olde writers. The effect is, they went about to couple the keeping of the olde lawe (theſe are Hieromes owne wordes) with the grace of the Goſpell, and to ioyne Moſes vnto Chriſt. But howe ſmall<note place="margin">The Ieſuits not like Paule, but the Nazareans, in their doctrin.</note> a matter is this, I pray you, if it bee compared with the riffe raffe of the Ieſuites doctrine, in the which there is ſcarce a leafe, wherein there is not read ſome, much more gréeuouſer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche againſt Chriſt, then that was? If for that doctrine the Apoſtle doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, and that with indignation, to call them the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, which inuerted the goſpell, which he hauing receiued of Chriſt, had preached: are not theſe to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">The Ieſuits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face God, and his glory, in ſanctifying, and deifying men.</note> for the very ſworne enemies of Chriſte, and his Goſpell, of all thoſe that haue profeſſed Chriſte, that loue him, and are carefull for his glorye?
