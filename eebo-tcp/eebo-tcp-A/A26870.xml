            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GOD having called away to his Blessed
Rest and Glory, the Spirit of the most
dear Companion of these last Nineteen
Years of my Life, or near; I found in
her Last Will a request, that I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
five Hundred of her Mothers Funeral-Sermons,
written by me 1661, being now out of Press, called
<hi>The last Work of a Believer, his Passing Prayer,</hi> &amp;c.
Not only her very great Love and Honour of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
Mother moved her to it, but the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Vsefulness of that subject to Dying Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
a Subject about which her Soul was awakened
the more, by the Death of many Friends and excellent
Christians taken away this Year. And the day some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
excited her, for it was written by her on <hi>Decem.
30,</hi> the same day which she kept secretly as an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
Remembrance of the Sentence of Death from
which she had been delivered; and the same day when
<pb facs="tcp:59245:3"/>
our dear Friend Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> lay dying. And I finde
some expectations of her own speedy Death, had some
hand in it.</p>
            <p>Being thus obliged by her Request, mine own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
urged me to premise this <hi>Breviate</hi> of her own
Life: Written, I confess, under the power of melting
Grief, and therefore perhaps with the less prudent
judgment; but not with the less, but the more Truth:
For passionate Weakness poureth out all, which greater
Prudence may conceal. Conscionable mens Histories
are true; but if they be also wise, they tell us but some
part of Truth, concealing that which would do harm,
and which the depraved world cannot bear without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
it: But we that are less wise, tell all the Truth,
too little regarding how men will receive it. And hence
comes all History, which hath not evidence equal to
natural, to be of less credit than most men think; while
bad men lie, and good men leave out so much of the
Truth, as makes the rest to be as another thing than
altogether it would appear.</p>
            <p>And having purposed to write this <hi>Breviate</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my dear Wife, God having the same year taken
away two more of my ancient Family, I wrote a <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate</hi>
of their Lives also; One was my excellent holy
Mother-in-Law, <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>Thomas
Hunks,</hi> Widow to my dear Father. She was one of
the most humble, mortified, holy persons, that ever I
knew; and lived in longing to be with Christ, till
she was an Hundred years old wanting three or four, in
full understanding, and at last rejoycing in the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
frequent hearing and repeating the 91 <hi>Psalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59245:3"/>
The other was my old Friend and Housekeeper, <hi>Jane
Matthews,</hi> who lived in pious humble Virginity, with
eminent worth, to about Seventy six or Seventy seven
years, and Died of mere decay, without considerable
Pain or Sickness, about a Month, or six Weeks before
my Wife.</p>
            <p>To these I added a fourth, a <hi>Breviate</hi> of the Life
and Death of that worthy Mother of my Wife, as to
the time since I knew her. But I have cast by all these
later three, and much of the first, by the Counsel of
wise Friends, as things which they think that Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
will not make so great a matter <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Nearness</hi> made me do. And I must <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that God's
<hi>Image</hi> is the same thing on all his Children; and when
you have described one, you have described all, as to the
Essentials. But (as in Faces and bodily Strength)
they so much differ in Integrals, Degrees and Accidents,
that the Lives of some are far more Exemplary and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to Christ their Lord, and their Christian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
than others are. And some are so much ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished
by Errours, Soul-Diseases, and miscarriages of
Life, yea and injuries to the Church of Christ, by their
carnal Animosities and Divisions, as rendereth the
Examples of the more wise, holy, loving and peaceable,
and patient Christians, the more conspicuous and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
by the difference.</p>
            <p>On this account, finding young people naturally much
delighted in History, and that for want of better, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
are quickly corrupted and ensnared by Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books,
Romances, Play-books, and false or hurtful
<pb facs="tcp:59245:4"/>
History, I have long thought that true and useful Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
is of great use to prevent such evils, and to many
profitable ends: And that to young people it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to begin with the Scripture-History, and next
the Lives of holy persons, and next to read the true
Church-Historians, and the History of our Native
Country; <hi>Melchior Adamus</hi> in <hi>Germany, Beza</hi> in his
<hi>Icones, Thuanus</hi> and many others in <hi>France,</hi> have
done the Church this way great service, by a due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of Exemplary persons. And such as <hi>Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Scultetus, Thuanus,</hi> and others who have recorded
the chief passages of their own Lives, have done a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
work, though <hi>Mom'es</hi> will say, <hi>They publish
their own Praise in Pride.</hi> There is no saying or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the world, which bad men will not
reproach, or put an evil face on, or make an ill use of
to themselves. But he that reads such Lives as <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choltzers,
melanchtons,</hi> and their like, and then
readeth their Church-Histories, will the better discern
that they were no Liars.</p>
            <p>As it is Satans work to counterwork Christ by the
Abuse and Perversion of his own Ordinances and
Means, (as to disgrace Revelation by feigned Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and Spirituality by false pretendings to the
Spirit, and Magistracy by wicked Magistrates, and
the Ministry by worldly and ungodly Ministers, and
Christianity by hypocrite false Christians;) so he doth
enervate the credit and use of History by false History.
And how great use he hath made of this to promote
Popery, he that readeth <hi>Jacobus de Voragine,</hi> and
many other of their Legends, or Saints Lives and
Miracles, and such as <hi>Tympius</hi> and many more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb facs="tcp:59245:4"/>
their voluminous deceitful Histories of Church,
Popes and Councils, may quickly finde.</p>
            <p>And being my self a vehement Hater of false Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
I beg Pardon of the Reader for interposing this
Digression: Lately writing of the Iudgment of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and others, as cited by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his
<hi>Irenicon,</hi> about Episcopacy, that the Reader might
know where to find it, I added in a Parenthesis, that
it was left out in Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Book: For this I am
accused, as disgracing him and his Book falsly. I here
do him right, and confess it was ill done of me to judge
so hastily without better tryal: But I must tell him
wherein my fault consisted; Not in accusing him; I
take it not to be a fault in D. B. that he hath omitted
many things that are in <hi>Fuller, Fox,</hi> and others: I had
not thought that his Book was disgraced, if he wrote
not over again all that every one else had written before
him. But my fault lay, 1. In believing Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi>
who tells us, That these Papers were written in
K. <hi>Edward's</hi> Reign, which made me look for them in
Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> Second Volume, where they are not. And
another affirming to me, that he saw them in that second
Volume, and I perusing it purposely a second time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
me. But Dr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> was
mistaken many years, and that they were written long
before, in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and so he hath them in
his first Volume, which I had not perused, not expecting
them there. And for this hasty judging, I beg his Pardon.</p>
            <p>As to these little private Histories of mine own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
forementioned, I was loath to cast by mine own
Mother-in-Laws Life, She being a person of so long
<pb facs="tcp:59245:5"/>
and extraordinay Holiness, living (long with Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Harley,</hi> whose Lady was her Cousin-German, and
after at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and after with my Father and
me, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> in so great Communion with God, contempt of
the World, and all its Pomp and Vanity, so great Victory
over the flesh, and so long desires to die, and especially
in much constant, fervent, successful Prayer, that had
marvellous answers, as very few Christians attain.</p>
            <p>And I was loath to have cast by the Narrative of my
Wifes Mother, for some Reasons not now to be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and because her Daughters extraordinary Love
to her, made her just honour very dear to her: (But
her Character is in the Sermon truly given you).</p>
            <p>But I am convinced by the judgment of my Friends,
that publick things are fittest for publick notice. And
I feel that <hi>Love, Grief</hi> and <hi>Nearness</hi> affect me with
the matters that are so near me; and as it doth not
much concern the world to know whether I am sick or
well, dead or alive, or whether ever I had a being,
(though it concerns me:) So I should think of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of my Friends. Affection makes us think our
own or our Friends affairs to be such, as the world
should be affected with: I perceive this weakness, and
submit.</p>
            <p>That which is left out of the Narrative of my Wifes
Life, is the occasions and inducements of our Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and some passages between some Relatives and her,
which the world is not concerned (yet at least) to know.</p>
            <p>If this that is written seem useless to any, it will
<pb facs="tcp:59245:5"/>
not hurt them, if they leave it to others that find it
more suitable to them: All things be not agreeable to
all: That may be useful to persons of her own quality,
which is not so to many others. To her Nephews, and
Neeces, and some other Kindred, who were also near
to her, and for whose sake above most others I write it,
you cannot think that it will be altogether useless. O
that they would all imitate her in all that is praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
and needful to themselves. The grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
I foresee will be, That I seem but to predicate
some of mine own good Works by praising hers. And
must I needs bury the memory of them as hers, for fear
of the sting of such Objectors? I have told them truly,
It is not my own acts, but those that were properly
hers, that I there mention. It is not her giving of my
Money which I there recite, but that which either was
her own and none of mine, or else procured by her for
those uses; and the Works such, in which I was but
the Executor of her Will.</p>
            <p>She is gone after many of my choicest Friends, who
within this one year are gone to Christ, and I am fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
even at the door. Had I been to enjoy them
only here, it would have been but a short comfort, mixt
with the many troubles which all our Failings and
Sins, and some degree of unsuitableness between the
nearest and dearest, cause. But I am going after them
to that Blessed Society, where Life, Light and Love,
and therefore Harmony, Concord and Ioy are perfect
and everlasting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> While I give thee but the Truth, forgive
the effects of Age, Weakness and Grief. And if before

own; if thou accept them not, forgive them only and
neglect them. As the man is, such will be his
thoughts and works. The Lord prosper our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our great approaching Change. To leave this
world for ever, and enter upon an endless Life, where
we shall speed according to the preparations of this
little inch of time, doth certainly bespeak the most sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Thoughts, the wisest and speediest Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
the most patient Suffering, the most unwearied
Labour, the most frugal use of all our Time, the most
resolute resistance to all Temptations; and to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
the most joyful Hopes.</p>

who dyed June 14. 1681.</head>
            <head>CHAP. I. Her Parentage, and the occasion of our acquaintance.</head>
            <p>§. THough (due) affection make me
willing to give the world a Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
which else I had omitted; yet
the fear of God hath not so forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me, that I should willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
any falshood through partiality or passion: but
as I knew more of this person than any other, for
the good of the Readers and the honour of Gods
grace in her, I shall by Gods assistance truly report
the things which I knew.</p>
            <p>§. 2. We were born in the same County within
three miles and an half of each other; but she of
one of the chief Families in the County, and I but
of a mean Freeholder (called a Gentleman for his
Ancestors sake, but of a small Estate, though suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent):
Her Father, <hi>Francis Charlton</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> was one
of the best Justices of the Peace in that County, a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59245:8"/>
grave and sober worthy man, but did not marry till
he was aged and gray, and so dyed while his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were very young, who were three, of which
the eldest daughter and his only son are yet alive.
He had one surviving Brother, who after the Fathers
death maintained a long and costly suit about the
Guardianship of the Heir (yet living): <hi>This</hi> Unkle
<hi>(Robert)</hi> was a comely sober Gentleman, but the
wise and good Mother <hi>Mary</hi> durst not trust her on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Son in the hands of one that was his next heir.
And she thought that <hi>Nature</hi> gave her a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in him than an Unkle had. But it being in
the heat of the late Civil War, <hi>Robert</hi> being for the
Parliament, had the advantage of strength, which
put her to seek relief at <hi>Oxford</hi> from the King, and
afterwards to marry one Mr. <hi>Hanmer,</hi> who was
for the King, to make her interest that way. Her
house being a sort of a small Castle, was now gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
for the King. But at last <hi>Robert</hi> procured it
to be besieged by the Parliament's Soldiers, and
stormed and taken; where the Mother and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were, and saw part of their buildings burnt,
and some lye dead before their eyes; and so <hi>Robert</hi>
got possession of the children.</p>
            <p>But at last she by great wisdom and diligence sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
them, and secretly conveyed them to one
Mr. <hi>Bernards</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and secured them against all
his endeavours.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The Wars being ended, and she as Guardian
possessing her Son's Estate, took him (as only Son)
as her self, and used his Estate as carefully as for her
self, but out of it conscionably paid debts of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
repaired some of the ruined houses, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59245:8"/>
things faithfully, according to her best discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
until her Son marrying, took his Estate into his
own hand.</p>
            <p>§. 4. She (being before unknown to me) came
to <hi>Kederminster</hi> (twenty miles) desiring me to take
a House for her alone: I told her that I would not
be guilty of doing any thing which should separate
such a Mother from an only Son, who in his youth
had so much need of her counsel, conduct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
and that if passion in her, or any fault in him,
had caused difference, the love which brought her
through so much trouble for him, should teach her
patience, rather than forsake him. She went home,
but shortly came again, and took a house without
my knowledg.</p>
            <p>§. 5. When she had been there alone a while, her
unmarried daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> (about seventeen or
eighteen years of age) came after her from her
Brother's, resolving not to forsake the Mother who
deserved her dearest love; and sometime went to
<hi>Oxford</hi> to her elder sister (Wife to Mr. <hi>Ambrose
Vpton,</hi> then Canon of Christs Church, both yet
living). In this time the good old Mother lived as
a blessing among the honest poor Weavers of <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminster,</hi>
strangers to her, whose company for their
piety she chose before all the Vanities of the world.
In which time my acquaintance with her made me
know, that (notwithstanding she had formerly been
somewhat passionate) she was a woman of all that
manly patience in her great tryals, that prudence and
piety, and justice and impartiality, and other Virtues
which I mentioned in her Funeral Sermon. Of her
death anon. It is her daughters case that this is the
Prologue to.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of her Conversion, Sickness, and Recovery.</head>
            <p>§. IN her vain youth, <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> and
<hi>Company</hi> suitable thereto, did take her up; and
an imprudent <hi>rigid</hi> Governess that her Mother had
set over her in her absence, had done her hurt, by
possessing her with ill thoughts of strictness in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
yet she had a great reverence for some good
Ministers (especially Mr. <hi>Tho. VVright)</hi> and she
thought that she was not what she should be, but
something better (she knew not what) must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>In this case coming to <hi>Kederminster</hi> for meer love
to her Mother, she had great aversion to the PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERTY
and STRICTNESS of the people there,
glittering her self in costly Apparel, and delighting
in her Romances. But in a little time she heard and
understood what those better things were which she
had thought must be attained.</p>
            <p>And a Sermon of Mr. H. <hi>Hickman</hi>'s at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
much moved her (on <hi>Isa. 27. 11. It is a people of no
understanding, therefore he that made them will not
save them,</hi> &amp;c.) The Doctrine of Conversion (as I
preached it as now in my Treatise of Conversion)
was received on her heart as the seal on the wax.
Whereupon she presently fell to self-judging, and to
frequent prayer, and reading, and serious thoughts
of her present state, and her salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 2. A Religious Maid that waited on her, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59245:9"/>
king notice of this (for she kept all her matters so
secret to her self, as was her great hurt all her life)
acquainted her Mother with it; and when it would
be hid no longer, but her frequent Closet-prayers
were sometimes over-heard, and her changed course
of life discerned, her Mother (who as far as I could
discern, before loved her least of her three children)
began to esteem her as her Darling; and all her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Friends and Neighbours, were glad of so
sudden and great a change.</p>
            <p>§. 3. I will here give you one of her self-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Papers, which I find since her death, upon her
then sad convictions. When I had on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9.
told them how it may be known whether we have
Christs Spirit or not, she thus repeated the signs with
her self-condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 1. The Spirit of Christ is the Author of the
Scriptures, and therefore suiteth your disposition to it,
and guideth you by it.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 1. <q>I fear then I have not the Spirit of
Christ; for I yet feel no love to Gods word, nor
closure with it as suitable to me, but I am questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
the truth of it, or at best quarrelling with
it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 2. The Spirit of Christ is from heaven, from
God our Father, and leadeth us upward unto him. Its
work is spiritual, of heavenly tendency, making us cry
Abba Father, and working the heart by uniting love
to God.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 2. <q>It is not so with me; for I have a
Spirit tending only to selfishness and sin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59245:10"/>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 3. The Spirit of Christ uniteth us to Christ,
and one another by love, and is against hatred, divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and abusing others.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 3. <q>Mine then is the spirit of <hi>Cain,</hi> for
I cannot endure any that are not of my opinion
and way, and it inclineth me to malice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableness,
and division.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 4. The Spirit of Christ is a spirit of Holiness,
and doth not favour licentiousness in doctrine, or in
life.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 4. <q>Though I am for strict Principles, I
am loose in practise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 5. Christs Spirit inclineth to love, humility
and meeknest, and makes men stoop to each other for
their good.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 5. <q>None more uncharitable, proud and
censorious than I.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 6. The Spirit of Christ makes men little, low,
and vile in their own eyes, it is pride that puffeth up.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 6. <q>My self-conceitedness shews that I
am unhumbled.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 7. The Spirit of Christ doth work to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
of the flesh, even all its inordinate desires, and
to self-denial.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 7. <q>I am a stranger to the work of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and self-denial. I can deny my self no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the comfort of well-doing. I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
my sloth so far as to go to prayer when I am
convinced of my necessity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 8. The Spirit of Christ is a prevailing spirit,
and doth not only wish and strive, but overcome the
flesh as to its rule.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 8. <q>The flesh prevaileth with me against
the spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59245:10"/>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 9. Christs Spirit is the author of his Worship,
Ordinances, and suits the souls of believers to them, the
Word, Sacraments, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 9. <q>They seem not suitable to my soul;
I am against them, and had rather not use them,
if I durst.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark</hi> 10. Christs Spirit is in all the Saints, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
them to holy Communion with each other in love,
especially to those in whom this spirit most eminently
worketh.</p>
            <p>Judgm. 10.</p>
            <q>
               <p> It is not thus with me: I desire not
the Communion of Saints: my affections are most
to those who are best to me, whether they have
more or less of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>To go no further, it is now evident that I am a
graceless person: Though all these things be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in the best, and some are more wanting in one
particular than in another; yet where all their
contraries are predominant, as in me, that person
is told by this Sermon, <hi>that they are none of Christs;</hi>
how much doth my behaviour at this time make
this appear, when I can with a hard heart, and a
dry eye, and a steady hand declare my self at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
heir of everlasting wo! But the longest day
will quickly come, though I strive to put it as far
from me.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 4. It would be too long to recite a paper
which I find next to this, containing the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of self-judging, the reasons for it, the rules
for performing it, and the due manner; especially
in dangers, and before the Sacraments, or any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
of our state of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59245:11"/>
§. 5. But these Convictions did neither die, nor
pass unto despair, but to serious conversion; yet
put her to struggle hard against backwardness to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
duties, and the forsaking of some vanities; but
presently God seemed sharply to entertain this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
soul. And while we were all rejoicing in her
change, she fell into a Cough and seeming Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
in which we almost despaired of her life. Mr.
<hi>Iackson</hi> the Physician, and my self, seeing the case
too hard for us, described it to Dr. <hi>Prujean,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>G. Bates,</hi> who both judged it a Consumption
arising from the obstructions of the vessels in the
Lungs, and corrupting the tender adjoining parts,
and both prescribed her the same Medicines. But all
these, and change of air long, and breast-milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
did no good. I and my praying-neighbours were so
sorry that such a changed person should presently b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
taken away before she had time to manifest her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
and do God any service in the world, that
in grief they resolved to fast and pray for her. For
former experience had lately much raised their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the success of prayer. They had lately prayed
for one that seemed Demoniack, that (after some
years misery) was suddenly freed of that disease.
They had oft prayed for me in dangerous illness, and
I had speedy help. I had lately swallowed a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullet
for a Medicine, and it lodged in me long, and
no means would bring it away, till they met to fast
and pray, and it came away that morning. A young
man yet living, falling into a violent Epilepsie, and
after all means long remaining uncured, they set to
fasting and prayer in his hearing, and the second day
he was suddenly cured, and never had a fit since.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59245:11"/>
God did not deny their prayers, though they were
<hi>without Book,</hi> and such as some deride as extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
I was not with them in any of these, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were humble praying persons only.</p>
            <p>But I was with them at prayer for this woman;
and compassion made us all extraordinary servent,
and God heard us, and speedily delivered her as it
were by nothing, or by an altogether undesigned
means. She drank of her own inclination, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directed, a large quantity of syrrup of Violets,
and the next morning her nose bled (which it scarce
ever did before or since) and the Lungs seemed
cleared, and her pulse suddenly amended, her cough
abated, and her strength returned in short time.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. The workings of her soul in and after this
Sickness.</head>
            <p>§. 1. SHE being of too timerous and tender a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the sharp work of her <hi>Repentance</hi>
being yet upon her spirit; for <hi>Death</hi> to come and
seem to summon her away to Eternity at <hi>such a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>unsetled state,</hi> must needs greatly encrease
her fears, when the strongest long experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
find it no easie work to dye in peace, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
resignation. But she had still a concealing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which made it never the easier within.</p>
            <p>§. 2. When God had recovered her, her Mother
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59245:12"/>
invited those that fasted and prayed for her, to keep
a Day of Thanksgiving for her Deliverance. I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her what she would have us give thanks for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly?
And in the morning as we began, she (that
was recovered) gave us in this following Paper.</p>
            <q>
               <p>MY life hath been a life of very great mercies,
and these have <hi>aggravated</hi> my sin in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
them. Some of those which God hath
most affected my heart with, I shall here mention;
but alas! with a heart very insensible of the greatness
of them.</p>
               <p>1. My Mothers restoration first I thank God did
for; and next, for many Mercies of mine own.
Four times before this, I have been delivered from
great danger of death.</p>
               <p>And now I desire to acknowledg his mercy in
delivering me from this death threatning disease,
and that in answer to prayers I am here now in
competent health to speak of the goodness of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>2. I desire to acknowledg it a mercy that God
afflict me; and though I cannot with the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
say, <hi>but now I keep thy statutes;</hi> I can say, <hi>before I
was afflicted I went astray.</hi> And how many great sins
God hath prevented by this affliction, I cannot
tell; but am sure that God hath dealt very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with me; and I have had many comforts
in my sufferings, which God hath not given to
many of his beloved ones.</p>
               <p>3. I desire to acknowledg Gods great mercy to me
in bringing me to this Town, under so useful
means of Grace; and that at such a time when I
was even ready to <hi>engage in a course of sin and vanity,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59245:12"/>
beyond what I had formerly lived in. This mercy
is much <hi>greatned</hi> by the time; for had the Lord
brought me hither in Infancy, and removed me at
riper years, the mercy would not have been so
great. And if I had gone longer on in a course of
hardning sins, it had been less than now it is.</p>
               <p>4. I desire to acknowledg it a great mercy that
I want no outward thing, but am enabled to be
helpful unto others, and have all the temporal
mercies that I can well desire, for my encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the ways of God.</p>
               <p>5. I desire to acknowledg it a great mercy that
God hath given me an interest in the hearts and
prayers of so many of his faithful servants in this
place.</p>
               <p>6. I desire to acknowledg it a great mercy,
that God hath made me the child of godly Parents,
and a child of many prayers.</p>
               <p>7. I desire to acknowledg it a great mercy,
which I can never be thankful enough for, that
God hath given me a heart in any measure willing
to acknowledg his mercies, and be thankful for
them; and that notwithstanding all that sin and
Satan hath done to hinder it, he hath made me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
this day to <hi>give up my self and all that
I have, to him; taking him only for my God and
chief felicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Requests that I desire you to make
to God on my behalf, are these.</p>
               <p>1. That he will give me a more thankful soul,
that I may praise him all my days.</p>
               <p>2. And an humble heart, that I may be taught
of God, who looketh on the proud afar off.</p>

3. And a tender conscience, that I may fear to
offend him, and hate all sin.</p>
               <p>4. And strength so to resist temptations, that I
be not led by Satan to dishonour God, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him.</p>
               <p>5. And a meek and quiet frame of spirit, that I
may be contented to bear the afflictions that God
shall lay me under without murmuring or repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>§. 3. This being that which she gave us in, I find
under her hand this secret renewal that same day of
her Covenant with God, which I annex.</p>
               <p>This being a day set apart for returning thanks
to God for his mercy in delivering me from the
gates of death, these people being they that have
earnestly supplicated the throne of grace on my
behalf; I here now renew my Covenant with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, and resolve by his grace to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to get and keep a fresh sense of his mercy on
my soul, and a greater sense yet of my sin: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to set my self against my sin with all my
might, and not take its part or extenuate it, or keep
the Devils counsel, as I have done, to the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, and the wounding of my own soul.
I resolve by Gods assistance to set upon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of known duty, and not to study shifts and
evasions to put off those which are either trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome,
chargeable, or likely to render me disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and vile in the eyes of the carnal persons
of the world. And this I do upon these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and for these reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59245:14"/>
1. My life hath been a life of great mercy. God
hath preserved it more than this once, and hath
done exceeding great things for me, which engageth
me more than many others, though all rational
creatures are obliged to live to God their Maker.</p>
               <p>2. God hath not only given me life, but in some
measure ability and opportunity to do him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
yea, and already some encouragement in the
hopes of the success of some of my poor endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
<hi>[I suppose on some of her servants.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. God hath more engaged me to himself, by
taking me into his Family, and planting me in his
Garden, and watering me with the dew from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
He hath set me in a fruitful soil: He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me the high priviledg of a part in the hearts
and prayers of his people; and I may say that I
live to speak it, That God is a God hearing prayers,
and hath heard and answered them. Though the
Tempter be busie to make me think diminitively
of this mercy, yet I must not, but must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the greatness of it.</p>
               <p>4. As all these and more engagements are upon
me; so I am already engaged by the Baptismal
Covenant to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
as my God and chief Good, and only happiness,
and as my Redeemer, Head and Husband; and as
my Sanctifier and Comforter; and I have renewed it
in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and how can I
go back that have thus far engaged my self, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive from God more obligations? Yea, God will
expect more from me than from many others. Let
me therefore see that I be in good earnest with
God, and think not to put him off with hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59245:15"/>
let me not deceive my self, for God will not
be mocked; what I sow, I shall reap: if I belong
to God, though I suffer whilst I am in the body,
they will be but light afflictions, and but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but the everlasting Kingdom will be mine
inheritance; and when this life is ended, I shall
reign with Christ; I shall be freed from sin and
suffering, and for ever rejoyce with Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
But should I prove an hypocrite, I lose my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
I lose my God, and damnation with Devils
and damned ones will be my reward for ever, and
rhis the greater as my mercies have been abundant
and great.</p>
               <p>Therefore I here desire this day to renew my
Covenant with God, and to beg the prayers of this
people that God will not leave me to my self, but
help me (by the sufficient Grace of Christ) to keep
the Covenant which I have made. And I intend to
keep this Paper by me, to help to remember me and
quicken me to duty, and hinder me from sin, and
encourage me to go on cheerfully against temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
looking still to Christ, who forsaketh not
those that by faith and repentance come to him.</p>
               <p>To all this let me add these Considerations of
the vanity of the creature, and of all false
hopes.</p>
               <p>It is contrary to the nature of the creature to be
our peace; they are our discomforts and troubles,
further than they help to lead us to the Creator.
Let me not forget the time when I seemed near
death: What comfort had I then in creatures?
What ease from them? Was not all my hope in
God? All creatutes shewed me that side on which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59245:15"/>
                  <hi>vanity</hi> was written, and they had nothing that
could satisfie my soul; Though I had as much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in means and friends, as I could possibly desire,
yet all this was nothing to me: the trouble of
parting with them was much more than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of enjoying them; and so it will be with me
still: which should teach me to keep my heart loose
from the Creature, and not over-love any thing on
this side Heaven: Why should my heart be fixed
where my home is not? Heaven is my home; God
in Christ is all my happiness: and where my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is, there my heart should be: Come away, Oh
my heart, from vanity; mount Heavenward, and
be not dead, or dull, if thou wouldst be free from
trouble, and tast of real joy and pleasure. Hath not
experience yet taught thee, that creature-comforts,
though they may be Roses, have their pricks? canst
not thou be content to look on them, and smell
them at a distance, and covet no other use while
thou art in the Garden where they grow, and be
content to leave them there behind thee? If thou
must needs have them in thy bosome, thou must
scratch thy fingers to get them; and when thou hast
them, though the smell a while delight thee, they
will quickly wither, and are gone. Away then, O
my carnal heart; retire to God, the only satisfying
object. There mayest thou love without all danger
of excess! Let thy love to God be fixed and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

towards God, her fears and troubles did not so pass
away; setled peace of soul doth seldom come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59245:16"/>
to young Converts, though their sincere resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

                        <p>Christ saith, <hi>In the world you shall have trouble, in
me you shall have peace.</hi> Something of both now I
find at this time: This night after returning thanks
to God for my recovery, I find my heart sad, and
trouble upon my spirits; and well it may be so: for
the sins of this day have been very great: My heart
hath not answered the expressions of thanks which
have been uttered by the mouths of those that spake
them to God. No, no, my heart hath not stirred,
and been drawn out towards my God! The thoughts
of his love have not ravished my Soul: Alas! I scarce
felt any holy spark to warm my Soul this day. This
day, which was a day of the greatest mercy of any
in all my life; the day in which I have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to give thanks for all the mercies of my
life, and thanks it self is a greater mercy than the
rest: All other mercies are to prepare for this: This
is the work of a glorified Saint, even a Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
before the blessed face of God: It's his everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
business to Sing the Songs of Thanksgiving and
Praise to the Most High: But my thoughts have not
been filled with the sweet foretasts of this blessed
work which I might have had this day! O God,! I
beseech thee forgive my sin, and lay not my dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to my charge, but overlook all my transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and look on me in Jesus Christ my Saviour. I
am thine, Lord, and not mine own: This day I have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59245:16"/>
under my Hand and Seal in the presence of Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
nay in thine own presence (who art Witness suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
were there no eye to see me or ear to hear
me) Thou Lord that knowest all things, knowest
that I have devoted my All to thee: Take it and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
my Sacrifice: Help me to pay my vows! Wilt
thou not accept me because I do it not more sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and believingly? O Lord I unfeignedly desire to
do it aright! O wilt thou strengthen my weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires!
I believe, Lord help my unbelief. Thou that
canst make me what I am not, O make me what thou
wouldst have me be! In thee there is all fulness, and
to thee I desire to come by Christ. Wilt thou now
cast me off, because I do it not <hi>unreservedly?</hi> Lord,
I confess the Devil tempteth, and the flesh saith,
<hi>Spare something: what! let all go?</hi> And I find in
me a carnal selfish principle, ready to close with
the temptation. But thou canst prevent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
all, and speak death to these corruptions, and
bid the Tempter be gone. It is thy pleasure here
to suffer thy dear children to be tempted; but
fuffer not temptations to prevail against thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Grace. If temptation be like a torrent of
water, to smother, quench, or hide the flame, yet
wilt thou never let all the sparks of thy Grace be
put out in the soul where once thou hast truly
kindled it. But Lord! suffer not such floods to
fall on my soul, where the spark is so small alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that it is even scarce discernible. O quicken it,
and blow it up to a holy flame: Most gracious God!
O do it here, who hast done it for many a soul! O
what have I said! that I have a spark of grace! why
the least spark is worth ten thousand times more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59245:17"/>
thanks than I can ever express! and I have been
dead and unthankful, as is before confessed! And is
that a sign of grace? Unthankful, dead, and dull
I have been, and still am; but yet it must needs
be from Gods gift in me, that I have any desires
after him; and that this day I have desired to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
my self to him, and that I can say I would be
more holy, and more heavenly, even as the Lord
would have me be. Nay, I do know the time when
I had none of these desires, and had no mind to
God, and the ways of godliness; and do I not
know that there be many in this condition who
have no desires after Christ and holiness? Here
then is matter of comfort given me from him that
doth accept the desires of his poor creatures, even
the Lord Christ, who will not quench the smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flax, nor break the bruised reed. I see then
that I have yet matter of rejoycing, and must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be so humbled for my remaining sins, as
may tend to my future joy in believing; but not
so as to be discouraged and frightned from God,
who is longsuffering and abundant in mercy. Rouze
up thy self then to God, my soul; humbly, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly
repent that thou hast been so unthankful
and insensible of the benefits this day received:
up, up, and lie not down so heavily; God hath
heard prayers for thee, and given thee life and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to serve him. He hath given thee all the
outward mercies thy heart can desire. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee dear, godly, able friends, such as can help
thee in the way to heaven; yea he hath set them
to beg spiritual mercies for thee, who prevailed
for temporal for thee, and oft for many others; why
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59245:17"/>
then shouldst thou not watch and pray, and wait
in hope that he hath heard their prayers this day
for thy soul, as formerly for thy body? They are
things commanded of God to be asked; and we
have his promise, that seeking we shall find. It may
be this night many of Gods dear children will yet
pray for my soul; I doubt not some will; and shall
I not be glad of such advantage? I heard this day
that <hi>I must not forbear thanks, because the mercies
are yet imperfect</hi> (else we should never give thanks
on earth). Though therefore my Grace be yet
but a spark, and weak, my body weak, my heart
sad; all these administer matter of <hi>thanks</hi> and
<hi>praise,</hi> as well as of <hi>supplication.</hi> Let me therefore
keep close to both, they being the life of my life
while I live here; and having daily need of supply
from God, let me daily be with him, and live as
in his presence: Let him be the chief in all my
thoughts, my heart and life. And let me remember
to be earnest for my poor Relations, and dear
Friends, and the Church and people of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
And let me strive to keep such a moderate
sense of sorrow on my soul, as occasion requireth.
I have now cause of sorrow for parting with my
dear friends, my Father, my Pastor. He is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
called away, and going a long journey:
what the Lord will do with him, I cannot foresee;
it may be he is preparing some great mercy for us,
and for his praise; I know not but such a day as
this may be kept here on his account. The will of
the Lord be done, for he is wise and good; we are
his own, let him do with us what he pleaseth; all
shall be for good to them that love God. I have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59245:18"/>
cause to be humbled that I have been so unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
under mercies and means; it may grieve me
now he is gone, that there is so little that came
from him left upon my soul. O let this quicken and
stir me up to be more diligent in the use of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
helps and means. And if ever I should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
this mercy again, O let me make it appear that
this night I was sensible of my neglect of it.</p>
                        <p>And now here is comfort, that I have to deal
with a God of mercy that will hear a poor repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinner; a God that will in no wise cast out
those that come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but loveth whom he loveth,
to the end. This is the God whom I have chosen and
taken for my portion; the same God is his God, his
Guide and Comforter. The whole world is but a
house where Gods children dwell a little while, till
he hath fitted them for the heavenly Mansions; and
if he send them out of one room into another to
do his work, and try their obedience; and if he
put some in the darkest corners of his house, to
keep them humble, though he separate those that
are most beloved of each other, it is but that they
may not love so much as to be loth to part and
come to him who should have all their love. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it fareth with his children in this house (or
howling wilderness) the time will come, and is at
hand, when all the children shall be separate from
the Rebels, and be called home to dwell with their
Father, their Head and Husband; and the elect shall
all be gathered into one. Then farwell sorrow, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
hard heart! farwell tears and sad repentance!
And then blessed Saints that have believed and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed!
Never so unworthy, crowned thou must
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59245:18"/>
be! This was the project of redeeming-love!
When the Lord shall take our carkasses from the
grave, and make us shine as the Sun in glory; then,
then shall friends meet and never part, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their sad and weary nights and days no more!
Then may we love freely! What now is wanting
to dispel all sorrow from my heart! Nothing but
the greater hopes that I shall be one of this number.
This, this can do it. No matter if I had no friend
near me, and none on earth; if God be not far
from me, it's well enough; and whatever here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
the Church and people of God, it's but as for
one day, and presently the storm will be all over.
Let me therefore cast all my care on God: Let me
wait on him in the way of duty, and trust him: let
me run with patience the race that is set before me,
looking to Jesus the Author and finisher of my
faith, and believingly go to him in all my troubles;
and let me so labour here, that I may find rest to my
soul in the Rest that remaineth for the people of
God.</p>

§. 5. Is not here in all these Papers (which I saw
not till she was dead) a great deal of work for one
day, besides all the publick work of a Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
day. If I should give you an account of all
her following Twenty One years, what a Volume
would it amount to? If you ask, why I recite all
this, which is but matter well known to ordinary
Christians? I answer, 1. It is not as matter of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi>
but of <hi>soul workings</hi> towards God. 2. Is not
this extraordinary in a Convert of a year, or few
months standing? 3. The love of God, and her,
makes me think it worth the publishing: They that
think otherwise may pass it by; but there are souls
to whom it will be savoury and profitable.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Yet she continued under great fears, that she
had not saving Grace, because she had not that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of holy affection which she desired: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in her sickness, her fears increased her disease
and danger. I will here, for the use of others in
the like case, recite some scraps of a Letter of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
as I find them transcribed by her self.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Advise you to set more effectually to the means
of your necessary consolation; your strange si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
keeping your case to your self (from your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and all your friends), is an exceeding injury
to your peace. Is it God, or Satan that hindereth
you from opening your sore, and make you think
that concealment is your wisdom? If it be pride
that forbids it, how dare you obey such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander?
Many of our sores are half healed when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59245:19"/>
well opened: if Prudence foresee some forbidding
inconvenience, you have prudent friends, and two
prudent persons may see more than one. But because
you will not tell us, I will disjunctively tell it
you.</p>
               <p>1. Your trouble of soul is either some <hi>affliction.</hi>
2. Or some <hi>sin.</hi> 3. Or the doubt of your <hi>sincerity</hi>
and true grace.</p>
               <p>I. If it be <hi>affliction,</hi> dare you so indulge impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
as to conclude against your future comforts,
while you have Gods love and title to salvation?
Dare you say that these are of so small weight,
that a cross like yours will weigh them down? and
that you will not rejoice in all the promises of life
eternal, till your Cross be removed?</p>
               <p>II. If it be <hi>sin,</hi> it is either past or present: if
past, why do you not repent, and thankfully accept
your pardon? If <hi>present,</hi> it is <hi>inward corruption,</hi> or
outward transgression. Which ever it be, if you
love it, why do you grieve for it, and groan under
it? If you grieve for it, why are you not willing
to leave it, and be holy? If you are willing to leave
it, and would fain have Gods grace in the use of
his means, to make you holy, this is the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Repentance: And why then are you not
thankful for grace received, for Pardon, Adoption,
and your part in Christ, more than you are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for remaining sin? Should none rejoyce that
have sin to trouble them, and keep them in a daily
watch and war? Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. &amp; 8. if you will
see the contrary: <hi>If any man sin, we have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, and
he is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> Dare you refuse
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59245:20"/>
your comforts on such reasons as would deny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to all the world? He that saith he hath no
sin, is a lyar. And will you for this deny the known
duty of thanks and praise for all that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?
You have been taught to difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
cause of Doubting, and cause of <hi>filial hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</hi>
And if it were any particular sin that
needs particular help and counsel, why do you not
open it for help (which its probably would do
more against it, than many years secret trouble and
dejection alone will do.)</p>
               <p>3. If it be <hi>doubts</hi> of <hi>your sincerity and grace,</hi> why
do you refuse to reason the case, and say what it
is that persuadeth you that you are graceless, that
we may try it by the word of God? What evidence
is it that you want? You have confest that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
you are convinced of sincerity; and can you
so easily deny what you have found, as to conclude
your self so miserable as you do? Should all do
thus that have not constant apprehensions of their
evidence, and whose assurance is hindred by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious?
You have heard the contrary.</p>
               <p>But suppose that you have yet no saving-grace or
part in Christ, why stand you complaining, while
Christ stands intreating you to accept his mercy?
Ishe not in good earnest? The offer is free; it is
not your purchase and merit, but <hi>consent,</hi> that will
prove your title: Why do you <hi>complain,</hi> and not
<hi>consent</hi> even to the Baptismal Covenant? Or if you
<hi>consent,</hi> why do you complain as if Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
were not true, or as if consent were not a
a proof of saving-faith? If you confess that you
should not doubt and be dejected on such terms;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59245:20"/>
methinks the Cure should be half wrought. Dare
you indulge it while you know it to be your sin?
Have you not sin enough already? And is it not
unkindness to deny so great a mercy as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting-grace
which you so lately felt, and to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
his love who is love it self, and hath so largely
exprest his love to you? Would you easily believe
that your Mother would kill you for such defects
as you fear that God will damn you for? Yea, tho'
she were perfectly just and holy? Is it congruous
to hear Ministers tell men from Christ, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth
them to be reconciled to God, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
none that are willing of his grace and cure;
and at the same time to hear such as you almost
ready to despair, as if God would not be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
nor give grace to them that fain would have it,
but will be inclined to reject humbled souls?</p>
               <p>Reason not for your distrustful fears and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
but still disowne them and accuse them, and
then they will vanish by degrees and dye: yea then
you will sure oppose them your self, and God will
help you: Can you look that God should
help you against the sin which you plead for, and
defend? If faith and love be the vital graces, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
of God, and denying his love, must not be
defended as no sin. As the ungodly cannot expect
the grace which they refuse; so how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the peace which you oppose, and say as <hi>Psal.
77. My soul refuseth to be comforted;</hi> and say of
your passionate fear and grief, as <hi>Ionas</hi> of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>I do well to be angry, even unto death.</hi> Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that Christ is yours, if you accept him, and
consent; and then that comfort is your interest,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59245:21"/>
right and duty; and then you will do more to comfort
fort your self, than I am endeavouring when I
chide you for your fears. Sure sinful sorrow is
no desirable thing, nor to be pleaded for; you
durst do nothing to the murder of a friend, no nor
to his grief; and you are bid to love your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as your self. Away then with your weakning
griefs and troubles, <hi>lest they prove a degree of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder.</hi>
If you care for your self, the comfort of
your Mother and Friends, and the honour of the
unspeakable riches of Gods grace, at least own it
to be your duty to oppose sinful fear, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in God, and serve him with delight and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
praises, and do your best against all that is against
this duty. And suffer not your sore to fester by
your silence; but open your case to some one that
is able to help you impartially to try it by the
word of God, and to pray with you that God
will mercifully discover your infirmities, and the
remedy. It were but wisdom to conceal your case
from others, if you can well be cured without their
help.</p>

               <p>The sadder my present condition is, the greater is
the mercy that I am yet alive: why then should I not
give God thanks for that, and beg the rest which
yet I want? And though my life seem but a burden
to me sometimes, it is my great mistake: for the
greatest afflictions are nothing to hell-torments:
Were they as great as ever any had, while I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59245:21"/>
live on this side Eternity, there is hope. The time
of grace is yet continued; if I be found in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
way, I know not but God may yet be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and give in my soul as he hath done my life
at his peoples prayers. For I cannot but look on
my life as an answer of their prayers. And sure
they desired my life only that I might live to God.
I desired it my self on no other terms. It was my
earnest request that I might not live, if not to him.
Why then should I be persuaded by Satan to think
that God will not give me grace as well as life?
May I not rather be encouraged with patience to
wait for further mercy? It is a mercy that I am in
any measure sensible of my danger, and have any
desire to be holy. I will therefore stir up my soul
to thankfulness, and be humbled that I can be no
more thankful. I will acknowledg the mercy I
have received, and the probability of future mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
and this by Gods assistance the Devil shall not
hinder me from doing.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 8. I will add one of her Papers, containing her
resolutions after her recovery, in some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 30. was my worst day: I did not then
think to be alive this day; I ought not to forget
it. On <hi>Ian. 1. New-years-day,</hi> I first bled at the nose
largely, and after mended. The fourth day was
kept in humiliation for me. <hi>April</hi> 10. was a day of
Thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>When I thought I should dye, I was more than
ordinarily sensible of my unprofitable life; and had
such convictions as usually people in my condition
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59245:22"/>
have; and I then made many resolutions as in such
cases others do. I remembred that I had heard much
of the promises that many made in sickness, which
they never performed; and I thought it was gross
hypocrisie to speak now of that which I was past
performing (as I thought); but that I were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
write down my purposes, and discover them if
God recovered me, that they might be as strong an
engagement on me, as if I had spoken them to
men.</p>
               <p>I. I resolved that I would endeavour to get and
keep a sense of that great mercy of Gods restoring
me from the peril of threatned death, in answer of
prayers; which was the greater, in that God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take me hence when I was but in the birth,
and had scarce well begun to live. This mercy I
promised to be thankful for, and to acknowledg o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mercies as God should make me able.</p>
               <p>II. I resolved that I would endeavour to be in a
fixed state and way of duty; and in order to this,
I would take advice of one who is (I conceive)
most fit to advise me. And I resolve by Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
that I will not consult with flesh and blood,
nor study my carnal interest, but resolvedly set on
the way of my duty, and freely discourse my
thoughts, so far as is requisite to my just advice.
And that I will speak my reasons and heart-risings
against any thing that is propounded to me, which
I judg unmeet. And I resolved when I saw my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
cheerfully to do it, and keep a sense of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and obligations of Gods love and mercy.</p>
               <p>III. I resolved to pray and labour for a true sense
of the sins of this Nation in general; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59245:22"/>
of the sins of my Relations, and of my
own. And that till it please God to give me cause
of rejoycing on the behalf of my Relations, and
of my own souls recovery and spiritual welfare, I
will continue with humiliation to supplicate the
Lord. And though I would not shut out a greater
duty by a lesser, yet I will avoid all manner of
Feastings as much as I well can, and all noxious sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
delights; and when I must be present, I will
use some mortifying restraint. And this I would do
in my habit, and all other things, but that I would
lay no snare on my self, by renouncing what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
may oblige me to; but by all means I would
strive to keep upon my heart a sense of my friends
danger and my own.</p>
               <p>IV. I resolve, if Providence concur, to go to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
as soon as I can after the day of Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the reasons mentioned in another place.</p>
               <p>§. 9. What these reasons were, I find not. This
following fragment of hers, hints something of it.</p>
               <p>I begin already to be sensible of my misusing the
helps which God had given me; I know now how
I should love Ordinances and means of grace, and to
what end; not to break my heart when Providence
removeth them from me, or me from them; but I
should love them for God, and use them for him,
and expect my greatest comfort from him, and not
from men and means themselves: This is no more
than what I thought I had known long ago, but I
never knew it indeed till now. And now I do but
begin to know it. When I felt my heart ready to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59245:23"/>
sink under a burden of sorrow, God was pleased
to ask me <hi>what I ailed?</hi> Was my condition worse
than ever? Had I less hopes of his love than here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore?
if not, why do I mourn more than when
I lay under that curse? What is it that I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for my hope and happiness? is that lost and
gone? Am I left in such a place or case as God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found in if I truly seek him? or that God
cannot sweeten with his presence? if not, why do
I not contentedly thank God for what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
had? I cannot say it's better that I had never
had it, than now to leave it: no, I must be willing
to submit to God, and be humbled in the sense of
my abuse of mercy, so far as it may quicken me to
diligence for the time to come. And if ever God
more trust me with such treasure as once I had, I
will strive to shew that I better know the worth
of it than I did before. My thoughts often tell me,
that if I were but in a condition in which I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to serve God with more cost to the flesh
than I here do, it would either shew my hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
or give me more assuring evidence that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sincere.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 10. And it is a useful note that I find added to
this by her.</p>
            <q>
               <p>If my trouble be for my sin, 1. My care will be
more for the removing of my sin, than of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>2. And if God should take away the affliction, it
would not content me, unless sin be taken away,
and my heart amended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59245:23"/>
3. If it be sin that I am troubled for, it will be my
great care not to sin in my trouble.</p>
               <p>4. And if it be my sin that troubleth me, I have
the more cause to submit to Gods hand, and silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bear the punishment of my iniquity; it shameth
murmuring, when we truly look on sin the cause,
though it bring the wholsome sorrow of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>5. And if I mourn for fear lest God be depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I should seek him, and cleave the closer to
him, and not depart from God, and then he will
not depart from me.</p>
            </q>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Some parcels of Counsel for her deliverance from this
distressed Case, which I find reserved by her for her
use.</head>
            <p>§. 1. WHILE in her languishing, and after
it, she was still cast down, condemned
her self as a graceless wretch, and her good Mother
and Friends afraid that her grief would encrease her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59245:25"/>
sickness, as it did their sadness; and yet she obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
concealed it from all, save a few sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to one person, who wrote thereof some frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which she extracted for her use; I shall here
recite them for others that have the same fears.</p>
            <p>§. 2. The miscarriage of a Relation troubling
her, this was set down.</p>
            <q>
               <p>When God hath done so much for you, will
you leave it in the power of an unconstant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to trouble you, and rob you of your peace?
Is the joy in the Holy Ghost so subject to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of your enemies, <hi>or the weakness of your friends?</hi>
Delight your self in an Allsufficient constanr God,
and he will be to you a sufficient constant delight,
and will give you the desires of your heart. I see
you are yet imperfect in self-denial, while you are
too sensible of unkindnesses and crosses from your
friends, and bear them with too much passion and
weakness: know you not yet what the creature is,
and how little to be expected from it? Do you not
still reckon to meet with such infirmities in the
best, as will be injarious to others, as they are
troublesome to themselves? It's God that we most
wrong, and yet he beareth with us; and so must
we with one another. Had you expected that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
should deal as creatures, and sinners as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
how little of this kind of trouble had you
felt? Especially take heed of too much regard to
matters of meer reputation, and the thoughts of
men; else you are like a leaf in the wind that will
have no rest. Look on man as nothing, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59245:25"/>
to approve your self to God; and then so
much honour as is good for you, will follow as the
shadow. If every frailty and unkindness of the
best friends must be your trouble, it is to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
with the unavoidable pravity of mankind;
and you may as well grieve that they were born in
sin, and made your acquaintance. And it should be
used as a mercy to keep you from inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to friends. It's a mercy to be driven from
creature-rest, though it be by enemies. Keep a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
apprehension of the inconsiderableness of all
these little things that cross you, and turn your eye
to God, to Christ, to Heaven, the things of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
weight, and you will have no room for
these childish troubles.</p>
               <p>Yet turn not the discovery of this your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
into dejection, but amendment. I perceive
you are apter to hold to the sense of your own
distempers, than to think what counsel is given
you against them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 3. On another occasion she recorded these
words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>How hard is it to keep our hearts in going too
far even in honest affections toward the creature,
while we are so backward to love God, who should
have all the heart, and soul, and might? Too strong
love to any, though it be good in the kind, may be
sinful and hurtful in the degree. 1. It will turn too
many of your thoughts from God, and they will
be too oft running after the beloved creature.
2. And by this exercise of thoughts and affections
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59245:26"/>
on the creature, it may divert and cool your love
to God, which will not be kept up, unless our
thoughts be kept more to him; yea, though it be
for his sake that you love them. 3. It will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
your sufferings, by interessing you in all the
dangers and troubles of those whom you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 4. When she seemed to her self near death.</p>
            <q>
               <p>You now see what the world and all its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are, and how it would have used you, if you
had had no better a portion, and God had not
taught you a happier choice. Providence now tells
you that they are vanity, and if over-valued,
worse; but if you learn to see their nothingness,
you will be above the trouble of losing them, as
well as the snares of too delightful enjoying them.
Pardon all injuries to men, and turn your thoughts
from them, and keep your heart as near as possible
to the heart of Christ, and live as in his arms, who
is usually sweetest when the creature most faileth
us, if we do but turn our hearts from it to him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 5. Another time.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Can you find that you are resolvedly devoted
to Christ, and yet doubt whether Christ be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
and surely yours? Are you willinger or
faithfuller than he?</p>
            </q>
            <p>Hence she gathered her self as followeth.</p>
            <q>
               <p>When I read the evidence of my self-resignation
to Christ, I should as it were see Christ standing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59245:26"/>
over me with the tenderest care, and hear him say,
<hi>I accept thee as my own.</hi> For I must believe his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as I perform my resignation. O what is he
providing for me? What entertainment with him
shall I shortly find? Not such as he found with
man, when he came to seek us; it is not a Manger,
a Crown of thorns, a Cross, that he is preparing for
me: when I have had my part of these in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, I shall have my place in the glorious <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 6. This fragment she wrote next.</p>
            <q>
               <p>For the sake of your own soul, and life, and
friends, and for the honour of that tender mercy
and free grace which you are bound to magnifie,
Let not Satan get advantage against your peace and
thankfulness to God, and the acknowledgment of
his obliging love. Let him not on pretence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
turn your eyes on a weak distempered
heart, from the unspeakable mercy which should
sill yonr heart with love and joy, notwithstanding
all your lamented infirmities. You perceive not
that it is Satan that would keep you still under
mournful sadness, under the pretence of repentance
and godly sorrow. You are not acquainted with
his wiles. You have cause of sorrow, but much
more of joy. And your rejoycing in Gods love
would please him better than all your sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and troubles, though he despise not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
spirit. <hi>I charge it on your conscience,</hi> that when
you are in prayer, you confess and lament your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfnl,
suspicious, unthankful, uncomfortable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59245:27"/>
thoughts of God and Jesus Christ, more than all
your want of sorrow for him. And you trouble
your self for such kind of sins, <hi>the honesty of whose
occasion may give you more comfort than the fault doth
sorrow.</hi> I know we have not our comfort at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
But see that your endeavour and striving
be more for a comfortable than for a sorrowful
frame of spirit.</p>
               <p>Two things I must blame you for, 1. That you
take the imperfections of your duties and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to be greater reasons for discomfort, than the
performance and sincerity are reasons for comfort:
as if you thought any thing were perfect here, or
that it were better do nothing than do it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly:
or as if you would have no comfort till
you can perform such duty and obedience as hath
no need of pardon and a Saviour; and so no man
living might have any comfort in any thing that he
doth.</p>
               <p>2. That when unreasonable fears and troubles
are upon you, and troubling thoughts are still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your mind, you say that <hi>you cannot help it, nor
turn your thoughts away to any thing else.</hi> I know
you have not an absolute power over your
thoughts, but some you have: why else hath God
made a Law for our thoughts, and laid so much
duty on them, and forbidden their sin so much?
Much may be done, if you will be resolute.</p>
               <p>Think whether Christ came from the Father to
bring tidings of sadness and despair, or of great
joy: and whether Angels preached not <hi>Glory to
God in the highest; on earth peace, and to men good
will?</hi> And whether <hi>Fatih, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59245:27"/>
are the things which Christ will work on souls, be
not more powerful to destroy your sins, than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
or discouragement of mind?</p>
               <p>And because you complain so much of sin, I ask
you, why doth not your conscience more accuse
you of the sin of unthankful denying or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
the mercies of God, and no more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
them. And for overlooking so much the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
righteousness of Christ, while you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
for want of more of your own. I would not
deceive you, by telling you that you need none in
your self; and that all your righteousness is out
of you in Christ: I know that your righteousness
must exceed that of the Pharisees, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, and
that he that doth righteousness is righteous: But
at what Bar or Tribunal? Only at that of Grace,
which <hi>supposeth the Reconciling Pardoning Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ:</hi> it is not at the bar of <hi>Rigorous
Iustice,</hi> according to the Law, which requireth <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi>
to Justification; there <hi>Christ only</hi> is your
<hi>Righteousness;</hi> and you have none, and must dream
of none but that which floweth from his, and stands
in subordination to it, and is your title to it, and
improvement of it, <hi>even your thankful accepting a
free-given Saviour, Head and Lord, and Pardon and
the Spirit to sanctifie you more, and fit you for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God and for glory; esteem most, chuse
first, and seek most the love of God the Father, the
Grace of Christ, and the Communion of the H. Ghost,</hi>
and this subordinate righteousness will certainly
prove the meritorious perfect righteousness of
Christ to be for you, instead of a perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59245:28"/>
of your own. There is no defect in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisice
or Merits; if you wanted a title to Christ,
you were unjustified; but none wants that, who
consenteth to his Covenant, as before: and that
consent you cannot deny. Will you live like a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
Orphan exposed in a Wilderness, while Gods
tender love is saving you, and Christ is glory<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
in you as the fruit of his blood, and the Angels
of God are serving you, and rejoycing at your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version?
I entreat you think whether it be not the
great work that God hath called you to, to honour
his grace, and propagate to all about you, as you
are able, a joyful, thankful, hoping and praising
frame of soul; and to stir up all to the delightful
praise of God? As Ministers must do it by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all must do it by conference and example. And
is your dejected sadness the performance of this?</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 6. When she desired to be prayed for, she
wrote down this Answer which I find now in her
Papers.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It's well if you know what prayer to put up, or
what to desire; I'le pray for you according to the
best of my judgment; and I'le tell you for what, that
you may know what to pray for for your self:
First, I'le pray that your thoughts may be turned
to the magnifying of Gods love; and you may
remember that he is as <hi>good</hi> as he is <hi>great;</hi> and that
you may be more sensible of his mercy, than of
your own unworthiness. 2. I'le pray that you may
have so lively an apprehension of your everlasting
felicity, as may make you long to be with Christ.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59245:28"/>
3. That you may have more self-denial, and that
humility which makes you little in your own eyes.
4. That you may be much less tender, and liable
to commotion, and disquiet of mind, and less sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of unkindnesses, and of bodily dangers, yea,
and of sin it self, while the sense of it hinders the
sense of mercy. A meek, and a quiet, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
spirit is of great price in the sight of God. I
will pray that you may be delivered from too
much inward passion, of fear, grief, or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
5. I will pray, that no creature may seem grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
better, or more regardable, or necessary to
you than it is; and that you would look on all as
walking shadows, vanity and liars (that is, <hi>untru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty),</hi>
further than you can see God in them, or
they lead you up to him; that they may never be
over-loved, over-feared, over-trusted, or their
thoughts too much regarded. 6. Above all, I'le
pray that you may be less <hi>self-willed,</hi> and not to
be too passionately or unmovably set upon the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of all your will; but may have a will that
is compliant with the Will of God, and can change
as he would have it; and will follow him, and not
run before him; and can endure to be crost, and
denyed by God and man, without discomposed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and impatient trouble of mind. 7. I shall
pray, that seeming wisdom may not entangle you,
either in the concealment of any thing which
greatly needeth your friends advice, or in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of your talents by unprofitale silence, as to all
good discourse, upon the emnity which you have
to hypocrisie; and that you will not live in sins
of omission, for sear of seeming better than you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59245:29"/>
are. By this you may know wherein I think you
faulty.</p>
            </q>
            <p>§. 7. The next I find, is this advice against her
resolution to go to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>It's not lawful to speak an idle word, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
deliberately; much less to go an idle jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
What if you fall sick by the way, or some
weakness take you there, will not conscience ask
you, who called you hither? Your weakness of
spirit, that cannot endure this or that, at home,
with your dearest friends, is so far below the quiet
composed fortitude which you should have, that
you ought not to give way to it. If you are at
the command of your impatience, how are you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to the command of God? It's a greater
work to bring your mind and will to the will of
God, than to change place, or apparel, or run away
as <hi>Ionah</hi> in discontent. O for a mind and will that
needed no more to quiet it, than to know what is
the will of God, and our duty; and in every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
therewith to be content. When you know
your duty, do it resolutely and cheerfully, and
scorn to run away, and turn your back, that you
may do it without censure where you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
Use well the means God here vouchsafes
you, and do your duty with a quiet mind, and <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
God</hi> in your removes.</p>

The best creature-affections have a mixture of
creature-imperfections, and therefore need some
gall to wean us from the faulty part: God must

world! (how long must I continue in it?
And why is this wretched heart so loth to leave
it), where we can have no fire without smoak, and
our dearest friends must be our greatest grief; and
when we begin in hope, and love, and joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are aware, we fall into an answerable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

            <head>CHAP. V. Her temper, occasioning these troubles of mind.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THE soul while in the body, works much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the bodies disposition. 1. She
was of an extraordinary sharp and piercing Wit.
2. She had a natural reservedness, and secrecy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by thinking it necessary prudence not to be
open; by which means she was oft mis-understood
by her nearest friends, and consequently often crost
and disappointed by those that would have pleased
her. And as she could understand men much by
their looks and hints, so she expected all should
know her mind without her expressing it, which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59245:30"/>
bred her frustrations and discontents. 3. And she
had a natural tenderness, and troubledness of mind,
upon the crossing of her just desires: too quick, and
ungovernable a sense of displeasing words or deeds.
4. She had a diseased unresistible fearfulness; her
quick, and too sensible nature was over-timerous:
and to increase it, she said she was four times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I knew her, in danger of death (of which,
one was by the Small-Pox): And more to increase
it, her Mothers house <hi>(Apply-Castle,</hi> near <hi>Welling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton),</hi>
being a Garison, it was stormed while she was
in it, and part of the housing about it burnt, and
men lay killed before her face, and all of them
threatened, and stript of their cloathing, so that
they were fain to borrow cloaths. 5. And the great
work upon her soul, in her coversion, moved all her
passions. 6. And then her dangerous sickness, and
the sentence of death to so young a Convert, must
needs be a very awaking thing; and coming on her
before she had any assurance of her justification, did
increase her fear. 7. And in this case she lived in
the Church-Yard side, where she saw all the Burials
of the dead, and kept a deaths head (a skull) in
her Closet still before her. And other such mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spectacles increased her sad disposition.</p>
            <p>§. 2. And the excessive love which she had to her
Mother, did much increase her grief when she expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
death.</p>
            <p>§. 3. Though she called it melancholly, that by
all this she was cast into, yet it rather seemed a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural, and partly an adventitious diseased fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59245:30"/>
in a tender over-passionate nature, that had
no power to quiet her own fears, without any other
cloud on her understanding.</p>
            <p>§. 4. And all was much encreased by her wisdom,
so stifling all the appearances of it, that it all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
wrought, and had no ease by vent.</p>
            <p>§. 5. And having keen spirits, and thin sharp
blood, she had a strong <hi>Hemicrania</hi> or Head-ake once
a month, and oft once a fortnight, or more, from the
age of fifteen or sixteen years. All these together
much tended to hinder her from a quiet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
temper.</p>
            <p>§. 6. And in a word, all the operations of her
soul were very intense and strong; strong wit, and
strong love, and strong displeasure. And when God
shewed her what <hi>Holiness</hi> was, she thought she must
presently have it in so great a degree as the ripest
Saints do here attain; and that because she had not
as much heavenly life, and sense, and delight in God
as she knew she should have and desired, she conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of it that she had none that was sincere.</p>
            <p>§. 7. One of the first things by which her change
was discovered to her Mother and Friends, was her
fervent secret prayers: for living in a great house, of
which the middle part was ruined in the Wars, she
chose a Closet in the further end, where she thought
none heard her: But some that over-heard her, said,
they never heard so fervent prayers from any person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59245:31"/>
§. 8. Yet she desired me to draw up a form suited
to her own condition; which I did, and find it now
reserved among her Papers; but I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she ever used it, having affections and freedom
of expression without it. I had thought to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
it for the use of afflicted Penitents: But it
will be but a digression in this Narrative.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of our Marriage, and our Habitations.</head>
            <p>§. 1. THE unsuitableness of our age, and my
former known purposes against Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and against the conveniency of Ministers Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
who have not sort of necessity, made our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
the matter of much publick talk and wonder:
And the true opening of her case and mine, and the
many strange occurrences which brought it to pass,
would take away the wonder of her friends and
mine that knew us; and the notice of it would
much conduce to the understanding of some other
passages of our lives: Yet wise Friends, by whom
I am advised, think it better to omit such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
particularities, at least at this time. Both
in her case and mine, there was much extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which it doth not much concern the world to
be acquainted with. From the first thoughts of it,
many changes and stoppages intervened, and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
till I was silenced and ejected with many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59245:31"/>
more; and so being separated from my old
Pastoral Charge, which was enough to take up all
my time and labour, some of my disswading Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were then over. And at last, on <hi>Septemb. 10.
1662.</hi> we were married in <hi>Bennet-Fink</hi> Church by
Mr. <hi>Samuel Clerk</hi> (yet living), having been before
Contracted by Mr. <hi>Simeon Ash,</hi> both in the presence
of Mr. <hi>Henry Ashurst</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Ash.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 2. She consented to these Conditions of our
Marriage: 1. That I would have nothing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Marriage was hers; that I (who wanted no
outward supplies) might not seem to marry her for
covetousness. 2. That she would so alter her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
that I might be intangled in no Law-suits.
3. That she would expect none of my time which
my Ministerial work should require.</p>
            <p>§. 3. When we were married, her sadness and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
vanished; counsel did something to it, and
contentment something; and being taken up with
our houshold affairs, did somewhat. And we lived
in inviolated love, and mutual complacency, sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the benefit of mutual help. These near nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years I know not that ever we had any breach
in point of love, or point of interest, save only
that she somewhat grudged that I had persuaded
her for my quietness to surrender so much of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
to a disabling her from helping others so much
as she earnestly desired.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But that even this was not from a covetous
mind, is evident by these instances. 1. Though her
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59245:32"/>
Portion (which was 2000 l. besides that given up
aforesaid) was (by ill debtors) 200 l. lost in her
Mothers time, and 200 l. after, before her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and all she had reduced to almost 1650 l. yet
she never grudged at any thing that the poverty of
Debtors deprived her of.</p>
            <p>2. She had before been acquainted with the Lord
Chancellor's offering me a Bishoprick; and though
it might have taken off the censure of those Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that thought she debased her self in marrying
me, and also might have seemed desirable to her for
the Wealth as well as the Honour; she was so far
from desiring my accepting it, that I am persuaded
had I done it, it would have alienated her much
from me in point of esteem and love. Not that she
had any opinion against Episcopacy then (that ever
I could perceive) but that she abhorred a worldly
mercenary mind in a Minister of Christ, and was a
sharp Censurer of all that for gain, or honour, or
worldly ends, would stretch their consciences to any
thing that they thought God forbad. And I am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
(though towards her end she wisht she had
been abler to relieve the needy, and do more good;
yet) she lived a far more contented life in our mean
condition, even when she stoopt to receive from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that had been strangers to her, than she would
have done had I been a Bishop, and she had had many
thousand pounds more at her dispose; yea I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
the would not easily have endured it.</p>
            <p>3. Another tryal of her as to Wealth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
was when I, and all such others, were cast out
of all possession, and hope of all Ecclesiastical main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
she was not ignorant of the scorn and the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59245:32"/>
jealousies, and wrath and prosecutions that I was
like to be exposed to; yea, she had heard and seen it
already begun by Bishop <hi>Morley</hi>'s forbidding me to
preach before, and preaching himself, and his Dean,
and many others, fiercely against me in <hi>Kederminster</hi>
Pulpit; she had quickly heard them that were cast
out and silenced, deeply accused as if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
it. To chuse a participation of such a life
that had no encouragement from any worldly
Wealth or Honour, yea, that was exposed to such
certain suffering which had no end in prospect on
this side death, did shew that she was far from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.
Much more evidence of this I shall shew you
as it falls in its place.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Among other troubles that her Marriage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
her to, one was our oft necessitated removals;
which to those that must take Houses, and bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Landlords, and fit and furnish them, is more
than for single persons that have no such clogs or
cares. First, We took a House in <hi>Moorefields,</hi> after
at <hi>Acton;</hi> next that, another at <hi>Acton;</hi> and after
that, another there; and after that, we were put to
remove to one of the former again; and after that,
to divers others in another place and County, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth;
and the women have most of that sort of
trouble. But she easily bare it all.</p>
            <p>And I know not that ever she came to any place
where she did not extraordinarily win the love of
the inhabitants (unless in any street where she staid
so short a time, as not to be known to them): Had
she had but the riches of the world to have done
the good that she had a heart to do, how much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59245:33"/>
would she have been loved, who in her mean and
low condition won so much?</p>
            <p>And her carriage won more love than her libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
she could not endure to hear one give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any sowr, rough, or hasty word; her speech
and countenance was always kind and civil, whether
she had any thing to give or not.</p>
            <p>And all her kindness tended to some better end,
than barely to relieve peoples bodily wants; even
to oblige them to some duty that tended to the good
of their souls, or to deliver them from some straits
which fill'd them with hurtful care, and became a
matter of great temptation to them. If she could
hire the poor to hear Gods word, from Conformist
or Nonconformist, or to read good serious practical
Books, whether written by Conformists or Noncon
formists, it answered her end and desire: and many
an hundred books hath she given to those ends. But
of these things more hereafter. This is here but to
answer the foresaid objection, and to lead on to the
following particular passages of her life.</p>
            <p>§. 6. While I was at <hi>Acton,</hi> her carriage and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
so won the people there, that all that I ever
heard of, greatly esteemed and loved her. And she
being earnestly desirous of doing good, prepared
her house for the reception of those that would
come in, to be instructed by me, between the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and evening publick Assemblies, and after: And
the people that had never been used to such things,
accounted worldly ignorant persons, gave us great
hopes of their edification, and reformation, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Room, and went with me also into the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59245:33"/>
Church (which was at my door): And when I was
after removed, the people hearing that I again
wanted a house (being ten miles off), they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
subscribed a request to me, to return to my
old house with them, and offered to pay my house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
which I took kindly: and it was much her
winning conversation which thus won their love.</p>
            <p>§. 7. When I was carried thence to the common
Goal, for teaching them, as aforesaid, I never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her troubled at it: she cheerfully went
with me into Prison; <hi>she brought her best bed thither,</hi>
and did much to remove the removable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of the Prison. I think she had scarce ever a
pleasanter time in her life than while she was with
me there. And whereas people upon such occasions
were not unapt to be liberal, it was against her mind
to receive more than necessity required. Only three
persons gave me just as much as paid Lawyers and
prison-charges, and when one offered me more, she
would not receive it: But all was far short of the
great charges of our removal to another habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>§. 8. The Parliament making a new sharper Law
against us, I was forced to remove into another
County; thither she went with me, and removed
her Goods that were movable, from <hi>Acton</hi> to <hi>Totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge,</hi>
being engaged for the Rent of the house we
left: At <hi>Totteridge,</hi> the first year, few poor people
are put to the hardness that she was put to; we
could have no house but part of a poor Farmers,
where the Chimneys so extreamly smoak't, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59245:34"/>

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59245:35"/>
annoyed her health; for it was a very hard Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Coal-smoak so filled the Room that we
all day sate in, that it was as a cloud, and we were
even suffocated with the stink. And she had ever a
great straitness of the Lungs, that could not bear
smoak or closeness. This was the greatest bodily
suffering that her outward condition put her to;
which was increased by my continual pain there. But
her charity to her poor Landlady, set her Son Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice,
who now liveth well.</p>
            <p>§. 9. Thence we removed to a house; which we
took to our selves, which required so great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and amendment, as took her up much time and
labour: and, to her great comfort, she got Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi>
and his Wife to dwell with us. And in all these
changes and troubles she lived in great peace.</p>
            <p>§. 10. When the Kings Declarations and Licenses
gave Nonconformists leave to build Meeting places,
and Preach, she was against my going to <hi>London,</hi> till
others were there setled, lest I should anticipate
them, and gather any Auditors, who would else go
to others, especially their old ejected Pastors; but
when others were setled, she was earnest with me to
go, for the exercise of my Ministry.</p>
            <p>§. 11. Upon our remove to <hi>London,</hi> out of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
regard to my health, which she thought the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
might contribute much unto, she chose, and
took for us this most pleasant and convenient house
in <hi>Southampton-Square,</hi> where she died. These
were our removes.</p>

            <p>§. 1. AS at her conversion, and in her sickness,
she absolutely devoted her self, and all
that she had to God; so she earnestly set her self to
perform it to the last. At first she gave but the tenth
of her incomes to the poor; but I quickly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
her, that God must not be stinted, but as all
was his, so all must be used for him by his stewards,
and of all we must give account; only in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
order we must use it, which is, 1. For our
own natural necessities. 2. For publick necessary
good. 3. For the necessities of our children, and
such Relations as are part of our charge. 4. And
then for the godly poor. 5. And then for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
poors necessities. 6. And lastly, For conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies;
but nothing for unuseful things.</p>
            <p>§. 2. To name the particular great instances of her
private charity, is neither suitable to my ends, nor
her desires. I will instance but some of her more
publick cares.</p>
            <p>§. 3. She was earnestly desirous of the winning
of souls, and of the utmost improvement of mine
and other mens labours to that end. At <hi>Acton,</hi> I told
you how she promoted it; and at <hi>Totteridge, out of
Church-time,</hi> she gladly opened her doors to her
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59245:36"/>
Neighours, that would come in for instruction.</p>
            <p>§. 4. At <hi>London,</hi> when she saw me too dull and
backward to seek any Employment till I was called,
and that most places in the City had some Supplies;
she first fisht out of me in what place I most desired
more Preaching. I told her in St. <hi>Martins</hi> Parish,
where are said to be forty thousand more than can
come into the Church, especially among all the new
Buildings at St. <hi>Iameses,</hi> where Neighbours many live
like <hi>Americans,</hi> and have heard no Sermon of many
years.</p>
            <p>When she had once heard this, without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
she sets one to seek after some capacious Room
there; and none was found, but divers Rooms over
the Market-house laid together. She gets one to take
them. And they two agreed to importune me to
preach each morning, and in the afternoon to get
by turns the ablest Ministers they could procure in
<hi>London.</hi> And to that end she got a Minister an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles off to come up to help me, promising him
4cl. a year to go from day to day to supply the places
of such eminent Ministers as should be got. All this
charge, besides paying a Clerk, and a woman to look
to the Seats, rose high. Part of it the people paid,
and the rest she paid her self.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Hence God was pleased to remove us, but
by the interposition of a marvellous deliverance.
The Roof of that Market-house is a vast weight,
and was ill contrived to lye much on one Beam in
the middle of the Floor: the place being greatly
crowded, the Beam gave so great a crack as put all
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59245:36"/>
the people in a fear. But a second crack set them all
on running, and crying out at the windows for Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
I having seen the like before at <hi>Dunstans
Fleetstreet</hi> while I was preaching (which occasioned
the pulling down and new building of the Church)
reproved them sharply for their fears, and would
have gone on to preach; but see the strange hand
of God on her that set all the work on foot! After
the first crack she got down the stairs through the
crowd, where others could not get that were stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
The first man she met, she askt him what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
he was of? He said a Carpenter. Saith she,
Can you suddenly put a prop under the middle of
this Beam? The man dwelt close by, had a meet
prop ready, suddenly put it under, while all we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
knew nothing of it; but the mans knocking
encreased the peoples fears and cry. We were glad
all to be gone; and the next morning took a skilful
Workman to take up the boards, and search the
Beam; which we all saw had two such rents, so
long and so wide, and the sound part left was so
slender, that we took it for a wonder that the house
fell not suddenly.</p>
            <p>§. 6. But this fright encreased my Wives diseased
frightfulness; so that she never got off all the effects
of it while she lived. The fear, and the marvellous
deliverance, made her promise to God two things:
1. To keep the Anniversary memorial of it in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Thanksgiving (which she did.) And 2. to build
a safer place, where they might meet with less fear.
And it too deeply toucht her mind to think that it
was she that took the place, and brought them all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59245:37"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59245:38"/>
thither. And if 800. persons had been there buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ruins, as the <hi>Papists</hi> were at <hi>Blackfryers,</hi>
O what a dreadful thing it would have been in the
heavy loss, the many dolorous Families, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
scandal! These were too great thoughts to fall
on a weak and too passionate nature.</p>
            <p>§. 7. According to her promise she paid for that
place, and presently set to seek and build another.
And there was there no fit grounds near it to be
had, but two; of which one was in <hi>Oxenden</hi>-street,
which she could not have without giving 30. l. a
year ground-rent, and to be at all the charge of
building on it, and this but for a Lease not very
long. But she <hi>must do it</hi> by promise and desire. She
gets a Friend to make the bargain, takes the ground,
and begs money to build on it a Chappel (which
tempted us by the ill advice of Friend, to take also
the front-ground to the street, and build two little
houses on it, to our great loss, all her own money,
and manytimes more, being laid out upon them,
much against her inclination).</p>
            <p>§. 8. When that Chappel was finished, I began
and preacht there but one day, being to go on the
morrow into the Countrey. It unhappily fell out,
that Secretary <hi>Henry Coventry</hi>'s house was on the
back-side of it, who resolved that it should not be
used by us. The next Lords day, when I was far
off, and left my Wife at home, she got one Mr. <hi>Sed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
a <hi>Derbyshire</hi>-stranger then come to Town, to
preach there (an humble pious man, that had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
imprisonment formerly by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Party
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59245:38"/>
for being for the King's Restoration at the rising of
Sir <hi>George Booth):</hi> Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> thinking I
would be there, had got three Justices with a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as for me, to have apprehended me, and sent me
to Goal. But it fell on Mr. <hi>Seddon.</hi> But because the
Warrant made for me, was so altered as to the name
that it suited not his case, after some time of Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
he had his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and by the Justice
of worthy Judg <hi>Hale</hi> and other Judges, was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But he was a tender man, and my Wife sensible
that she was the occasion (which did her no good),
and all the burden lay on her to maintain him, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
and comfort him, to pay the Lawyers, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
all fees; which as I remember cost her 20 l.
And yet we were calumniated as if I (that was
twenty miles off) had put another to suffer in my
stead.</p>
            <p>§. 9. When she saw that we could not be suffered
to preach in the place which upon her promise she
had built; she was very glad that Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> and the
Parishioners accepted of it for their publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
asking them no more Rent than we were to
pay for the ground, and the Room over for a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
at 5 <hi>l.</hi> and asking no advantage for all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
laid out on the building: yet since the purchase
of the fee-simple of the Chappel-ground hath cost
me 200 l. more (and the adjoining ground 200 <hi>l.</hi>
more, to my great loss).</p>
            <p>§. 10. So much was her heart set on the helping
the ignorant untaught poor about St. <hi>Iameses,</hi> that
she set up a School there to teach some poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59245:39"/>
to read, and the Catechism freely; and thereby
also relieved a poor honest man that taught them,
who hath a Wife and many children, and no other
maintenance of his own. [Mr. <hi>Bruce.]</hi> And she
would fain have set up more, had she had money:
For this she beg'd a while of her good friends; but
they quickly gave over, and she paid him mostly of
her own, six pound a year, till her death. I mention
this, to move some charitable people to continue it;
and to tell them, that in the many great out-parishes
of <hi>London</hi> there are multitudes of the children of
the poor, that spend their time in idleness, and play,
and are never taught to read; and that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good women very poor, that would be glad of a
small stipued to teach such to read, and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism;
and so both might have relief and help: and
I think Charity can scarce be better used, as honest
Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> hath in <hi>Wales</hi> found by experience. And
I would such places in <hi>London</hi> where the tenth or
the fourth person in the Parish cannot come to
Church, and many thousands have disused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from Gods publick Worship, and breed up
their children accordingly, were pitied as well as
<hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 11. When she saw that I could not use the
Chappel which she built, she presently hired ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
near (ready built, for gain) in <hi>Swallow-street,</hi>
that the poor people where I had begun (through
Gods mercy with considerable success) might still be
taught: and when I had there a while continued,
and was kept out (by the Officers standing at the
door with the Justices Warrant many Months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59245:39"/>
it was her care and act to refer it to many
good Ministers, to choose one for the place that
would be better endured by them that would not
endure me; and a faithful painful self-denying man
was chosen, who hath there done much good, and
still doth.</p>
            <p>§. 12. When I was thence driven, it was her choice
that I should go quite to <hi>Southwark</hi> each Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to Preach to a Congregation of poor people
there.</p>
            <p>§. 13. When Dr. <hi>Manton</hi>'s place, at <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi>
was void, it was her desire that I should Preach once
a day there, because being near, many of the poor of
St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s would come thither, as they did.</p>
            <p>§. 14. She got from her friends also money to help
to build another very useful Chappel for another,
among a numerous poor people, where still much
good is done. And she promoted two or three such
more.</p>
            <p>§. 15. She was very impatient of publick Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the Ministers, or for the Rent of the place,
because it sounded ill, and prejudiced the ignorant
and covetous, and troubled the poor that had no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and therefore did the utmost she could with her
own Purse and her friends to avoid it, knowing that
Rent must be paid, and Ministers and their Families
must have Bread (and it's pity they should be under
the cares of want).</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59245:40"/>
§. 16. She was so far from crossing me in my preaching
freely without Salary, or gathering a Church that would
maintain me, or making Collections, or getting Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
that she would not have endured any such
thing if I had desired it; though she knew that the
labourer was worthy of his hire, and that God had
ordained, that they that Preach the Gospel should
live of the Gospel: yet she knew that all must be
done to the furtherance of the Gospel, and to edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and was of <hi>Paul</hi>'s mind, that would rather die
than any should make his glorying void, and deprive
him of that reward. Therefore it was so far from
offending her (as it would be with many Ministers
Wives that were in want, and might have such main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as is their due), that I neither conformed,
nor took any place of gain, that it was as much by
her will as my own, that for the first nine or ten years
of my ejected state I took not so much as any private
gift to supply my wants, except Ten Pounds a year
from Serjeant <hi>Fountaine,</hi> which his importunity, and
my civility would not permit me to refuse.</p>
            <p>§. 17. And I take it yet for a greater part of her
self-denial and charity, that when her own Estate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
much too short to maintain her in the exercise
of such good works as she was devoted to, she at
length refused not to accept with thanks the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of others, and to live partly on Charity, that she
might exercise Charity to them that could not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
get it from others as we could do: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
of latter years divers faithful pious friends (no
way related to us, or obliged by us) have been so
free, kind and liberal, that I have much ado to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59245:40"/>
here naming them, in expression of their bounty,
and my thanks. And I must say of her, that once her
pride would not have stooped to be so much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
as to live on the Charity of strangers.</p>
            <p>§. 18. When Warrants were out (from Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Davis)</hi> to distrain of my goods for fines for
my Preaching, she did, without any repining, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me to undergo the loss, and did her self
take the trouble of removing, and hiding my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
a while (many score being so lost), and after,
to give it away, <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> some to <hi>New England,</hi>
and the most at home to avoid distraning on them.
And the danger of Imprisonment, and paying 40. <hi>l.</hi>
for every Sermon, was so far from enclining her to
hinder or discourage me from any one Sermon, that
if she did but think I had the least fear, or self-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by fleshly wisdom, in shrinking from my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
Office work, it was so great a trouble to her,
that she could not hide it (who could too much hide
many others).</p>
            <p>§. 19. She was exceeding impatient with any
Nonconforming Ministers that shrunk for fear of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
or that were over-querulous and sensible of
their wants or dangers; and would have no man be
a Minister that had not so much self-denial as to lay
down all at the feet of Christ, and count no cost or
suffering too dear to serve him. She greatly hated
choosing, or using the sacred Ministry for wealth,
ease, or honour, or any worldly end, serving the
flesh under the name of serving Christ, and looking
to be reverenced and honoured in this taking of Gods
Name in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59245:41"/>
§. 20. Accordingly after some years, wherein a
lager course had been taken, she was against my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
Parents to devote their children to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
that had but good Wits and Parts, and were
not prophane; though my success with some did much
encourage me to it heretofore: But her sense of the
sin and mischief of bad Ministers, made her perswade
all, that in that case she had to do with, to take heed
of devoting their Sons to the Ministry, till they had
good reason to judg them truly godly; and as she
would not have pious persons to Marry such as were
not pious, on pretence of hopes that God would
convert them; so much less would she have such
hopes that have no promise from God, pretended for
devoting unsanctified lads to the Sacred Office: she
saw how many, even of good mens children, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned
the Ministy, and turned to any course that
did but serve their worldly interest; that she was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
against addicting any to that Office, that
had not besides good Wits and Parts, so great a love
to God and Souls, as to come to it with absolute self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial,
resolved to serve Christ at the dearest rates,
and take his acceptance, and the winning of Souls
for their Benefice.</p>
            <p>She was not willing to entice any into the way of
the Ministry, as a common Trade to live by in the
world; and would have had two or three Reading,
Writing, and Catechising-Schools set up instead of one
Grammar-School: And she would not have Parents
make <hi>Scholars</hi> of bad children, nor send them to
the Universities, lest when they had a little wordy
Learning they should make themselves Ministers,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59245:41"/>
whether their Parents would or not; and so a swarm
of such as had been a few years at the University,
should think a Benefice their due, and take the
charge of the souls of many, that never knew the
worth of one, nor how it must be qualified and
guided.</p>
            <p>§. 21. Her expectations of liberality to the poor
from others were too high, and her displeasure too
great towards them that denied her; whereupon
when she saw a worthy person in debt, or Prison, or
great want, she would promise to gather them such a
Sum, and sometimes she was put to pay most of it her
self: But a Fortnight or Month before she died, she
promised to get 20. <hi>l.</hi> towards the relief of one of
known name and worth, and could get but 8. <hi>l.</hi> and
somewhat over of it, and paid all the rest her self.</p>
            <p>§. 22. Her judgment was, that we ought to give
more or less to every one that asketh, if we have it;
and that <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> and <hi>notice,</hi> and <hi>asking,</hi> next
to <hi>known indigence,</hi> and <hi>great worth,</hi> are the marks by
which to know to whom God would have us give. I
thought, that besides these, we must exercise pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in discerning the degrees of need and worth.
But she practised as she thought, and specially to them
in Prison for debt; and blamed me if I denied any
one.</p>
            <p>§. 23. Alas! I know many poor Widows, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
that think they have now lost a Mother, and
are left desolate, whom I could wish some that are
able would help, instead of the help which they have
lost.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59245:42"/>
§. 24. She was much more liberal to many of my
own poor kindred than I was: But her way was not
to maintain them in idleness, but to take children,
and set them to some Trade, or help them out of some
special straits.</p>
            <p>§. 25. To her own kindred she bare a most tender
love: but her care was most to get them to be good,
and save their souls, and next to settle them well in
the world. I had ever been greatly averse to motion
Marriages, yet she even compelled me (first satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my reason) to be a motioner of a Wife to her
only Brothers Son, who, it's said, was worth to him
above 20000. <hi>l.</hi> And her Sisters children she loved
as if they had been her own, especially three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>§. 26. There are some things charged on her as
faults, which I shall mention. 1. That she busied her
head so much about Churches, and works of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and was not content to live privately and quietly.
But this is but just what prophane unbelievers say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all zeal, and serious godliness: <hi>what needs there
all this ado?</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> call some women his
helps in the Gospel? He that knows what it is to do
good, and makes it the business of his life in the
world, and knows what it is to give account of our
stewardship, and to be doomed as the unprofitable
slothful servant, will know how to answer this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59245:42"/>
§. 28. Another accusation is, that she was
wasteful and imprudent in leaving me so much in
debt.</p>
            <p>To that I answer, 1. Let any one that reads what
went before, consider what she did, and he will not
wonder at her debts: It was not to pamper her own
body; she used mean clothing, and a far meaner diet
for her own person, I think much less than <hi>Cornario</hi>'s
and <hi>Lessius</hi>'s proportion.</p>
            <p>2. And she went into no debt but (by mortgage,
or otherwise) she gave the Creditors good security
for.</p>
            <p>3. But I confess she and I differed in this; I thought
I was to give but all my Income, and not to borrow
to give, unless in some publick, or extraordinary
case: she thought otherwise, that while she could
give security, she ought to borrow to relieve the
poor, especially the most worthy. Nor did she draw
upon us any debt, but what there was not only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
security for, but also a fair prospect of our
selves having a competency left, had it pleased God
to lengthen her life: and I am far from fearing want
my self.</p>
            <p>But so much for opening the course of her studies,
labours, expences, and indeed her delights.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of her Mental Qualifications, and her Infirmities.</head>
            <p>§. 1. <hi>I Doubt not but some of these accusers will
say,</hi> Why open you all this? Were not you the
Master? and do not you hereby praise your self; or
else confess that she was your governess.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Perhaps love and grief may make me
speak more than many will think fit. But though
some passion blind the judgment, some doth but sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate
it to duty; and God made it to that end: and
I will not be judged by any that never felt the
like.</p>
            <p>2. Did not Christ say of <hi>Marys</hi> Box of Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it should be remembred wherever that
Gospel was Preached? And was it not <hi>Iudas</hi> that
said, <hi>what need this wast?</hi> And were not the poors
clothing, made by <hi>Dorcas,</hi> shewed to move <hi>Peter?</hi>
The poor we have always with us. Do the covetous
believe, that what we do to his people, we do to
Christ?</p>
            <p>3. It was not mine which she gave, but her own,
that I am now mentioning, and what she procured.</p>
            <p>4. But I am not ashamed to have been much ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by her prudent love in many things. And you
will the less wonder when I have told you what she
and I were.</p>
            <p>§. 2. For my self, my constant pains, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Ministerial labours, forbad me the care of
outward things. I had never much known worldly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59245:43"/>
cares: Before I was Married I had no need; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
she took the care on her: and disuse had made
it intolerable to me. I feel now more of it than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I did, when yet I have so little a way to go.</p>
            <p>§. 3. And as for her (I speak the truth), her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of such things was so much quicker, and
more discerning than mine; that though I was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
somewhat tenacious of my own conceptions,
her reasons, and my experience usually told me,
that she was in the right, and knew more than
I. She would at the first hearing understand the
matter better than I could do by many and long
thoughts.</p>
            <p>§. 4. And the excellency of her reason lay not so
much in the speculative, as the <hi>prudential practical
part:</hi> I must say, that in this I never knew her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual:
In very hard cases, about what was to be
done, she would suddenly open all the way that was
to be opened, in things of the Family, Estate, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
civil business. And to confess the truth, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
acquainted her, that I knew less in such things
than she; and therefore was willing she should take
it all upon her.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Yea, I will say that, which they that believe
me to be no liar, will wonder at; <hi>Except in cases
that require Learning, and skill in Theological diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
she was better at resolving a case of conscience
than most Divines that ever I knew in all my life.</hi> I
often put cases to her, which she suddenly so resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as to convince me of some degree of over-sight in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59245:44"/>
my own resolution. Insomuch that of late years, I
confess, that I was used to put all, save secret cases,
to her, and hear what she could say. Abundance of
difficulties were brought me, some about Restituti,
on, some about Injuries, some about References,
some about Vows, some about Marriage promises,
and many such like; and she would lay all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
presently together, compare them, and
give me a more exact resolution than I could do.</p>
            <p>§. 6. As to Religion, we were so perfectly of one
mind, that I know not that she differed from me in
any one point, or scarce a circumstance, except in
the prudential management of what we were agreed
in: She was for universal love of all true Christians,
and against appropriating the Church to a Party, and
against censoriousness and partiality in Religion;
she was for acknowledging all that is of God in
Conformists and Nonconformists: But she had
much more reverence for the elder Conformists than
for most of the young ones, who ventured upon
things which Dissenters had so much to say against,
without weighing, or understanding the reasons on
both sides, meerly following others for worldly ends,
without a tender fear of sinning; especially if any
young men of her own friends were inclined meerly
to swim with the stream, without due tryal of the
case, it greatly displeased her, and she thought hardly
of them.</p>
            <p>§. 7. She had in her Youth been tempted to doubt
of the Life to come, and of the Truth of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:
But she was so fully resolved and setled
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59245:44"/>
herein, that her confident Assurance of it was the
life of all her Life and Practice.</p>
            <p>§. 8. After all the doubts of her Sincerity and
Salvation, and all the Fears and Sadness thereupon,
which cast her into Melancholy, she so far overcame
them all, that for near these Nineteen years that I
have lived with her, I think I never heard her thrice
speak a doubting word of her Salvation, but oft of
her hopeful perswasions, that we should live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Heaven: It being my judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice, to make those that I teach, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the Gospel is glad Tidings of great Joy;
and that Holiness lies especially in delighting in
God, his Word and Works, and in his joyful praise,
and hopes of Glory, and longing for, and seeking
the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and living as fruitfully to
the Church and others, as we can do in the world:
And that this must be wrought by the most belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
apprehensions of God's Goodness, as equal to
his Greatness, and of his great Love to Mankind
manifested in our Redemption, and by believing
the Grace and Riches of Christ, and the Comforting-Office
of the Holy Ghost, and studying daily God's
Promises and Mercies, and our everlasting Joys.
And that Religion consists in doing God's comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Will, and quietly and joyfully trusting and
resting in his promising and disposing Will. And
that Fear and Sorrow are but to remove Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and further all this.</p>
            <p>And this Doctrine by degrees she drunk in, and so
fully consented to, that (though Timerousness was her
Disease) her judgment was quieted and setled herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59245:45"/>
§. 9. The nature of true Religion, Holiness, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and all Duty to God and man, was printed
in her conceptions, in so distinct and clear a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
as made her endeavours and expectations still
look at greater exactness, than I and such as I could
reach. She was very desirous that we should all
have lived in a constancy of Devotion, and a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Innocency: And in this respect she was the
meetest helper that I could have had in the world
(that ever I was acquainted with): For I was apt
to be over-careless in my Speech, and too backward
to my Duty; And she was still endeavouring to
bring me to greater wariness and strictness in both:
If I spake rashly or sharply, it offended her: If I
carried it (as I was apt) with too much neglect of
Ceremony, or humble Complement to any, she would
modestly tell me of it: If my very Looks seemed not
pleasant, she would have had me amend them (which
my weak pained state of Body undisposed me to do:)
If I forgat any Week to Catechise my Servants, and
familiarly instruct them personally (besides my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Family-Duties) she was troubled at my remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And whereas of late years my decay of Spirits,
and diseased heaviness and pain, made me much more
seldom and cold in profitable Conference and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in my house, than I had been when I was
younger, and had more Ease, and Spirits, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Vigour, she much blamed me, and was troubled
at it, as a wrong to her self and others: Though
yet her judgment agreed with mine, that too much
and often Table-talk of the best things, doth but
tend to dull the common hearers, and harden them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59245:45"/>
under it as a customary thing: And that too much
good talk may bring it into contempt, or make it
ineffectual.</p>
            <p>And of late years, my constant weakness and pain
made me unable to speak much in my ordinary
course of Duty; and my Writings, Preachings and
other publick Duty (which I ever thought I was
bound to prefer before lesser) did so wholly take up
those few hours of the day, which I had out of my
Bed, that I was seldomer in secret Prayer with my
Wife than she desired.</p>
            <p>§. 10. Indeed it troubleth me to think how oft I
told her, <hi>That I never understood</hi> Solomon's <hi>words,</hi>
Eccles. 7. 16. but by the Exposition of her case, <hi>[Be
not righteous overmuch, neither make thy self overwise:
Why shouldst thou destroy thy self?]</hi> I doubt not but
<hi>Solomon</hi> spake of <hi>Humane Civil Righteousness and
Wisdom, as a means respecting Temporal Prosperity
or Adversity,</hi> rather than Spiritual, holy Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
respecting God's everlasting Reward: Or if it
were extended to Religious Righteousness, it can
be but against Superstition, falsly called <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to our present case, I must thus resolve the
Question, <hi>Whether one can be religiously wise and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
overmuch?</hi> And I Answer, That we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between, 1. <hi>Material and Formal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
2. Between Objective and Subjective measures of
it. 3. Of the good and bad consequents and effects.</hi> And
1. no man can be <hi>formally and properly too wise or
too righteous.</hi> Else it would charge God with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59245:46"/>
For formal proper Righteousness is nothing
but our Conformity to God's governing Will. And
if our Obedience were too much, and to be blamed,
God's commands were to be blamed, that required
it. But very strict actions are commonly called <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
as a written Prayer or words are called a
Prayer, though properly wanting the Form, it is
not so. And not only a good Object, but a right
End, Principle, and <hi>Mode,</hi> and Circumstances, go
to make an Action righteous. 2. That Action which
compared with the Object cannot possibly be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
and righteous, yet as compared with the Agent,
or Subject, may be too much: No man can know,
believe, or love God too much, nor answerable to
his Perfections. But one may possibly be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with so earnest a desire of God, Christ, Christian
Society, Holiness and Heaven, as may be more than
Head and Health can bear: And so it may be too
much for the subject. 3. Therefore the probable
effects must be weighed. He that should meditate,
read, yea love God so intensly as to distract him,
would to it overmuch. He that would do a good
work precisely, when the exactness would hinder
the substance of another, perhaps a better, would
be righteous overmuch. And I thought this the case
sometime of my dear Wife; 1. She set her <hi>Head</hi>
and <hi>Heart</hi> so <hi>intensly</hi> upon doing good, that her
<hi>Head</hi> and Body would hardly bear it. As holy set
Meditation is no Duty to a Melancholy person that
cannot do it without confusion and danger of distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
so many other Duties are no Duties, when
they will do more harm than good. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And a man
is limited in his Capacity and his Time: No man
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59245:46"/>
can do all the good he would; and to omit a
greater for the better doing of a lesser, or to omit
the substance of the one for exacter doing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I thought was to be unrighteous by being
righteous overmuch. She (and some others) thought
I had done better to have written fewer Books, and
to have done those few better. I thought, while
I wrote none needlesly, the modall imperfection of
two was less evil than the total omission of one:
She thought I should have spent more time in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
exercise with her, my Family, and my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
though I had written less. I thought there
were many to do such work, that would not do mine;
and that I chose the greatest, which I durst not omit,
and could not do both in the measure that I desired
else to have done.</p>
            <p>§. 11. As she saith (before cited) her self, that
<hi>if she was but in a condition, in which Gods service
was costly to her, it would make her know whether she
were sincere or not;</hi> so she had her wish, and proved
her sincerity by her costliest obedience: It cost her
not only her labour and Estate, but somewhat of
her trouble of body and mind; For her knife was
too keen, and cut the sheath. Her desires were
more earnestly set on doing good, than her tender
mind and head could well bear; for indeed her great
infirmity was the four Passions of Love, Desire,
Fear, and Trouble of Mind. Anger she either had very
little, next none, or little made it known. She rarely
ever spake in an angry manner: She could not well
bear to hear one speak loud, or hastily, or eagerly,
or angrily, even to those that deserved it: My
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59245:47"/>
temper in this she blamed, as too quick and earnest:
When her servants did any fault unwillingly, she
scarce ever told them of it; when one lost Ten
Pounds worth of Linnen in carriage carelesly, and
another Ten Pounds worth of Plate by negligence,
she shewed no anger at any such thing. If servants
had done amiss, and we could not prove it, or knew
not which did it, she would never ask them her self,
nor suffer others, lest it should tempt them to hide it
by a lye (unless it were a servant that feared God,
and would not lye).</p>
            <p>I took her deep and long sense of the faults of
over-loved and obliged persons, to be one of her
greatest faults. But no one was ever readier to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
a fault confessed, or which weakness and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
differences caused. I will give but one instance:
The good woman whom she used to hire the Rooms
over St. <hi>Iameses</hi> Market-house, was greatly against
the Common-prayer, and first made my Wife feel
whether I meant to use it, before she would take it.
I told her I intended not to use it, but would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
her. Upon that my Wife told her that I would
not. After this I caused the <hi>Reader</hi> to read the
Psalms, Chapters, Creed, Decalogue, and I used the
Lord, Prayer; and I openly told them, that we met not
as a Separated distinct Church, but for the time to
supply the notorious necessities of the people, and
as helpers of the allowed Ministry. The good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
thought this had been reading the Common-Prayer,
and in a Letter which I now find, accused
my Wife with five or six vehement charges, for tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her I would not read <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Common-Prayer. My
Wife was of my mind for the Matter; but greatly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59245:47"/>
offended with me for seeming to do it for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of danger; and was so far from not pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these false smart accusations, that she never once
blamed the good woman, but loved her, tendered
her, and relieved her in sickness to the death, but
hardly forgave me; and yet drew me from all other
places, if the Ministers were not of my mind (by
prudent diversity).</p>
            <p>Much less did her sufferings from the times distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
her. She hath blamed me for naming in print
my Losses, Imprisonment, and other sufferings by the
Bishops, as being over selfish queralousness, when I
should rather with wonder be thankful for the great
mercy we yet enjoyed. Though I think I never
mentioned them as over-sensible of the sufferings,
but as a necessary evincing of the nature of the
cause, and as part of the necessary history or matter
of fact in order to decide it. She as much disliked the
silencing of the Ministers, as any; but she did not
love to hear it much complained of, save as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
loss; nor to hear <hi>Conformists</hi> talkt against as a
Party; nor the faults of the conscientious sort of
them aggravated in a siding factious manner.</p>
            <p>But 1. she was prone to <hi>over-love</hi> her <hi>Relations,</hi>
and those good people (poor as much as rich)
whom she thought most upright. The love was
good, but the degree was too passionate.</p>
            <p>2. She <hi>over-earnestly</hi> desired their spiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
If these whom she over-loved, had not been as
good, and done as well as she would have them, in
innocent behaviour, in piety, and (if rich) in libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
it over-troubled her, and she could not bear
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:59245:48"/>
3. She was apt when she set her mind and heart
upon some good work which she counted <hi>great,</hi> or
the welfare of some dear Friend, to be too much
pleased in her expectations and self-made promises of
the success; and then almost overturned with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when they disappointed her. And she too impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
bore unkindnesses from the friends that were
most dear to her, or whom she had much obliged.
Her will was set upon good, but her weakness could
not bear the crossing or frustration of it.</p>
            <p>§. 12. But the great infirmity which tyrannized
over her, was a diseased <hi>fearfulness,</hi> against which she
had little more free will or power, than a man in an
Ague or Frost, against shaking cold. Her nature was
prone to it; and I said before, abundance of sad
accidents made that, and <hi>trouble</hi> of mind, her malady.
Besides (as she said) four times in danger of death.
2. And the storming of her Mothers house by Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
firing part, killing, plundering, and threatning
the rest. 3. The awakenings of her conversion.
4. The sentence of death by sickness presently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her peace was setled. 5. The fire next her
Lodgings in <hi>Sweetings-Alley.</hi> 6. The burning of a
Merchant, his Wife and Family, in <hi>Lothbury,</hi> overa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her Brother <hi>Vpton</hi>'s door. 7. The common
terror and confusion at <hi>Dunstans</hi> Church in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi>
when they thought the Church was falling on
their heads while I was preaching, and the people
cast themselves down from the Galleries. 8. Her
Mothers death. 9. The friendless state she thought
she was then left in. 10. The great Plague. 11. The
Burning of <hi>London.</hi> 12. The crack and danger of
her Chamber in <hi>Aldersgate street.</hi> 13. The crack
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59245:48"/>
and confusion at St. <hi>Iameses</hi> Market-house. 14. The
many Fires and talk of firing since. 15. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rumours of Murderings and Massacres. 16. The
death and dangers of many of her friends, and my
own illness. More than all these concurred to make
<hi>fear</hi> and <hi>aptness</hi> to be troubled, to be her disease: so
that she much dreamed of fire and murderers; and
her own dreams workt half as dangerously on her
as realities; so that she could not bear the clapping
of a door, or any thing that had suddenness, noise,
or fierceness in it. But all this was more the malady
of her body than of her soul; and I accounted had
little moral guilt: and I took it for an evidence of
the power of grace, that so timerous a person 1. had
overcome most of her fears of Hell and Gods deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2. And was more fearless of persecution, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
or losses and poverty thereby, than I or
any that I remember to have known.</p>
            <p>§. 13. And though her spirits were so quick, and
she so apt to be troubled at mens sin whom she much
loved, she greatly differed from me in her bearing
with them, and carriage towards them. My temper
and judgment much led me to use my dependents,
servants and friends, according to the rules of Church-discipline;
and if they heard not loving, private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
once, twice, and thrice, to speak to them
more sharply, and then before others, and to turn
them off if yet they would not amend. But her way
was to oblige them by all the love, kindness and
bounty that she was able, and to bear with them year
after year while there was hope, and at last not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
them, but still use them so as she though was likest
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59245:49"/>
at least to keep them in a state of hope from the
badness which displicency might cause. I could not
have born with a Son, I think, as she could do where
her kindness was at her own choice; and yet she
more disliked the least fault than I did, and was
more desirous of their greatest innocency and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness.</p>
            <p>§. 14. Indeed she was so much for calmness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
and doing nothing rashly, and in haste,
and my condition and business, as well as temper
made me do, and speak much so suddenly, that she
principally differed from me, and blamed me in this;
every considerable case and business she would have
me take time to think much of before I did it, or
speak, or resolved of any thing. I knew the counsel
was good for one that could stay, but not for one
that must ride Post: I thought still I had but a little
time to live; I thought some considerable work still
called for haste: I have these Forty years been
sensible of the sin of losing time: I could not
spare an hour: I thought I could understand the
matters in question as well at a few thoughts as in
many days: and yet she (that had less work and
more leisure, but) a far quicker apprehension than
mine, was all for staying to consider, and against
haste and ea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gerness in almost every thing; and
notwithstanding her over quick, and feeling temper,
was all for mildness, calmness, gentleness, pleasing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and serenity.</p>
            <p>§. 15. She had an earnest desire of the conversion
and salvation of her servants, and was greatly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59245:49"/>
troubled that so many of them (though tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in their work) went away ignorant, or
strange to true godliness, as they came: And such
as were truly converted with us she loved as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>§. 16. One infirmity made her faulty in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of much of her duty: She was wont to
say, that she had from her childhood Imprinted a
deep fear and hatred of hypocrisie on her mind,
that she could never do the outside of her duty,
as to the speaking part, for fear of hypocrisie: I
scarce ever met with a person that was abler to
speak long, for matter and good language, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repetitions, even about Religious things; and
few that had more desire that it were well done;
and yet she could not do it her self for fear of
seeming to be guilty of ostentation. In good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
she would speak little of that which she most
desired to hear. When I was at any time from
home, she would not pray in the Family, though
she could not endure to be without it. She would
privately talk to the servants, and read good books to
them. Most of the open speaking part of Religion she
omitted, through a diseased enmity to ostentation and
hypocrisie. But of late years, when she saw me and
others too sparing in profitable speech to young
and ignorant people, she confest that she saw her
error, and that even an hypocrite, using but
the words and outside of Religion, was better
to others than silence and unprofitable omission
was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59245:50"/>
§. 17. Her houshold-affairs she ordered with so
so great skill and decency, as that others much
praised that which I was no fit judg of: I had been
bred among plain mean people, and I thought that
so much washing of Stairs and Rooms, to keep
them as clean as their Trenchers and Dishes, and so
much ado about cleanliness and trifles, was a sinful
curiosity, and expence of servants time, who might
that while have been reading some good book. But
she that was otherwise bred, had somewhat other
thoughts.</p>
            <p>§. 18. Her great tender impatiency lay much in
her ears: She could not bear (without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son)
a disputing contradiction; nor yet to hear sad
tidings, nor any hard prognostick; and it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she felt the weakness of her own head, and for
Twenty years lived in too great fears of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of her understanding. And I was apt to think
it was but a passionate fanciful fear, and was too apt
to be <hi>impatient with her impatiency,</hi> and with every
<hi>trouble</hi> of her mind, not enough considering how
great tenderness in all our discourse she needed;
though I remember nothing else that ever I shewed
impatience to her in: but ever since her first danger,
and <hi>strong</hi> affection, I could hardly bear any signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of her displeasure and discontent. And she
was wont oft to say, It is a great mercy of God not
to know what will befal us in this world, nor how we
shall be sick, or suffer, or die, that our fore-knowledg
may not anticipate our sorrows, though in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
we should be always ready.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59245:50"/>
§. 19. She was the greatest honourer of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and most sincerely loved her, that ever I knew
a Child do to a Parent: She believed the Promise of
the Fifth Commandment, and believed that it did
imply an answerable Curse to them that broke it.
And that as honouring Parents hath even the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Blessings on Earth, so the dishonouring them
is like to bring a Curse upon the Person, or Family,
that is guilty of it: And that how great soever their
present Prosperity may seem, it is coming and will
overtake them, either in their Bodies, Children, or
Estates. Prov. 30. 17. <hi>The eye that mocketh at his
Father, and despiseth to obey his Mother, the Ravens
of the valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles
shall eat it:</hi> And such by <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law were to be

THAT SETTETH LIGHT BY HIS
FATHER OR HIS MOTHER; AND

And will God suspend it till the Sinner saith, <hi>Amen?</hi>
O no. And what is that persons Case that liveth
under this Curse of God? If the <hi>Body</hi> escape it,

Childrens Souls.</p>
            <p>§. 20. In one, 1657. to this Daughter at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
she writes thus.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

it not. Many false Fears may arise, for want of
the true Fear of offending a Good and Gracious
God: All your Fears and all your Joys must be
founded in him, or else your life here will be very
uncomfortable. Had not I my Comforts from my

I and my Neighbours had of comassion to her in

yet those which she had I find now among her reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Papers: And that you may see what it was that
I' thought she most desired, and what she her
self most valued, I will here add one of them (not
venturing to trouble such with more, as are affected
little with any matters but their own, which is the
case of most). I recite this rather than others, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
also as an act of repentance for those failings of
her just expectations, by the neglect of such helps as
I should have given her, which I had here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.
For though she oft said, that before she Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me she expected more sowrness, and unsuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than she found; yet I am sure that she found less
zeal, and holiness, and strictness in all words, and
looks, and duties, and less help for her soul than she
expected: And her temper was to aggravate a fault
much more in her nearest and dearest friends than in
any others, and to be far more troubled at them.
But this use she made of my too cold and careless
converse, and of all my impatiency with her impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and of all my hasty words, that she that had
long thought she had no grace, because she reach't
not higher than almost any reach on Earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she had many Passions and Infirmities, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by me and many other esteemed Teachers, that
we were all as bad as she; and therefore grace doth
stand with more faultiness than she had imagined, and
that all our teaching much excelled the frame of
our souls and lives, and was much more worthy to be
followed; and therefore that God would also pardon
such failings as her own.</p>

THough I have received none from you, but
one by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I will not be avenged on
you by the like. I have nothing of News, or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to communicate, but to tell you, that we
are all here yet as well as you left us, excepting
what your absence causeth. And yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
I find that it is easier to be oft speaking to
God, when I have no body else to speak to, than
when there are other Competitors, Expectants, or
Interpellators. Just as I can easier now fill my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to thee, with some speech of God, when I
have nothing else to put into it, than I can when
many other matters are craving every one a place.
It is our shame that the Love and Glory of God
doth not silence every other Suiter, and even in
the midst of crowds and business take us up, and
and press every creature and occasion for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
But while we are weak, and compassed with
flesh, we must not only consider what we <hi>should</hi>
do, but what we <hi>can</hi> do. It is our great fault that
we are no skilfuller, and faithfuller in helping one
another, that we might miss each other on better
reasons, than meerly from the inclinations of Love.
I hope God will make us better hereafter, that
when we are asunder, each of us may say, I miss
the help for Watchfulness and Heavenliness, for
true Love and Thankfulness to God, which I was
wont to have. But O! what an enemy is a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
heart! which maketh us unable for our duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and makes us need the help of others, and yet
will not suffer us to use it when we have it. When we
are alone, it maketh us impediments to our selves, and
when we are in company it maketh us impediments
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59245:55"/>
to others. Yet is there none, no, not the weakest of
Christians, but there is much in them that we
might improve. But we are so bad and backward
at it, that Satan too commonly hath his end, in
making us unprofitable to each other: If a good
Horse, or a good House be a valuable mercy, how
much more is a good friend? But Art and Industry
are necessary to the improvement. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
when we fetch not the help and comfort which
we might have from God, from Christ himself, from
Heaven, from Scripture, for want of improving
skill and industry. O how easie is it, when our
friends are taken from us, to say, Thus, and thus I
might, and should have used them, rather than so
to use them while we have them! I hope God will
help me to make some better use of thee while we
are together: and at a distance, O let not a hearty
request to God for each other, be any day want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Dear heart, the time of our mutual help is
short (O let us use it accordingly); but the time
of our reaping the fruit of this, and all holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
and preparatory mercies, will be endless.
Yet a little while, and we shall be both with Christ.
He is willing of us, and I hope we are willing of
him, and of his Grace, though the flesh be weak.
I am absent, but God is still with you, your daily
Guide and Keeper; and I hope you will labour to
make him your daily Comfort. And now you
have none to divert and hinder you, to say, <hi>[When
I awake, I am still with thee.]</hi> And when you are
up, <hi>[I have set the Lord always before me; because he
is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.]</hi> And
when Thoughts crowd in, <hi>[In the multitude of my
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59245:55"/>
thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul.</hi>
And when Thoughts would trouble and perplex
you, <hi>My Meditation of him shall be sweet, and I will
delight in the Lord.</hi> And when your Wants and
Duty call you to him, <hi>It is good for me to draw
nigh to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All other comforts will be, as the things are
which we take comfort in; that is, Helpful if the
things be helpful, and used but as Helps: Hurtful
if the things be hurtful, or hurtfully used; Vain if
the things be vain; Short if the things be transitory;
and durable if the things are durable to us. And this
is the chief comfort which you and I must have in one
another, that is, as helpful towards God, and as our
converse with him will be durable. The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
my great unprofitableness, and the sin that
brought me under any disabilities to answer your
earnest and honest desires of greater helps than I
afford you, and help me yet to amend it towards
you. But though my Soul be faulty and dull, and

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of her Bodily Infirmities, and her Death.</head>
            <p>§. 1. HER diseased frightfulness, and many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sicknesses, I have mentioned before.
A great pain of the Head held her from her youth,
two or three days every Fortnight, or little more;
and upon every thing that did irritate the matter, she
had a constant straitness in the Lungs, a great inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of much exercise, motion, or any heating
thing. Ever since her sickness, 1659. she hath lived
in an ill-conceited fear of distraction, which greatly
hurt her; It was because she had an Aunt long so,
deceased, and her Parents were naturally passionate,
and her spirits over-quick, and her blood thin and
Mobile; and though wisdom hid it from others in
her converse, she felt the trouble of her own mind
in things, as aforesaid, that much displeased her;
and so lived in a constant fear, which tended to have
brought on her what she feared: But her understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was so far from failing, that it was higher and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than other peoples; but like the treble strings of
a Lute, strained up to the highest, sweet, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
danger.</p>
            <p>§. 2. About three years ago, by the mis-perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a friend, drinking against the Collick a spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of powdered Ginger every morning, near a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a year together, and then falling into some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-whelming
thoughts; besides it overthrew her
Head for a few days, but God, in great mercy, soon
restored her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59245:56"/>
§. 3. Ever since that time her Head-ach abated,
and she complained of a pain in one of her Breasts,
and her uncurable timerousness setled her in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that she should have a Cancer (which I saw no
great cause to fear); but she could neither endure
to hear that it was none, or that it was; but in fearing
uncertainty, prepared constantly for a sad death:
And several Friends, Neighbours and Relations late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dying of Cancers, increased her fear: but she
seemed to be prepared cheerfully to undergo it.</p>
            <p>§. 4. The many and weekly rumors of Plots,
Firings, Massacres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much increased this fear, as
is aforesaid; and the death of very many Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
young, strong, and excellent Christians, of
greatest use, and many near friends, did greatly add
to her sadness and expectations of death. But little
of this was seen to any; she purposely carried it
pleasantly, and as merrily to others, when she was
troubled.</p>
            <p>§. 5. The fears of a Cancer made her take the
Waters for Physick often, and she kept down her
body so in her diet, that about five Ounces of Milk,
or Milk and Water, with a little Chocolate in it,
morning and night, and about one or two bits at
Dinner was her diet for many years.</p>
            <p>§. 6. At last, about ten weeks before her sickness,
almost all her pain went out of her Breast, and all
fixed in a constant pain upon the right Kidney, and
with the pain <hi>her Urine</hi> stopt, that about four parts of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59245:57"/>
five ceased for about ten weeks. She divers days drunk
<hi>Barnet-Waters;</hi> but I think they were the last occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of her sickness, and too much tincture of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which work't too powerfully on her Brain, and
suddenly cast her into strong disturbance and delira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
in which, though the Physicians, with great
kindness and care, did omit nothing in their power,
she died the <hi>12th</hi> day: She fell sick on <hi>Friday, Iune
3.</hi> 1681. and died <hi>Iune</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Though her understanding never perfectly
returned, she had a very strong remembrance of the
affecting passages of her life, from her childhood.
Mrs. <hi>Corbet</hi> (whom she dearly loved, and had newly
got into the house to be her companion), with others,
standing by, she cried out to me, <hi>My mother is in
Heaven, and Mr.</hi> Corbet <hi>is in Heaven, and thou and
I shall be in Heaven.</hi> And even in her last weakness
was perswaded of her salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>She oft shewed us, that her soul did work
towards God, crying out (complaining of her Head),</hi>
Lord make me know what I have done, f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
all this. Lord, I submit; God chooseth best for
me. She desired me to pray by her, and seemed quietly
to join to the end: <hi>She heard divers Psalms, and a
Chapter read, and repeated part, and sung part of a
Psalm her self. The last words that she spake were,</hi>
My God help me, Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>§. 9. God had been so many years training her up
under the expectations and preparations for death,
as made the case of her soul less grievous to me, as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59245:57"/>
no way doubting of her salvation; and knowing
that a distracting Feaver, or a Phrensie, or an Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or disturbance of the Animal Spirits, or
Brain, or an Impostume may befal the best as soon as
the worst. I thank God that she was never under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Melancholly, which tempted her to any of those
doleful evils, which many Score, I think, that have
been with me (of several ways of education) have
been sadly tempted to. She near 19. year lived with
me cheerful, wise, and a very useful life, in constant
Love, and Peace, and Concord, except our differing
Opinions about tri<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>al occurrences, or our disputing
or differing mode of talk.</p>
            <p>§ 10. She was buried on <hi>Iune</hi> 17. in <hi>Christs-Church,</hi>
in the Ruines, in her own Mothers Grave. The
Grave was the highest, next the old Altar, or Table
in the Chancel, on which this her Daughter had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a very fair, rich, large Marble-stone to be laid,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1661. about 20. years ago; on which I caused
to be written her Titles, and some Latin Verses, and
these English ones,
<q>
                  <l>Thus must thy flesh to silent dust descend,</l>
                  <l>Thy mirth and worldly pleasure thus will end:</l>
                  <l>Then happy holy souls, but wo to those</l>
                  <l>Who Heaven forgot, and earthly pleasures chose:</l>
                  <l>Hear now this Preaching Grave without delay,</l>
                  <l>Believe, repent, and work while it is day.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Christs-Church</hi> on earth is liable to those chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of which the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> above is in no danger.
In the doleful-flames of <hi>London,</hi> 1666. the fall of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59245:58"/>
the Church broke this great Marble all to pieces,
and it proved no lasting Monument; and I hope this
Paper-Monument, erected by one that is following,
even at the door, in some passion indeed of love,
and grief, but in sincerity of truth, will be more
publickly useful and durable than that Marble-stone
was.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. Some Vses proposed to the Reader from this History,
as the reasons why I wrote it.</head>
            <p>IF this Narrative be Useless to the Readers, it
must needs be the sin of the publisher; for
idle writing is worse than idle words: But I think it
useful (with that which followeth) to all these ends
to considering men.</p>
            <p>§. 1. It may help to convince those that are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Sadducism,</hi> or Infidelity, and believe not the
testimony of the sanctifying spirit to the truth of
the Word of God, but take holiness, as it differs from
Heathen-morality, to be but fancy, hypocrisie, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
or self-conceit: A man that never felt the
working of Gods special Grace on his own heart, is
hardly brought to believe that others have that which
he never had himself. And this turneth usually to
Diabolical malignity, inclining them to hate those,
and revile or dispise them as deluded proud Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
hypocrites, who pretend to be any better than
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59245:58"/>
they are, or to have that which they take to be but
a conceit: All their Religious thoughts they take for
the Dreams of crazed, or proud persons; and their
holy discourse, and Prayers, but for canting, or vain
babling. But acquaintance, if intimate with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons, might convince them of their mortal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
and true History methinks may do much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it.</p>
            <p>§. 2. I confess, with thanks to God, that having
these Forty years found that all our holiness and
comfort depends upon our certain perswasion of the
life of Retribution following, and that our certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this depends upon our certain belief of the
Holy Scriptures; and we being here in the dark, and
too apt to doubt of all that we see not, there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sensible, or experienced present certainties,
which have been a great succor to my Faith, to save
me from temptations to unbelief and doubting, and
confirm my assurance that the Scripture is Gods
Word.</p>
            <p>I. In that I undoubtedly by see and hear, that through
all the world there is just such a pravity in humane
nature, as the Scripture describeth for original sin;
which cannot be the state of mans integrity, when
his reason is much convinced of much of the duty
to God, man and himself, which he will not do,
and of most of the great sins which he will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake.</p>
            <p>II. I see the Scripture clearly verified in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the common enmity and War between the
Serpent's and the holy Seed; It is notorious through
the world, in all Ages and Countries, an enmity
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59245:59"/>
which no Relation, or Interest reconcileth.</p>
            <p>III. I feel and see the Scripture verified, which
describeth all the temptations of Satan, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
War within us between the spirit and the
flesh.</p>
            <p>IV. And I feel and see the Scripture fulfilled,
which promiseth a blessing on Gods Word, and his
Ordinances.</p>
            <p>V. And I feel and see the Scripture fulfilled,
which describeth the renewing work of the Holy
Ghost, and the spiritual difference of the sanctified
from all others. This is not only in my self, but in
others (O how many hundred holy persons have I
known) the witness of Christs Truth and Power;
and as <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s and <hi>Caleb</hi>'s bunch of Grapes, to assure
me of the land of Promise, and Gods Truth, which
I see fulfilled in them. Can I doubt of holiness when
I feel it, and see it in the effects?</p>
            <p>VI. Even as it perswadeth me the easilier to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there are Devils, when I see their very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and works, in Devils incarnate, and see what a
Kingdom he plainly ruleth in the world; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that there is a Hell when I see so much of Hell
on Earth.</p>
            <p>§. 3. It may teach us that the state of Godliness is
not to be judged of by the fears and sorrows in which
it usually begins: A mans life is not like his Infancy
at his birth. The fears and penitent sorrows which
foolish fleshly sinners fly from, do tend to everlasting
peace and joy: and perfect love will cast out all tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
fears, unless it be those of a timerous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
temper, which have more of sickness than of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59245:59"/>
sin, and will be laid aside with the body, which was
their cause. A life of peace and joy on earth <hi>may
succeed</hi> the tremblings of the new-born Convert;
but a life of full everlasting joy will certainly suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the perseverance, and victory of every believing
holy soul.</p>
            <p>§. 4. It may warn all to take heed of expecting
too much from so frail and bad a thing as man: My
dear Wife did look for more good in me, and more
help from me than she found, especially lately in my
weakness and decay. We are all like Pictures
that must not be looked on too near. They that
come near us find more faults and badness in us than
others at a distance know.</p>
            <p>§. 5. It should greatly warn us to take heed of
small beginnings; even a spark of affection, honest
in the kind, may kindle a flame not easily quenched.
How great a matter may a little fire kindle! almost
all sin beginneth in a seed or spark, which is very
hardly known to be a sin or danger.</p>
            <p>§. 6. Yea, it should warn all to keep all the <hi>thoughts,
affections</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> under a constant watch and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to God; and know first, whether God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them and allow them.</p>
            <p>§. 7. And this History may teach us, that though
God usually begin (as is said) our conversion in
<hi>fears</hi> and <hi>penitent sorrows,</hi> it is holy and heavenly
joy which it tendeth to, as more desirable; and we
should chiefly seek, and should labour to moderate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59245:60"/>
fear and sorrow, and not think we can never have
enough. It is too common an error with honest souls,
to think that a hard heart lieth most in want of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and tears, when as it lieth most in want of a
tractable compliance, and yielding to the commands
and will of God, and in an iron neck, and obstinate
disobedience to God; and to think that a new and
tender heart is principally a heart that can weep and
mourn, when it is chiefly a heart that easily receiveth
all the impressions of Gods commands, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and threats, and easily yieldeth to his known
will.</p>
            <p>§. 8. And this may greatly warn us to fear and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<hi>self-willedness:</hi> I mean a will of our own that
runs before the will of God, and is too much set on
any thing which God hath not promised, and knows
not how to bear a frustration or denial, but saith as
<hi>Rachel, Give it me, or I die.</hi> We must learn to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and not to lead, and to say, The will of the
Lord be done; not mine Lord, but thine; and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
estate to be content. There is no <hi>rest</hi> but in
<hi>Gods will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. Yet this tells us, that God dealeth better
with his weak servants than they deserve, and
turneth that oft times to their good, which they
deserved should have been their greatest suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <hi>This History (and my great experience)
saith, that</hi> there is a friend that sticketh closer than a
brother, Prov. 18. 24. <hi>and that it was Gods spirit
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59245:60"/>
that said,</hi> Prov. 27. 10. Thy own friend, and thy fathers
friend forsake not: neither go into thy brothers house
in the day of thy calamity; for better is a neighbour that
is near, than a brother that is far off.</p>
            <p>§. 11. This History tells us how great a mercy it
is to have a body meet to serve the soul, and how great
an affliction to have an unruly inclination from the
bodies temper; and what a tyrant excessive fear is,
and how great a blessing it is to have such a passion
as Faith can rule, and easily quiet.</p>
            <p>§. 12. It tells you also how manifold temptations
and afflictions Gods servants are liable to in this
life.</p>
            <p>§. 13. And it tells you, that our greatest good or
evil is nearest us. Next God, the best is in our souls,
and there is the worst; and next in our bodies, and
next in our nearest friends: And it may teach all to
expect their greatest sorrows from those, or that
which they most excessively love, and from whom
they have the highest expectations: Only God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be loved more than he deserveth. Sorrow begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in <hi>inordinate love,</hi> and joy in <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 14. And it tells us, that Gods service lieth more
in deeds than in words. My dear Wife was faulty
indeed in talking so little of Religion in company
(expect it were unresistibly to confute in few words
an opposer, or reviler of Religion). But her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lay in <hi>doing</hi> more than talk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59245:61"/>
§. 15. Yet her example tells us, that it is one of
Satan's wiles to draw us to one sin to avoid another;
and to make us think that nothing is a due that hath
great inconveniences, or which we can fore-see some
men will receive hurt from; and so to be unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by being righteous over-much, and leave much
undone for fear of doing it amiss; by which Rule
we should scarce ever do any thing that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
<hi>He that observeth the winds shall not sow, and
he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap, Eccles. 11.
4.</hi> I speak this on her (at last confessed) error of
omitting seasonable speech and duty to avoid hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
and ostentation (which my great friend, Judg
<hi>Hale,</hi> was just so guilty of, as I know, and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of his Life confess; He would make no great
shew of zeal in Religion, lest if he did any thing
amiss, Religion should be reproached for his sake).
Cardinal <hi>Ric<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lieu</hi> was wont to say (as is written of
him), that he hated no Counsellor more than those
that were alway saying, <hi>Let us do it better;</hi> by that
hindering the doing of much at all.</p>
            <p>§. 16. You see here, that suitableness in Religious
judgment and disposition preserveth faster love and
concord (as it did with us) than suitableness in Age,
Education and Wealth; but yet those should not be
imprudently neglected. Nothing causeth so near, and
fast, and comfortable an Union, as to be united in
one God, one Christ, one Spirit, one Faith, one
Church, one hope of Heavenly Glory; yet acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
unsuitableness should be avoided as far as may be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59245:61"/>
§. 17. There are some great men who know their
own names, who (as I have most credible informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
have, to greater than themselves, represented
me not only as covetous, but as mutable for my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>To whom I now give this satisfaction. 1. As to
Covetousness, my Vindication is a matter unfit for
the ears of the world, if Reverend mens backbitings
(the same that troubles our common peace) did not
make it partly necessary. Through Gods mercy, and
her prudent care, I lived in plenty, and so do still,
though not without being greatly beholden to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
friends; and I am not poorer than when I Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
but it is not by Marriage, nor by any thing
that was hers before.</p>
            <p>2. And as to my mutability. Whereas one of them
reports that I said to him, that <hi>I thought the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of Ministers had so great inconveniences, that
though necessity made it lawful, yet it was but lawful;</hi>
that is, <hi>to be avoided as far as lawfully we may. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
that I did say so to him; and I never changed
my judgment; yea, my Wife lived and died in the
same mind. And I here freely advise all Ministers that
have not some kind of necessity, to think of these few
reasons among many.</p>
            <p>1. The work of the sacred Ministry is enough to
take up the whole man, if he had the strength and
parts of many men. O how much is there to do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
with one ignorant, or scandalous, or sad
despairing soul? And who is sufficient for all that's
to be done to hundreds or thousands! In the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church every Congregation had many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59245:62"/>
but covetousness of Clergy and people will
now scarce allow two to very great Parishes. I did
not marry till I was silenced and ejected, and had no
flock or Pastoral Cure. Believe it, he that will have
a Wife, must spend much of his time in conference,
prayer, and other family-duties, with her. And if he
have children, O how much care, time and labour,
will they require! I know it, though I have none.
And he that hath servants, must spend time in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, and in other duties for them; besides the
time, and perhaps caring thoughts that all his Family
expences and affairs will require. And then it will
disquiet a man's mind to think that he must neglect
his Family or his Flock, and hath undertaken more
than he can do. My conscience hath forced me many
times to omit secret prayer with my Wife when she
desired it, for want of time, not daring to omit far
greater work.</p>
            <p>2. And a Minister can scarce look to win much on
his Flock, if he be not able to oblige them by gifts
of charity and liberality. And a married man hath
seldom any thing to spare, especially if he have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that must be provided for, all will seem too
little for them. Or if he have none, House-keeping
is chargeable, when a single man may have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at easie rates; and most women are weak, and
apt to live in fear of want, if not in covetousness;
and have many wants real or fancied of their own to
be supplied.</p>
            <p>3. In a word, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own words are plain to
others, but concern Ministers much more than other
men, 1 Cor. 7. 7, &amp;c. <hi>I would that all men were as I
my self— It is good for them they abide even as I—
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59245:62"/>
28. Such shall have trouble in the flesh. 32. I would have
you without carefulness. He that is unmarried, careth
for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please
the Lord: but he that is married, careth for the things
of the world, how he may please his wife.</hi> This is true.
And believe it, both caring for the things of the
world, and caring to please one another, are busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and troublesome businesses; care for house-rent,
for children, for servants wages, for food and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>but above all for debts,</hi> are very troublesome
things; and if cares choak the word in hearers, they
will be very unfit for the mind of a Student, and a
man that should still dwell on holy things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the pleasing of a Wife is usually no easie task:</hi>
There is an unsuitableness in the best, and wisest, and
likest. Faces are not so unlike as the apprehensions
of the mind. They that agree in Religion, in Love
and Interest, yet may have daily different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
about occasional occurrences, persons, things,
words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That will seem the best way to one
that seems worst to the other. And passions are apt
to succeed, and serve these differences: Very good
people are very hard to be pleased: My own dear
Wife had high desires of my doing, and speaking
better than I did, but my badness made it hard to
me to do better. But this was my benefit; for it
was but to put me on to be better; as God himself
will be pleased: That it's hard to please God and
holy persons, is only our fault. But there are too
many that will not be pleased, unless you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to their sin, their pride, their wastfulness,
their superfluities and childish fancies, their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
and passions: and too many who have such
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59245:63"/>
passion, that it requireth greater skill to please them,
than almost any, the wisest can attain. And the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and displeasure of one that is so near you,
will be as Thorns or Nettles in your bed.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> concludeth, to be un-married is the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
that we may <hi>attend the Lord without distraction,
v.</hi> 35, 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what need we more than Christ's own
words,</hi> Mat. 19. 10, 11, 12. <hi>when they said then,</hi>
It is not good to marry; <hi>he answers,</hi> All men cannot
receive this saying, save they to whom it is given:
For there are some Eunuchs, who were so born from
their Mothers womb; and there are some Eunuchs
who were made Eunuchs by men; and there be Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
which have made themselves Eunuchs for the
Kingdom of Heavens sake: He that is able to receive
it, let him receive it.</p>
            <p>Oh how many sad and careful hours might many
a Minister have prevented? And how much more
good might he have done, if (being under no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity)
he had been sooner wise in this?</p>
            <p>§. 18. Another Use of this History is, to shew
men, that it is not God's or our Enemies afflicting
us in worldly losses or sufferings (especially when
we suffer for Righteousness sake) which is half so
painful, as our own inward Infirmities. A man's
Spirit can bear his Infirmities of outward Crosses;
but a wounded Spirit, who can bear! My poor Wife
made nothing of Prisons, Distrainings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and such Crosses; but her burden was
most inward, from her own Tenderness, and next
from those whom she over-loved. And for mine
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59245:63"/>
own part, all that ever either Enemies or Friends have
done against me, is but as a flea-biting to me, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the daily burden of a pained Body, and
the weakness of my Soul in Faith, Hope, Love,
and Heavenly Desires and Delights.</p>
            <p>§. 19. And here you may see, how necessary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
is, and to have a Mind fortified before-hand
against all sorts of Sufferings, that in our Patience
we may possess our Souls. And that the dearest
Friends must expect to find much in one another
that must be born with, and exercise our Patience:
We are all imperfect. It hath made me many a
time wonder at the Prelates, that can think it the
way to the Concord of Millions, to force them to
consent to all their Impositions, even of Words, and
Promises, and Ceremonies, and that in things where
Conscience must be most cautelous; whereas even
Husband and Wife, Master and Servants have almost
daily Differences in judging of their common Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>§. 20. And by this History you may see, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
cause we have to be over-serious about any
worldly matters, and to mind and do them with
too much intensness of Affection; and how necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it is to possess them as if we possest them not, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time is short, and the fashion of this world
passeth away. And how reasonable it is, that if
we love God, our selves, yea or our Friends, that
we should long to be with Christ, where they are
far more amiable than here, and where in the City
of God, the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> above, we shall delightfully
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59245:64"/>
dwell with them for ever: Whereas here we were
still sure to stay with them but a little while. And
had we here known Christ after the flesh, we should
so know him no more: Whereas <hi>believing</hi> that we
shall soon be with him, even those that never saw
him, may rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
Glory.</p>
            <p>§. 21. Lastly, Here you may see, that as God's
Servants have not their portion or good things in
this Life, so they may have the same Sicknesses and
manner of Death as others: <hi>Lazarus</hi> may lie and
die in his sores, among the Dogs at the door; when
<hi>Dives</hi> may have a pompous Life and Funeral. There
is no judging of a mans Sincerity, or of his future
state, by his Disease, or by his Diseased Death-bed
words: He that liveth to God, shall die safely into
the hand of God, though a Fever or Deliration
hinder him from knowing this, till Experience and
sudden possession of Heaven convince him. <hi>Blessed
are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth;
yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their
labours, and their works do follow them,</hi> Rev. 14. 13.
Therefore in our greatest straits and sufferings,
let us comfort one another with these words, <hi>That
we shall for ever be with the Lord.</hi> Had I been to
possess the company of my Friends in this Life on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
how short would out comfortable converse
have been! But now I shall live with them
in the Heavenly City of God for ever. And
they being there of the same mind with my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
God, and Saviour, will forgive all my Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
Neglects and Injuries, as God forgiveth them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59245:64"/>
and me. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away: And he hath taken away but that upon my
desert, which he had given me undeservedly near
Nineteen years. Blessed be the Name of the Lord.
I am waiting to be next: The door is open. Death
will quickly draw the Veil, and make us see how
near we were to God and one another, and did not
(sufficiently) know it. Farewel vain World, and
welcom true Everlasting Life.</p>
