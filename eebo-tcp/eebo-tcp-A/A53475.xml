            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD, of His Abundant Mercy, having Convinc'd
Me, how much Precious Time I had cast away
on Airy Verses; I Resolv'd to take a Final
Leave of That Sort of Poetry; And in some
Degree to Repair the Unhappiness and Fault,
of what was past, to Dedicate my Muse in the Future, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to Sacred Subjects.</p>
            <p>I was a while considering, How Those Intended Labours
of Mine, might be least unusefully bestow'd; and having,
with trouble, taken notice, with how little Reverence, and
Devotion, the Holy Days in our Churches Kalendar were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated,
I determin'd to Write POEMS on the chiefest of
Them.</p>
            <p>For I hoped, such Gross, and Sinful Stupidity, proceeded
chiefly, from Mens being Ignorant of the True History of the
Actions, or Martyrdoms, of those Blessed Persons; so little
of both being Recorded in the Sacred Word. And it seem'd
to Me no Irrational Belief, that if the Generality of the
People, were Instructed in the Truth, it might Inspire in
many of them, that Esteem, and Reverence, the want of
which, had so long been their Fault, and ought to be their
Shame.</p>
            <p>The Young, and the Vulgar, of both Sexes, being little
inclinable to attain to Information, by perusing Antient Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Histories, and Records: And the Writers of
<pb facs="tcp:60309:3"/>
both, too often, and too much Disagreeing, in their Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the same Actions, and Persons; and the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> also, having interwoven much Fiction with the
Truth, I Flatter'd my Self with a Belief, That by Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the History from the Fable, and by making a Short,
yet as True a Relation of the Former, as I could attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
Divers thereby might be inclin'd to Learn, what They
had been Ignorant of, and might be encouraged to preserve
in their Memories, such great Exemplars of Piety; whereby
if they did not Write after such Illustrious Copies, yet at
least they would Value, and Esteem them.</p>
            <p>The handling of these Subjects in Verse, and Rhime, I
was perswaded, would not be unpleasing to the less Studious,
(who are those who most need such Information) and since
in Poetry, there is a kind of Natural Musick, I imagined,
that all Those, whose Souls were not quite out of Tune,
might be affected with it.</p>
            <p>Besides; I found, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Many, who could hardly Repeat
one Verse of the Sacred Scripture, would yet say without
Book, intire Psalms; even in the Vnhappy Verses, and
Rhimes, of Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sternhold;</hi> which
seem'd to me a Demonstration, how highly the <hi>English Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
was affected to Poetry, on Holy Subjects.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Love to Verse, Peculiar to our Country, but
is in effect diffus'd, over the whole Civiliz'd World.</p>
            <p>The False Religion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was generally taught
in Verse; and the True Religion of the Primitive <hi>Jews,</hi> was
much of it Writ in Poetry; as the whole Books of <hi>Job;</hi>
and of the <hi>Psalms;</hi> besides lesser Sprinklings of it, in the
Songs of <hi>Moses;</hi> and in that of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barack &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More of <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> was gotten by Heart by the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> than of the <hi>Orations</hi> of <hi>Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi>
and <hi>Cicero;</hi> or of the <hi>Morals</hi> of <hi>Seneca;</hi> or
even of the Excellent <hi>Phedon</hi> of <hi>Plato;</hi> tho' most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
These, had been more worthy to have been so Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
up, than Those.</p>
            <p>But it seems to be the Inherent Prerogative of <hi>Verse,</hi>
above <hi>Prose,</hi> To be better Fancied; To be easier Learn'd by
Heart; and to be Longer Retain'd in the Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60309:3"/>I must acknowledge, when I had even Resolv'd upon
my Argument, I met with Two Disanimations, which were
likely to have made Me Elect another.</p>
            <p>The First was, That the Materials I was to be furnish'd
with, out of the Holy Scriptures, (for such I coveted
most) were so Few, except in what related to Our Blessed
Lord; and to St. <hi>John the Baptist;</hi> and to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and
to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and what further was to be known of those
Holy Persons, of whose Lives, and Deaths, I design'd to
Write in Epitomie; was not only, so copiously Deliver'd by
<hi>Church-Historians,</hi> and fill'd with so many Improbable
Relations, (to give it the softest Name I can) that to
Collect so much out of the Former, as seem'd pertinent, and
instructive; and to Winnow out of the Latter, so much of
the Wheat from the Chaff, as was requisite, appear'd to Me,
a Difficult Task to perform, tho' but Tolerably; Since indeed,
where I most desired to be supply'd, I was the Least, (th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'
what it wanted in <hi>Quantity,</hi> it had in <hi>Weight</hi>) and
where I least desired to be Furnished with Matter, I was
but too much. For most of all those Elder Histories seem'd
to Me, to be like a Mine, in which several Tuns of Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
must be digg'd through, to attain to One Pound of
Oar.</p>
            <p>The second was; I had Experimentally found, That no
Argument for Poetry, was so little Obliging to the Muse,
and Invention of the Writer, as Narrative is; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
the Fancy, which of all things Delights in Liberty.</p>
            <p>But at length I overcame these two Discouragements.</p>
            <p>The Last, by remembring, that I Writ, not for Applause
to my Self, but for the Instruction of Others.</p>
            <p>And the First, Hoping that by my Readers Charity, my
Faults might not be Vnpardonable, since this kind of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
was New to Me, and untrodden by any of my Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Quality: So that the Piety of My Design, might
in some Degree Apologize, for My Errors in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it.</p>
            <p>I have in the Margent, not only marked the Places of
the Word of God, to which in the <hi>POEMS</hi> I have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
but also, some of those Authors out of whom I
<pb facs="tcp:60309:4"/>
have taken My <hi>Narrative;</hi> That if they have been Faulty,
it might appear, I have not erred in My Own Intentions,
but by the Mis-information of Elder Times</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, it is not usual to handle any Controversies
in <hi>Verse,</hi> and <hi>Rhime;</hi> especially those in <hi>Divinity;</hi> and
therefore I must beg My <hi>Readers</hi> Pardon, if in some of the
Succeeding Pieces, I have presumed to walk in so unusual
a way; which I had not done, but that I esteem'd it a
Duty to My Own Religion, to Defend it against the Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
of the Romish, where-ever I believ'd I had a Fit
Rise to do it. And I suppos'd, since in the Present Times,
all seem so justly necessitated, to maintain the Truth of Our
Religion, it might not be unallowable for a Lay-Man, to
draw His <hi>Poetick Pen</hi> also, in the Defence of it: And
Possibly, the Few Arguments I have made use of by the By,
in that Important Dispute, may be read, and kept in the
Memory of Those, who any other way, would not have done
either.</p>
            <p>However, If any One of Our Church should be Offended
at it, I both desire, and hope, He will for the Causes Sake,
excuse the Effect.</p>

            <p>THe Reader will perhaps wonder that these <hi>POEMS</hi>
are placed in such an Order, as is, neither altogether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with that of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>VRCH CALENDER, nor with
that, which others have Observ'd. To Satisfy him in which
it hath beene thought Convenient to give this Following a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it.</p>
            <p>The Noble Author of these <hi>Poems</hi> had a respect to three
things, in the Publishing of them in that Order, they are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the World.</p>
            <p>First, He had a respect to the History of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Life, and Actions, and therefore esteem'd it requisite, to
place all the <hi>Poems</hi> on those Feastivalls, that did any way relate
thereunto, in such an Order, as that the whole History thereof,
might be carryed on, and Continued in one uninterrupted S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And therefore the Reader fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds, after the Dedication,
the First <hi>Poem</hi> to be, on the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> beginning there first, because that is the first account
wee have of our Saviours actuall Comming into the World
And then after that, On his Nativity, and Circumcision;
And then, as Occasionall Attendants on these, are added those
<hi>Poems</hi> on the Epiphany, Holy Innocents, and Purification.
Afterwards follow those, on his Passion, Resurrection, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and sending the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He had likewise a respect to the Eminency of
Certaine of the Saints, Whose Festivals are Celebrated in
the Christian Church. And therefore those, whom he E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd
most Eminent either for Suffering for, or Preaching
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60309:45"/>
of the Gospel, He thought fit to Place next. And upon this
account, after the Poem on Wnitsunday, Hee Order'd those
