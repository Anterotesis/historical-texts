         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Hope my two former Letters were ſafely delivered,
wherein I gave you notice of a purpoſe taken in
hand here, to make Notes upon the Bible; what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
you think fit to give in ſuch a work, I leave
to your owne piety to determine. Now I have ſome
other thoughts to impart unto you, which lye as a
burthen on my heart; nor can I be at reſt till I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
them in ſome bodies boſome; nor know I any more fit then
your ſelfe, to whom I may confide them, for I truſt that you will make
them harmleſſe to me, and as profitable as you can to the Publique,
according to the occaſions which God at this time doth put into your
hand, which may be of great conſequence hereafter if rightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
            <p>I am then very deſirous to let you know my thoughts concerning
the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe, which I heare is laid to heart amongſt you; whereat
as I am glad, ſo I will not ceaſe to pray that God would direct your
hearts to doe ſomething in it as it ought to be done. But to conceive
what may be done in it, and how that which may be done ought to
be done, ſo as we may be ſure that God will give a bleſſing to it, is a
thing whereof I am not a little ſollicitous, ſince I have heard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
both here and there, where you are tending towards ſome
reall undertakings for his Highneſſe: You know that the right ayme in
framing of Councels, is of very great, if not of greateſt importance:
For it is like the Axell tree, whereupon the meanes like a wheele, runne
about to carry it to an Iſſue: If this ayme be not as it ſhould be ſetled
in the minds of the Undertakers for the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe, I can have little
hopes of a bleſſing upon the enterpriſe, whatſoever it be; nor can I be
perſwaded, that fit meanes to help the cauſe will be made uſe of: and
would to God not onely they that are willing to undertake for the
Houſe Palatine; but that the Houſe it ſelfe, and the Counſellors which
are about it did not underſtand onely, but alſo affect truly the end,
which they ſhould have in proſecuting their owne Cauſe. The ſweet
natured Prince Elector is of very good capacity and judgement, and as
moſt young men, and of a ſanguine complexion, are flexible and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
led; ſo might he be brought into better apprehenſions of matters,
then as yet he ſeemeth to have, if the Counſellors that are about him,
were ſo ſenſible of the beſt things belonging to the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54189:3"/>
Men in that place ſhould be: but that they are not truly ſenſible of
their true ayme, it appeareth to me in ſome things, at which I can but
grieve. I ſpeake this with due reſpect unto them, and in love to the
Cauſe, which they do manage about his Highneſſe. And I pray unto
God heartily that in ſuing for the meanes of their Reſtitution, they
may walke more entirely with God, (<hi>and in all his wayes, then they have
done many of them hitherto;</hi>) that they may be fit to looke up directly
unto him, and not ſo much unto the arme of fleſh, as States men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
do; and that they may be able to underſtand the Counſel of God
towards their Maſter, whom he hath honoured to ſuffer hatred and
perſecution for his own Cauſe: Which cauſe I feare is little regarded
by moſt of them, and till they, as well as the Prince himſelfe, be truly
ſenſible of it, I have little hope of any good iſſue in all their Enterpriſes,
which no doubt have beene hitherto miſcarried, for want of Gods
bleſſing upon the undertakings; and Gods bleſſing hath been wanting,
becauſe the true end, which he requireth in ſuch a cauſe, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Leſt therefore both they and you that are willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for them, ſhould make ſhipwracke upon the ſame rock, I thinke
my ſelfe bound in conſcience to give ſome warning to you, which I
will leave to your prudency to inſinuate to ſuch, as can make beſt uſe
thereof in time and place convenient.</p>
            <p>Now then to let you know, what the true aim is, which ſhould be laid
to heart in the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe, I muſt tell you, what I know to be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, and can make good, if need be, with infallible evidences,
concerning the Cauſe of the War in <hi>Germany.</hi> The true originall of this
War, is known to be the quarrell of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> which the P. <hi>Elector</hi>
took upon him. But this was not the firſt originall of the Warre, there
were other fore-going plots laid againſt the Freedome of the Proteſtant
Religion, and their Liberties in <hi>Germany;</hi> and eſpecially againſt the
greatneſſe of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Houſe, then matched with our Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which made that Houſe and the Proteſtant State, whereof it was the
Head, ſo formidable unto the Pope and his Conclave, that he with the
<hi>Auſtrians,</hi> took up a firm reſolution to ruine that Houſe, leſt by its means
Proteſtancy might be ſo upheld in <hi>Germany,</hi> as to weare out Popery.
And they had ſome cauſe to feare this, when they ſaw what encreaſe
Proteſtancy did make dayly, ſo long as matters were at quiet in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and what a Nurſe the Vniverſity of <hi>Heildelberg</hi> was unto it. This
jealouſie then was the true cauſe of the Quarrell, which had broken forth
elſewhere, if it had not been fired in <hi>Bohemia:</hi> For at the ſame time at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54189:3"/>
divers other parts in the Empire, a Quarrell was pickt againſt the free
uſe of the Proteſtant Religion, which was an intolerable eye-ſore unto
the Pope, and <hi>Auſtrian</hi> party. Thus then it is certain, the cauſe in their
contention originally, is the feare and hatred of our Religion, and no
doubt it was in the P. Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> a pious intention, to uphold the
Proteſtant Liberties in <hi>Germany,</hi> which were put at, and which being
loſt, the Religion it ſelfe would ſuffer thereby. By this firſt originall of
the Warre, we ſee the nature of the Cauſe; and from the nature of the
Cauſe, we muſt take the aime in undertaking it. For if it ſhould be
undertaken as it ought to be, it muſt be undertaken ſincerely for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to uphold the Proteſtant Cauſe in <hi>Germany;</hi> and then means anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to this aime, will be thought upon, and may be found out, if we
will but conſider what the Meanes are by which the Enemies of the
Cauſe have all this while prevailed againſt it; and what practiſes they
ſtill uſe to undermine and overthrow it wholly. For if we can take
away the advantages, which have made them hitherto prevaile, and
prevent their future deſignes, no doubt our undertakings will not bee
without effect.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain that hitherto their greateſt advantages have beene
herein, that as they were alwayes united amongſt themſelves, and ſtood
cloſe to one main purpoſe, which is the propagation of their Religion; ſo
they have been able alwayes hitherto by their practiſes and inſtruments
to divide Proteſtants, and diſtract their intentions, that they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
joyn in one purpoſe. Thus in <hi>Germany</hi> all their induſtry have beene
imployed ſtill to ſeparate the Counſels of one State and Prince from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which they were able to doe, by reaſon of their diſputes and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
one againſt another about matters of Religion; and out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
they have kept the thoughts and intentions of us in Great
<hi>Britain</hi> buſie another way, to divert us from giving aſſiſtance unto our
afflicted brethren, or taking their caſe to heart, til it be almoſt paſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
For verily, the Proteſtant Power in <hi>Germany</hi> is even gone, and
there is none either ſhut up or left any more within that Country; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have the greater hope for my part, that God will now repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
of his Servants, becauſe his cuſtome of old is, as the Prophet ſaith,
<hi>Eſay</hi> 30. 17, 18. when his people is, <hi>as the beacon on the top of a mountaine,
and an enſigne on an hill,</hi> therefore, and then chiefly to <hi>wait that he may bee
gracious unto them;</hi> and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have
mercy upon them. And this I hope he will doe in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anctifying good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
unto his Service, and ſhewing the true way which muſt bee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54189:4"/>
followed in maintaining his Cauſe, and preventing the plots of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
which they have laid for times to come: whereof the depth
I ſuppoſe is or may be fully diſcovered, if uſe can be made of that ſmall
treaſure of obſervations new and old, which I and ſome others have
made, and do make, whereof here I will give you a briefe abſtract.</p>
            <p>Since the Conqueſt of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the tranſaction with the King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and a little before the arrivall of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> into
<hi>Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> their main intentions have been diſcovered fully, and the
wayes of their plots, and the induſtry which they uſe in the ſame, can
eaſily be gathered, partly from their own Hiſtoricall relations concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſame, and partly from their actuall proceedings in all places,
uniformally upon the ſame grounds and principles, which men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and any thing verſed in affaires, cannot but take notice of. The
ſumme of all is this, that ſince they gained ſo much ground againſt the
Proteſtant Cauſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> that they thought their hopes might be
brought to ſome good perfection, there they have raiſed upon that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
ſome further Reſolutions determined in the Papall Conclave,
how to deale in time to come with all other Proteſtants, to bring them
back again to Rome; or elſe to divide them, and diſtract them more
and more amongſt themſelves, ſo that they ſhall eaſily become a prey to
Papiſts, as thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> are become. This Reſolution is to make
Propoſitions of Peace, and of Agreement betwixt Proteſtancy and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
How far this plot, and by what meanes it was advanced here in
Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and how God hath diſappointed it, I need not to relate:
And by the way of carrying things here, wiſe men can gather what
negotiations are a foot elſewhere alſo, whereof I can bear ſome witneſſe
in many particulars, if need were. But what danger there may be ſtill
here of reviving their plots, and how that danger may be hereafter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
I will leave to the wiſdome of both States to conſider, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord in mercy to direct them therein to his glory. And if theſe
notes that I am going to ſet down can doe any good to that effect; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
farther particulars, if they be required, may be in this kinde made
known. It is certain then that in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Polonia,</hi> in the
Low-Countries, and elſewhere, the ſame myſtery of iniquity is a foot,
and with much induſtry and diligence advanced by Emiſſaries of all
ſorts towards Princes, States-men, and leading Divines. I will not
here name thoſe that are known unto me in all theſe parts, nor how far
things, and by what waies in ſeveral parts they are diverſly caried on to
the ſame ſcope, becauſe that is needleſſe at this time, a generall intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54189:4"/>
in one or two will ſuffice. It is manifeſtly known, what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
in <hi>France</hi> hath now this good many yeares been fomenting by
<hi>Monſieur de la Melitiere,</hi> and ſome others, concerning a tranſaction of
differences between Papiſts and Proteſtants; and now of late it break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth more then ever, by that which is done at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and ſome
other parts in <hi>France,</hi> where ſome chiefe Papiſts have made overtures
unto Proteſtants towards ſome agreement, upon plauſible generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
becauſe they ſeeme to be willing to yeeld unto Proteſtants in
ſome things of no ſmall moment, and chiefly becauſe they abſolve them
from the crimes of hereſie laid to their charge ordinarily by other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.
I am alſo credibly now of late informed from a very good hand,
That the Cardinall hath written to the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> in the name
of his King, to make an overture of ſuch a tranſaction; and I am in no
doubt but it may be ſo, for other circumſtances which I know; and you
may conjecture that the Cardinall would not lightly venture upon ſuch
a Propoſition without ſome preparatives, and hopes to effect ſomthing,
&amp;c. I know he may have ſome private ends in reconciling Proteſtants
with Papiſts in <hi>France;</hi> I know he is an enemy to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
and that he ſeems now to jarre with the Pope, for the maintaining of
the Priviledges of the King over the Eccleſiaſtick Perſons in <hi>France;</hi> but
all this doth not hinder any whit his concurrence in the maine plot of
the Conclave; but rather to emulate the forwardneſſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and
not to be behind in the Counſels of furthering the plot of Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any: he doth all this in ſubordination unto the Reſolution of the
Conclave, which of late hath fully been diſcovered to be this, towards
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Polonia</hi> chiefly, and conſequently towards all other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Churches in due time. The reſolution I ſay hath been diſcovered
by the negotiation of one <hi>Valerius Magnus,</hi> a Frier ſent forth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Conclave, to goe through <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Polonia</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and learn what the moſt common and important grievances are,
which give greateſt diſcontent unto all Proteſtants there, againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that when they ſhall be truly and diſtinctly known, a courſe may
be reſolved upon, how to yeeld unto ſome kinde of Reformation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>Salvo jure &amp; honore Pontificio,</hi> by ſome generall Councell, which the
Emperour ſhould call, with the conſent of the Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> that
ſo the common ſort might receive ſatisfaction. This Frier is now at this
inſtant ſtill in his negotiation, ſupported to that effect, with means and
aſſiſtants for correſpondency, by the Emperour, and the King of <hi>Polonia:</hi>
The diſcovery of this plot is come to my knowledge of late, and he was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54189:5"/>
moved by a Providence of God himſelfe, to lay it open to one, with
whom I have been heretofore acquainted, who in a Conference about
the grounds of our Religion, did ſo fully in the preſence of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict
him, and ſtopped his mouth, that he became troubled in conſcience,
and did not reſt till he had dealt more privately with the Divine who
had overcome him, to whom he in teſtimony of his ſincerity revealed
his whole plot; and by the procuration and intervention of great men
and friends, hath moved the foreſaid Divine to go along with him into
<hi>Polonia,</hi> and to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and as farre as <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee what can be effected
in this Negotiation, and further this pretended tranſaction. Much more
could be related of this ſubject, but this is enough to make their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
fully known, which no doubt is this, to make a generall kinde of
politick tranſaction of differences in Religion, by the power of Civill
authority, with ſo many Proteſtant Princes as can privately or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
be gained thereunto, that if others who will not condeſcend to
ſuch an agreement, be moved for conſcience ſake to beare witneſſe
againſt it, they may be cruſht by Authority, and ſuppreſſed; and when
the ſounder part of Proteſtants ſhall be thus taken out of the way, and
not able to peep, then his authority may be fully eſtabliſhed over thoſe
that ſhall re-unite unto him without contradiction.</p>
            <p>Thus the Pope dealt at firſt with the <hi>Huſſites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for after a
long Warre, wherein the Bohemians had wearied all their Neighbours,
he ſaw that by violence they could not be brought to a conſtant and
voluntary yeelding unto him, therefore he propoſed Conditions of
agreements unto the greateſt part of them, which was leſſe ſound, by
yeelding unto them foure or five Articles for the redreſſe of ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;
and when the ſounder part would not acquieſce, they were
quite oppreſſed and diſſipated; nor did they ever, after that <hi>Thabours</hi> was
once taken, recover ſtrength or become conſiderable till the dayes of
<hi>Luther,</hi> and theſe later times, wherein again they were the firſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
The ſame purpoſe is now manifeſtly in hand to deale with all
Proteſtant Churches, but chiefly with thoſe in <hi>Germany</hi> in like manner;
that if the <hi>Auſtrio-Bavarian</hi> faction in <hi>Germany</hi> can either by faire or
foule means bring any conſiderable party of the Proteſtant Church
any where, but chiefly within <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelfe, to yeeld unto the plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Conditions which may be propoſed for the redreſſe of common grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
then they have fully obtained their purpoſe, and will not fail
to deal there ſo with the remnant of Proteſtants, as was done with the
remnant of <hi>Huſſites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> And what courſe the Emperour takes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54189:5"/>
in <hi>Germany,</hi> the ſame will be followed in <hi>Polonia</hi> and in <hi>France;</hi> ſo that
except God diſappoint this plot by a wonderfull providence, as he uſed
to worke in all his wayes, there is no poſſibility in humane appearance,
and by humane wayes to avoid the effect of it, which will be the ſetting
up againe of popery in all places where once it hath had footing.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what advantages the Adverſaries of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe
have had hitherto againſt it, and what their plot and practiſe is to
bring their Enterpriſe to perfection. I know that God uſeth to laugh
the wiſdome of this world to ſcorne, and taketh the crafty in their own
deviſes, and that as heretofore alwaies from the beginning of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
and now of late alſo in the diſcovery of Antichriſtianity, he hath
had the better of his Adverſaries, even there and then, where and when
they thought themſelves to be ſtrongeſt. So he will ſtill to the end be
at laſt victorious in his owne Cauſe yet, although I know I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
perſwaded that God will doe ſo, yet I ſay we ought not to be
negligent in doing our duty: but taking the moſt likely courſe, wee
ought according to our ability help him againſt the mighty, leaving
the events of our endeavours to his providence. Who knoweth but that
the time may be now come, wherein the Lord will riſe &amp; work for his
owne names ſake? nor is it unlikely to be ſo, if we conſider the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of propheſies, and particularly that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. that when
the adverſary ſhall have accompliſhed to ſcatter the power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
people, that then their ſufferings ſhall be at an end: now verily their
power is wholly ſcattered and divided, and there is no conſiderable
force either in or out of Germany, that is able to riſe up for Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
againſt Papacy; and therefore I hope it is Gods time to worke now
in his owne way, and not according to humane appearance? And this
very conſideration maketh me the more earneſt towards you that
ſeeme willing to take his Cauſe in hand: leſt in going about it his way
ſhould not be followed, without which nothing can proſper in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi>
affaires. Now I conceive his way to be not a way of great
ſtrength and force, but a way of ſpirituall Wiſdome and integrity, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to advance the Kingdome of his Son, in managing the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
of his Church. If then all the outward undertakings whatſoever
they may be, goe not along with God in his way, and are not made
ſubordinate unto this end; they will be in vaine and prove but a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſcattering of the forces of Proteſtancy. And how they may be ſet in
this way, in oppoſition to the way of thoſe that fight againſt Proteſtant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy, more by craft then by ſtrength, I will tell you my opinion, that you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54189:6"/>
may judge of it, and ſubmit it as you ſhall thinke fit to be judged of
by others, that are wellwillers to the Cauſe; It is then briefly this.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I thinke it neceſſary that both his Majeſty and the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
be made ſenſible of the dangerous conſequence of the Papall plot
againſt Proteſtancy.</p>
            <p>Then the Prince Elector ſhould be dealt withall ſeriouſly by ſome
grave, wiſe and godly man, to make him lay to heart the great honour
that God doth to him and to his Family in calling him to ſuffer for his
Cauſe, and to beare the reproaches of them that reproach the truth of
Chriſtianity, and the hatred of thoſe that hate the Goſpell of Chriſt,
which they perſecute in his perſon. To know truly what an honour
this is, would be a great ſtrengthening of his ſpirit; and then to know
alſo how he ought to behave himſelfe in all his wayes towards God in
bearing up this Cauſe, how that he ought not to ſeeke himſelfe in it,
but ſhould make the upholding of Proteſtancy, and not the regaining
of his Lands and Titles, his true inward ayme, and conſequently to doe
all in ſubordination to God, and not by humane wiſdome and policy,
&amp;c. If this could be truly (as I am perſwaded he is very capable of)
wrought upon him, then I would not deſpaire of a bleſſing upon that
which he may take in hand; He being thus wrought upon to make
God his counſell and ſtrength in all things to manage faithfully his
Cauſe; could have ſome other Counſellors adjoyned to him, beſides
thoſe which he now hath: Men of exemplary and entire lives, men
that ſhould ſtrengthen him in the true ayme of his Cauſe, to keepe it
unmoveable in his heart; men that are verſed in publique Treaties
about the cauſe, and experienced in State affaires, chiefely in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Princes Courts; ſuch a one is <hi>N. N.</hi> without whoſe judgement
and experience, I conceive his buſineſſe can hardly be well contrived
in reſpect of Germany, and I could wiſh that he were maintained to be
perpetually about him, for he is a very religious and knowing man, and
of ſingular uſe in this worke, for the contrivance of the counſels therof
toward forraine States; and beſides him, one or two States men more
could be named. But I leave this and will come to the undertaking of
the Worke; not of the outward military ſupply which may be ſent for
him, but of the ſpirituall part of the worke which ſhould tend to uphold
Proteſtancy againſt Popery, not onely in Germany, but every where
elſe: I conceive then that ſuch as undertake to reſtore the Houſe Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
in Germany, ſhould make the quarrell not in pretence, but in
truth (as indeed it is) a matter of Religion, and ſo ſhould reſolve to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54189:6"/>
handle the Cauſe in a religious way, as well as by force. The cauſe then
of maintaining the Religion and Liberties of Proteſtants in <hi>Germany,</hi>
ought to be made a publique buſineſſe; and in all Treaties with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
States, and deliberations about forraine Affaires, it ought to
come into conſideration; and all Ambaſſadours towards other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
ſhould be inſtructed to deale with them for a concurrence in it,
and in effect become like unto the advice of <hi>Cato</hi> for the deſtroying of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> an appendix to every counſell given in the Senate.</p>
            <p>If the Cauſe of Religion ſhould be made a publique buſineſſe, then
publique wayes and meanes muſt be uſed to advance Proteſtancy, ſo
as a matter of Religion ought to be advanced, that is, without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and by reſpects or private ends and affections, by taking Proteſtancy
in the true notion thereof, as it ſtands in its principles oppoſite to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and to advance it thus taken; two kindes of meanes ſhould be
ſet aworke, the one ſhould ſerve to make knowne unto the world what
true Proteſtancy is, the other ſhould ſerve to oppoſe the wayes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
in undermining it; I will name onely the heads of theſe meanes
as now they lye in my conception; To make true Proteſtancy known
unto the world, thoughts muſt be had, how to make the tenour of their
Common Faith, and the Rules of their practiſe in their publike and
private profeſſion of the Goſpell, better evident unto the world then
hitherto they have been.</p>
            <p>For the tenour of their common Faith, it may be evident two
wayes; Firſt, if the harmony of Confeſſions be reprinted (for it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of print) and in ſome things enlarged and compleated. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if a courſe could be taken to make Scripturall knowledge more
common to all in the plaine and evident truths thereof, and leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
in diſputes, and ſubject to various interpretations amongſt the
learned. The firſt may be done by uſing meanes to make the literall
ſenſe of the Text and the cleare doctrins thereof, plaine for the vulgar
uſe, and fit for the ordinary reading of all men, by the printing of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
with Notes, and briefe Explications, wherein all Proteſtants
ſhould agree and conſent of the meaning of the Text. The ſecond may
be done by ſome common Rules and Methods of Interpretation of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
doubtfull, whereupon the godly learned could be moved to agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves, that by common principles in the Analogie of
Faith, and by a way of Analyſing the Text, and drawing conſequences
therefrom (which ſhould be agreed upon by common conſent of the
Learned) they might be able to avoid private interpretations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54189:7"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54189:8"/>
doubts in Doctrine, which obſcure much the faith, and trouble
the weak profeſſors, and keep off doubting Papiſts from being fully
convicted.</p>
            <p>This would be a Means if it could be had, to inlarge very much the
knowledge of the Truth, and to confirm it without danger of diviſions;
it would alſo be a ground of reconciling different opinions, without all
danger of betraying Truth, or ſuppreſſing it, which is a thing ſo much
feared in the work of peace Eccleſiaſticall. Concerning the rules of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
common practice, in their publique and private walking accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Goſpel, they ought to be ſet forth as much to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Reformation of their religious walking, as to vindicate the
credit of their profeſſion againſt malicious aſperſions. Here then Means
ſhould be thought upon, how the Rules of their Publique Worſhip, in
their Eccleſiaſticall meetings, to hear the Word, to put forth prayers and
praiſes to God, and to partake of the holy Sacraments one with another,
ſhould be framed ſo as to take away the offences which ariſe amongſt
themſelves by reaſon of diverſity in theſe practiſes, and by conforming
their actions herein unto that which is expreſſed and preſcribed in the
Word, that they may ſhew themſelves true unto their own principles,
wherein they maintain againſt Popery, that Gods Worſhip ſhould be
truly ſpirituall according to his will, and not clogged and mixed with
humane inventions. And to bring this to paſſe, all their Eccleſiaſticall
Conſtitutions ſhould be compared one with another, and their funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
agreement amongſt themſelves, and with the expreſſe Rules in
the Word, ſhould be taken and diſtinguiſhed from the Circumſtantiall
matters, wherein the free and indifferent cuſtome of Nations, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to be uſed, make them differ one from another. This their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in ſubſtantiall, and difference in diaphorall practiſes, wherein eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Church hath its own liberty, might be publiſhed, as the Harmony of
Rules in publike Worſhip obſerved by Proteſtants in conformity to
Gods Ordinances, and what is over-plus as a clogge and mixture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
inſtitution in ſome Churches, means ſhould be thought upon how
that might by little and little, be antiquated and left off. And to effect
this, if ſome publike Treaties, and Synodicall meeting could be brought
about in due time amongſt them, it would be a great ſettlement unto
themſelves in the wayes of Truth, and a ſpeciall means to propagate it
unto others.</p>
            <p>As for the rules of their private walking, they ſhould be ſet forth and
deſcribed, in reſpect of common Family duties, and in reſpect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54189:8"/>
Callings and Charges belonging to all theſe, that are Members
of the Church and Common-wealth. Here then ſhould be a ſubſtantiall
deſcription of the right ordering of Chriſtian Families, to make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
how Proteſtants, ſome do ſtudy, and all ſhould ſtudy to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in their private houſhold ſocieties. And in like manner other
materiall deſcriptions of the ſeverall duties of Eccleſiaſticall and Civill
charges, how they are, or ought to be diſcharged conſcionably in the
preſence of God, ſhould be put forth, to informe all of the integrity of
their waies and intentions. Here then the duties belonging to the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Charge, and to the Doctorall Charge, and to the Helpets in the one
and other Charge, ſuch as are Elders and Deacons in the Church; and
School-maſters for the education of youths, ſhould be laid open. Alſo
the Charge of the Magiſtrate as he is Governour and Judge of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and the duty of the Subject as he is under Superiour powers; The
Charge of a Husband and Wife; The Charge of Parents and Children,
and of Maſters and Servants, ſhould all be diſtinctly deſcribed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in ſeverall briefe Treaties, and made common to all, that both
Proteſtants might ſee what they ſhould do according to their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of profeſſion, and others might be informed of their walking, who
traduce them for licenciouſneſſe, and blame their Religion, as if it were
the high way to diſſolve all Government, and to caſt men looſe unto
all manner of rebellion and diſſolution.</p>
            <p>Such Treaties as theſe being briefly yet fully and ſubſtantially penned,
and then reviſed and approved by ſome Synods and Vniverſities, would
be of great uſe to make all Proteſtants be of one minde in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Chriſtianity before the world, and free them from many odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
impreſſions which evill Statiſts and Emiſſaries of the Pope beget in
the minds of Princes againſt them, whereby more hurt is done then we
are aware of. Therefore to elaborate theſe tasks, Men ſhould be ſet
apart, and being fitted for the common uſe of all men, they ſhould be
printed and diſperſed in ſeverall Languages to be ſeen by all, and the
Charges of Tranſlation and Printing ſhould be born by thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe; and his Counſellors for the good of this
Cauſe, ſhould ſet their minds awork how to bring theſe things to paſſe.
For herein doth their ſtrength conſiſt, againſt which all the power and
plots of the Enemies of Proteſtancy will never be able to prevail. For
ſuppoſe they ſhould effect what they intend, in calling a Councell in
<hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperours authority, to rectifie ſome generall grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
if Proteſtants have theſe Declarations and evidences to make the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54189:9"/>
tenor of their common Faith and Practiſe appear in a readineſſe, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to be judged by that Councell, what will their plot be able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
Will they not be taken in their own device, and made inſtruments
of confirming that Profeſſion which they intend to overthrow? I know
not what you will think of the poſſibility to effect all this, but I am ſure
you cannot deny but that all this may be done, and that without great
difficulty, or great delay, if the Proteſtant Cauſe were taken to heart as
it ought to be; and if ſome few Inſtruments were ſet apart to elaborate
ſuch tasks as theſe. But alas theſe things are not at all minded nor can
they gain any favour or countenance at any bodies hand, who is in place
of Eminency, except they can make a particular uſe of the undertaking
to ſubordinate the ſame unto ſome private aims of their own. Hence it
is that the ſolicitors of ſuch Works are lookt upon aloof, and ſuſpected as
dangerous Men by all ſides, or laught at in ſecret as men of odde and
ſingular conceits, that fancy unto themſelves Caſtles in the air, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
undertakings. Verily I confeſſe the undertakings are impoſſible,
not <hi>per ſe,</hi> but <hi>per accidens,</hi> by reaſon of the ſtupidity of mens ſpirits in
matters of a publike nature, and by reaſon of their great partiality which
doth blinde them in all other things, not ſerving to their private ends
and wayes. Nor do moſt men that I meet withall, minde any thing but
what is immediately of uſe for their own preſent turns; and becauſe my
thoughts cannot run that way, I am become like a ſparrow on the houſe
top, and as an Owle among the reſt of the Birds of the Foreſt. For all
this while I have been knocking at a deaf mans door, intending to put
men in minde of theſe things, and ſeeking help to bring them to paſſe,
I have ſpent my time and ſtrength in vain. Now then I have diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my conſcience, and will ſet my mind at reſt from henceforth; and
this I count to be the fruit of my labours. This is the firſt kind of means
ſerving to eſtabliſh, to perfect, and to make known what true Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is in the world.</p>
            <p>The ſecond kind of Means doth ſerve to oppoſe Popery in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it doth ſtudy to divide and undermine the State of Proteſtants. To
this effect Means ſhould be thought upon, how to go croſſe unto them
in their proceedings againſt us. They labour and plot how to divide us
amongſt our ſelves, and to feed our diſputes in Religion and jealouſies
of States, and to bring every where ſome evill intelligence betwixt Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Subjects, and to make us of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to neglect all the
thoughts of our Brethren which may tend to their comfort: ſhould not
we then labour and plot to bring the quite contrary effects to paſſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54189:9"/>
namely, how to reconcile matters of diſputes in Religion, and to take
away jealouſies of States, and to bring good intelligences betwixt Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Subjects and to make us here in Great <hi>Britain</hi> to think upon the
State of our Brethren who ſuffer in, and for the ſame Faith which we
profeſſe? They have a Synagogue of Satan to tempt the Proteſtants to
defection, from whence they ſend forth ſwarms of Emiſſaries, as they
call it, <hi>ad propagandam fidem;</hi> but it is to creep into all Courts and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to corrupt mens minds, and to execute all miſchievous deſigns
againſt us; and we are ſo dull as to intend nothing, either for our own
preſervation or againſt them. Nor is the way thought upon, or inquired
after, how that any ſuch purpoſe might be effected. This then the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cauſe ſhould lay to heart, and ſeriouſly mind as a
Fundamentall Maxime of their State: That the Cauſes of diviſions
amongſt Proteſtant Churches and States muſt be remedied by ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
Negotiation, whereof the preparatives being already made to
their hand, rather by a Providence of God, then by any mans inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and encouragement, they will be the leſſe excuſable if they make not
uſe of the ſame by taking notice of the Means which may be ſhewed
unto them, whereof I will not now ſpeak at large, only in a word let me
refer you unto the ſummary diſcourſe concerning the work of Peace Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,
how it may concur with the aim of a Civill Confederation
among Proteſtants, which is in print, &amp; was ſent unto you 6 or 7 weeks
ago. But if no ſuch publike Negotiation can be as yet intended, then a
more private, and yet no leſſe effectuall way might be uſed, by ſetting
afoot a Theologicall Correſpondency with Divines already ingaged in
the Work of Reconcilement. The maner and Method of entertaining this
Correſpondency, and the Vſefulneſſe of it might eaſily be ſhewed, if
there were any hope or appearance of obtaining any countenance, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,
or maintenance in undergoing it; for much muſt be done in it
by printed Letters and Tracts, which ſhould at once be made to flie
abroad to all places convenient, and yet not become common to every
one promiſcuouſly till matters ſhould be ſufficiently ripened in the
minds of Leading men on all ſides, who in due time ſhould be able to
ſway others unto good Reſolutions: And although in this publique
Cauſe of maintaining Proteſtancy, nothing elſe ſhould be done, but
to keep afoot the Correſpondency which is begun already, that the
thoughts of thoſe that are everywhere raiſed, and ſet upon theſe Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
may be more and more confirmed and ripened; yet this alone
if it be effectually proſecuted may be able by the grace of God to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54189:10"/>
the Papall plot heretofore mentioned: Therefore whatſoever
elſe may be intended, if my counſell may be heard, I would not have
this omitted nor delayed, but His Majeſty ſhould be moved to ſettle
ſome donatives, and ſet them apart to maintain the Charges of this
correſpondency. Many things of this nature will be in his Majeſties
diſpoſing, if thoſe that are found guilty be puniſhed and deprived of the
gifts and priviledges which they injoyed without doing ſervice to the
publique therein.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee my deſire, and the care that doth trouble my minde
about this buſineſſe. Having thus diſcharged the burden of my thoughts
upon your wiſdome and diſcretion; I finde my ſpirit at reſt, becauſe I
make no doubt but God will addreſſe you to make ſome uſe of them,
where they may be moſt profitable to the good of the cauſe of Religion;
and I ſhall not fail to joyn my daily prayers with you and your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
that they may not be unfruitfull in this matter. Thus I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
