            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:46046:3"/>
and <hi>Royal Society,</hi> whereof You are a Worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) to take into Consideration the Work of <hi>Planting</hi> and <hi>Preserving</hi> all sorts of Trees; not onely of Forrest-trees for <hi>Building, Fuel,</hi> and other uses, but also of Fruit-trees, especially in Relation to (the most wholsome Drink) <hi>Cider</hi>; which hath (together with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Your undeserved Favours towards me) imboldned me to make this humble Address unto You, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating Your Favour and further Help in this good and profitable Work. And conceiving that I have so much Interest in Your Honours Favour, as to have liberty to make such Proposals unto You, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Profit of the Publique (not
<pb facs="tcp:46046:3"/>
doubting of Your good acceptance of them) I do humbly submit these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars to Consideration, which I judge to be material, if not necessary, as to many persons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That there be a Law made to enjoyne the Work, as we have in other Cases of far less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment then this; and according to the <hi>Example</hi> of other Nations in the same thing: For although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are Ingenious Persons, will not need such an Excitement, yet the Common vulgar People (which are the greatest part of the Nation) will do but little without it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there be <hi>Overseers or Officers</hi> appointed to look after the Work, from year to year, (without which, some Laws
<pb facs="tcp:46046:4"/>
will have but a feeble Execution) and these <hi>Overseers</hi> to have due Encouragement one way or other: This is no more then what is done in other Cases of far smaller ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage then this would be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there be <hi>Books Printed and Published</hi> for instruction in this business, which may have these Characters.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That they be of small <hi>Bulk</hi> and <hi>Price</hi>; Because <hi>great Volumns</hi> (as many are upon this Subject) are of too great a Price for mean Husbandmen to buy; as also take up more time to peruse then they can spare from other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Stile and Expressions be plaine, and
<pb facs="tcp:46046:4"/>
suited to the Vulgar</hi> (even to the Capacities of the meanest, for these (Generally) must be the Workmen and Labourers thereabout. Now, we know that many Pieces upon this Subject, are in <hi>Latine, French,</hi> and other <hi>Tongues</hi>; yea, and some that are in <hi>English</hi>; being the Works of some Learned and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Persons, (whose Faculties are raised by Study and Education, far above the reach of common <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities</hi>) their <hi>Expressions</hi> are answerable, and therefore not so <hi>profitable</hi> to the Vulgar, though Excellent in themselves, and very useful unto those that understand them: But when Men are spoken to, and taught in any <hi>Art</hi> in their own <hi>Language,</hi> (in their common
<pb facs="tcp:46046:5"/>
familiar stile) things are more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, and take the deeper Impression in their minds, and are better remembred.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>these Books for Instruction, be Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> according to what is tried and practised from <hi>year</hi> to <hi>year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many that have Written upon this Subject (especially some <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Authours</hi>) have been meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Contemplative men;</hi> and have presented us with little else but their <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:</hi> And though some things may be <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>useful,</hi> yet many are not so, which when they come to be tryed by the <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of Experience,</hi> fall off and deceive men, to their loss of <hi>Time,
<pb facs="tcp:46046:5"/>
Cost,</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> with <hi>discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi>; and discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> observes in his <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi>) to be but meer <hi>Puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive things:</hi> And hereunto he adds, <hi>That it were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (as that which would make Learning indeed solid and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) that Active or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental men, would, or could, become Writers:</hi> And the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Experience</hi> in things is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and repeated, from year to year, the more it is Confirmed, and so fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test to be <hi>Communicated</hi> and <hi>Practised.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, how that which is here done (in the ensuing work) answers to these things, I leave to others to
<pb facs="tcp:46046:6"/>
Iudge, not doubting but that You [Honoured Sir] will continue your <hi>Endeavours</hi> for the <hi>carrying</hi> on this good and profitable <hi>Work of Planting.</hi> A Work wherein not onely the most Learned <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> and <hi>Exquisite Indaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> into the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of Nature, may <hi>exercise</hi> his <hi>Judgment,</hi> and please his <hi>Mind;</hi> but also a work <hi>Pregnant</hi> with <hi>Profits,</hi> Real and Substantial to all <hi>people</hi> all their life long, from the <hi>Cradle</hi> to the <hi>Grave:</hi> A Work that (instead of <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>fruitless specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>) will fill the <hi>Belly</hi> and cloath the <hi>Back.</hi> A Work that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the <hi>Poor,</hi> and adorn the <hi>Rich:</hi> A Work that will <hi>Encrease</hi> the <hi>Kings Revenues,</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>

of all his <hi>Subjects:</hi> A Work <hi>Praised</hi> and <hi>Practised</hi> by the <hi>Greatest</hi> and most <hi>Eminent Persons</hi> in all <hi>Ages.</hi> In a word, It is a <hi>Royal Work,</hi> and worthy the most <hi>serious Considerations</hi> and <hi>Endeavours</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> whereby those Worthies may raise to themselves <hi>perpetual Honour,</hi> as being Instrumental to promote and carry on the same, to a greater and more <hi>general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>

            <p>We see likewise the Scripture calls it <hi>Husbandry: Noah</hi> is called an <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> when he Planted a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> Gen. 9.20. God (blessed for ever) is called an <hi>Husbandman,</hi> for that he Pruneth, Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ordereth his <hi>Mystical Vine-tree the Church,</hi> Joh. 15.1. So that I shall keep the phrase throughout the Work.</p>
            <p>I have seen (I suppose) the best Works, both of antient and late Writers upon this Subject, and have <hi>learned</hi> from them what I could, for the accomplishing of this Art, and have observed the practise and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of many from time to time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and have improved them to my own advantage.</p>
            <p>And likewise I have set my self to the <hi>Practise</hi> of this work about Thirty and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, endeavouring to find out things of use and profit, by <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that I might speak upon better and surer grounds, than some others who have written upon this Subject; for <hi>Experience</hi> guides, and informs <hi>Reason</hi> in many things in which (without <hi>Experience</hi>) it would often erre. Some who have taught this <hi>Art of Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> have been in it only <hi>Contemplative men,</hi> having little or no
<pb facs="tcp:46046:8"/>
               <hi>Experience</hi> in it; so that in many things they have erred, and that grosly, as shall appear in due place; See pag. 165, 166, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>The writings of speculative men upon active matter, (for the most part) seems to men of Experience to be but as dreams and dotage:</hi>

               <hi>Experience</hi> is called <hi>the Perfecter of Arts, and the most sure and best teacher in any Art: Contemplation</hi> and <hi>Action</hi> are the two legs whereon Arts run steedily and strongly, and the one without the other can but hop, or go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amely: They are the two <hi>Eyes</hi> wherewith men see Natures secrets clearly, but the one alone discerns but dimly. And hence it follows, that some who were only Contemplators of nature without experience, and would needs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to write, and give instructions touching the <hi>Practique part</hi> of <hi>Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> have in many things (as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Author sayes) presented us with
<pb facs="tcp:46046:9"/>
smoak, instead of the <hi>lucide flames of light:</hi> They have indeed shewed us a comly and beautiful body, Painted according to Art, but yet lifeless and without a spirit, and have offered us shells and husks instead of kernels.</p>
            <p>But now, <hi>speculation</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> are as Soul and Body united, which labouring together, work out both <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> many advantages to our selves and others. <hi>Experience</hi> (as a Philosopher says) is the <hi>Root of Art,</hi> and it may well be so called, from which springs a numerous multitude of new <hi>Experiments</hi>: for from one <hi>Root,</hi> or single <hi>Experiment,</hi> (though perhaps a poor and mean one in it self) if throughly weighed with reason and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may arise many rich and rare inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And its most true, which the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> sayes to this purpose: <hi>As through a small hole or cranny, a man may see great Objects; so through small and contemptible instances, men may see great Axioms, singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar secrets of nature.</hi> Men will labour hard, and a long time in some labours full of hazard and danger, and perhaps unjust too, and all for a <hi>little profit</hi>; but here, in this employment, men may with a <hi>little labour,</hi> in a <hi>short time,</hi> without <hi>hazard</hi> or <hi>danger,</hi> and that <hi>justly,</hi> obtain great and
<pb facs="tcp:46046:9"/>
many <hi>profits,</hi> and those with pleasures su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded.</p>
            <p>Works, and labours, which have in them but a vain and unprofitable pleasure, are approved but onely of some sensual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and such labours as have but onely <hi>Profit,</hi> and do not ease the Pains with some <hi>pleasantness</hi> in them, are yet harsh, and disliked of many, but such as yield both <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> are universally liked, and allowed of all, according to the Poet,
<q>Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit utile dulci.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Either of these is the better, because of the other joyned with it, when they run along hand in hand; the Profit is the more, because of the Pleasure; and the Pleasure is more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of the Profit.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, That men may obtain yearly, a plentiful Harvest of <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> I have endeavoured to remove whatsoever might hinder; and have laid down some Arguments of Encouragement to set upon, and prosecute the means to obtain them; discovering the best way I can find out, how they may be gotten with most speed, and kept with most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>If any man think the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb facs="tcp:46046:10"/>
Arguments</hi> (preceeding the work) to be needless, because generally men know, that Planting <hi>Fruit-trees</hi> is a very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work, none doubt it.</p>
            <p>I Answer; Some know it by <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> many others do not.</p>
            <p>And although men are <hi>convinced</hi> of the profitableness of the work, yet there is need of some quickning <hi>Motives</hi> to it, as to some persons; And I know none more prevalent than those taken from Profits and Pleasures, considered in so great and so many respects.</p>
            <p>Accept of what is made ready at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, which as it may be profitable to some in respect of Encouragements and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the practise of the Work, so also I desire it may be a means to stir up others to do something in the like kind for <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many good Wits exercised about Toys and Trifles: some men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow excessive <hi>Time, Cost,</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout meer shadows, empty speculations; and well deserve <hi>Martials Motto.</hi>

            <p>While they might in the mean time, by

the Study and Practise of this Art, (in searching out many hidden <hi>secrets of nature and experiments</hi>) much advantage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and many others, both in respect of <hi>Temporals</hi> and <hi>Spirituals.</hi> An Antient Authour sayes, <hi>Not he that knoweth many things, but he that knoweth things Fruitful is Wise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Art is a full Store house, out of which may be brought both Meat, Drink, and Money: It is a Rich <hi>Mine,</hi> without bounds or bottome, out of which we may dig <hi>profits</hi> and <hi>pleasures,</hi> great and many, and worthy the study and labour of the most Wise and Learned, and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Philosophers-stone,</hi> (virtually and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually (though not properly) for it turns, by the help of nature (though not Metals, yet) <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> yea, <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> into <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> in a short time.</p>
            <p>The good of this Imployment, both in the <hi>Theorique</hi> and <hi>Practique part,</hi> spreads it self <hi>over all places in the world, to all persons in the world, from the Cradle to the Grave, from the beginning of the world, to the end of it</hi>; so that no work can be more universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good than this.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, seeing there is so much profit and advantage to be received from
<pb facs="tcp:46046:11"/>
this imployment of <hi>Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> both in <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> respects, Let us set about it, and labour in it, either with body or mind, or both, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>publique profit</hi> (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our own advantages) may be promoted.</p>
            <p>The blessing of God go along with us, and give the increase in all our labours, and prosper the works of our hands.</p>

                     <hi>Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Glocester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, Kent,</hi> and many other parts in this Nation, can sufficiently evidence the <hi>Profits of Orchards and fruit-trees in the fields and hedges</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And those good <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths-men,</hi> who have written of the <hi>Improvement of lands,</hi> have all agreed, that this is the <hi>highest way of improvement</hi> of any other.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Blith</hi> in his Book intituled, The <hi>Improver improved,</hi> hath asserted, That <hi>Planting Fruit trees</hi> at such a distance as they cannot reach, when they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained largest growth, they do advantage the Land, <hi>even in respect of Grasse,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the common prejudice against <hi>Fruit-trees in fields</hi> is, that they spoyle Grasse) so that some Land not being worth above 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, or 13<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. an <hi>Acre,</hi> the Grasse (<hi>by planting Fruit-trees</hi> regularly upon it) was afterwards worth 30<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, on 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, or 50<hi rend="sup">s</hi> an <hi>Acre.</hi> And the <hi>Fruits</hi> upon the Trees may yeild some 3<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, some 5<hi rend="sup">l</hi>

                  <p>And that in <hi>Kent, Essex, Surrey, Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi> and those parts, some Land that was not worth above 6 or 8<hi rend="sup">s</hi> the <hi>Acre,</hi> was by <hi>Nurseries of young Trees, planting and ordering of them,</hi> in certaine years
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46046:25"/>
brought to be worth 20l <hi>an Acre,</hi> and some 40 or more.</p>
                  <p>And further, he affirmeth, that some <hi>Orchards</hi> in those parts a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> worth to grase <hi>Forty, or fifty shillings,</hi>

                  <p>It may (perhaps) be objected: That Fruit-trees so planted make grasse (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and about them) sower, that it is not so pleasant, and good for Cattle, as some other, where no Trees are.</p>
                  <p>It is Answered: Although it be not so pleasant altogether, as that where ther's no shade of trees, yet other advantages doe more then make amends. It's obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd that <hi>such Grasse is earlier in the spring</hi> then upon other grounds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and that such grounds beare <hi>more,</hi> when it is cut for hay, or if pastured it keeps <hi>more Cattle,</hi> then Lands of like quantity not so plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And besides, in a <hi>hot and dry summer,</hi> ther's grasse under, and about Trees, when its burnt up in other grounds.</p>
                  <p>My advice is therefore (all these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and advantages</hi> considered) that men set themselves diligently to this work of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46046:26"/>
                     <hi>Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> for improvement of their Lands and Estates. Not only, that they plant good <hi>Orchards and Gardens,</hi> but also that they <hi>Plant round about their fields, and in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>elds, and in their Corne, Pasture, &amp; hay grounds,</hi> (as in <hi>Kent</hi>) the fruit-trees at a large distance one from another, 20 or 30 yards asunder, and that they suffer no branches to spread, within two yards from the ground, that so they may be out of the reach of Cattle &amp; may not be troublesome to workmen <hi>in plowing, sowing, reaping,</hi> and other works.</p>
                  <p>If the Plants are faire straight ones, of <hi>two yards high,</hi> or thereabouts, &amp; senced about to preserve them from Cattle at the first, (with some stakes or the like) they will in a few years preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and will need but little labour about them afterwards as long as they live,</p>
                  <p>And hereby men may reape <hi>every yeare two harvests, (from one and the same piece of land)</hi> the one of <hi>Corne,</hi> the other of <hi>fruits of trees,</hi> and the latter (when trees are growne large) probably will be the greater.</p>
                  <p>And in this respect this way of <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lands,</hi> is much better then other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46046:26"/>
wayes of profit; because in getting <hi>Corne,</hi> or raising profits by any other wayes of improvement, men must of necessity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow much <hi>money, time, and paines</hi> about them every yeare, which eats up a great part of their profits, but in <hi>Planting fruit-trees,</hi> the worst is at first, after a few yeares they yield great profits, with little cost and labour. So that as was said <hi>fruit-trees in a few years with small cost and labour; will double and treble the value of Lands,</hi> and after many years, the advance of Profit will be <hi>manyfold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be <hi>Objected,</hi> That if all should plant,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> then such great profits could not be made, every man would have of his own.</p>
                  <p>I answer: that if all should plant fruit-trees that may conveniently plant; yet would there be multitudes every where to buy for all that.<note place="margin">Ans.</note> For consider, in a great <hi>Citty or Town,</hi> what a number of people there are, who have no Lands at all, not so much as a piece of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their house, and many others but very small quantities, these will be buyers of the husbandmans <hi>fruits,</hi> and the <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Wines</hi> that he makes of them.</p>
                  <p>And let us say what we will or can, ther's many that have Lands which they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46046:27"/>
might Plant, and improve to an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great value, who will yet be idle, and sloathfull, and object with Solomons sluggard <hi>ther's a Lyon in the may,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other that hinders: yet these men when they see fruits, will be as eager for them as any others, and therefore will be very good Chapmen to buy the Fruits of the diligent husbandman.</p>

                        <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Discouragements</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Planting; answered.</head>
                     <p>BEfore I enter upon the work it selfe, it will be convenient in the first place, to Answer some maine Objections, to remove discouragements about this work of Planting Fruit-trees, that have kept off many from this profitable imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and may still hinder them, unlesse remov'd. And then I will give some encouragements to it from <hi>Diuine, and Humane Arguments and Testimonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">1. Ob.</note>This is an Objection amongst many in the North parts: they say the Northern Countries are so cold, that Fruit-trees will not prosper nor beare fruits there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ans.</note>To this I Answer: That although it be true that the <hi>Northern Countries</hi> lye in a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46046:27"/>
more cold Climate then <hi>Worcestershire, Herefordshire</hi> and those Fruit Countries, yet I doubt not but that if they were as diligent in planting Fruit-trees in the North parts, as men are in these, they might have store of good fruits: so that some Cautions be observed <hi>in the nature of Trees.</hi> Its true: <hi>Cold Countries</hi> are not so fit for <hi>choice and tender fruits</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as warmer Climates; but there are diverse kinds of <hi>hardy fruits,</hi> both Apples, Pears Cherries, which yearely experience shewes endure cold, and come to perfection in cold springs, when many other kinds are spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Procure <hi>Grafts,</hi> or <hi>Young trees</hi> ready grafted of the best bearing kinds, such as are found by experience to beare well, even in cold springs. See pag. 53, 54, &amp;c. Let such kinds therefore be sought for and Planted. Those good husbands in those parts, who are diligent in Planting Fruit-trees, have Fruits answerable.</p>
                     <p>Others say,<note place="margin">2: Ob.</note> that if they should plant Fruit-trees, and bestow much labour and cost about them, when they come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and bearing fruits they should be robd of all, or most, and the Trees would be spoiled, and who would Plant to be so serv'd.</p>
                     <p>To this I Answer:<note place="margin">Ans.</note> That if there were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46046:28"/>
no remedy against this mischeife, it might indeed be a just discouragement: but this feare may be removed diverse waies.</p>
                     <p>And First: I advise, that having made a good fence about the Orchard, you keep therein a lusty Mastiffe or two; that will not be charmed in the night time, and the terrour of them will keep men from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing upon such an Occasion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly: some that have good Orc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hards watch their fruits. If a man keep 2, or 3, or more servants, they may watch in their turns, its no great matter, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider for what time only it is necessary, which is but from the time that fruits come to be worth getting, till they be ripe, and that's not long. And consider, it is in a pleasant season of the yeare, the paines and charge would be but little to the profit: we see men are vigilant &amp; diligent much more then this would require upon far lesse advantages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But there is a third means to keep Orchards from being rob'd, which I estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me best of any other, it is this: I would have every man (that hath land) to plant some Fruit-trees for himselfe, that so they may not be theeves to their neighbours: and let those that have much fruit spare a part to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that have but little, or none
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46046:28"/>
of their own, and be no niggards but liberall to their neighbours: And this bounty will bring a double blessing, first from God, to increase the fruits; secondly from men, not to diminish them.</p>
                     <p>But I heartily wish that such as make but a sport of robbing an Orchard,<note place="margin">See the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of his Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Chap. 4.</note> would but consider the affliction and terrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that seised upon good <hi>St. Austen,</hi> for this very sin of robbing an Orchard, which he was guilty of before his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version: he confesseth it with much greife, and aggravates it with no lesse then ten circumstances, crying earnestly for mercy and pardon: <hi>Ecce Cor meum Deus meus, ecce Cor meum, quod miseratus es in imo abyssi. &amp;c.</hi> When God lets loose the least sin to fight against a man, and but to shew it selfe in its proper shape, it will terrifie the stoutest heart: <hi>A wounded spirit who can beare?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is another <hi>Objection</hi> greater then the former:<note place="margin">3. Ob.</note> Men usually say, should we plant Fruit-trees it would be so long ere they come to perfection, and bearing fruits, that out hopes would faint before we could see profit of our labours, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they would not beare fruits of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, or Twenty yeares growth.</p>
                     <p>I Answer first,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> that though the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46046:29"/>
on were true, that trees Planted would be long ere they come to bearing fruits, perhaps 20 yeares or more, yet this should not discourage us; especially such as may have good hopes to enjoy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleasures of them many yeares after, and then leave them to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and to posterity after them. But secondly, men are generally mistaken upon this Accompt, Fruit-trees rightly ordered, will not be so long ere they beare fruits as they suppose: I shall shew a way, that by Planting Fruit trees, and ordering of them as I give directions (by the blessing of a divine hand that still at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends honest labours) we may receive <hi>Profits</hi> from them in halfe <hi>Twenty years</hi> yea in <hi>halfe that halfe,</hi> yea in lesse then in <hi>five yeares</hi>: sometimes the <hi>third,</hi> sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it, though we must know, the fruit cannot be much, while the trees are so small, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>So then; that Fruit-trees may be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and come to bearing fruits in 5, 4, <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>years,</hi> or sooner, the meanes is shew'd a large in the ensuing worke. So that <hi>I</hi> hope

                     </p>
                     <p>And secondly, as <hi>gifts and good turnes,</hi> gaine a <hi>good name,</hi> so also to be conversant and imployed about works for the <hi>Publick and general profit of a Commonweal</hi>: such works produce the same effect.</p>
                     <p>We know all labours and imployments, that bring both <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved &amp; praised of all, though the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage be but to a <hi>private family,</hi> how <hi>much</hi> more when they are for a <hi>Commonweal?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And besides this <hi>Moral consideration,</hi> God
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46046:54"/>
hath promised the great blessing of a <hi>good name</hi> to them that are conversant in good imployments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same.</hi> Rom 2.10. <hi>Glory, honour, and peace, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that worketh good, upon the Jew first, and also on the Gentile.</hi>

                     <p>I shall set down all these things as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can, so that withal, I make them plain to the intelligent Reader, laying down the most material, and essential things concerning this Art: For long and tedious discourses (about things that may be comprehended in few words, (as many use) they do often mislead men, so as it is not easie to see the most material things concerning their subject, or what they drive at; whereas, a brief and plain disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them may better be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and remembred.</p>

                     <p>This I account the best way of <hi>Grafting</hi> for divers Reasons:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ecause in this way of <hi>Grafting</hi> we may make use of the <hi>Stocks</hi> divers <hi>years</hi> before they will be ready to graft in the Cleft: by this way of Grafting, the trees
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46046:68"/>
will be ready to bear, before they will be ready to graft the other way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, This kind of grafting is less hurt, both to the stock and graft; for cleaving the stock is danger, and hurt to it, being cloven (as it must) in the middle to the very heart: whereas in this way of grafting, it remains whole and entire, save onely a small part of the Barke taken off.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Graft, in Cleft-grafting, it must be cut on both sides, to the heart, and made thin, but <hi>in slicing or packing on,</hi> it must be cut onely on one side, and so less hurtf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l to the Graft.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, When stocks are cloven, if they be somewhat great, commonly the Rain and Aire gets into the cleft, and rots the middle of the stock, before the Graft can grow over to cover the head of it, which is not incident in this way of Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, This way of Grafting is much more easie to do, and more sure to take and grow, then grafting in the cleft, for the graft &amp; stock joyn more close and exactly, then can be in cleaving the stock.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As this way is easily done, and more sure, so also is it more speedily done, then any other kind of Grafting.</p>

                        </note>Secondly, There is another way of <hi>Grafting small stocks,</hi> such as are but just as big as the <hi>Grafts</hi> you mean to set on. And those <hi>Stocks</hi> are prepared thus: The top being cut off over against a smooth straight place, as before; the <hi>Bark</hi> of it must not onely be cut, but also the <hi>Wood,</hi> quite through to the back side of it at the top, directly like as the Graft is cut (as was said) in length as much as the cut part of the Graft; the manner of cutting the Graft for this, is the same with the former<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> then lay the cut part of the <hi>Graft,</hi> upon the cut part of the <hi>Stock,</hi> and let the top of the <hi>Stock</hi> (even the very bark of the outside) be directly under the shoulder of the <hi>Graft,</hi> that so the cut parts both of <hi>Graft</hi> and <hi>Stock,</hi> may joyn, and answer one another from the top to the bottome, and so bind and clay them as before</p>

and more to the advancement of the Art, then great Volumes upon the same <hi>Subject,</hi> when men (as many do) rove about upon unnecessary things, and strange fancies, without any solid grounds, beside the <hi>life</hi> of the business. If men miss the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and essentials of an Art,</hi> they discourse of it to little purpose.</p>
                     <p>So also in the practise: and therefore it has many times fallen out, that some men having laboured much, and spent much time and cost in <hi>Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> yet their labours have not succeeded well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there has been mistakes in <hi>some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi> and <hi>very material things</hi>; either the Trees have not grown well, or if prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and come to a large growth, yet they have not born Fruit well, or if growen; and born fruit, and store of fruit, yet if the fruit hath not been right good, and of the best, it hath been a great discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not onely to themselves, but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have seen it.</p>
                     <p>Now, among all <hi>Observations</hi> about this <hi>Art of Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> I know none of <hi>greater moment,</hi> or <hi>more essential</hi> to the profitable proceeding in it, then the <hi>choice of right kinds,</hi> and <hi>the joyning of Grafts, Buds, and Stocks fit for each other.</hi> I shall therefore mention some particulars of the

                        <hi>Twelve kinds of Fruit-trees,</hi> which I have made choice to speak of, and shew which I account most <hi>profitable, and best to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and increase, and how they fit seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral stocks</hi> when the <hi>Cyences are to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted, or buds Inoculated.</hi>

                           <hi>Of Apples Chuse the best bearing kinds.</hi>
                        </note> concerning <hi>Apples:</hi> In the choice of <hi>Apple-Grafts,</hi> we must consider not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>goodness of the Fruit,</hi> but also, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Trees be <hi>good bearing Trees natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>: whether such as have known them divers years, can say by experience, <hi>they bear well,</hi> but many look not after this so much, as what kind of fruit it is, <hi>in respect of goodness.</hi> And thence it comes to pass, that some men having store of faire, large Fruit-trees, they have but little fruit from them. Therefore let the <hi>generality of Fruit-trees</hi> (both in the <hi>Orchards</hi> and in the <hi>Fields</hi>) be of right <hi>kinds in respect of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as well as in respect of <hi>goodness of the fruit</hi>; and then for <hi>variety,</hi> there may be some of other kinds of good and choice fruits, though they bear but few and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>And for particular kinds of <hi>Apples,</hi> I commend the <hi>Sommer Pearmain,</hi> and the <hi>Winter Pearmain,</hi> not onely for special fruits, but also for <hi>good bearing kinds.</hi> So likewise the small spice <hi>Pippin, a good Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

                     <p>As for <hi>Stocks</hi> fit for <hi>Apple Grafts,</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Crab-trees</hi> better then sweeter <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-trees</hi> to graft on, because they are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally free from the <hi>Canker,</hi> and will become <hi>very large Trees,</hi> and will last longer then Stocks of sweeter <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> and will make fruits more strong, and hardy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Frosts, and cold <hi>weather</hi> in the <hi>spring</hi>: yet it is good to chuse stocks of some pleasant Apples, to graft some choice fruit upon; Because that the stock hath some small influence upon the fruits, to make them more delicate, if grafted upon a <hi>choice stock.</hi> Although notwithstanding the graft may be said to Governe, as is shew'd at large.</p>

                        </note>As for <hi>Pears,</hi> there are multitudes of kinds, as well as of <hi>Apples,</hi> some <hi>preferring</hi>

A late Author sayes, he is perswaded there are 400. or 500. <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of Pears.</hi> Now therefore, it is a point of wisdom to chuse <hi>Grafts</hi> from the best bearing <hi>kinds,</hi> although (it may be) not so delicate to eat as some others. I know none but they are very useful and profitable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Windsor Pear</hi> is accounted one of the best with us, some kinds bear not well, but some others do, therefore observe the former <hi>Rule.</hi> The <hi>Sommer Burgamet</hi> is a choice fruit, and the Trees bear well; so also the <hi>Winter Burgamet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for a constant bearing kind.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Winter Boncriten is an excellent fruit, so the sommer, but bears not so well as the winter kind.</hi>
                        </note> I know none better then the <hi>Catherine Pear,</hi> both the <hi>Russet</hi> and the <hi>Red</hi>; but they must be quickly spent, for they are no lasting fruits.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Greenfield Pear,</hi> is an excellent <hi>Pear,</hi> and <hi>a great bearer.</hi> There is a <hi>Pear</hi> they call a <hi>Choke-Pear,</hi> which is accounted a special kind for <hi>Perry,</hi> although the <hi>Pear</hi> to eat, is stark naught, and therefore men may adventure to plant the Trees in the <hi>fields and hedges,</hi> and need not fear stealing of the fruits. I advise (for that reason) to plant many of the Trees, on purpose
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46046:77"/>
to grind the fruits for <hi>Perry.</hi> Mr. <hi>Parkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> says, the <hi>Perry</hi> of these <hi>Pears,</hi> is scarce discerned from Wine, neither by <hi>tast</hi> nor <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> after it hath been kept certain <hi>months.</hi>

                     <p>The best kind of <hi>stocks</hi> to graft <hi>Pear-grafts</hi> upon, are such as come of the <hi>Seeds or Kernels of Pears.</hi> I know no difference among these, but all good to graft upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I utterly dislike grafting these Fruits upon <hi>White-thorne,</hi> or upon any kinde of <hi>stocks</hi> beside <hi>Pear-stocks.</hi> The fruits are naught (having a hard and stony core) if grafted upon a <hi>Thorne-tree.</hi>

                        </note>There are many kind of <hi>Cherries.</hi> The <hi>Flanders-cherry</hi> is most generally planted here in <hi>England,</hi> and is <hi>a great bearing fruit.</hi> Some of them (if planted against a <hi>south-wall</hi>) are almost as soon as the <hi>May-Cherry,</hi> they follow close after: The <hi>May-Cherries</hi> are tender, the Trees must be set in a warm place, upon some smooth <hi>south-wall,</hi> or <hi>morning sun,</hi> but the <hi>Flanders</hi> hear well in Orchards, and Fields at large.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>black Hart-Cherry,</hi> is a very special fruit, and a <hi>great bearing-fruit</hi>; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less exceeding proper to press for Wine, either to drink of it self, or to mix the juice with <hi>Cider</hi> to give it a <hi>colour,</hi> as <hi>Clarret-wine.</hi> It being of a deep red, &amp; a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it, will <hi>colour</hi> a <hi>gallon</hi> of <hi>Cider or
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46046:77"/>
white-wine.</hi> There is a <hi>Cherry</hi> we call the <hi>great bearing cherry,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Millen.</hi> It may very well be called the <hi>great bearer,</hi> for the Trees seldome fail of great store of fruits, although in a cold, and sharp spring. It is something a tart fruit, of a very deep red, almost blackish, when full ripe. The juice is very proper to colour <hi>Cider, Perry, White-wine,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>These kinds are not ripe so soon as they are red, as the Flanders are, but should grow 10 dayes, or a fortnight after, until they become a very deep red: These (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing somewhat late ere they be ripe) will hang upon the Trees until <hi>October,</hi> or after, especially if the Trees grow in the shade, and then they are rarities as much, or more then those in <hi>May</hi>: the <hi>White-cherry</hi> (the right kind) is a delicate fruit, there are many more kinds, I have above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty several kinds of <hi>Cherries</hi> in my <hi>Garden.</hi>

for <hi>Grafting,</hi> none take that way, and but few with <hi>Inoculating,</hi> which I conceive is the reason it is the dearest of all Plants with us. The <hi>Yellow and Green Nectrines,</hi> are much short of it in goodness.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>time</hi> for this work (in general) is in <hi>Autumne,</hi> when Trees have done grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that is divers weeks before the Leaves fall.

                     </p>
                     <p>It's a great advantage to remove <hi>plants betime,</hi>

Stay not therefore till the Leaves fall ere you remove, although they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd then with good success, but it is not so good at that time as before.</p>
                     <p>The ancient proverb is, <hi>If a growing Tree would have, Let him carry his green Leaves to his grave.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>time of removing</hi> being come, and the place prepared for setting them again, then be careful in taking up the Plants, dig round about them, and take off the <hi>mould</hi> from their Roots, if it be a small plant, it may be drawn up easily, the mould being taken away; if it be great, and the Roots spread much, then they may be cut about half a yard from the body of the Plant, and the greater it is, the further off cut the Roots, and so draw it up: and break off all the leaves the first thing you do, if they be not then fallen off, for the Sun and Aire (by means of them) extract the sap of the branches.</p>

And having measured exactly the <hi>square plot,</hi> and the distance of the Trees, set a stake or pole in the place where every tree must stand, and dig the soile round about it, a foot deep, and three foot broad, then set

the four corners first, then fill up the <hi>square plot</hi>; on all the four sides with plants, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as before, and so go on to fill up all the other places in the Plot, exactly by the line, or by the eye, if there be four or five persons to assist in the work.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46046:93"/>
                        <hi>Cause,</hi> and therefore they returne again. So that it must be considered what the <hi>Cause of Mossiness is,</hi> sometimes it is <hi>caused</hi> by <hi>over coldness</hi> of the ground, as in <hi>wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and clay grounds,</hi> likewise by <hi>Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the soyle.</p>
                     <p>If it be <hi>Coldness</hi> through moysture, then use all means to lay it dryer, by trenching the ground: or if it be clay ground, then bring in some warmer soyles to mix with it, as <hi>Sand, Ashes, Sheeps-dung, Pigeons, or Hens-dung,</hi> or the like: If the <hi>soyle</hi> be too <hi>barren,</hi> then help it by mixture of good <hi>soyles</hi> round about the Roots.</p>
                     <p>But withal, take away the <hi>Moss</hi> that is already upon the Trees, in this manner; after Raine, rub it off with a <hi>Hair-cloth</hi>; else scrape it off with a piece of hard <hi>wood</hi> in the form of a knife.</p>

                     <p>And in the <hi>Northerne cold Countries,</hi> God hath given them great store of <hi>Coles</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> for Fuel, which is not in so great plenty in <hi>hotter Countries</hi>: So also for <hi>Fruit-trees</hi>; some parts of <hi>Worcester-shire, Gloucester-shire, &amp;c.</hi> The ground does naturally bring forth <hi>Fruit-trees</hi>; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the labour and diligence of men in Planting) the soyle is naturally fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, cherish, &amp; increase all sorts of <hi>Apple-trees, Pear-trees, &amp;c.</hi> which bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bundance of Fruits, whereof to make this <hi>wholsome</hi> and <hi>best drink, Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry.</hi> And <hi>England</hi> affords the greatest store of <hi>Apples,</hi> and the best of any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; which is an Argument (I say) of the <hi>profitableness,</hi> and <hi>healthfulness of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,</hi> for the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of these <hi>Climates.</hi>

                     <p>Some great and Learned Authors have asserted very weak things, and altogether untrue. L. <hi>Bacon</hi> sayes concerning them, <hi>That the Writings of speculative men upon

                     <p>I shall divide the <hi>Errors</hi> in the <hi>Theorie (or contemplative part)</hi> of this Art, into three sorts.</p>
                     <p>The first sort are, <hi>Instructions hurtful and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> dangerous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second are, <hi>Instructions for effecting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of some things impossible to be done by the means prescribed: and others impossible to be effected by any means.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third sort are, <hi>Assigning wrong cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to Effects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the first.</p>
                     <p>A late Author, giving Instructions for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Grafting, says, <hi>Graft the next Spring after remove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This, I say, is a <hi>dangerous Instruction,</hi> because <hi>Stocks</hi> removed, have so great a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46046:108"/>
wound and repulse by removing only, that they cannot so well bear another so soon after so great, as <hi>Grafting</hi> would be, if in, the cleft: Therefore let stocks removed, grow a year or two before <hi>Grafting; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Experience</hi> is clear enough in this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Theophrastus</hi> giving instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Planting, sayes, <hi>Nullâ radiculorum parte detractâ, stultum est enim amittere ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices quas habemus, ut acquiramus novas.</hi> Take away none of the Roots, for it is a foolish thing to loose those Roots we have, that we may get new.</p>
                     <p>This is a <hi>hurtful and dangerous Instruction,</hi> for except some of the small strings, and roots be cut away, if there be many, and all the ends of the great ones, they will not put forth new <hi>Roots,</hi> as they will if cut: and multitude of <hi>Roots</hi> hinder the mould from closing on every side of every Root, as it ought to do, therefore some must be cut away, and the ends of all that are left; Experience proves this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Columella</hi> giving <hi>instructions for choice of Grafts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Columel. lib. de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botibus. cap. 29.</note> this is one, <hi>surculi sint bisulci.</hi> Let Grafts be double or forked. So <hi>Ruelius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a <hi>dangerous and hurtful instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> because <hi>forked, or double or treble
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46046:108"/>
Grafts,</hi> most of them die, and those that live, grow poorly, not a fift or sixt part (it may be) so much as <hi>single and short grafts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bapt. Port.</hi> giving <hi>Instructions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for choice of Grafts,</hi> says, we must take <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos pregnantes &amp; turgentes</hi>: Grafts full and swelling with Sap. <hi>This is a bad instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> for <hi>Grafts</hi> should be taken before they swell with Sap, for it is a repulse to Nature to cut them after sap stirs in them: neither will such take hold on the stock so soon as those which are indigent, and needy of sap: therefore let <hi>Grafts</hi> be cut from the Tree, <hi>before sap stir in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another says <hi>When Grafts put forth, take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> away the Clay, for Clay rather keeps moisture then drought, save a little in the hole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a <hi>hurtful Instruction</hi>; for sap will not cover the head of the stock, nor close up the clefts on both sides so soon without <hi>Clay,</hi> as with it: <hi>Clay</hi> is <hi>as</hi> a salve to a <hi>wound,</hi> which heals it up, and it rather keeps out moysture, then otherwise, if well closed; and also preserves from dry <hi>Winds, Sun,</hi> and other annoyances; therefore keep on the <hi>Clay</hi> a year or two, till the head of the Stock be covered, and the Cleft healed up.</p>
                     <p>Another says, <hi>When the Grafts have well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> put forth, underprop them, else wrap them
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46046:109"/>
one within another, and tye them with wood amongst, for fear winds break them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a very <hi>hurtful and dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> for all these wayes do fret, and gall the bark, and (it may be) breed the <hi>Canker</hi>: And besides, it hinders the young grafts that they cannot <hi>spread</hi> into an <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> form: this course brings a certaine mischief to prevent an uncertain: winds hurt but few, except they be very top-heavy; if so, then cut some of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches till they be grown stronger below, able to bear the Top.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Some Authors counsil us to cast <hi>glew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of Grafting, to glew together the two substances, or sprinkle Sugar, Cinamon, or sweet liquor, that the fruits may retain the taste.</hi> This is a <hi>hurtful instruction,</hi> because <hi>liquor</hi> (or any other substance) put <hi>between</hi> the <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>the graft,</hi> do hinder (if not spoyle) the joyning of <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>graft,</hi> but if this might be done without hurt, either to stock or graft, yet would it be no way effectual for the <hi>End</hi> proposed. Of this further, see pag. 84. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sap in Trees always moves upwards,</hi> and it is contrary to the Law and course of Nature for <hi>sap to descend: Natura nil agit frustra,</hi> Nature does nothing in vain. Now it were a vain work in Nature to cause <hi>sap
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46046:121"/>
to ascend up in the branches, to descend again to the Roots</hi>; the Roots send Sap to the Branches, and not the Branches to the Roots. When it once comes into the Branches, it is converted into <hi>Wood, Bark, Leaves, Fruits, &amp;c.</hi> Whence is all that great <hi>Bulk and Body</hi> which we see a Tree arise to in a few years; if <hi>Sap</hi> should <hi>descend</hi> one while, as it <hi>ascends</hi> another, it would follow, that as a Tree increaseth by <hi>ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sap,</hi> so it would <hi>descrease by its descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be more clear if we consider the <hi>cause</hi> why <hi>Sap in trees stirs and ascends,</hi> and also why it riseth not after such a time to make any growth. When the Sun in the Spring of the year by degrees drawes nearer to us, then <hi>Sap in Trees</hi> begins (by its heat and influence) to move, to swell, and open the Buds, and to cause the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to shoot forth, which increase by it all the Summer: and as the Sun (by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) draws nearer, and grows hotter, so the Sap (by degrees) increaseth, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth more plentifully, and when the Sun is nearest, then Trees are fullest of Sap.</p>
                     <p>Now observe, as by the vicinity and nearness of the Sun (which is by degrees) the <hi>sap</hi> is increased by degrees, so likewise by the Sunnes remoteness and absence,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46046:121"/>
(which is also by degrees) in his going back again; the <hi>Sap</hi> is also diminished by degrees, that is, <hi>ascending</hi> less and less in quantity, until the Sun be gone so far from us, and the heat and influence of it be so weak, that it works not to cause sap to rise up, whereby the branches may increase any longer, and then the Branches and Buds of Trees are all at a stand, and grow no more until the next Spring. And at that time the leaves loose their beauty, and fall off, because <hi>Sap riseth not up suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to feed them any longer,</hi> but onely so much as to preserve life in the Tree.</p>

                     <p>I would fain know (of those who hold <hi>descention of Sap</hi>) what should <hi>cause it to descend,</hi> for, <hi>Nullus effectus datur sine causa:</hi> there can be no <hi>effect</hi> without a <hi>cause</hi>; they cannot say that as <hi>heat causeth it to ascend,</hi> so <hi>cold causeth it to descend</hi>: Cold never <hi>causeth sap</hi> to stir, but to stand or move slowly. Cold is of a condensing nature, and does constipate, and fix rare &amp; fluid <hi>bodies</hi>; if cold should cause <hi>sap to descend,</hi> then as the cold increaseth, sap would <hi>descend more</hi> &amp; <hi>more</hi> in <hi>quantity</hi>; as on the contrary,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46046:122"/>
as heat increaseth in the <hi>Spring and Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> the sap in Trees also increaseth in quantity; and if so, what would become of the Trees? But if <hi>sap</hi> of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would descend, yet there is none in the Branches <hi>at that season of the year,</hi> that they can spare, but all that has <hi>ascended</hi> in the <hi>Sommer,</hi> is converted into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Tree,</hi> its <hi>Leaves,</hi> and <hi>Fruits.</hi>

                     <p>Concerning that Objection that is made against this, and brought as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that <hi>sap descends,</hi> viz. That if we disbarke a bough or branch when sap is up, an inch round about, and lay, and keep up mould about the disbarked place, there will be small <hi>Roots</hi> in the upper part of the place so disbarked, which (say they) are caused by the <hi>descension of Sap</hi> out of the bough to that part.</p>
                     <p>To this I Answer, That such Roots are not made by any <hi>descension of Sap,</hi> but by the <hi>ascension of Sap</hi>; for sap <hi>ascends</hi> up into such a bough, notwithstanding the disbarked part, through the <hi>pith</hi> and <hi>pores of the wood,</hi> though in smaller quantity then it would do if the bark were on. This is plain, because such a bough does grow and shoot forth, and bear fruit after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking, which could not be, but by the <hi>rising up of Sap.</hi> Now I say, sap in its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46046:122"/>
up, some part of it is pendulous about that place, and does somewhat <hi>hang</hi> or <hi>rest</hi> at the upper part of the disbarked place, in the very edge of the bark; having recourse to this <note n="(b)" place="margin">Sap has recourse to this part especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is wounded: as <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>humours</hi> in the body, flie to the part that is <hi>cut</hi> or <hi>hurt,</hi> to succour it, and so do abound there.

                     <head>Reasons for it.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. First, because <hi>Timber,</hi> and <hi>all sorts of Wood,</hi> hath been of late times very much wasted and destroyed: and unless men set to this work, succeeding Ages will very much want timber for building <hi>ships, houses,</hi> and other necessarie uses.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, by reason of the <hi>great waste of Wood,</hi> and no care to Plant more,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46046:143"/>
                        <hi>fuel</hi> is grown <hi>scarce</hi> and <hi>dear,</hi> especially in many places, so that the <hi>poorer sort of people</hi> make lamentable mone for want of <hi>fire</hi> in cold long <hi>Winters,</hi> whereas by diligent planting, there would be fuel enough for all people.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, except there be more <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> the <hi>Tanners trade</hi> (so necessary in the Commonweal) is like to fail very much: <hi>Bark</hi> is at a very great rate already, and grows yearly dearer, because scarce.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, By planting Trees in the <hi>Mounds,</hi> the fields would be much <hi>warmer</hi> in <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>cooler</hi> in <hi>Sommer</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>Cattle,</hi> and all <hi>commodities</hi> there, would prosper and come on the better.</p>

                     <p>It is true, that the seeds of some <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> brings forth very good fruit: the cause of this (I suppose) is, for that the stocks whereon these fruits were <hi>graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> or <hi>Inoculated,</hi> were <hi>good</hi> kinds of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, kinds that came good of seed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and if so, no marvel though the seeds bring forth good fruits without <hi>Grafting</hi> or <hi>Inoculating</hi>: and upon the Experience, <hi>Peach-stones</hi> have brought forth a paltry, naughty fruit many of them, though some good: As concerning the <hi>Grafting of an Apple Cions upon a Sallow, Poplar, Alder, Elme, or Horse-plum</hi>; it is in vain to try, for tryal hath been made upon stocks nearer in kind then these, and it would not come to perfection; they will grow a year or two, (it may be) and then decay and die.</p>

                        <hi>Crab-tree</hi> near the ground, with some good kind of <hi>Apple-graft,</hi> and the next year to graft that again a handful or two above where the first was grafted, and the next year to graft that second graft, and the fourth year to graft that third graft, a <hi>handful</hi> or <hi>two</hi> above where it was <hi>grafted,</hi> and thus every <hi>year</hi> to set <hi>graft upon graft</hi> for divers years together; this (probably) may make some alteration and commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the <hi>top branch</hi> and its fruit, although it be true, that every graft keeps its own nature, yet so as that it receives <hi>some small alteration</hi> from the <hi>stock</hi> (as hath been said) Now the Sap arising, and passing through so many kinds of stocks (as before) up into the top branches, this (if any thing) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive will have an influence into the fruit of the last graft, to cause some commixture (more or less) in the fruit; the sap passing through <hi>so many kinds of stocks.</hi>

year at least, let the <hi>mould</hi> be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more or less: lay about all their <hi>Roots,</hi> some <hi>good, fresh, black mould:</hi> And that we may have every year <hi>new, young Roots,</hi> and that the best kinds may be increased, the slips must be laid in <hi>Sommer,</hi> as I shall here shew how, though it be a common thing, and well known amongst many, yet for the sake of those that know it not, and desire it, I shall briefly speak of it.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of <hi>Iuly,</hi> (and for six or seven weaks afterwards) <hi>slips</hi> may be laid thus. Observe the <hi>fairest</hi> and <hi>biggest slips</hi> upon the Roots, and with a sharpe Knife, cut half way through the slip on the outside, near to the bottome, just from a joynt, and cut the slip upwards through the middle of it, about half an inch, (or little more) in length; then with a small hook stick fasten the cut part down into the mould, yet so as that the slip be not broken, or parted from the Root where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it grows: so do to the rest of the slips upon the same Root, or to as many as you please: having so done, then mould them all up with fresh mould, that is, cover all the cut parts on every side with mould, then water them, and press the mould close about them, and so let them rest.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, in a <hi>month,</hi> or <hi>five weeks,</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:46046:183"/>
these slips (so laid) will have taken Root, (especially if their mould have been wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered now and then) then they may be cut off from the old Root, and taken up, and so set again in <hi>fresh, good mould,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the Garden plat for that purpose: Or else they may be let alone until the <hi>Spring after,</hi> and then set: These <hi>young vigorous Roots,</hi> set in good mould, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred (now, and then) with <hi>fat water,</hi> will have large flowers: especially if in <hi>Iune</hi> we break off most of their buds, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only some few, six, or eight, or tenne <hi>flowers</hi> upon a Root, these the Root will easily maintain, and each of them will have the more nourishment, then when they are suffered to spindle up as many as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will; such must needs be <hi>smaller flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> the root being overburdened.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Clove-gllly-flower,</hi> is of all other, the best for use; it is well known how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they are to make <hi>Syrups,</hi> which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Cordial</hi>: they are good for <hi>Sallets</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Sugar, to use all the year long, and have the best smell of any other; therefore increase these as much as may be, not only of slips (for slips of these will grow without laying, better then of other kind of flowers) but lay many of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for more certainty, as is shew'd before.</p>

But now, as to the lower boughs, and side branches, there nature is at work, but in a remiss and weaker degree as to the increase of the branches; such grow but little, because the sap is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obstructed, and curbed by bowing the branches downwards, and so does at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the other work also, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Fruits.</hi>
