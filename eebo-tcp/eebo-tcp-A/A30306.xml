         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, I have received your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with the newes therein
incloſed, for which remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of me I thank you, I
cannot return you any from
theſe parts, being quiet:
I could wiſh England were as quiet, and
in ſo good a poſture of defence; but that
cannot be, ſo long as the Queen is ſo great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62098:3"/>
an enemy to it; for ſhe ſayes ſhe will bee
revenged, and told M. Strickland the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
from the Parliament, that there
ſhould never be quietneſſe in England ſo
long as liberty of conſcience was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Catholikes. Her Majeſty is
merry, and by no meanes would have the
King yeeld to the Parliament upon any
condition: ſhe is making ready to come
for England, and will bring with her great
ſtore of ammunition, money and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
We conceive her Majeſties departure
will not be too much lamented for.</p>
            <p>Colonell Goring hath been lately at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
with the King of France, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by Monſieur Montgomery to
his lodging, and after three dayes reſpit he
was ſent for and accompanied with divers
Lords and Gentlemen to the Kings Court,
and was bravely entertained, before whom
his Majeſty delivered a ſhort ſpeech, much
to this effect.</p>
            <q>Je à conſidere voſtre. Meſſuage à le requeſt de ma

Two weeks after the Colonell received
his Meſſage, with a Letter to the effect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>That his Majeſty, the King of France,
hath conſidered her royall intentions, and
the troubles and vexations of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
in England, for which in ſo juſt, ſo
honourable, and ſo good a cauſe, I have by
the advice of my Privy Councell given
conſent, that what forces may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
ſpared out of Flanders, Artoys,
Normandy and S. Malo, I have given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that they ſhall bee withdrawne from
their garriſons, leaving but a ſufficient
number of ſouldiers therein, to that end
the King hath ſent Letters to the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
and Commanders to deliver up
both Officers and Souldiers that can bee
well ſpared. As for Ammunition, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
Goring hath brought with him ten
thouſand mens armes, beſides all ſorts of
ammunition, and furniture, with ſaddles
for horſe, beſides 20. peeces of Ordnance:
as for money, the King cannot ſupply her
Majeſty for the preſent, in regard of his

The Prince of Conde at Durmount,

more for this time, I cannot certifie you for
