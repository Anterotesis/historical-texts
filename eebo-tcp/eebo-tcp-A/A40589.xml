         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A full and true Account of an English Vessel,
which was lately robbed by French Pyrates.</head>
            <p>SO prone are the generality of Mankind to Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that rather than not commit them, they
will do it on an Element which seems as unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
as incommodious for them to effect their
horrid Villanies upon. Who would imagine that men
who live in those fleeting Houses, called Ships, who
are daily subject to be destroy'd by every blast or Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane,
and every minute ride within three Inches of
their liquid Grave, should extract from the fear of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
so much leisure as serves them for the plotting
their wicked Designs? Who would conceit they could
have while to think on any thing but mortality? and
since they lye liable to so many Accidents, which they
have no security from, but that they may even the very
next minute tumble them into Eternity? I say upon
these Considerations who can imagine they should pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any thing but their latter Ends? or ought contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,
but their everlasting Happiness or Misery in the
World to come? and yet we hear there are every day as
many Outrages committed at Sea as Land: <hi>Pyrats</hi> on
the Ocean, like <hi>Pick-pockets</hi> near the Gallows, forfeit
their lives even in the sight of death; when every
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57544:3"/>
Rock with its craggy Brow seems to scold them into
Piety, and every Storm with majestick Eloquence to
drive them into the security of an honest life.</p>
            <p>Nor are we in Reason to blame that Monarchy or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to which these excursive Sea-Robbers owe
their Nativities, and consequently ought to do their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and subjection, any more than we would sensure
a wholsom Law or Constitution, because some incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
Malefactors will forfeit their lives in breaking it.
Though <hi>Maritine</hi> Laws are in all Nations very severe,
yet the main Ocean affords so large a Scene, that it is
impossible for any Magistrate, though never so inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
or circumspect, to behold every Action that is
done thereon. There is no Kingdom so vertuous but
there are some vicious in it, nor no Constitutions so
firm, as to constrain every one to Obedience; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since we see by daily Experience, That there is no
Nation free from Malefactors at Land, we may reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
imagine, none are clear from Pyrates at Sea; the
nice distinction betwixt a <hi>Pyrate</hi> and <hi>Thief,</hi> being so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that we may not altogether improperly term the
first a <hi>Sea-Thief,</hi> and the latter a <hi>Land-Pyrate,</hi> especially
since the Laws of Nations run as strict against the one
as the other.</p>
            <p>It being therefore granted, that every Country is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
too much to abound with these Caterpillers, I
hope I shall be thought free from all Reflections, when
I have related a Passage which lately happened. In the
Chanel betwixt <hi>Callis</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> where a small Pink of
ours then riding, ken'd at a distance a Sail which made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57544:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
swiftly up towards her, which caus'd our Sea-men
to make all the Sail they could before her,
hoping to gain some Port, or meet with some
Assistance before they could be overtaken: But
these hopes were altogether fruitless, for the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
which pursued them was so swift of sail, that
in five or six Leagues she overtook them; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
she had thrown off her Chain, and lockt them
fast together, presently boarded our little Pink,
who though not man'd for such an Assault made
some Resistance; in which Contest her Surgeon
was slain by an accidental blow from one of the
contrary Party, whom the <hi>English</hi> perceived by
this time to be <hi>French-men,</hi> by whom being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd
with number, they were forced to see
their Ship robbed without any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress.</p>
            <p>After these cruel Pyrates had carried off all
they thought valuable out of this little Pinck
they left her to the merciless Ocean; but she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all the sail she could towards the <hi>Downs,</hi>
made her Complaint to Sir <hi>Iohn Holms,</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
who was riding there at that time; and he
according to the usual Civility which he daily
dispences to all his injured Country-men; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forthwith the <hi>Castle Frigot</hi> and the <hi>Soldody,</hi>
to go a cruising for the aforesaid <hi>French</hi> Pyrates;
and not only so, but hearing that there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abroad, which used the same cruel, illegal,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57544:4"/>
and wicked employment, gave the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of those Ships Orders to bring in not only
any that were to be suspected for Pyrates, but any
Privateer belonging to the <hi>French.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it was their fortune to light upon two little
<hi>French</hi> Vessels, which they suspected to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the aforesaid Pyracy, or robbing the
<hi>English</hi> Pinck: One of these which was the lesser
of them had about 50 men in her; and the other
about seventy or eighty.</p>
            <p>Both these Vessels were after some small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
taken by the <hi>English,</hi> and having no
good Commissions to shew for their sailing,
were on suspicion of being Pyrates brought to
the <hi>Downs</hi> before the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Iohn
Holms,</hi> who upon mature Examination, thought
fit to send up both their Vessels into the River,
where they now lye over against <hi>Wapping</hi> Stairs;
and after he had heard the Captains of both Ships
what they could say in their own defence, thought
fit likewise to order them to be sent to the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalsees,</hi>
there to have their Tryals according to
Law in those Cases: Which the Reader, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
may hear at the Sessions held there about
five weeks hence, as I remember beginning the
Twelfth day of <hi>August</hi> next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57544:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Any one who will take so much pains as to go as
far as the <hi>Marshalsees</hi> in <hi>Southwark</hi> may see these two
Captains, being both very brisk men to look on,
and the one of them very gallant; but, if I were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of guessing a Mans mind by his Countenance,
I should be perswaded they are somewhat discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
whether by reason of their Confinement,
or Guilt, I am not able to resolve.</p>
            <p>I suppose it is in the hubbubs of War, as at the
lamentable exigent of a great Fire, where many
Rascally Fellows, who have no Habitations of
their own to gratifie the Ravenous Appetite of
those devouring Flames, forget all Humanity,
and under pretence of helping their distressed
Brethren, by carrying away and securing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
their Neighbours Goods, become a greater
Judgment, than those Flames they would be
thought to oppose.</p>
            <p>How easie is it for a base spirited Seaman, to
be guilty of resembling such Knavery? who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either by direct, or indirect means, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Master of a convenient Vessel, calls to his
Assistance a Company of Vagabonds, Men of
desperate resolutions and fortunes like himself,
and with these under pretences of opposing his
Countrys Enemies, falls promiscuously either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them or her Friends, not spairing upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57544:5"/>
the Merchant-men of his own Nation, if
he light on them in a place convenient to secure
their <hi>Cargo</hi> to his own secular use. Thus are the
Leagues and Contracts of Princes often in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be unrivited, by a company of impious
wretches, whose Souls are as narrow as their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and their Births if it were possible more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
than either.</p>
