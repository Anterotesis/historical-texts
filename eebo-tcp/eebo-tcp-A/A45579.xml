         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55783:16"/>

which is bad enough already; which he
doth either by a long and circumstantiall

               <p>
                  <hi>Rash in discretion</hi> should not call a whole

is, That the habit of vertue doth

which may hinder the reduction of

is exercised; Now how doth Vice stand
like a Lion in the way to hinder the actual

it happens that many times the habit of

Vertue lies like glowing coales rak't up

               <p>The second condition is, That though

I deny not (I say) but that Vertue in
it self is praise-worthy, but many times
the object of praise is blotted, being
placed in a most vicious subject, who for
one or two vertues may be noted, but
with twenty vices may be tainted; so
that the viciousnesse of the person or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
may obscure the lustre of his vertues,
and so (though not cut off, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The civil and moral worldling will

These only in the sight of the bleare-ey'd
Civilian are vertues sufficient to hurry a

               <p>Wicked sure is that man, who sticks not
(yet the worlds custome 'tis, though wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)
to praise his neighbour being dead,
whom he sought to spoile being living;
so prone to mischievous dissimulation is
mans minde, as that he who is now (<hi>in
humo</hi>) shrined in dust, shall be the object
of praise; who when he was (<hi>homo</hi>) cloth'd
with mortality, was the object of malice.
It is the complaint of a moderne Poet:

Charity to excuse the unadvised errours

yet patience to bear with the weaknesse
of inferiour Worthies. An instance in
this we have in the Romane Tribunes;
for when <hi>Caeso</hi> the son of <hi>L. Quintius,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Concinnatus,</hi> had incurred the
hatred and displeasures of the Tribunes,
by carrying himself as a professed enemy

endangered his life; They would not
hear of his worthinesse and knowing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servings,
the alledging of which incensed
them the more, whereby they became the
more cruel, like a Beare robbed of her
whelps; they hunted the more eagerly after
his blood, which his father perceiving,
and being directed by a better discerning
wisdome, (as it were) then the rest of
his Advocates, he chuseth out a path (for
his sonnes safety) contrary to that which
they had trod, omits the recital of his
merits, as things not fitting to be seen of
a distempered sight, and indeed not to be
endured of Envy; acknowledgeth a fault,
and in that regard with great instancy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
the people (in humble and submissive
termes) to bear with the weaknesse of his
yeares, and not to urge the forfeiture of
his unadvised errour. Thus better it was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55783:38"/>
to confesse an errour, then to alledge
merit. A man therefore ought to beware
and consider to whom he praiseth a
neighbour.
