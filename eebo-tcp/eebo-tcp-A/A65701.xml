            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Think I have sufficiently considered all that is material both in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and in the <hi>Letters</hi> of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and the <hi>Lady.</hi> In his <hi>Preface</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to vindicate his Exposition from Singularity, appealing, 1. to the <hi>Books</hi> that are <hi>written after the Mystical and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way,</hi>

who in his <hi>Seventh Sermon</hi> is most express against him in these words,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <q>
               <p>But <hi>mistake me not, All other things besides God, are not excluded of our Love.</hi> —
Wherefore, for the farther understanding of this <hi>Entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Love of God,</hi> we must not take other things <hi>oppositè,</hi> but <hi>compositè</hi>; we <hi>must exclude nothing from our Love</hi> that doth not enter into competition with God, and oppose it self against the Love of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi>
If there be any thing that may be loved jointly with God, it must not be taken as <hi>Coordinatum,</hi> but <hi>Subordinatum</hi>; it must not share equally with God, but keep its distance, and receive our Love by a reflection from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi>
Upon this Inequality must our Love ground an unequal Estimate of things, and we must love God <hi>above all Appretiativè</hi>; we must account all, in comparison of God, to be as Dung, to be very Loss.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi>
Finally, according to the Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, must the heat of our Affection be; we must love God <hi>above all Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè</hi> also; we must love other things as fit to be used, not fit to be enjoy'd, yea, we must use all the World <hi>as if we used it not,</hi> but we must love God as him whom we would not only use, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy also</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60499:3"/>Again,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 335</note>
There be many things and Persons which we are allow'd to love, but we must love them only until they come to the Comparison. If then the Question be, Whether of the two we love more, to Whether of them we will stick in a case where both cannot be held; or upon which of them we will fall foul, when it is not possible for us to keep in with both, if then we can with <hi>Moses, esteem the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than the Treasures of Egypt,</hi> we conform our selves to Christ's first Rule.</p>
               <p>Thus if we love God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 336.</note> we love him as we ought, that is, we love him <hi>above all things,</hi> and we love him <hi>for himself</hi>; for that must needs follow when we love him for no other thing, no not for our own sakes, but are willing to hazard all, even our selves and all, for the love of him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This, I hope, is sufficient to shew that <hi>Excellent Prelate</hi> is an Adversary to the Exposition of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and an Abettor of the Vulgar Exposition.</p>
            <p>He appeals, 4<hi>thly,</hi> to St. <hi>Austin, in his Devotional Tracts.</hi> Now true it is, that St. <hi>Austin</hi> hath said many things which, to one unacquainted with his use of Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, may mislead him into this Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho', as he doth explain them, it
<pb facs="tcp:60499:4"/>
is evident they are nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>V. G.</hi> He inveighs very much <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra cupiditatem mundi,</hi> but then he lets you know that we are then only Guilty of it,<note place="margin">

               <hi>is not in the nature of the things themselves, but from the cause of using, and the manner or degree of desiring them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes he will not allow us <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere terrena,</hi> but then it is because <hi>dilection is a word that is used properly only for the love of better things.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> To avoid the seeming Inconsistence betwixt the Love of God only, and the Love of my Neighbour as my self, it is said, That the Love of God with all our Heart enjoined in the First Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Love of Desire; the Love of my Neighbour required in the Second, is only Love of Benevolence, §. <hi>1.</hi> To take off this Evasion it is proved, <hi>First,</hi> That the Love of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Injunction to love him with all our Hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be discharged by a Love of Desire only, but requires also a Love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, §. <hi>2. Secondly,</hi> That though the Love of our Neighbour here enjoined be not love of Desire of him as our Good, yet neither is it love of Benevolence, or wishing well to him only, but to the due performance of it, a desire of the Creature is necessary, §. <hi>3. Thirdly,</hi> That the Love of our selves, our Relatives, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and our Friend (all which, saith Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is love of Benevolence only) is indeed that Love which chiefly opposes, and obstructs our Love to God, and is the rise of our inordinate Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the World, §. <hi>4. Fourthly,</hi> That tho' the Command to Love our Neighbour as our selves, doth not require us to Love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our Good, yet is not only lawful, but very commendable so to do, §. <hi>5.</hi> This Doctrine, That the Love of God is entirely exclusive of all Love to, and Desire of the Creature, destroys the Foundation of these two great Virtues, Iustice and Charity, §. <hi>6.</hi> It also casts a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Works both of Creation and of Providence, §. <hi>7.</hi>

and respect it hath to their owning God to be the true God, in opposition to all strange Gods, §. <hi>8. Secondly,</hi> From this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That this Love is required as the Condition of Salvation, §. <hi>9. Thirdly,</hi> That to love God with all our Mind cannot bear this Sense, §. <hi>10.</hi> The common Exposition serves all the Designs of Religion in General, and of Christian Religion in Particular, as well as the Exposition of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and the Lady, §. <hi>11.</hi>

            <p>Quest.<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Whether the Scripture doth require us to love God so entirely, as that we may love nothing else with a love of desire, though it be only with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to him?</hi> So the philosophical and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Letters dogmatically do assert; declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">

               <hi>that God is not only the Principal, but the sole Object of our Love.</hi> Whence it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that every degree of desire of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a sin, as being a transgression of this Precept. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Hence it must follow, that this sin is plain Idolatry; for Idolatry consists in giving that Reverence and Affection to the Creature, which is due only to the Creator. If therefore no degree of love, or of desire, be due unto the Creature, but to the Creator only, by loving or desiring the Creature in any degree whatsoever, we must give the affection to the Creature which is only due to the Creator, and therefore must be guilty of Idolatry. Hence sutably to their Opinion 'tis asserted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 62.</note> That <hi>the Creatures are no more our Goods, than our Gods; and we may as well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, as love them.</hi> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 77, 78. <hi>As to worship the Creature, though but rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, is to give that worship to the Creature which is proper to God; so to love the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though but relatively, is to give that love to the Creature which is proper to God. I cannot see why one should not be reckoned Idolatry, as well as the other.</hi> Now Idolatry in the <hi>New Testament</hi> is frequently declared to be a damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sin,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9, 10.

               <hi>First,</hi> It is manifestly and expresly contrary to the plain Dictates of the Holy Scripture, and the Experience and Reason of Mankind. To make this evident, I lay this down as the Foundation, That love of Concupiscence, and of Desire, are the same; Desire being in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the same which <gap reason="foreign">

have, or to enjoy. Now God himself by divers Methods hath instructed us, that we may lawfully desire the Creature He hath himself obliged us to desire, and therefore moderately to effect the World's good Things.</p>
            <p>For, 1. He hath made the desire of them the matter of our daily Prayer, requiring us to address unto him daily for <hi>our daily Bread.</hi> Now under the name of Bread it is agreed by all Interpreters that I have met with, that all things needful to the sustaining and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of this present Life are comprehended; of which nature are Meat, Drink, and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.32</note> saith our Saviour, <hi>your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of All these things.</hi> Moreover, the Reason why we are to desire Bread being this, because 'tis needful for the Support and Comfort of this present Life; it follows that we have the same reason to desire of God what ever else is needful to the Support and Comfort of this Life: And so to beg his Blessing not only on our honest Labours, and endeavours to obtain and to preserve what is needful for the Support and Comfort of our selves, and our dependants, but also on our Flocks and Herds, and on all those Fruits of the Earth he hath provided for the use of Man.<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.3, 4, 5.</note>Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns those <hi>Hereticks</hi> who taught Men <hi>to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of them who believe, and know the truth</hi>; (<hi>viz.</hi> that nothing is unclean of it self, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.14.) <hi>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.

               <note place="margin">Mat. 6.33. 1 Tim. 1.8.</note> 
               <hi>that all these things may be added to us:</hi> To live piously, because <hi>Godliness hath the promise of this life, as well as that which is to come.</hi> Now, can any rational Man deny, That what God promiseth as the Reward of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, is our Good; or doth he not allow, and even encourage us to affect and to desire what he doth promise! We therefore by these Promises are taught of God to love, and to desire the good things of this present Life.</p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Mark 10.29, 30.</note> our blessed Saviour promiseth to them who forsake <hi>Houses</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Life, for his sake</hi> and <hi>the Gospel's, an hundred fold here, and afterwards eternal life.</hi> Now, if none of these things are fit to be the Objects of our Love, if they be not desirable to us, why doth Christ promise such an immense Reward to those that do forsake, and quit them for his sake? Why doth he promise, as an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to do so, the Return of them <hi>an hundred fold</hi>; since what we are not to affect, or to desire at all, of that we are not to affect or to desire the Encrease? Or why doth <hi>Peter</hi> say to Christ,<note place="margin">

               <hi>We have left all</hi> (these things) <hi>and followed thee, what shall we have?</hi> Doth not the Question plainly suppose, That leaving of these things was that for which they might

expect a Recompence? Which sure they could not do for leaving only that which was not in it self desirable, which was not good, and so could be no proper Object of their Love. Wherefore by these Expressions our Saviour plainly doth instruct us that these are in some degree desirable, and proper Objects of our Love. Again, when the Psalmist, to engage Men to keep God's Commandments, saith, <hi>More to be desired are they then gold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 19.10. Ps. 119.127.</note>

In fine, when Christ declares,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> That <hi>he who loveth Father or Mother, Wife or Children, or even his own Life, more then him, is not worthy of him</hi>; does not he tacitly suppose that 'tis as natural to love, and to desire the Continuance of Life, as to love Father and Mother; and that this Love is only Vicious when it exceeds or rivals that Affection which we owe to him?</p>

               </note> That God, upon their Prayer, and their Repentance, would grant Deliverance from the forementioned Evils?</p>
            <p>Again, this is one of God's Motives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his People to depart from evil, That <hi>their iniquities witheld good things from them,</hi>

            <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> The Industry which God requires from us, that we may enjoy these temporal good things; the Appetites he hath implanted in us towards them, which cannot be satisfied without Industry; the Faculties he hath given us to fit us for it; the Callings he hath placed us in, and in which we can never thrive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and the temporal Blessings he hath promised as the Reward of our Industry; are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60499:17"/>
all sufficient to convince us, That these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Enjoyments are good, and desirable things to us. Even in <hi>Paradice</hi> God found Employment for our Industry,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.19.</note> requiring the Man that he had put into it <hi>to dress it, and to keep it,</hi> and so by Industry to sustain his Life; and to secure his Pleasure, when he was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out thence, God laid the Burthen upon him and his Posterity,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.17.</note> That <hi>in the sweat of their faces they should eat their bread, till they returned unto the ground.</hi> Under the Evangelical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation, every Christian is to have his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 2 Thes. 3.12. 1 Thes. 4.11.

                  </gap>, that which is good, with his hands</hi>; and <hi>if he will not labour,</hi> when he can,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3.10.</note> the Apostles Canon saith <hi>he must not eat</hi> when he would. Moreover, though we bring nothing into the World, yet we bring Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, which have no other use but to desire these Temporals, and Constitutions which cannot at all subsist, or not conveniently, without them; which therefore were undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly designed to prompt us to that Industry by which alone we can obtain them. We have hands also suted for Work, and Strength enabling us to labour, and Reason to contrive how to employ that Labour in procuring the things we want. All which things shew, even without a Revelation, That Divine Wisdom did intend that we should live in the Exercise of Industry to procure these things, and not well without it; having so many Desires to be appeased, so many Wants to be supplied, so many Troubles to be removed, so many Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60499:17"/>
and Senses to be gratified by our Care and Industry, in the pursuit of these things. But now imagin these temporal Enjoyments not to our good, not proper Objects of our Desire, not worthy of the name of temporal Blessings, you cut off all Motives to this Industry; for where there is no proper Fruits of Industry, nothing which is <hi>Operae pretium, worth the labour,</hi> there can be no cause of Labour: Now where there is nothing good for me, nothing desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no Blessing to be obtained by Labour, 'tis certain that there is no ground or motive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Labour. And therefore, to excite us to this Industry, God hath engaged to give to the diligent pursuit of these things, 1 Prosperous Success,<note place="margin">Prov. 13.4.</note> declaring, That <hi>the soul of the diligent shall be made fat,</hi> whilst <hi>the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing</hi>: 2 Plentiful Accommodations for our Sustenance;<note place="margin">Prov. 21.5.</note> for as <hi>The thoughts of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent tend only to plenteousness,</hi> so hath God assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him of Satisfaction from it; for he that <hi>tilleth his Land shall be satisfied with bread.</hi> 3. Encrease of Wealth and Riches; for tho' <hi>the blessing of the Lord maketh rich,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10.4.</note> yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs that Blessing to us by the hand of Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for 'tis <hi>the hand of the diligent that maketh rich</hi>;<note place="margin">Prov. 13.11.</note> and <hi>he that gathereth by labour, who,</hi> saith the wise Man, <hi>shall encrease.</hi> Now surely that which God doth promise to us as a Blessing, and Reward for a just motive to our Industry, must be something desirable to us, and good for us, and so our good.</p>
            <p>But had we no such evidence of these things from Scripture,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> even Reason and Experience would powerfully convince us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60499:18"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> That God hath not forbidden the Desire, or denied us the Enjoyment of any worldly Pleasure, which is truly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Pleasure that doth call for no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, because his all wise Providence hath made such liberal Provisions for them. For wherefore hath he given to us Organs capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of great and exquisite Delight in all our Senses? Wherefore hath he caused the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Earth to furnish us with things so grateful to the Palat, so fragrant to the Smell, so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the Eye? Did he not give us the free use of these Enjoyments, provided that we take this freedom with Moderation and Discretion, use it with Thankfulness, and with Submission, and Subordination to the Glory of the Donor? Therein consisting our iniquity, not that we do at all love Pleasures, but that we <hi>love them more than God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.4.</note> This is apparent to a demonstration, from the very definition of Pleasure contained in these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Pleasure is the Gratification of natural Appetites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lett.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> 
               <hi>according to, and not exceeding the intention of Nature.</hi> For this definition takes it for granted, That the God of Nature intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gratification of our natural Appetites, that is, our Pleasure. Moreover what are these natural Appetites, but natural Desires? What is it that gratifies them but the Enjoyment of the thing desired? I must have therefore implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me by the God of Nature, as many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Desires of the Creature, as I have natural Appetites, which may and only can be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Enjoyment of the Creature.</p>
            <p>What therefore doth the good Lady mean when she affirms so positively,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lett.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 179.</note> That <hi>if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60499:18"/>
the Creature as the true cause of our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, it is so far from being our good, that it certainly becomes our evil.</hi> Does she mean that I sin if I desire drink, as the true cause of the pleasure that I find in quenching my Thirst; or Wine, as the true cause of making glad my Heart? This she can only mean upon the account of that new Invention of Mr. <hi>Mal Branch</hi>'s, That <hi>God is the immediate and efficient Cause of all our pleasing Sensations:</hi> Now that being but an invention of yesterday, spick and span new Philosophy, not discovered till this last Age, all precedent Ages, according to this Doctrine, lay under a necessity of sinning. And so must all at present, whose heads are not cast in <hi>Metaphysical Moulds,</hi> they being thought uncapable of this fine Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore forced still to believe the Scripture,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.5. Judg. 19.5.</note> when it saith, that <hi>Wine maketh glad the heart of man,</hi> and that <hi>bread comforts his heart.</hi> And when it speaks of <hi>pleasant Bread,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 10.3. Cant. 4.13.16. Prov. 24.4.</note> and <hi>pleasant Fruits,</hi> and of <hi>Chambers filled with all precious and pleasant Riches,</hi> and of the <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Honey and the Honey-comb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He cannot absolutely have forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the desire of Honour; for if so, why hath he planted in us such a natural thirst after it? Why doth he promise it so oft as the reward of Wisdom?<note place="margin">Prov. 22.1.</note> Why hath he told us, <hi>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches</hi>; that it is <hi>better than the precious Ointment?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 7.1.</note> Why hath he made it our Duty to pursue whatever is <hi>praise-worthy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>honourable, and of good report?</hi> Why hath he made it a commendation of Faith,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.2.</note> that by it <hi>the Elders obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi> Why hath he ordered matters so, as to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60499:19"/>
render a good Reputation, and an honourable Esteem so highly instrumental to promote his Glory, and so beneficial to our selves and others, that great and good things can scarce successfully be done without it? And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for temporal good Things; he by making such rich Provisions of them for the Sustenance of our lives, and by framing our Bodies so as not only to relish and delight in them, but also to be nourished and sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, hath sufficiently intimated that it is his pleasure that we should in reasonable measure desire and enjoy them, otherwise his care would have been vain, and his works useless; yea, he might seem to have laid an ill design to tempt and ensnare us, and draw us off from himself by them. In fine, when we come into the World in the want of all things, with Appetites which have no other use but to desire them, and cannot but be pleased with them; when we have Natures that cannot long, or conveniently subsist without them; when the Organs of our Senses are so framed, as naturally to be delighted with them; when the wise Providence of God hath framed the whole Earth for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those Appetites; when by the Order of Providence from the Creation, all Men do pursue them, and even good Men pray unto God, and do praise him for them, can it be needful to spend more words in confutation of a Paradox, which all Men do renounce in Speculation or in Practice; or to evince that God hath not entirely forbid all love, and all desire of the World's good Things. Now hence it follows;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60499:19"/>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> That this Doctrine is inconsistent with our Obligation to pray for any temporal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which we want either for our selves, or others.<note place="margin">1 Kings 8.</note> Whosoever looks into the Prayer of Dedication, made by <hi>Solomon,</hi> will find it is imploy'd in begging temporal Mercies for the <hi>Iews</hi> in answer to their Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance from that <hi>Pestilence</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed their Lives; that <hi>Famine, Mildew, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, Locust</hi> which consumed their Fruit, that <hi>Drought</hi> which consumed their Drink, and that <hi>Exile</hi> which deprived them of that good Land which <hi>flowed with Milk and Honey.</hi> The <hi>Ancient Liturgies</hi> pray'd always thus,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Let us beseech the Lord to give us a temperate Air, gentle Showers, refreshing Dews, and plenty of all Fruits; so that the year may afford us store of all good things, and abundance of all Provisions.</hi> In our Liturgy we pray that God would <hi>give and preserve to us the kindly Fruits of the Earth, so as in due time we may enjoy them:</hi> That the King may <hi>study to preserve his People in Wealth, Peace and Godliness:</hi> That <hi>we may receive the Fruits of the Earth to our comfort:</hi> That God would <hi>encrease the Fruits of the Earth by his heavenly Benediction, and turn our great Scarcity and Dearth into Plenty and Cheapness.</hi> Now, seeing Prayer is a desire of some good thing from God, if these Enjoyments be not our good things, if we may not desire or affect them, we cannot thus address unto God for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Doctrine is inconsistent with that Praise, and that Thanksgiving which we owe to God for all the Mercies we enjoy.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Doctrine tends to depreciate the divine Gifts, to undervalue all God's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Blessings, to cause Men to despise and slight his temporal Promises, and to contemn his threats of the same kind, and render both

unable to obtain the ends his Wisdom hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in making them; for what greater contempt can we cast upon the divine Gifts? how can we more effectually vilifie the divine Blessings, or slight these Promises, than by thus solemnly declaring they contain nothing in them which a good Man can desire or affect?

               <p> To avoid the seeming Inconsistence betwixt the Love of God only, and the love of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as my self, it is said, That the Love of God with all our Heart enjoined in the First Commandment, is the love of Desire; the love of my Neighbour required in the Second, is only Love of Benevolence, <hi>§. 1.</hi> To take off this Evasion it is proved, <hi>First,</hi> That the Love of God required in the Injunction to love him with all our hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be discharged by a love of Desire only, but requires also a love of Benevolence, <hi>§. 2.

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. §. 1.</note>I Proceed now to my Second Head, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew, that this Exposition of the Precept, <hi>to love God with all our hearts,</hi> renders it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the following Command, enjoining us <hi>to love our Neighbour as our selves.</hi> That this is a just Prejudice, if true, against this new Invention the Admirable Lady confesseth, and confirmeth in these words;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lett.</hi> 7. <hi>P.</hi> 135, 136.</note>
               <q>It were, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, a strong prejudice against their way of stating the Love of God, if it were in any measure injurious to the right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and due performance of the love we owe to our Neighbour. For since the Precepts of the Gospel are an exact and beautiful System of Wisdom and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; every one of whose Parts are so duly proportioned to the other, that the result of all is perfect Harmony and Order. I must needs conclude, that when such a sense is put upon one Precept as causes it to clash and interfere with another, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the genuine meaning of it; and if I cannot make over the whole of my desire to God, without defaulking from that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love he has assigned my Neighbour, I must of necessity set the signification of that Precept to a lower pitch, and find out some other Medium to interpret the first and great Commandment.</q>
But then they think to salve the matter with the distinction of love, into love of desire, and love of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence; declaring that the former is due
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60499:23"/>
to God alone, and is the thing required in the Commandment, <hi>to love God with all our hearts</hi>; the second only belongeth to our Neighbour, and is the thing enjoined in the Command, <hi>to love our Neighbour as our selves.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>N.</hi>

               <q>'Tis most certain, that the most entire love of God, enjoined in the first Commandment, does by no means exclude the love of our Neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enjoined in the second, in case these two loves be of two different kinds; the former suppose love of Desire, and the latter love of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, there being no manner of Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy between the desiring none <hi>but God, and the wishing well to Men.</hi> Thus, <hi>saith he,</hi> is it in this case; for the word Love, when applied to God in the First Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, signifies desiring him as a good; and when applied to Men, in the Second, (it) signifies not desiring them as a good, but desiring good to them: And cannot I thus love God only, and my Neighbour too, and so fulfil both Commands? Cannot I desire but one thing only in the World, and yet at the same time wish well to every thing else? 'Tis plain that I may, and that the entireness of my love to God, does no way prejudice my love to my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; supposing the latter love to be of a different kind from the former.</q>
Now in Answer to these Suggestions I shall endeavour to shew.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> That the Love of God required in the Command <hi>to love him with all our hearts,</hi> is not only a love of desire, but of Benevolence also.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60499:24"/>2<hi>dly,</hi> That though the love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour here enjoined be not <hi>love of desire of him as our good</hi>; yet neither is it love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence only, but that to the due performance of it a desire of the Creature is requisite, which is sufficient to consute the Hypothesis, That <hi>the love of God required in the command, To love God with all our hearts, is exclusive of the love of the Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That the love of Benevolence allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and his good <hi>Lady,</hi> is indeed that love which chiefly opposeth and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth our true love to God, and is the rise of our inordinate Affections to the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> That though this Precept, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> cannot be well supposed to command us <hi>to desire our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our good,</hi> yet is it not only lawful, but very commendable so to do.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> Then I say, That <hi>the Love of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Injunction to love him with all our Hearts, cannot be discharged by a love of Desire only, but requires also a love of Benevolence.</hi> For is the desire of Enjoying him all that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires from us, to testifie and express our love to him?

That we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in every thing by which his Holy Name is Glorified?

Doth he not enjoin us to do good to others for his sake? to love his House, his Ministers, his Servants, because they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him? and require Servants to obey their Masters,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.7.</note>

               </gap>, <hi>with good well-doing service to the Lord</hi>; and do we not by all these things testifie our good will to God. When the Excellent Lady saith of the Divine Lover,
<q>That where-ever his Beloved is interested,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lett.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 266.</note> his Soul is all on Fire; he does not pursue his Service with a languid and frozen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but with the Diligence and Zeal of Love; He will not see his Beloved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, his Law contemned, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs opposed, and tamely stand by and hold his peace, nor does he regard what himself may suffer, but only what service he may reasonably hope to do, and never is chary of those things we usually call our own, whether Fortune, or Fame, or Life it self, but only deliberates how he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them for the most opportune season of spending them freely in his Beloved's Service?</q>
Doth she not in all this speak of the Love of Benevolence? Are not all these Acts of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent affection to God? When we are thus
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60499:25"/>
zealously concerned for the Honour of our Neighbour, when we desire he may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and gratified, and rejoice when he is so; and are grieved when any thing is done to his Dishonour, or by which he is much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased; when we love any thing related to him, and treat it respectfully for his sake; do we not by these things shew our love of Benevolence to our Neighbour? Why therefore may we not be said to testifie and express our good will to God, by doing the like things towards him.</p>
            <p>The Excellent Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> not only makes it one Property of true Love to God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm.</hi> 23. <hi>of the Love of God, Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 316.</note> 
               <hi>to bear the greatest good will towards him,</hi> but also saith, <hi>There wants not sufficient matter of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising good will, both in Affection and Action to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God;</hi> (for) <hi>we are capable both of wish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, and in a manner, as he will interpret it, and accept it, of doing good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to him by our concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with him in promoting those things which he approves and delights in, and in removing the contrary.</hi> Moreover when Christ saith, <hi>He that loveth Father and Mother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> 
               <hi>Wife or Children, or his own Life more more than me, is not worthy of me:</hi> Doth not the comparison require, that the Love mentioned should relate to the same kind of love? If then the love of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and and Mother be only that of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and the love of God and Christ be that of Desire only, let Mr. <hi>N.</hi> tell us why they may not both be very well consistent, as well as the love of God, and of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour are upon that account believed to be so, if the love of both be that of desire, it follows, in opposition to his Grand Tenet,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60499:25"/>
that Creatures may be loved with love of Desire; but if the love here mentioned be that of Benevolence, then is it certain that love of Benevolence is not only due to God, but also that it is due to him in an higher measure than to any Creature. And indeed this Matter needs to be explained a little, and then it will scarce need a further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Then we may consider God in his Divine Essence, as an All-sufficient God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happy in himself, and incapable of any accession either to his Being, or internal Happiness; and in this sense to wish well to him, or to desire to him Good, is vain and impracticable; and therefore considered thus, he is incapable of Love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>But then we may consider him as the great Governor of the World, giving Laws, which he would have us to observe, and by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which he is glorified by Men, and is well pleased when they do chearfully and readily comply with them, and is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured and displeased when they affront him by their Disobedience.</p>
            <p>We also may consider him according to his immitable Perfections, and his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Attributes, <hi>viz.</hi> his Holiness and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, his Truth and Faithfulness, his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mercy. Now these being the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Perfections of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he cannot chuse but love and delight in, he is pleased to express himself as one who very much desires that all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should be like him in them, and to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60499:26"/>
delight in all that are so, and who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make others so; he being glorified by them who promote these Excellencies in themselves, and others, and as one who is highly offended, displeased, and even grieved when Men neglect these things, and act in opposition to his great Design of promoting these Perfections in Mankind; and thus he is very capable of our Love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: For whenever we do him service out of good will, and pure desire to please him; when we aspire to greater measures of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Righteousness, and are Fruitful in good Works, because these things are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and tend to the promotion of his Glory; when we endeavour that all with whom we do converse may advance in them from the same Principle; in all these cases we express our good will to him. When we are zealous for his Honour, rejoice to see it promoted, are grieved at any thing which doth dishonour and displease him, and are industrious to prevent it; in this we we shew a Zeal for God, and a displeasure against these things, arising from a love to him. And when we love his Servants for his sake, and our Neighbour, because made after the Image of God; this is in Scripture represented not only as an Indication, but an Expression of our love to him;<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.10.</note> For <hi>God is not unrighteous,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>to forget your labour of love, which you have shewed to his name, in that you ministred to the Saints.</hi>

unto our selves; it also shews a stronger compliance of our Will with the Will of God, a greater Sympathy of Affections, a stronger Complacency in Goodness, an higher Resemblance of Divine Perfections, than our desire of the chief Good imports, and so it renders us more partakers of the Divine Nature, and so more acceptable and lovely in the sight of God. Love of Benevolence is therefore due to God, as well as to my my Neighbour, and so the love of God and of Neighbour is not on that account of different kinds. And if it cannot be denied that this is true and genuine love of God, it cannot be denied that this love also is required in the Command, <hi>To love the Lord with all our Heart, and all our Soul</hi>; and then it is demonstrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, that Phrase cannot exclude the love of any Creature, because it is confessed, that with this love of Benevolence we are to <hi>love our Neighbour as our selves.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I add, That <hi>the Duty of Love I owe to my Neighbour cannot be discharged by a love of Benevolence, or by wishing well to him only, but that it imports also a love of Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or a sincere endeavour of doing all the good I can to him.</hi> This is self-evident, and confessed by Mr. <hi>N.</hi> when he saith, It makes us ready <hi>not only to wish them,</hi>

                  </gap>, the things which are profitable to the Body,</hi> is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable piece of Charity. And yet how is it possible we should be able, or even desirous to afford him what is necessary for the Body, if we our selves may not desire the things that are so? Let us reflect upon those acts of Charity to our Neighbour, for which our Lord hath promised to us the Kingdom, and we shall easily discern we cannot do them, without desire of the Creature as their Good. For can we <hi>feed the Hungry,</hi> or <hi>give drink to the Thirsty,</hi> without desiring to have Food and Drink to give them? Can we <hi>take the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in,</hi> without desiring an House in which we may receive him? Or <hi>Cloath the Naked,</hi> without desiring to have wherewith to Cloath him? 'Tis therefore certain, that we cannot discharge this Christian Duty to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, without a desire of, and an endeavour also to enjoy the Creature, and then it must be also certain, that the Love of God is not exclusive of all love, and all desire of the Creature.</p>
            <p>Besides, we by this Precept are obliged <hi>to love our Brother as our selves</hi>; now are we barely to wish well to our selves, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Life, Health, Sleep, Ease, Comfort, and all the Necessaries of this present Life? If then we are to love our Neighbour as our selves, that love must certainly engage us to desire for our Brother the continuance of Life, Health, Ease and Comfort, and all the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of this present Life; and also that we may have what will enable us to minister to him in these things.</p>

            <q>
               <p n="1"> Now
<hi>This,</hi> saith the Excellent Dr. <hi>Barrow, is the Root from which all other Vices do grow, and without which hardly any Sin could sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi>; the chief Vices especially have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and evident dependance upon it.</p>
               <p>All Impiety doth involve a loving our selves in undue manner and measure, so that we set our selves in our Esteem and Affection before God; we prefer our own Conceits to his Judgment and Advice; we raise our Pleasure above his Will and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>From hence particularly, by a manifest Extraction, are derived those chief and common Vices, Pride, Ambition, Envy, Avarice, Intemperance, Injustice, Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness, Peevishness, Stubbornness, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and Impatience.
For,</p>
               <p>We overvalue our selves, our Qualities and Endowments, our Powers and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our Fortunes and external Advantages; hence we are so Proud, that is, so Lofty in our Conceits, and Fastuous in our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors.</p>
               <p>We would be the only Men, or most considerable in the World; hence are we Ambitious; hence continually, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable greediness, we do affect and strive
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60499:29"/>
to procure encrease of Reputation, of Power, of Dignity.</p>
               <p>We would engross to our selves all sorts of good Things in the highest degree; hence enviously we become jealous of the Works and Virtue we grudge, and repine at the Prosperity of others, as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falked somewhat from our Excellency, or did Eclipse the brightness of our Fortune.</p>
               <p>We desire to be not only full in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, but free and absolute in our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Things, not only secure from needing the Succour of other Men, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant in regard to God's Providence: Hence are we so covetous of Wealth; hence we so eagerly scrape it, and so carefully hoard it up.</p>
               <p>We can refuse our dear selves no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, although unreasonable and hurtful, therefore we so greedily gratifie sensual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites in unlawful, or excessive Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Being blinded or transported with fond Dotage on our selves, we cannot discern, or will not regard what is due to others: Hence are we apt, upon occasion, to do them wrong.</p>
               <p>Love to our selves doth in such manner suck in, and swallow up our Spirits; doth so pinch in, and contract our Hearts; doth, according to its Computation, so confine and abridge our Interests, that we cannot in our Affection, or in real expression of Kindness tend outwards, that we can afford little good Will, or impart little Good to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60499:30"/>
Deeming our selves extreamly Wise, and worthy of Regard; we cannot endure to be contradicted in our Opinion, or cross'd in our Honour: Hence, upon any such Occasion, our Choler riseth, and easily we break forth into violent Heats of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>From the like Causes it is that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not willingly stoop to due Obeisance of our Superiors, in Reverence to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Observance of their Laws, that we cannot contentedly acquiesce in the Station or Portion assigned us by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that we cannot patiently support our Condition, or accept the Events be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling us.</p>
               <p>In fine, if surveying all the several kinds of naughty Dispositions in our Souls, and of Miscarriages in our Lives, we do scan their particular Nature, and search into their Original Causes, we shall find inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Self-love to be a main Ingredient, and a common Source of them all.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In particular, the love of Life, which is by them esteemed Love of Benevolence, to what base Fears, and sordid Actions doth it not expose us? How many myriads have lost their Reputation, Honesty, their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and their own Souls to save it? This therefore is that piece of Self-denial so oft in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, so vehemently pressed in Scripture, that we may continue <hi>Christ's Disciples,</hi> and may be Faithful to him to the Death. The immoderate love of it being that which is especially pronounced inconsistent with the love of God, and with Fidelity to Christ.

Hence he so often saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.39. <hi>ch.</hi> 16.25.</note> 
               <hi>He that findeth his own Life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 13.26.</note> And <hi>if any Man come to me, and hateth not his own Life, he cannot be my Disciple.</hi> Can therefore any Person doubt whether this self-love, this love of Life, be not as much forbid by the Command of loving God with all our Hearts; as the desire of Houses, Lands, or any temporal Possessions, or think it less obstructive of, or inconsistent with it, because it is love of Benevolence? But will Mr. <hi>N.</hi> or his Good <hi>Lady,</hi> by reason of the mischievous Effects of this Self-love, this love of Life, perswade the World that no Man ought to love himself at all, or desire at all the Preservation of his Life? And yet would they be pleased to revise their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and those especially which are taken from the Consideration of the Danger of the Love of the Creature, they would soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they were of equal Force against all love of our selves, and of our lives.</p>
            <p>Again, the love of Parents, Children, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Wives, Relations, Friends, is love of Benevolence; and yet it is the Root of many and great Vices, it is that which renders it exceeding difficult to obey the Laws of Christ, when they once come in Competition with these Beloved's of our Souls; for where there is by Nature the closest Union, and the most intimate Affection, it must be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to burst these Bonds asunder, and disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our Hearts from them. Hence that great Duty of Self-denial is still expressed by loving God more than these;<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, doth not Experience convince us, that from the excessive love we bear to our Relations, beloved Sects and Parties, mostly proceeds that Strife, Debate and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, those Quarrels and Contentions, that Wrath, Hatred, Envy, Bitterness of Spirit; those Schisms, Factions and Seditions; those Animosities and Heart-burnings; those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Detractions, rash Censures, which are in the World?</p>
            <p>Is not this one great Root of that Avarice, that scraping for the World, that hoarding of it up, that want of Charity we complain of that Men are very desirous to advance their Families, and leave them in great Plenty and Splendor in the World?</p>
            <p>Can it be therefore doubted, Whether this love of Benevolence be one great thing forbidden in this Injunction, <hi>To love the Lord with all our Heart,</hi> &amp;c. or whether it be not inconsistent with it as that love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of <hi>Houses, Lands,</hi> joined with it in the Text; which Men do often part with to preserve the Life of these Beloveds? But will Good Mr. <hi>N.</hi> or the <hi>Lady,</hi> hence conclude, That <hi>the Love of God with all our Hearts,</hi> is entirely exclusive of all Love of Benevolence to Father or Mother, Wife or Children?</p>

supposed to command us to desire our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our Good; yet is it not only lawful, but very commendable so to do.</hi> I say, the Command to love our Neighbour cannot be <hi>a Command to desire him as our Good,</hi> because the love of my Neighbour is this love of another as such, the wishing well, and doing good to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without a formal respect to my self; whereas loving another <hi>as a Good to me,</hi> is properly Self-love. The true reason then why I cannot love my Neighbour in the Sense here required, <hi>with love of desire as a Good to me,</hi> is not because he is a Creature, for I my self am a Creature, and yet may love my self, as I have proved, with a love of Desire; and I may love and desire those temporal good Things God hath promised, though they be only Creatures; but because whatsoever I thus love, must be affected, and desired from Self-love, and not from love unto another.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it is very evident that I may, and sometimes ought to desire my Neighbour <hi>as a Good to me.</hi> For, is there not such a thing as a good Friend, a good Companion, a good Neighbour, a good Counsellor; and may not I want, and so have reason to desire this Friend, Companion, Neighbour, Counsellor, as a Good to me? Are not such Persons very needful and beneficial to us in this Life? And will not Self-love teach us to desire what is so needful and so beneficial to us? May not the Parish of <hi>B.</hi> desire that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their Minister, as being a Good to them? When Great and Good Men are in danger to be taken from us by Sickness, or the Casualties of War, how heartily do we

pray for the continuance and preservation of their Lives? And do we not desire this as a publick Good? And when we grieve for them as dead, and gone into a State of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, can we do this out of Benevolence to them?

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By stretching this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to an exclusion of all desire of, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to, the Creature, a great Contempt is cast upon the works, both of the Creation and of Providence. For,</p>

               </gap>. And wherein doth the Goodness of these things consist, but in their fitness to serve the ends for which these Creatures were created? Now is it the Herb only, which was created for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Man;<note place="margin">Gen. 1.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> was not the Host of Heaven made to give him Light, and Heat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Influences, and for Signs, and for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and for Days, and for Years? Was not the Earth made to be inhabited by him? Was it not given to the Children of Men for their use?

The Ox, the Ass, the Horse for Travel and for Tillage of the Earth; the Flocks and Herds, to feed and clothe him? The Fruits of the Earth to sustain him? The Corn, Wine and Oil to comfort and make glad the Heart of Man? Are not all these things made in such an Order and Dependance by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60499:34"/>
Wisdom, as that the Influence of the Heavens should render the Earth fruitful; and that the fruitful Earth should yield her Corn, and Wine, and Oil, and these should mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the Support and Comfort of Man's Life? Is not this the true import of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>The Heavens shall hear the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 2.21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>and the Earth shall hear the Corn, and Wine, and Oil, and they shall hear Iesrael?</hi> When the Psalmist calls upon <hi>the Sun, and Moon, the Heavens, and the Waters that are above the Heavens, the deeps, and the Whales swimming in them; the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Hills, fruitful Trees and Cedars, the Beasts and Cattel, creeping things and flying Fowl to Praise God</hi>; doth he not in effect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and stir up Man to praise God for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he hath received from these things, and for the kindness God designed to him by them? Now if there be nothing in the whole System of the Creation which is our Good, which we may love, <hi>i. e.</hi> be pleased with and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, how came these Creatures to be stiled <hi>very Good</hi>; and that in reference to one great end of their Creation, the Service of Man? Wherein consists the kindness of God design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Creation of them? And whence ariseth the Obligation to such Praises and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings for them?</p>
            <p>Moreover the same <hi>Moses</hi> informs us, That God created the Woman to be an <hi>help meet</hi> for the Man,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.18. <hi>ch.</hi> 1.28.</note> because it was not <hi>good for Man to be alone</hi>; and that he Blessed them both, and said, <hi>Be fruitful, and multiply, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Earth.</hi> Now is there comfort in the Society of a Bosom Friend, nothing desirable in a help meet for the Necessities and Uses of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60499:34"/>
this present Life; or may I not desire what is so comfortable,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.9.</note> and so helpful? If it be <hi>better to marry than to burn,</hi> must it must not be good to desire a Wife, that I may not burn? If it be a Blessing to be Fruitful, and an Infelicity and Judgment to be Barren, may I not, when I have a Wife, desire Children by her, because they are Creatures?</p>
            <p>The Providence of God respects his Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and his Government of all things, and with relation to both these we have have just cause to say,<note place="margin">Psal. 33.5.</note> 
               <hi>The Earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.</hi> For he <hi>preserveth Man and Beast</hi>; and this he doth by giving and continuing to them Life and Breath, and all things. Hence, to the memory of God's great Goodness, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath declared,<note place="margin">Psal. 145.9, 15, 16.</note> That <hi>the eyes of all things wait upon him, and he giving them their meat in due season.

            <p>As for the other Act of Providence, God's Government of Mankind, who knows not that the great Objection made against it both
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60499:35"/>
by <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> was this, That it so often hapned to the Wicked to abound in temporal good Things, and to the Good to be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Misery and Want; That such was <hi>the Prosperity of the wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73.7, 12.</note> that <hi>their eyes stood out with fulness,</hi> and <hi>they had more than heart could wish</hi>; that <hi>they prospered in the world, and encreased in Riches</hi>;<note place="margin">Jer. 12.1.</note> That <hi>the way of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prospered, and they were happy who dealt very treacherously:</hi>

               <note place="margin">Psal. 73.14.</note> Whereas <hi>many</hi> were <hi>the afflictions of the Righteous,</hi> they being <hi>plagued all the day long,</hi> and <hi>chastned every morning.</hi> That <hi>there is a just man who perisheth in his righteousness,</hi> and <hi>there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi> That there <hi>be just men to whom it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth according to the work of the wicked.</hi>

               <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, there be wicked men to whom it hapneth according to the work of the righteous.</hi> Now had it not been generally received as a certain truth, that these external things were our Good, that they were proper Objects of our Desire and Affection, and that the want of them was the want of what was good and fit to be desired, there could have been no foundation for this Objection against Providence. Whence it is evident, that the Opinion which represents the Creature as no fit Object of our Desire and Affection, and and denies them to be our Good, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the general Judgment of Mankind.</p>

               <p> The ordinary Exposition of these Words, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. laid down in the Words of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and of the Schoolmen, <hi>viz,</hi> That we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by them to love God above all Things; <hi>1.</hi> Appretiatively. <hi>2.</hi> Comparatively. <hi>3.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensively.

            </argument>
            <p>HAving thus establish'd, and confirmed this Proposition, <hi>That it is lawful to have some love for, and some desire of the Creature,</hi> and shew'd that the love of God cannot be entirely <hi>exclusive</hi> of all love, or all desire of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as our Good, I now proceed to answer what is offer'd to the contrary from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from Reason.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>
               <hi>First,</hi> The great Objection insisted on from Scripture ariseth from the words of Christ, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> 
               <hi>and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</hi> Now to fix the true sense of these words I shall

                  <item>1<hi>st,</hi> Lay down the ordinary Exposition of them, and offer some Arguments to confirm it.</item>
                  <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> I shall consider and confute the Novel Exposition of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> and answer what
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60499:36"/>
he offers against the commonly received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now the ordinary Exposition of these words, saith Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is by the generality of Divines express'd thus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> (1<hi>st,</hi>)
<q>That we are to love God with a superlative Affection, so as to be ready always to prefer his Favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other things; to chuse to obey him, rather than man; to please him, rather than to gratifie our selves; to enjoy him, rather than any carnal Interest whatsoever; and so as to be ready, rather to lose any temporal good, or suffer any temporal Evil, than commit the least Sin against him. (2<hi>dly,</hi>) That we are to love other things only in a way of Relation and Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 75.</note> for seeing God requires us to love him with all our hearts, our love to other things must be derived from, and dependant on our love to God, and we must only love them for his sake, as they relate unto him, or as they enable us to serve him, or as they are instrumental to the Enjoyment of him.</q>
This by the <hi>School-men,</hi> and <hi>Systematical Divines,</hi> is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That we are to love God above all things <hi>Appretiativè, i. e.</hi> so as to prize him in our Judgments above all things; to esteem him more valuable in himself, more beneficial to us than all things else we can enjoy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that saying of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 63.3.</note> 
               <hi>Thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness is much better than is Life it self</hi>; to esteem him as the only Felicity of our Immortal Souls; their chief and most desirable Good, the only Being in whom is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60499:37"/>
perfect Rest, entire Complacency, and full Satisfaction to be found, and consequently to look on all things else as <hi>Loss</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him. And whilst we retain this value for him, we can never prize or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for any thing so much as for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor refuse to part with any thing which tendeth to deprive us of it, we can never value any other thing so much as to permit it to rival him who is exceedingly more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in our Eyes, and more desirable to our Souls, and so we cannot overvalue any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing. This therefore may be truly stiled the loving him with all our Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we are to love God above all things <hi>Comparativè, i. e.</hi> with a superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Affection, so as to be ready always to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Favour before all other things. And this Affection, this cleaving of our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, must follow from the forementioned Estimation of him: For if we fully are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there is infinitely more Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in God, more Happiness to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him, than all the Honours, Pleasures, Profits, Interests, Relations, and Satisfactions of the World can tender, and so the highest reason that he should always be prefered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and that we should still cleave unto him, in opposition to any other thing: 'Tis certain he can have no rival in our hearts, nothing that stands in competition for our love, nothing we do not truely hate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise comparatively to his Favour; nothing that can tempt us to depart from from him, or to do the thing which will hazard his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or provoke his Displeasure; and may
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60499:37"/>
we not then be faid to love him with an entire and undivided heart?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we are to love God above all things <hi>Intensive,</hi> that is, our desires must be more ardently enclined towards his Favour, and the Enjoyment of him; we must long, thirst, and pant more after him, rejoice more in his Favour than in any other thing, be more concerned to retain it than to secure any worldly Blessing, and be more satisfied in it than in Marrow and Fatness; and what more can the love of God with all our Souls import? For seeing such a prevalence of our Desires towards him, and Delight in him, will not permit us to desire any thing in opposition to him, or against his Will and Pleasure; but will constrain us to quit all other Interests, that we may happily retain our Interest in him, we thus desire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in above all other things: It follows, that by thus loving God with all our Souls, our love unto, or our desire of the Creature, can never be inordinate or irregular, and so can never be offensive to God, and then it cannot be forbidden by the Command, <hi>To love the Lord our God with all our Souls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these things seems to be implied, or from them certainly will follow that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour above all things to please him; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious care to serve and to obey him; that vigorous Imployment of all our other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in his Service, which will demonstrate, that we comparatively do not labour <hi>for the Meat that perisheth,</hi> do not permit our Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Imployments, or our pursuit of any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Enjoyments to impair our diligence in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60499:38"/>
the securing our eternal Interests; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that in the true import of the Phrase, we love God with all our might, all other Senses of it being inconsistent with that Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our Callings, and that Industry in our Civil Affairs which God himself requires from us. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hence it follows, that we are to love all other things only in way of Relation and Subordination to God; for if we do co-ordinately love any other thing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cum autem ait toto corde, tota anima, tota mente nullam vitae nostrae partem Reliquit quae vacare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat, &amp; quasi locum dare ut aliâ revelit frui, sed quicquid aliud diligendum venerit in animum illuc rapiatur quo totius dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis impetus currit.</hi> Aug. de Doctr. Christian. l. 1. cap. 22.</note> we love it equally with God. And certainly if God requires us to love him with all our Hearts, and all our Souls, our love to other things must virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be comprised in our love to God, or be independant on it, or subservient to it, or else we must deprive him of some portion of the Heart he wholly calls for. Moreover God being our ultimate and chiefest Good, all other things can only be Good, as they conduce to the Enjoyment or Service of him, and so are to be loved by him; that is, we must love them as they relate to him, as they enable us to serve him, as they are, or may be Instrumental to his Glory, or to our Enjoyment of him. When therefore we desire the Creature only for God's sake, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may have Food and Rayment to sustain that Life we have devoted to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Encrease of temporal Enjoyments, that we may be more able to feed Christ's hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and clothe his naked Members, or more engaged to serve him <hi>with Ioy and Gladness
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60499:38"/>
of Heart for the abundance of all things,</hi> when we desire Marriage, or a Wife, that we may not <hi>burn</hi>; and Children, that, as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, we may breed them up in the Fear and Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>and leave behind us a Race of pious Persons, who may do him service, when we are dead and gone</hi>; and Honour, that we may be more instrumental to promote his Glory, and to do Good to others; and lastly, the Knowledge of the Creature, that we may learn to Glorifie the Creator, by viewing the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Creation of them; who sees not that this love of the Creature centers in the love of God, and tends expresly to his Glory, and therefore cannot be forbidden by this Command to love the Lord with all our Hearts, and all our Souls?</p>
            <p>And of this Exposition of these Words we cannot reasonably doubt,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> if we consider that our Lord himself doth plainly seem to favour and approve of it, making that Service, and so that Love which he requires from us, to consist in that prevalence of Affection which enables us, in any competition betwixt the love of the World, and the love of Him, to cleave to God, and despise the World. This evidently is the import of these words,<note place="margin">Mark 6.24.</note> 
               <hi>No Man can serve two Masters</hi> (when their Services and Commands do interfere) <hi>for he will either hate the one, and love the other, he will cleave to the one, and despise the other; ye cannot</hi> (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>serve God and Mammon.</hi> Mr. <hi>N.</hi> indeed saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 64, 65.</note>
               <q>Here we are plainly told we cannot divide between God and the Creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60499:39"/>
we cannot love either of them but upon such a Principle as must utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the love of the other.</q>
But, 1<hi>st.</hi> the word <hi>Mammon</hi> doth not signifie the Creature in general, but Riches and Money in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: Now will it follow, that because I must not love Money, that I may not love my Victuals, or that because I may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire Riches, which <hi>Agur</hi> prayed against, I may not desire Food convenient for me, which he prayed for? 2<hi>dly,</hi> When our Lord saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.24.</note> 
               <hi>No Man can serve two Masters,</hi> can this be so interpreted, as to infer we cannot serve our Master Christ, and be Servants to our <hi>Masters according to the Flesh in all things</hi> not forbidden by him? Must I needs hate my Master, if I love my Saviour; or despise him, if I cleave to my Lord Christ? Must not then the words be necessarily Interpreted of Masters Co-ordinate, or Masters whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Services do interfere? 3<hi>dly,</hi> What is the Business of a Servant, is it not to obey the Pleasure of his Lord, and yield himself up entirely in Subjection to his Commands? What therefore must it be here to serve God, but to give up our selves entirely to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the Obedience of his Will? What to serve Mammon, but to give up our selves to the pursuit of Riches, and to obey the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and Cravings of our covetous and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Appetites? Thus it is certain, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not divide betwixt God and the Creature, or love the one but from a Principle which excludes the love of the other; but a Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Affection to the Creature is no more exclusive of our love to God, then is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60499:39"/>
of an Earthly Master exclusive of the Service which we owe to Christ our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>Again, Christ places the due love of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the prevalence of our Affections to him above other things,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> saying, <hi>He that loveth Father and Mother, Son or Daughter, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, above me, is not worthy of me</hi>; whence it must follow by the Rule of contraries, that he who loveth Christ more than Father and Mother, Son or Daughter, or any worldly Interest whatever, must be worthy of him. From these two places it is therefore evident, that to love God so as to despise and to forsake all other things, to cleave unto him; to love God superlatively, so as to have our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more powerfully carried out after him, than any other thing that is most dear unto us, is, in the Scripture Sense, to love God with a whole and an entire Heart. And surely, if I love God, so as to love nothing which is contrary to him, or which he forbiddeth me to love, I can do nothing contrary to the love I owe unto him. If I love him, so as to prize neither Friendship, Relations, Fame, Honour, Pleasures, Riches, Life, or any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Concernments, so as to offend him by preserving them, I do not inordinately love them; for Obedience being the true test of Love; where there is no neglect of Obeeience, there can be no want of love. Moreover, if I prize nothing in comparison with God in my mind, if I cleave to nothing in competition with him in my will, if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing in comparison with him in my Affections, if I pursue nothing but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60499:40"/>
to his Glory, and in Subordination to his Sacred Will, how can I be wanting in my Duty to him? And if I be not wanting in my Duty to him, how can I sin against him?</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>That by this Exposition this precept is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond the real import of it, even beyond what any Person, in this State of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, doth, or can do, is very plausibly asserted by all the <hi>Romish Commentators</hi> I have read, and by the most judicious of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, who affirm, it only doth require sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, and to aim at, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to advance to that Intension and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Affection which we cannot expect compleatly to attain to in this Life.</p>
            <p>But that any Person should not be satisfied with all this, but still be stretching of this Duty to a higher pitch, charging the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this Exposition with <hi>Insincerity,</hi> and love unto their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and the Exposition it self with the most odious Consequences, this is just matter of our Admiration.

herein they did not rise up to the Letter of the Text, which manifestly requires a more elevated Sense;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> namely that our whole Affections be placed upon God, and that we love him so entirely, as to love none but him. That we ought to love God, not only with the best and most, but with the whole of our Affection;<note place="margin">

               <q>So it is said by some who think they strain the love of God to a very high pitch, when they tell us we must love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God, or in order and relation to God. So then, according to these Men, we are allow'd to love Creatures, provided
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60499:41"/>
it be in a Relation and Subordination to God, who, upon this Principle, is not to be the only, but only the final and ultimate Object of our Love. But methinks these Mens relative Love is very much like the relative Worship of the <hi>Papists,</hi> they make God the only ultimate Object of Divine Worship, and so do these Men make him the only last Object of divine Love, but yet they allow of giving divine Worship to a Creature, provided it be in a transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and relative way. And so these Men allow of bestowing our love upon a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, provided it be for God's sake, or in relation to God, provided it do not stop at the Creature, but run on till at last it fix upon God as its final Object.</q>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 217.</note>In his Tenth Letter he speaks thus;
<q>The Truth and Reasonableness of this Notion, (<hi>viz.</hi> That God only is to be the Object of our Love,) seems to me so very evident, that as I cannot with-hold my assent from it my self, so, were it not a matter of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice wherein our Passions and Interests are concerned, as well as Theory that imploys our Understandings, I should strangely wonder at all Rational and considerate Persons that can. But this, in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, silences my admiration: For this is the great disadvantage that all Truths of a moral Nature lie under, in comparison of those that are Physical or Mathematical, that though the former be in themselves no less certain than the latter,<note place="margin">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60499:41"/>
in the minds of Men, because they meet with their Passions and Lusts, and have often the Will and Affections to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with, even after they have gained upon their Understandings.— Were I to deal only with the Rational Part of Man, I should think the half of what has been said enough to convince that; but considering the nature of the Truth I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and what a strong Interest is made against it in the Affectionate Part of Human Nature, I cannot expect to find the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Or what Encouragement can such Promises afford them thus to love him? If these things were in no sense <hi>their good,</hi> why are they stiled <hi>God's Blessings</hi> and his <hi>Gifts?</hi> And why are they commanded to <hi>rejoice in them,</hi> and so bless him for them? Yea, why are they said to be blessed in them? But if they were their good things, why might they not desire or effect them proportionably to the Goodness that was in them? Yea lastly, if they were not good and desirable things, wherein consists the hurt and Curse in being stripped and deprived of them? 'Tis therefore manifest that this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it casts a slur and a reproach on all God's temporal Blessings, as having in them nothing good, nothing fit to be desired, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60499:47"/>
worthy to be loved, and therefore tends to rob him of the Praises due unto him for them, so doth it also impair the force of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises by which God did endeavour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his People thus to love him, and of those threats by which he did deter them from their Disobedience; this therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the genuine import of these words.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. §. 7.</note>Again, from this Consideration, That this Command was given to the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi> it follows that it ought to bear the Sense which is the certain import of it in all those other places of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> where it only doth occur, it being only found in the <hi>New Testament</hi> as a Citation thence. 'Tis therefore certain, that it doth not require us to love God in perfection of degrees, or in the elevated Sense contended for, but only to love him with a sincere and a prevailing love. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> God's Servants entred into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to serve the Lord after this manner. Thus <hi>Asa gathered all Benjamin and Iudah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 15.12.</note> 
               <hi>and they entred into Covenant to seek the Lord God with all their Heart, and with all their Soul.</hi> And good <hi>Iosiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 23.3.</note> with all his People, <hi>made a Covenant before the Lord to walk after the Lord, and to keep his Commandments with all their Heart, and with all their Soul:</hi> Now if, in this Covenant, they promised <hi>to love God with every degree of every Power, with the whole pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of the Soul; to bestow on him not only the highest Degree of it, but every Degree of it, the whole</hi>; and to <hi>make him not only the Principal,</hi> but <hi>the only Object of their love,</hi> they promised
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60499:47"/>
what they knew they never could, what to be sure they never did perform. And why then is it said, That <hi>the People stood to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that God wus found of them.</hi> But if they only promised love of Sincerity, and love to God above all other things, and that they would adhere to him and his Service, then may this Phrase Import no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This God required them to do, to render them the Objects of his Grace and Favour, promising to have Mercy on them in their Captivity on this Condition.<note place="margin">Deut. 4.29.</note> 
               <hi>If from thence,</hi> saith <hi>Moses, thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him; if thou seek him with all thy Heart, and all thy Soul.</hi> And again, <hi>if thou shalt return to the Lord thy God with all thy Heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 3.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and with all thy Soul, then the Lord thy God will turn thy Captivity, and have Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on thee, and will bring thee into the Land which thy Fathers possessed; and thou shalt possess it, and he will do thee Good.</hi> And upon this Condition only doth <hi>Solomon</hi> desire this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, saying,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8.48.</note> 
               <hi>If they turn to thee with all their Heart and all their Soul in the Land of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then hear thou their Prayer and their Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Now is it reasonable to conceive that God required such an absolute Perfection of Degrees in their Affection and Obedience, to qualifie them for his Favour under their Captivity? If so, they must for ever have continued Captives. Would he promise to restore them to their good Land, and to do them Good upon a Condition that would not permit them either to desire that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Land, or any other Temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as their Good? Sure the Suspension of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60499:48"/>
his Favour upon this Condition, is a clear Evidence, that this Phrase bears a milder Sense.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God doth acknowledge that some of them did actually love him thus, That King <hi>David had kept his Commandments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 14.8.</note> 
               <hi>and followed him with all his heart, saving in the matter of Uriah</hi>; and yet we find him Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mistrust of God's own Promise, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 21.2. <hi>ch.</hi> 25.22.</note> of Lying to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> of a rash Oath, in Swearing to <hi>cut off the House of Nabal</hi>; of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, in giving a deceitful <hi>Ziba</hi> half the Goods of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.29. <hi>ch.</hi> 24.1. 2 Kings 23.24, 25.</note> and of Pride, in <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the People.</hi> God also testifies of good <hi>Iosiah,</hi> That <hi>he turned to the Lord with all his Soul, and all his Heart, and all his Might,</hi> since therefore God himself declares of Men thus subject to Imperfection that they did thus love him, that love cannot require a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Degrees, but only a sincere and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Affection to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>In a word, in the Language of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> to <hi>serve God with the whole heart and Soul</hi>; to <hi>walk before him with a perfect heart, and with Integrity of heart,</hi> hath an essential respect to the owning him alone to be the true God, in opposition to all strange Gods, and the continuing stedfast in his Service, in opposition to the Service of the <hi>Heathen Idols,</hi> or the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi>; Thus when God permitted a False <hi>Prophet</hi> to arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and to <hi>shew a Sign,</hi> or <hi>do a Wonder</hi> to tempt them to desert him, and <hi>go after other Gods,</hi> he declares he did this for

            <p>In fine, it may deserve to be considered, that we cannot safely argue that a thing is, may, or should be so, because it would be an advantage to Religion were it so: For what an advantage would it be to Truth, to have a <hi>living Infallible Iudge</hi> of it; or that every <hi>Parson</hi> of a <hi>Parish,</hi> or every <hi>Private Person</hi> were Infallible?

               <p> This Chapter contains an Answer to Mr. <hi>N.'s</hi> Arguments from Scripture, for a love of God exclusive of all love of Desire of the Creature; as, <hi>V. G. 1st.</hi> From these Words, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth. 22.37. §. 1. 2dly.</hi> From those Words of St. <hi>James, Ye Adulterers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresses, know ye not that the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of this World is enmity to God, James 4.4. §. 2. 3dly.</hi> From these Words of St. <hi>John, Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World, 1 John 2.15. §. 3.</hi> And to his Arguments against the relative Love of the Creature, <hi>V. G. 1.</hi> That it is as much Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry as the relative Worship of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This Answered, <hi>1. ad hominem,</hi> by shewing that it was formerly approved by Mr. <hi>N. 2.</hi> By shewing the Disparities betwixt the relative Love of the Creature, and the relative Worship of Images, §. <hi>4. Object. 2.</hi> If Creatures be truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly lovely, as being our true and proper Good, they are to be loved absolutely and for themselves; if not, they are not to be

loved at all. <hi>Answered,</hi> by shewing in what Sense they may be stiled our true and proper Good, and be loved for themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> as that imports a love of them only for that Goodness God hath put into them; and how they may not be loved absolutely, and for themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> as that excludes the Subordination of that Affection to the Love of God, §. <hi>5.</hi>

                  <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</hi> but does he love God at this Rate, who loves him only princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, and more than any thing else? Does this exhaust the Sense of this great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment? Can he be said, with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Sense, to love God with all his Heart and Soul, that only loves him above other things, at the same time allowing other things a share in his love? Can he be said to love God with all his Love, <hi>N. B.</hi> who loves him only with a part? What though that part be the larger part, 'tis but a part still, and is a part of the whole? What Logick, or what Grammar will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this?</q>

               <hi>First,</hi> That he assumes what never will be granted by Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> That Scripture Phrases must be Interpreted not according to the Analogy of Faith, and the import of the

same words elsewhere occurring in the Holy Scripture, but according to the Rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and of Grammar, which supposition would render the Interpretation of Scripture very absurd in many places. For instance,

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ask <hi>what Grammar will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it?</hi> I have already shew'd, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint do use the Phrase in this Sense; as for the <hi>Latins</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common with them than to express an ardent Love, by saying, <hi>In amore est totus, unicè amat, toto pectore diligit, omni studio aliquem amplectitur:</hi> In French it is as common to say, <hi>Ie vous aime de tout mon coeur:</hi> We teach our very Children to say, <hi>I love my Dad, I love my Mam with my whole Heart</hi>; nothing therefore being more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in every Language than to use this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, when we do not in the least intend to signifie the Person we thus love, is loved exclusively of all others, but only that he is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60499:56"/>
very much beloved by us: Why may not the Scripture say this of that God we are obliged to love above all things, and before all things, and so as to love other things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Subordination and Relation to him; loving none other with that Love which is due and proper to him? For as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>serve him only,</hi> and yet may serve our King, our <hi>Master,</hi> and our <hi>Friend</hi>; to <hi>fear him only,</hi> and yet may fear our <hi>Parents,</hi> our <hi>Superiors</hi> and <hi>Masters,</hi> because we do not serve them with that Religious Worship, nor fear them with that Reverence which is due to God alone: So may we love the Creature with a love of Desire, and our Neighbour with a love of Benevolence, and yet love God only with that Desire and Benevolence which is due to him alone. When Mr. <hi>N.</hi> proposeth this Objection against his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That <hi>if the Love of God required our whole Affection, we could not love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our selves,</hi> he is forced to Answer thus, that
<q>
                  <hi>If the Love of God,</hi>

               </q>
So, say I, is it in our case, we do not love the Creature <hi>with the same sort of Love,</hi> or <hi>in the same Sense</hi> in which we love God, <hi>i. e.</hi> not with a Religious Affection, but with a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural only; not as our Spiritual, but as our Temporal Good; not as the Good of our Immortal Souls, but our Frail Bodies; not as our End, our Rest, or our chief Good, not

for its own, but for God's sake; whereas we love God with a religious Affection, as the Spiritual and Eternal Good of our Immortal Souls, as our End, Rest, and our chief Good, and even for himself:<note place="margin">Duct.

               <hi>There are but two sorts of Love, that of Desire, and Benevolence,</hi> considered that this love of Desire may be branched into religious and natural Desires, desire of things Spiritual and Temporal, of things good for the Body and for the Soul, of things to be used here, and to be enjoyed here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, of things as necessary for our being and our well-being, of things to be desired for their own and for God's sake; He would have discerned as great a difference betwixt one Love of Desire and another, as betwixt Love of Desire and of Benevolence; or at the least would not have thought that he who desired the Creature in a sense thus limited, desired him <hi>in the same sense,</hi> or <hi>with the same sort of Desire</hi> with which his Love and his Desire is carried out towards his Great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.

            <p>The Second Objection from Scripture is taken from the words of the <hi>Apostles Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>;<note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> the words of the <hi>Apostle Iames</hi> are these,<note place="margin">James 4.4.</note>

            <p>I Answer,<note place="margin">

               </note> That as a Woman becomes not an Adulteress by any Affection to, or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with another Man, for she ought to love her Friend, and Neighbour, and Relations, and to shew Friendship to them, but only by loving Friend or Neighbour with the love proper to her Husband, with that love which comes in competition with,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Nunquid non est in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus?</hi> S.

Is not our dependance on that Providence for them, which will give good Things to them that ask them, the Remedy here prescribed against our anxious Cares for these things? And must not then the Moderation here required Respect the same things?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.29, 30.</note> Again, <hi>Brethren,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>the time is short, it remaineth that both they that have Wives, be as if they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as not abusing it: For the Fashion of this world passeth away.</hi> Here do not all the Ancient Commentators agree that the Apostle prescribes mediocrity as to these transitory Things we can enjoy but for a short time?

have and use them as <hi>if we did it not,</hi>

Theoph. vide Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret &amp; Oecum in locum.</note> he only doth enjoin us <hi>not to have our hearts affixed, and our chief care imployed about them; and that to abuse the world is thus to use it to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our Lusts, or so as to imploy all our Studies and Affections on it</hi>; doth not the <hi>Apostle</hi> himself thus explain our weeping for our lost Friends, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 4.13.</note> That we should not do it immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and is not that sufficient warrant, so to interpret the other Particulars? And since these words respect the Moderation of our Joy and Grief, and we do joy and grieve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we do affect the Objects of those Passions; why should they not be also deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to respect the Moderation of our Affection to, or our desires of this World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If <hi>we Deifie the Object that we love,</hi> we Deifie every Woman that we love in order to Matrimony; every Child and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we desire to preserve, that so we may enjoy the Benefit and Comfort of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; we Deifie our selves when, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Psalmist, we desire life and love many days</hi>; yea, we Deifie all the Meat and Drink we love, and therefore do desire to eat and drink of; and if I love and desire a Cup of good Wine, because it <hi>maketh glad the Heart of Man,</hi> I am, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> an Idolater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I deny that it is necessary that <hi>he who loves, i. e.</hi> desires <hi>any Creature</hi> (suppose Meat when he is hungry, or Drink when
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60499:59"/>
thirsty) <hi>must suppose that Creature perfects his Being, and is the cause of his Happiness; or that it is able to act upon his Soul, and affect it with pleasing Sensations:</hi> 'Tis only necessary that he should suppose those pleasing Sensations will follow upon the Enjoyment of those Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and are not to be had without them; for put case a Sensual voluptuous Man were of your Opinion, would he ever the less pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the delights of the Flesh, and of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Appetites? Is it not the Pleasure annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Enjoyment of these things which all the World pursue? And must they not then have the same reason to desire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them, while the same Pleasures are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Enjoyment of them, whoever be the efficient cause of that Pleasure, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that acts upon the Soul, and affects it with these pleasing Sensations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It cannot be Idolatry to suppose God acts upon my Soul by the virtue he hath put into a Creature, rather than immediately by himself; for then all the World must have been Idolaters before Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>N.</hi> made known this new Opinion to the World;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. P.</hi> 22.</note> for he confesses that among the whole Tribe of <hi>Philosophers</hi> that went before them <hi>none of them thought any otherwise, or any farther,</hi> but universally held, that <hi>Bodies had a power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing such Sensations:</hi> 'Tis also evident that Children for a long time taste the Pleasures of the Creatures before they can be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that God immediately produces these pleasing Sensations in them; and that the Generality of the World are still uncapable of knowing that he doth so. Now is not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60499:60"/>
this to vilifie the Providence and Wisdom of God, and to reproach his Goodness to say, That he hath laid the World under a sad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of <hi>defrauding God of his Worship,</hi> and <hi>committing</hi> that Sin of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which <hi>he that doth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.9, 10.</note> saith the Apostle, <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Moreover all Idolatry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an act of Religious Worship,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.20, 21.</note> though mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed; now do we by desiring Meat when we are hungry,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.5.</note> or Drink when thirsty,<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.15.</note> or by thus loving Meat and Drink as things which may gratifie our hungry or our thirsty Appetites, by the virtue God himself hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in them, worship Bread and Drink? All religious Worship proceeds from a direct immediate Intention, either to give Honour to that which we conceive to be God, or else ascribes to the Object worshipped some of the Divine Attributes, or Essential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; but do we conceive Bread and Drink to be God, by asking them of God, that is, desiring them, or by rejoicing in them as his Blessing, <hi>i. e.</hi> being pleased, or affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them as such, or by conceiving he hath put any virtue into them to do us Good? Do we ascribe unto the Creature any of the Divine Attributes or Perfections, or say in effect they are <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> by thinking God may enable them to raise pleasing Sensations in us; or to work upon our Animal Spirits, and by them upon our Souls? Surely could there be any semblance of Idolatry in this case, it must wholly lie not in conceiving that Creatures can move our Animal Spirits, which is all we say or think they do, but in conceiving that these Animals Spirits can act
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60499:60"/>
upon the Soul, and that these Motions of them can be grateful, or ungrateful to it?</p>

                     <hi>Serm. Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 318.</note> that by the World he means those things which are most generally embraced and practised in it; <hi>the Lust,</hi> or <hi>the desire of the Flesh,</hi> that is Sensuality and Intemperance; <hi>the Lust of the Eyes</hi>; that is Envy, Covetousness, vain Curiosity, and the like; <hi>the Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Boasting of Life,</hi> that is Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, vain Glory, Arrogance, Qualities as irreconcilably opposite to the Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Will of God, so altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Love of him, begetting in us an Aversation and Antipathy towards him, rendring his Holiness distasteful to our Affections, his Justice dreadful to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60499:61"/>
and Himself consequently, his Will, his Law, his Presence hateful to us.</q>
And that this is the true import of the words, is highly probable; 1. Because <hi>these things,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>are not of the Father</hi>: Whereas the moderate Desire of, and Affection to the World's Good things, is of that God who hath implanted in us natural Affections and Propensions to them, made them the Objects of our Desires and our Industry, encouraged us to affect them by making the matter of his Promises, and hath allowed us to rejoice in them. 2. Because he saith, <hi>He that loveth the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> which cannot possibly be true of that Relative and Subordinate Love unto it, which he hath made Provisions for.</p>
            <p>Again, if we understand by these things, the desire of those things which gratifie our Appetites with Pleasure, <hi>V. G.</hi> by <hi>the Lusts of the Flesh,</hi> the desire of Meat, Drink, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous Enjoyments, as they do gratifie the Flesh; by <hi>the Lust of the Eye,</hi> the desire of Gold, Silver, large Possessions, noble Houses, rich Furniture, fair Gardens, as they do gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Eye. By <hi>the Pride of Life,</hi> the desire of Places of Dignity, Noble Titles, all the Honour and Glory of the World, as they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our Thirst of Honour. Hath he not told us, That the pleasing Sensations which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these desires in us are <hi>not of the World, i. e.</hi> the things contained in it, but <hi>of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; that they are <hi>the natural,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60499:61"/>
and therefore sure would have us to will and delight in them, and consequently to desire them. What then remains but that we should understand by the love and desire of these things, that immoderate love and desire which tends to captivate our Affections to them; and to prevail upon us to transgress the Will of God, that we may enjoy or preserve them, that is, the immoderate love and desire of these things.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to consider what Mr. <hi>N.</hi> objects from reason against our Relative Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Creature,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> our love of it in Relation to God.</p>

               <q>Now as, saith he, to worship the Creature,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>To this I Answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> (1.) That Mr. <hi>N.</hi> was formerly of another mind; for in his Discourse of <hi>Platonick Love</hi> he speaks thus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 443.</note>
               <q>Because God is of too sublime and refined Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to be fastned on immediately by our

               </q>
Now do we not find here all that Mr. <hi>N.</hi> condemns in our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Love? <hi>viz.</hi> the love of the Creatures by way of Relation to God, not as the only, but the final and ultimate Object of our Love; a love of that Creature for God's sake, or in Relation to God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 75.</note> provided that it do not stop and fix at the Creature, <hi>but run on till at last it fix upon God as its final Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas. and Rel. p.</hi> 244.</note>Again, <hi>We ought,</hi> saith he, <hi>to make God the direct and primary Object of our Love, and to love nothing for it self, but only in and for God.</hi> In his Aspiration he speaks thus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 246.</note> 
               <hi>My God, I will love thee as thou teachest me; the first and direct Motion of my Love shall be towards thee; and whatever I love besides thee, I will only love in and for thee.</hi> And doth he not here say, that he is taught of God to love other things besides God for his sake?</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Essay upon Contemplation and Love,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>God ought to be the ultimate end of all our Actions; and we ought not in any of our Actions</hi> (and therefore not in our Love) <hi>to stop short of this Center, but in all our Actions to make a farther Reference either actual or habitual.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>An end may become evil by being rested in, when it is not the last, without any farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or reference.</hi> So that 'tis the want of this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60499:62"/>
respect and reference, which renders the love of the Creature evil.</p>
            <p>And now to shew what little cause he had to parallel this Relative Love of the Creature, with the <hi>Relative Worship</hi> we condemn in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so unhappily to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Christians Guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who love any thing besides God for his sake, I need only to remind him of a few things which, had they been considered, would have put him out of love with this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the distinction of <hi>Relative Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> is proper to the Worship of <hi>Images,</hi> which can deserve no Worship for themselves, but as they represent some Object which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Worship: Now to say thus of all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior good things, that they can deserve no Love, or cannot be desirable for any real Goodness God hath put into them, is to beg the Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> That we only charge them with <hi>Idolatry</hi> in Worshipping the <hi>Cross,</hi> and the <hi>Images</hi> of God, and Christ with <hi>Latria, i. e</hi> for giving the same Worship which they give
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60499:63"/>
to God and Christ, to the Cross, and to the Image, which is a Creature of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Now can Mr. <hi>N.</hi> charge us with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same love to the Creature which we give to the Creator? Moreover, we charge them with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for doing this with <hi>the same Individual inward and outward Act</hi>; now can Mr. <hi>N.</hi> charge us with loving the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the same Individual desire with which we love God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Relative Worship which they do give to <hi>Images</hi> is plainly forbid in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, but as this cannot be said of this Relative Love without begging the Question; so I have sufficiently proved alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that it is highly approved in the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> That God hath made Provisions for it, accepts of it, and doth encourage us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, as will be still more evident by an Instance proper to this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>N.</hi> doth, and must allow a Relative Love of Benevolence to the Creatures, <hi>Christ</hi> having so expresly said for the Encouragement of our Charity to his Servants;<note place="margin">Mat. 25.40.</note> 
               <hi>For as much as you did it to one of these little ones, my Brethren, you did it unto me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 9.41.</note> And again, <hi>Whosoever shall give you a Cup of cold Water in my Name, because you belong to Christ, shall not lose his reward.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 6.10.</note> that <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your labour of love that you have shewed to his name, in that you have ministred to the Saints, and do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</hi> And <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 19.17.</note> that <hi>He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth to the Lord.</hi> In all which cases there is a love of the Creature for God's sake, or in Relation to God; a love of the Creature in a Relative, transitive way; a love of them
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60499:63"/>
terminating upon God and Christ, and yet a Love highly acceptable to God, and such as he hath promised richly to reward; but then it is not love of the same kind with that Affection which I owe to God, as being not an <hi>Elicite,</hi> or an <hi>immediate Act of Religion,</hi> as is the love of God, but only an <hi>Imperate</hi> Act of it, as the <hi>Schools</hi> speak; it proceeds not from the same act which carries me directly to God, the love of God being the Cause, that of Man the Effect; it is not done by any act of my mind <hi>joining God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture together, as one integral Object,</hi> but it is love to the Creature for that Relation which it hath and bears to God and Christ, and therefore 'tis not a forbidden, but a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable kind of Love, though it be plainly Relative.</p>
            <p>And so it is also in our Love of Desire to the Creature; for I love them for God and for Christ's sake, when I desire them that I may have wherewith to feed Christ's hungry, and clothe his naked Members, and in all the other Instances fore-mentioned. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident, that this Relative Love, and the <hi>Papists Relative Worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> are so far from being <hi>exactly Parallel,</hi> as Mr. <hi>N.</hi> asserts, that they have nothing common to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but this, that both are stiled Relative, which also happens in that love of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for God's sake, he allows of.</p>
            <p>But saith Mr. <hi>N.</hi>
               <q>Either Creatures are truly and really lovely,<note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> as being our true and proper Good, or they are not; if they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60499:64"/>
are, then a Relative Love is too little; we ought to love them with more than a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Love; we ought to love them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and for themselves; but if they are not, then even a Relative Love is too much; for what is not truly lovely, is always loved too much, if it be lov'd at all: So that either way there is no pretence for admitting this last Expedient of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, the Relative Love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>To this I Answer, That when he saith, <hi>The Creature is not our true and proper Goods,</hi> this may be taken in the most elevated Sense, in which God only is our <hi>true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Good,</hi> and then his Argument runs thus. Either Creatures are to be loved as our God, or else they are not to be loved at all; and this Consequence I hope is not <hi>as clear as the day</hi>; or it may be taken in a large sense for that which is the Good of the whole Man, Soul and Body, and then also I deny that what is not thus lovely, is not to be loved at all; for I may love, because I may desire my daily Bread, though it be not the proper Good of my Soul, but of my Body only. Or lastly, our true and proper Good may signifie that only which is some way condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to our Good, to the Advantage and Comfort of this present Life, as being instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Sustentation, and the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Pleasure of this Life, or to our Preservation from those afflictive Evils which are incident to us in this Life; and all that in

            <p>Now sure I may desire that Pleasure of Appetites which <hi>God hath made provision for,</hi> and consequently may desire those particular Objects which afford that Pleasure, since o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise that Provision God hath made for the Entertainment of our Animal Falculties must be made in vain.

            </p>
            <p>Again, seek and use sensible things for our Good we cannot, whilst we suppose they are not Good for us, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they will do us no Good, if then we may seek, and use sensible things for our Pleasure, and our Good, they must do us Good, and so be our Good: For <hi>That,</hi>

               <hi>There are some things in the World which I love,</hi> N. B. <hi>with great passion, such as are Conversation with select Friends, or Men of Harmonical and Tuneable Dispositions, Reading close and fine-wrought Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, solitary Walks and Gardens, the Beauty of the Spring, and above all, Majestick and well composed Musick; these I delight in with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-like satisfaction and acquiescence, and the last, could I enjoy it in its highest Perfection, would, I am apt to phansie, terminate my Desires, and make me Happy.</hi> Now could he do all this without any Movement of his Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60499:68"/>
them? Are none of these things truely and really lovely, because they are Creatures? Or must he <hi>love them too much,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 78.</note> 
               <hi>if he love them at all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> He is here speaking of <hi>seeking the Creatures for our good:</hi> Now hath the Body any apprehensions of what is for our good? Can it desire, or seek any thing under that Notion? Hath it any apprehension of the Objects that make Impressions on it as the natural or occasional Causes of our Pleasure? Doth that find Pleasure from the Fire, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it did so? Is it not evidently the Soul that apprehends, remembers, seeks, desires, and doth all these things? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible therefore is it to talk of all these things only as Movements of the Body, and and not as Movements of the Soul? To take his own Instance, Do we approach to the Fire by a Bodily movement without desiring the Fire, and expecting Pleasure from it? And is not this desire and expectation a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul? Is it not the Soul which moves those animal Spirits into those Parts and Muscles by which we are enabled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Fire by a bodily movement: So that, as far as I am able to perceive, here is nothing true, nothing satisfactory, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most said nothing intelligible in this pretended Illustration.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>the Lady,</hi> allow us to move toward these things, only <hi>as the Occasions,</hi> not <hi>as the Causes of our Good,</hi> I ask, Is not the continuance of my Life and Being good? And is Food only the occasion, is it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60499:69"/>
not the means by God appointed for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Life? Is Physick only the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is it not the means of my Health? Is sleep only the occasion, is it not the means of my Refreshment? And so of the Pleasure that we find in the Recovery of our Health, and the Refreshments of our wearied Spirits?</p>
            <p>And lastly, were it true that God is the immediate cause of all the Pleasure that we find in the Creature, was any Body acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Notion till these latter days? Doth one in Ten thousand now believe it? Are the generality of Men capable of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding it? And must not then all who in former Ages did not, and who at present cannot understand, or believe it, lie under a necessity of desiring the Creature, as the true cause of their Pleasure, and so have a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul toward it as such? So that this matter is both impracticable and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
            <p>The Notion also seems as useless, as 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible; for am I not as much obliged to God for the Benefit and Pleasure I receive from any of his Creatures, whether he do immediately produce that Pleasure in me by occasion of them, or doth produce in me those Faculties by which I am enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Pleasure they afford? Is not the Pleasure which reflects from them as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or as natural Causes of it, still the same? And is not the Giver of these Faculties and Creatures the sole Author of it? Is not <hi>causa causae, causa causati?</hi> Must not he who is the efficient cause of all those Faculties by which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60499:69"/>
I perceive Pleasure from the Creatures his Providence affords me, be the true efficient cause of all my Pleasure? Is it not the same Kindness to give me Money to build me an House, and to pay my Debts my self, as to build an House or pay my Debts for me, since either way my Debts are equally paid, and my House built, and the Benefit is the same.</p>
            <p>In fine, Doth this Notion tend at all to abate or lessen our desires of the Creature? Not at all. For be it supposed, that they are only occasions of our Pleasure, yet are they granted to such occasions as are always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with this Pleasure, and without which it would not be produced in us by God. If then the Object be as pleasing as it would be, provided God had lodged a power in it to excite this Pleasure in me, and given me Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to perceive it without his immediate Operation, as certainly it is, then is it also equally desirable; it being the Pleasure it self, not the efficient of it, that I do desire.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>N.</hi> saith, <hi>We must not desire them as our Good, because they do us no Good; they afford us no Pleasure,</hi> but God doth upon occasion of them. A very <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Consideration, which scarce any one regards in the pursuit of his Pleasure, and which will abate no Man's desire of it, for the Gratification of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the Enjoyment of the Delight, and the pleasing Sentiment is that thing desired and pursued.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 73.</note> Now the Creatures being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be the <hi>positive Conditions</hi> upon which God by his immutable Law and Order stands
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60499:70"/>
obliged to give these Gratifications and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and without which he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us one of these pleasing Sentiments, must not my pursuit of Pleasure, and desire of it, oblige me to desire and pursue that without which I know I cannot have it, and with which I am sure I cannot want it? they being the <hi>positive Conditions determining the Operation of God,</hi> to produce this Pleasure in me, <hi>i. e.</hi> to give me that which only I desire and pursue, and for which only I desire the Creature. However it is granted,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>we may seek and use sensible things for our Good</hi>; and hence it is inferred, that we may desire and be pleased with, that is, may love them as our Good; because it is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of them as Good to us, or as things which may do us Good, which moveth us to use and seek them for our Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis also granted, That <hi>we may unite our selves, and approach to them by the Movements of the Body,</hi> which Movements of the Body being not Mechanical Motions, but caused by some Movements of the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; hence, I conclude, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or unite our selves to them also by some Movements of the Soul; which is the thing denied by Mr. <hi>N.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having premised this, I proceed direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to return an Answer to the Arguments by which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> endeavours to establish his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, That <hi>the Love of God is exclusive of all Love of the Creature,</hi> and doth require us <hi>in Iustice to withdraw every straggling Desire from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60499:70"/>I confess, the <hi>Incomparable Lady</hi> hath let fall some words, which seem to lay an Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worst of Follies upon this attempt. Her words are these,<note place="margin">

               <q>
                  <hi>I will not search for Arguments to inforce this Love, after those incomparable ones you have so well inculcated, which are indeed unanswerable</hi>; And not to be opposed by any thing, but that which is as unconquerable, as it is unaccountable, wilful Folly.</q>

But though these be indeed hard Strokes, I'm sure they come from a very soft and tender hand, and from as sweet a temper'd Soul as lives in Flesh. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be taken by the right handle, and must be thought to be intended as an high Compliment to Mr. <hi>N.</hi> not as an imputation of Folly to all that should oppose his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Inforcements of his Tenet. Passing them therefore over with this gentle touch, I pass on to a Consideration of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mr. <hi>N.</hi> contained in his <hi>Sermon,</hi> and in his <hi>Letters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then he argues thus,<note place="margin">

               <q>God is the only Cause of our Love,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that is, of that Bent or Endeavour whereby the Soul of Man stands inclined to Good in General;<note place="margin">

Now if God be the only Author and Cause of our Love, has He not then the Sole Right and Title to it? If He does as much Produce my Love, as He doth my Being, why hath He not as much
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60499:71"/>
Right to my Love, as to any part of my Nature?</q>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>This Argument proves nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, by his own Confession; for it only proves that God is the Cause of all that Love which is a <hi>necessary Adherent to our Beings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. P.</hi> 13 14.</note> 
               <hi>such</hi> as is <hi>all over invincible and irresistible</hi>; of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love <hi>in which we are purely passive, over which we have no more Command, than over the motion of our Heart and Pulse</hi>; which <hi>we can never controul; can never be without; never can put off</hi>;<note place="margin">

Is it a purely passive Love which it is not in the Power of <hi>Devils</hi> to withhold, and in which the greatest <hi>Saints</hi> cannot excel them? Is God concerned that we should not want that which is a necessary Adherent of our Beings? That which we never can put off, never can be with without? Doth he require that only which no Man can defraud him of? Mr. <hi>N.</hi> is sensible that the Text is not at all concerned in this Love, confessing that <hi>our Free Love is the only Love that falls under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>

                  <hi>Lett.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 231.</note> and <hi>the only one that is in our Power.</hi> And why then doth he argue from such a Love, to that Free, Active Love, which too many are without, and too many do put off; or from that Love which cannot be, to that Love which is commanded. Moreover</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note>This Argument plainly destroys the thing it was designed to establish: For he lays down his <hi>Thesis</hi> thus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 12.</note> That <hi>our whole Affections are to

be placed on God, and that we are to love him so intirely, as to love none but him. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>I shall endeavour to establish upon this double Basis,</hi> (1.) <hi>That God is the only Author, or Cause of our Love.</hi> And will it not hence follow, that he is the only Author and Cause of our Natural Love, Bent, and Inclination to every thing besides himself? And can he be the only Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Cause of our Love to all other things, and yet forbid that very love which he alone produceth in us? <hi>God,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>N. is the Author of all my Love, he hath produced it all, 'tis therefore highly just and reasonable he should have it all.</hi> God, say I then, is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all the Love of my self, and of my Preservation, my love of Food, Drink, Cloths, of Honour, Riches, Pleasure, Life, my love of Women, and of Sensual Delights, and of the <hi>Gratification of all my Natural Appetites ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to,</hi>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 222.</note> If therefore <hi>it is the Perfection and Duty of every Rational Creature to conform those Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Will that are free, to that which is natural, or to take care that the Love of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Love of his Choice conspire in one, that they both agree in the same Motion, and concenter in the same Object,</hi> as he saith it is, then 'tis the Duty and Perfection of our Nature to chuse to Love, or freely to affect the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Life and Being, our Food,

            <p>In a word, as God is the sole efficient Cause of my Intellectual Love in the true <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical</hi> Sense, by giving me the Faculties, and the Liberty by which I chuse Intellectual Good; so also on the same is he the cause of all my sensual Love, <hi>i. e.</hi> of my Love of the Body, of all the Conveniences and innocent

               <hi>And this,</hi> saith he, <hi>cannot be evil; for then 'twould be a sin to be in Love, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there would be a necessity of sinning, in order to Marriage, because no Man</hi> (not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>N.</hi>) <hi>is supposed to Marry but whom he thus loves</hi>; and so Mr. <hi>N.</hi> being Married, had once a sensual Desire of a sensual Good without Sin; and therefore was not obliged by this Commandment to make God the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Object of his Love of Desire.

God's Right therefore in this Case can be only this, that I never love any sensual Good against him, or to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of him, but rather that I love it only in Relation, or in Subordination, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to him, not that I love it not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I lay down this an evident and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Proposition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 2. §. 3.</note> that the natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Will is to Good in General.<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60499:73"/>
But now how can the Will be moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Good in General, but by being moved towards All Good; for to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved towards Good as Good, is to be moved towards All Good. And how can the Will be moved towards All Good, but by being moved towards an Universal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who in himself is, and contains All Good?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>This is a piece of <hi>Sophistry,</hi> and a meer Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy; for when we say the Will is moved to Good in General, the meaning of those words is only this, <hi>That nothing but what is Good in reality or appearance can move the Will,</hi> or <hi>that it is always moved by some or other of those things which are contained within the Compass or the Sphere of Good</hi>; not that in all its Motions or Elections it desires all that can be called Good. <hi>V. G.</hi> I desire to eat when I am hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, to drink when I am thirsty, to take my rest when I am sleepy, not that I think All that is Good is contained in my Food, Drink or Sleep.</p>
            <p>Moreover, to be moved <hi>towards Good as Good,</hi> is not to be moved <hi>towards All Good,</hi> but to be moved towards any particular Object, <hi>sub ratione boni,</hi> under this Prospect that it is, some way or other, Good for me to enjoy that Object; even as to be moved towards <hi>Evil as Evil, i. e. sub ratione mali</hi> is not to be moved to all that is evil, but to be moved to evil, under the Apprehension or Conviction that it is evil,<note place="margin">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60499:73"/>
from God towards it, but to the contrary</hi>; which Mr. <hi>N.</hi> phancies to be the only reason why we cannot possibly Will, or Love evil, as evil. For that would prove as much that we cannot love Evil at all, under the false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Good; for sure <hi>we have no motion to it from God</hi> under that false appearance, but to the contrary: Sure the desiring of Evil can in no sense be the natural and <hi>proper effect of that great Impression whereby God moves us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually towards himself.</hi> But the plain reason of it is, because to Will <hi>Evil, as Evil,</hi> is to desire it because it is not desirable; which is, to move towards it without a motive. And, 2<hi>dly,</hi> because 'tis to desire what is pernicious to me, because it is so; which is contrary to the first Principle of self-Preservation God hath planted in us. And hence ariseth also a demonstration, that the Will is not always moved to Good in General, or towards all Good, because it is so often and so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully moved to Good apparent only, which being in it self Evil, and only in appearance Good, we can have no motion to it from that God whom, saith he, we move to by moving towards Good in General, nor can it be the effect of <hi>that General impression by which God moves us continually to himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>N.</hi> farther argues thus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 3. §. 4.</note>
               <q>That as God is the Author of this motion, so is he the end of it too,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Serm. p.</hi> 17.</note> and he moves us to good no otherwise than by moving us towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For can God move us towards the Creature? Can he move us from himself?
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60499:74"/>
Can he act for a Creature? Can he make a Creature his end? Does not God make all things for himself? Is he not always his own end? Hath not this the evidence of a first Principle, that God acts only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</q>

               <hi>V. Gr. God cannot act but by his Will, that's most certain,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> not by his Power, not by his Knowledge, not by his Wisdom, but only by his Will, wonderful confidence.) <hi>But now the Will of God is not, as in us, an Expression that he receives from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himself,</hi> (i. e. I suppose the Word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression may be the Printers, not the Authors fault;) <hi>and which accordingly carries him out from himself, but an inward self-centring Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that both derives from, and terminates in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> (as <hi>V. G.</hi> his Will to create the World, and all things in it, his Will to Redeem Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, his Will to Judge the World.) <hi>For as God is to himself his own Good, his own Center, and beautiful Object, so the Love of God can be no other than the Love of himself: Whence it will follow, that as God must therefore be his own End, and what ever he Wills, or Acts, he must Will and Act for himself; so that the Love that is in us</hi> (to Cherries) <hi>must be the effect of that very Love which God hath for himself; there being no other Principle in the Nature of God</hi> (no Wisdom, Power, Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>by which he is supposed to Act.</hi> Now, not to insist on many other Mistakes contained in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and briefly hinted in the Parenthesis, I answer.</p>

We take too much upon us, if we imagine that the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God can be concerned whether such blind Creatures as we are, approve or disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his Proceedings; or that he really can suffer any diminution of his Glory by our dislike, or is advanced in honour by our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of his Dispensations. We think too meanly of, and we detract from his Great Majesty, if we conceive that he is tickled with Applause, and chiefly aims at Reputation from us in all his glorious Designs, this being such a weakness in our fellow-Creature, as is stiled Ambition, and <hi>loving of the Praise of Men,</hi> a Crime which he will punish in them; and so it cannot be the great Design of all the Dispensations of his Providence. That
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60499:76"/>
therefore, such as we should think well of him can be no farther his concern, than as it serves the nobler Ends of his great Goodness; <hi>viz.</hi> that these Conceptions may engage us to that Affection to, that Imitation of him, and that Obedience to him, which tends to the promotion of our Happiness.</p>
            <p>God therefore acteth for his Glory when he discovers to the World those Excellencies and Perfections of his Nature, which are just motives to the performance of that Duty which we owe unto him; or when he doth display before us those imitable. Perfections in which it is our Glory to be like him. But then, it farther is to be observed, that God, in the discovery of these Divine Perfections to the World, designs as well the Benefit and Happiness of Man, as the advancement of his Honour. For when he doth discover all those Attributes which represent him Good and Merciful, kind and obliging to the Sons of Men, he doth it with design, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner very proper to lay the highest Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on us to Returns of Love and Gratitude, and to engage us to that Imitation of his Goodness and Mercy to our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which renders us partakers of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> and helpful to others in all their Exigencies and Distresses. When he gives signal Demonstrations of his Almighty Power, and of his great Wisdom, he designs by this to teach us, that he is able to foresee, and to divert those Evils which may at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal us; to rescue us from all our Miseries, and to confer the greatest Blessings on his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;

               </gap>ations to the Throne of Grace for suitable help in time of need, and to serve him faithfully in expectation of his Favour and Protection. When he manifests himself to be a God of Truth, and Faithfulness, one who will punctually perform his promises to, and execute his Threats upon us, he doth this chiefly to affright us from those Sins which make it necessary for his Justice to be severe upon us, and to provoke us to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of those Duties to which he hath annexed the greatest Blessings. When he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that his Holiness and Justice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not permit the Wicked to escape his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, or any upright Soul to want the tokens of his Love, or the reward of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience; his great design in all this is, that Sin, which is the rise of all our Miseries, may be avoided, and Holiness, which is the true advancement, and the best accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Humane Nature, may be more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pursued by us. So that God's acting for his Glory, is also acting for the Good of his most noble Creatures; 'tis only recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending himself to their good Liking and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that so he may the more effectually promote their Happiness.

            <p>To this Question therefore, <hi>Can God move us towards a Creature?

Does he not move the hungry Appetite to desire Meat, the thirsty Drink, the naked to desire Cloths, the Poor supply of his Wants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And doth he not in all these Cases move us towards the Creature? Hath not God made these things the matter of his Promises, and his Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to Duty? entailing upon Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60499:78"/>
               <hi>the Promises of this Life?</hi> and engaging to them who <hi>seek first the Kingdom of God, that all other things shall be added to them? We</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are by him moved towards the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a motive to the Enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And sure thus moving us to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to move <hi>us from himself,</hi> but to himself by means very proper to excite us to love, obey, and cleave unto him who doth thus <hi>load us with his Blessings, and poureth his Benefits upon us</hi>; as the whole Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the whole Law of <hi>Moses</hi> testifies.</p>

                  </note>The Love here discoursed of and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, is the Love of a God, that is, of all that is Good, of all that is Perfect, of all that is Lovely, of all that is Desirable, in short, of all that truly is; and can any Love be too great or too high for such an Object? Or, rather doth he not deserve infinitely more than we, or any of his Creatures can bestow upon him? What, can infinite Good be loved too much? Or is any degree of Love too high for him who is infinitely lovely, and who infinitely loves himself! —And why then should it be thought such a stretch of the Love of God, to make it intire and exclusive of all other Loves? Can we love God too much, or Creatures too little?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That what I have discoursed is sufficient to evince that this is <hi>such a stretch of the Love of God,</hi> as renders it inconsistent with our Duty, and Obligation
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60499:78"/>
to pray for any temporal Blessings which we want. That it tends to depreciate the Gifts of God, and to impair the sense of Divine Goodness in them; to destroy all our Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in our Callings, and all pursuit of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Enjoyments by our honest Labours: That it removes the natural Foundation of all Injustice, and cramps all charitable Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: That it casts a vile Contempt upon the Works both of Creation and of Providence: And lastly, that it casts this imputation upon the Just and Holy God, that he hath made that our Sin, which is Natural and Necessary: As sure it is, to desire Food when we are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; that he will not allow us to desire what he knows we have need of. It makes him to have planted in us natural Appetites and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires which he intended we should gratifie, and yet hath not permitted us to desire that which alone can gratifie them. And sure, if this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> do all, or any of these things, it by so doing must stretch this Duty of the Love of God beyond the bounds prescribed to it by our God, and <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God be <hi>all that truly is,</hi> all that is not God, truly is not; and what is not, can have no Love to God, or any other thing. So that this stretch of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> destroys that Love he recommends. Moreover, to say that God is <hi>all that is Good,</hi> is to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict God himself, who said of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that he made, that <hi>they were very Good:</hi> To say that he is <hi>all that is lovely, all that is desirable,</hi> is to beg the Question. Again, that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60499:79"/>
               <hi>God deserves infinitely more than we can bestow upon him, that an infinite Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be loved too much, i. e.</hi> more than he deserves, is very true, but not pertinent; for we can be no more obliged to love God, than we are to serve him as he deserves; which we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do: For he deserves to be served answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Reward that he hath promised; but can we perform such Service? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves Perfect and Angelical Obedience; but are we therefore, in this State of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, obliged to it? The Question is not, What is too much for him, if we could perform it, but, What he hath made our Duty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth expect we should perform. Now hath he made it our Duty so to love him, as not to love our selves; not to love Health and Pleasure, not to desire Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any other Blessing he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as the Reward of our Obedience? If not, 'tis evident that Duty of Affection which we owe unto him cannot be exclusive of all love of the Creature.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Absurdity of this way of Arguing will best appear by the propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some <hi>Parallel Instances,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <q>The Duty which we recommend is the desire of Happiness and Salvation, that is, of all that is truly lovely and desirable, of the truest Riches, the Divinest Honours, the most Ravishing Delights, of the Vision of God in Glory, the Enjoyment of him, the being made like him, and seeing him as he is: And can any desire be too Great, or too High for such an Object, or rather doth it not deserve infinitely more than we are able to bestow upon it? What, can an Endless Happiness, and Immense Glory be desired too much? Why then should it be thought such a stretch of the Desire of Happiness, to make it Intire and Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of all Labour for the World? Can we love Happiness too much, or the World too little?</q>
I appeal to the Judicious Reader whether the Argument of the <hi>Massalian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>

            <p>What he has more to say upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is directly levelled against those Persons, if there be any such in the World, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Love required in the Command, <hi>to love our Neighbour as our selves</hi> is a love, or <hi>desire our Neighbour as our Good,</hi> which I have shewed to be a Contradiction <hi>in adjecto</hi>; the desire of our Neighbour as our Good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not properly love of our Neighbour, but our selves; and therefore though some <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> do, and reasonably may, say that Mr. <hi>N.</hi>'s Exposition of the First Command ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it <hi>inconsistent with the Second,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires me <hi>to love my Neighbour as my self,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it excludes me from the desire of those Creatures by which I may do good to him, and give him the things needful for the Body, as I do to my self; yet I desire one Instance of one of those <hi>many</hi> who ever said that the Love of our Neighbour in this Precept,<note place="margin">

<q>Is it once to be thought that God who is Infinitely Good, Infinitely desirable, Infinitely deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our highest Affections, nay of our whole Love, and withal Infinitely able to satisfie and reward it, should command us to love and desire a Creature as vain and infirm, and as much a shadow as our selves? Is it to be thought that he should first call us to himself, and then, as if he alone were not able to suffice for us, and to satisfie the enlarged Appetites which he had given us, should call in the Creatures to part of the Expence, and send us from himself to them?

who is so indifferent towards it, as that he cares not tho' he spend that in Gaming, or squander it away in Prodigality, which had he been more concerned to keep it, might have preserved himself and his Family from Want and Misery? What thinks he of the Tradesman, who is so indifferent towards the Creature, that he will not give himself the trouble to consider whether he thrives or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays in his Trade or Calling, till at last he breaks, and robs many, who had Dealings with him, of their Right?

Divine Contemplation,</hi> and <hi>Union with God,</hi> as that he hath withdrawn his Desires wholly from the Concerns of his Estate, his Family, or his own Body.

<q>Lord, I have been so indifferent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those Creatures which are thy signal Blessings, and thy gracious Gifts, to which all Mankind owe the Preservation of their Souls in Life; that I have not thought them worthy of the least desire, or been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pray to thee for my daily Bread.

not that he wills it from within, or for it self, but only from without, and for the sake of something else, as it is necessary to the Order of his Justice; for had there been no Sin, there never would have been such a thing as Pain, which is a plain Argument that God wills our Pleasure as we are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and our Pain only as we are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but now in measuring our Devoirs to God, we are not to consider how he stands affected to us as Sinners, but how he stands affected to us as Creatures.</q>

why he should be thought the <hi>natural, genuine and direct Cause of the first,</hi> and only <hi>indirectly and by accident</hi> the Cause of the latter?</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>God,</hi> saith he, <hi>wills our Pleasures as we are Creatures, and our Pain only as we are Sinners.</hi> He would do well to reconcile this with the Sentiments of Mr. <hi>Malbranch,</hi> That <hi>we being Sinners,</hi>

               <hi>and by consequence unworthy to be recompens'd by agreeable Sentiments, oblige God, in consequence of his immutable Will to make us feel Pleasure in the time that we offend him:</hi> What also doth he think of the Pains of Bruit Beasts, which by his Argument must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by God only; Doth God produce in them pain only as they are Sinners? What of the pains of the <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> flagrant in Flames of Love to God, are they inflicted on them only as they are Sinners? Is it not for the Tryal of their Faith, Patience, Love and Obedience,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.7.</note> that <hi>the Tryal of their Faith might be found to their Praise, Honour and Glory at the Revelation of the Lord Iesus?</hi> What thinks he of the direful Agonies and Sufferings of the <hi>Blessed Iesus,</hi> was he also a Sinner?

            </p>
            <p>In fine, 'tis certain that the Wicked find the same sentiments of Delight and sensual Pleasures in their sinful, as do the Righteous in their lawful Actions; <hi>viz.</hi> the lustful Person in his unchast Embraces, as the Good Man in the Marriage-Bed.

very Charming, and her devout Affections highly commendable, but her Arguments sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom reach the point; and when they do, their strength is not equal to the Beauty of the Stile.</p>

Let her go on with her chast Rhetorick and Holy Flames, to beat down this inordinate Affection to the Creature; and we will equally admire, and approve her sayings.

            </p>
            <p>Now doth she here mean the corrupt manners of the World? Her Proposition is invincible; but reaches not the point. If she means the good Things of the World, Food, Drink, Clothes, Houses, Lands, Orchards, Gold or Silver, I hope the danger of assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is not here very great.

               </note>It is not only hard, but it is sinful to keep our selves from desiring the Creature; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep our selves from desiring what God hath promised, and made the matter of our daily Prayer, and to rob our selves of all the Pleasure which ariseth from the <hi>Gratification of our natural Appetites or Desires according to,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Nor is it true, That <hi>it is easier not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire at all, than to desire with moderation.</hi> For doubtless, this Excellent <hi>Lady</hi> desires rest and sleep when she doth want them, Food when she is hungry, and Drink when she is thirsty, and Health when she is sick, and desires all these things with moderation; but can she with more ease abstain from desiring them at all?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though we permit desire; yet if we do not permit it to exceed the real Necessities of Nature, and the bounds which <hi>Scripture</hi> hath set to it, and <hi>having Food and Raiment are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content:</hi> If we pursue the Comforts of this present Life, or the Gratifications of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Appetites <hi>according to, and so as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Intention of Nature</hi>; if we pursue them in relation to, and in due Submission to the

Will of God; and only by those means, and in those measures he allows of, as Reason and <hi>Scripture</hi> do require, we cannot be immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and therefore not irregular in the desire of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Hopes, our Fears, our Grief, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light are subject to the like Irregularities; but must we therefore never permit these Passions to move towards their proper Objects? In fine, love of Benevolence toward our selves, our Friends, Relations, and our Life are too oft excessive, and are indeed the Root of that immoderate desire we have for the Creature; and yet they are commanded. It will not therefore follow, That we may not desire temporal good things at all, because these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires are subject to Irregularity.</p>

               </note>I have already granted that these Creatures are not desired to satisfie the Soul, but to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Wants of the Body. Now is there any necessity in that fulness which the Earth affords for all, that I should desire what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hath; or that my desire of Meat, Drink and Clothing, which is all that Nature craves, and with which <hi>Christianity</hi> requires me to be content, should move me to cross the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural desires of others to have Meat, Drink and Clothes, when Providence hath made a plentiful provision of these things for us all? A desire thus limitted to <hi>contentment with Food and Raiment,</hi> lays a sure Fund for Charity to others, by disposing us to part with what is not thus necessary for our selves, to supply our Brother's Wants; which is all that Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>

We desire only in order to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; nothing being desirable any farther, than as it promotes that end: But the Love of the Creature is more apt to hinder, than advance our Happiness; and therefore in all Reason, Creatures are not to be thought desirable.</q>

Wants. For what we so far need, as that we are not able to live without it, we must desire, as much as we desire to subsist; tho' the desire of Life it self should be in order to God's Glory, and the Welfare of our Souls: And therefore in that sense even the desire of that Food by which we do sustain that Life, is a desire of it in order to our Happiness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To say this Generally, and without all Restriction, that the Love, that is, as she her self Interprets it, the desire of the Creature <hi>is more apt to hinder than advance our Happiness,</hi> is in effect to say that God himself doth move us to love and to obey him by the promise of things <hi>more apt to hinder than advance our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>; and that he hath Implanted in us na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Desires of such things; and that our Lord commands us daily to desire and pray for what rather tends to <hi>hinder than advance our Happiness.</hi>

               <hi>that what we love will be uppermost in our minds</hi>; I desire her to consider, that 'tis a contradiction to say, That what I love only in relation, and in Subordination to another, whom I do value above all things, should be uppermost in my Mind; that is, preferred in my Mind before that very Being my Mind doth value much above it.</p>
