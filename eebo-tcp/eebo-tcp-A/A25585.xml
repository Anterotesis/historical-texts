            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>IN the name of the fiend, what the Rump up agin,</l>
               <l>The Delk, and the good old cause,</l>
               <l>If they settle agin, which to think were a sin,</l>
               <l>Good-night to Religion and Laws.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>First Tithes must go down like a sprig of the Crown,</l>
               <l>Although J. Presbiter grumble;</l>
               <l>Already they tell's our Lead and our Bells</l>
               <l>They'l sell, next our Churches must tumble.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This poor <hi>English</hi> Nation, by this Generation</l>
               <l>Hath been grieved 11. years and more,</l>
               <l>But in that season, and not without reason,</l>
               <l>They ha'thrice been turnd out of door.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Which they please to call force, yet themselves can do worse,</l>
               <l>For this Piercel of a House</l>
               <l>Dare keep out of door, thrice as many more,</l>
               <l>And value the Law not a Louse.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>First by Owl-light they met, and by that light they set,</l>
               <l>The reason of it mark,</l>
               <l>Their acts and the light, do differ quite,</l>
               <l>Their deeds do best with the dark.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Esquire <hi>Lenthall</hi> had swore, he'd sit there no more,</l>
               <l>Unlesse in with Oxen they drew him,</l>
               <l>That he once might speak true, they pick'd him out two,</l>
               <l>Sent <hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi> to him.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When these Gamsters were pack'd, the first gracious act</l>
               <l>Was for pence for their friends of the Army,</l>
               <l>Who for any side fight, except't be the right;</l>
               <l>Sixscore thousand a month won't harm ye.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet many there be, say the House is not free,</l>
               <l>When I am sure of that,</l>
               <l>T'one another they are so free, that the Nation do see,</l>
               <l>Their too free for us to be fat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Religion they wav'd, now they had us enslav'd</l>
               <l>And got us sure in their Claw,</l>
               <l>They puld of their mask, and set us our task,</l>
               <l>Which is next to make Brick without Straw.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The next act they made, was for helping of Trade,</l>
               <l>So they settled again the Excise,</l>
               <l>Which the City must pay, for ever and aye,</l>
               <l>Yet might have chose had they been wise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To pull down their K. their plate they could bring,</l>
               <l>And other precious things,</l>
               <l>So that <hi>Segwick</hi> and <hi>Peters,</hi> were no small getters</l>
               <l>By their bodkins, thimbles and rings.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when for the good of the Nation 'twas stood</l>
               <l>Half ruined and forlorne,</l>
               <l>Though't lay in their power, to redeem't in an hour,</l>
               <l>Not a Citizen put out his horn.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>They had manacled their hands, with Kings &amp; Bishops Lands,</l>
               <l>And ruin'd the whole Nation,</l>
               <l>So that no body cares, though they and their heirs,</l>
               <l>Be Cornute to the third generation.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>May their wives on them frown, but laugh and lie down,</l>
               <l>To any one else turn up Trump,</l>
               <l>To mend the breed, as I think there is need</l>
