            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> for my <hi>injurious</hi> words [<hi>Plus Ultra,</hi> pa. 7. 8.] Had I spoken any <hi>there</hi> about <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> or, did I think that any <hi>one</hi> Physician, that doth not <hi>want Physick</hi> himself, understands me to have as much as <hi>meant</hi> any thing to <hi>their</hi> prejudice, I should give them what <hi>Reparation</hi> they can expect: But all that you have objected about the <hi>Cut-Finger,</hi> and the <hi>Injury</hi> done your <hi>Faculty,</hi> I have proved to be meer impertinent Malice, that longed to pick a Quarrel. And I shall now give you a <hi>further</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that whole Paragraph you have transcribed, and raised such Clamours against.</p>
            <p>If in Discoursing of it I can shew, that the <hi>substance</hi> of those Periods, and the most <hi>obnoxious</hi> Passage <hi>there,</hi> is to be found <hi>largely,</hi> and <hi>often</hi> insisted on by so Great, Learned, and Wise a Man as my LORD <hi>BACON,</hi> I hope I may be excused for having spoken after so profound, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> that was no Enemy to <hi>Physicians,</hi> or any sort of Learned Men.</p>
            <p>I repeat my Periods as you have cited them: [<hi>The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Experimenters think that the Philosophers of elder Times, though their Wits were excellent, yet the Way they took was not like to bring much advantage to Knowledge, or any of the Uses</hi>

            <p>I say, the <hi>Experimenters think,</hi> and undertake to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the <hi>Sence</hi> of some of those Philosophers, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it.

But in whatever he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd as to the Publique, I was unacquainted with those Affairs, and was so young, as that I did not then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the State of the <hi>Case</hi> between the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and had been hitherto bred under such <hi>invin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ado Presbyter,</hi> as you do [p. 34, the first of your <hi>Praefaces,</hi>] I never concern'd my self about the <hi>Disputes</hi> of <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,</hi> till the Year before the <hi>King</hi>'s coming in, when, upon Inquiry into the matter, my Judgment voted for <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,</hi> and accordingly I suddenly took Orders upon His <hi>Majesties</hi> Return, from the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> but never was in <hi>any</hi> before: So that you might with as much justice have call'd me <hi>Quaker</hi> (which another Huff did) as <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> But now I remember, you are not to mind what <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>justice</hi> there is in the <hi>Imputations</hi> you bestow: If they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Reproach,</hi> 'tis sufficient for your purpose.</p>
            <p>And that you regard nothing else in the <hi>Characters</hi> you bestow, 'tis further evident from your styling me <hi>Ecebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who was a <hi>shuffling Apostate,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> that I should say was <hi>like</hi> a <hi>Physician</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> but that he <hi>repented.</hi> And why <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> I pray? I never joyn'd my self with any of the Sects; I never frequented their Meetings; I never espoused their Principles; I never received Sacrament, or Orders, or Preferment from them. On the contrary, I overcame the Prejudices of Education even in those times; and as soon as ever I had inquired, pleaded for the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and declared against the Practices and Opinions of the Prevailing Parties, though it were against my Interest, and exposed me to the displeasure of those that could prefer or ruine me. <hi>This</hi> I did, when there were no hopes of better Times: And how come I then to be <hi>Ecebolius?</hi> But cry you mercy Sir, now I think on't, you are not to be ask'd a Reason for any thing you say, or do; Reason is too <hi>cold</hi> a thing for your temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>M. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> I have almost done with you for the present; only give me leave to ask you a few Questions between you, and me. Your great Pretences are the Interests of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:53421:20"/>
and <hi>Religion;</hi> Pray do you remember what a certain <hi>Physician</hi> for <hi>His Majesty</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> advised Col. <hi>D.</hi> in <hi>that</hi> Island; and when he was slighted by that Loyal Gentleman, what he counsell'd my Lord <hi>M.</hi> in the same place? Do you remember who talk'd of several <hi>hundred Gospels</hi> that were of old, and made <hi>those we have to owe their Credit to Chance,</hi> in a Discourse to me and two others of <hi>Oxford?</hi> Can you call to mind who told me at Sir <hi>J. L</hi>'s Table at <hi>Bath,</hi> That being sick, he prepar'd himself for Death with <hi>Lucretius,</hi> and <hi>Beregardus,</hi> and being ask'd, whether he had not the <hi>Bible</hi> to help prepare him, made a <hi>pish</hi> of it, and said, That <hi>he had not seen a BIBLE in seven Years before, and that it was good for nothing but to make Folks humorsom?</hi> Do you remember who affirm'd to me, in the Presence of Sir <hi>F. H.</hi> and other Gentlemen, <hi>That there was no more reason to believe there is a God, than to believe there is none;</hi> That he believ'd it, <hi>because he could not help it; and could not help it, because he was carried by an unaccountable impulse;</hi> That the <hi>Arguments</hi> to <hi>prove a Deity,</hi> drawn from <hi>that Wisdom, Beauty, Order,</hi> and <hi>Usefulness</hi> that is in the Frame of the Creation, signifie nothing, because We cannot tell what Is <hi>Wisdom, Beauty,</hi> or <hi>Order?</hi> Do you not know the Gentleman that discours'd <hi>thus?</hi> And have you not forgot the <hi>Letter</hi> that my Lord <hi>M.</hi> hath of the same Person's, and with what carnestness he beseech'd his Lordship not to let it be seen by the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> for fear of his being ruined by it?

of any <hi>Stubbes</hi> that were <hi>hang'd:</hi> I perceive by it, that you are not acquainted with your own <hi>Pedigree;</hi> I'le there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inform you, that you are not the first of the Name who hath deserved well of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> In M. <hi>Heath</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle</hi> of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> p. 856, 857. <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. you will find among divers others convicted of a Conspiracy against the <hi>King, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> one <hi>Francis Stubbes,</hi> a Cheesemonger, was executed with his Accomplices, and <hi>Quarter'd</hi> as a <hi>Traytor.</hi> And another Name-sake of yours, <hi>John Stubbes,</hi> had his Right Hand cut off on a Scaffold erected in Palace-yard, for a Seditious Book, intituled <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago,</hi> in which he vented abominable Reproaches against the Queen, and for that was so punish'd, as you may see in <hi>Cambden's Elizabeth.</hi> You may thank God, and a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King, that you have had a better Fate than those others of your Name: I wish you may never meet with the Reward of your Deserts, as those other <hi>Stubbes</hi> did; but may <hi>repent,</hi> and be <hi>wise</hi> on this side the <hi>Place, where many Friends part.</hi>
