            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſad Relation of a Dreadful Fire at <hi>Cottenham,</hi> Four Miles diſtant from <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat I may not trouble the Reader with a prefatory introduction to ſo ſad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable an accident, there is a place of conſiderable note in the County of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> four miles diſtant from that famous Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> called <hi>Cottenham;</hi> it lyes in the Rode to <hi>Ely,</hi> and though it be not a Market-Town, and ſo properly called a Village, yet for the number and compactneſs, of the houſes, the wealth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and conſiderableneſs of their traffique, it equals many eminent Towns in <hi>England,</hi> and is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that gives too remarkable an occaſion for the preſent Relation.</p>
            <p>It conſiſts chiefly in one fair Street that is above a mile in length, formerly called <hi>Fenning-Street,</hi> but of late years Vulgarly termed, and better known by the name of <hi>Church-ſtreet:</hi> moſt of the Inhabitats are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64959:3"/>
Yeomen, and ſubſtantial Farmers, ſo that their Barns and backſides were full of Corn, Straw, hay, Stacks of Faggots, Turff, and ſuch like combuſtible matter, which with the drought of the ſeaſon, and their ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of water, could not but give great advantage to that great deſtroyer which within the ſpace of five hours, conſumed above a hundred houſes, beſides a great number of Barns, Stables, and other out-houſes, to a value greater then at the preſent can be comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>This Dreadful fire began on Saturday the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt paſt, about ten of the Clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when moſt of the Inhabitants were gone to <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Market, ſo that what ever aſsiſtance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief they might otherwiſe have hoped for, they were utterly deprived of almoſt any other then their tears, and prayers; And though many poor wretches have been apt to think that had they had more help, they might have prevented, or at leaſt have abated its fury, yet when providence is pleas'd to ordain it ſhall be thus, it is in vain for poor Mortals to fancy it might have been otherwiſe. Not but that I think we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to take all immaginable care to prevent ſuch diſaſters, and to uſe the utmoſt of our endeavours to ſuppreſs this common enemy of mankind, but I ſay, when all this will not do, 'tis then but a fooliſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpection either to blame the perſon through whoſe negligence or misfortune the calamity came, or to ſay if it had been ſo it had never been as it is.</p>
            <p>I have made this ſhort derivation from the ſtory in behalf of the perſon who was the unhappy occaſion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64959:3"/>
or rather Inſtrument of this unfortunate accident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know people that ſuffer in any general calmity are exceedingly apt to blame ſuch as are any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the cauſe, though they are more than equal ſufferers in the effect, which is (if not an unjuſt) I am ſure a very imprudent accrimination: the perſon I aim at is a Farmers Wife of <hi>Cottenham,</hi> well ſtricken in years, of whom I ſhall not attempt to give a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter becauſe it may ſeem altogether impertinent to my purpoſe; let it ſuffice that whatſoever miſchief ſhe were the occaſion of, the ſequel of the ſtory will make it appear ſhe did it not with a miſchievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but meerly through misfortune or inadvertency, for having newly baked, ſhe took ſome of the embers, imagining they had been out, and carried them into the back-ſide in a ſcuttle, and there threw them down with the ſcuttle over them, near to a ſtack of courſe ſedge, which they uſe in that Countrey to heat O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and upon ſeveral other occaſions, they call it by the name of a Stuff-Reek; and (I know not how) the embers coming into the freſh air, it ſeems they began to glow, and to lay hold of ſome ſcattering ſtraw or other combuſtible matter near at hand, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to creep to the Reek, which being looſe and very dry, was immediately blown up into a fierce and violent flame: This preſently alarm'd the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who immediately ran and uſed their utmoſt endeavours to extinguiſh it in its infancy, knowing how tyrannical a Maſter Fire is, when once it ceaſes to be a ſervant; But in ſpight of their moſt careful and induſtrious endeavours, in a very ſhort time it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64959:4"/>
conſumed not onely the Reek where it begun, but all the Out-houſes, Barns, Stables, and Dwelling-Houſe of the ſaid Farmer <hi>B.</hi> and that with ſo much fury (the wind blowing pretty freſh) that great flakes of flaming ſtraw were carried into the Aair, and carried more then a furlong from the place.</p>
            <p>This Farmers houſe ſtood almoſt at the entrance of the Town, at a place they call <hi>Green-end,</hi> ſo the next houſe remaining entire, the people were in hopes it would have ended there; but one of the Flakes it ſeems was blown over the next houſe, and leaving it ſtanding, as a remarkable ſignal of Gods mercy, took fire of the next beyond it, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtop or ſtay vvent raging on vvith all immagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fury, on both ſides of the ſtreet, and in ſpight of Engines or any other aſsiſtance, burn'd dovvn the vvhole ſtreet as far as the Church, before three a Clock in the Afternoon, vvhich is in diſtance of Ground neer three quarters of a Mile, there being more than a hundred dvvelling houſes, beſides Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, Corn, Hay, Turff, &amp;c. conſumed in that ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Near the Church ſtands the houſe of an eminent Doctor in divinity, vvhoſe Barns, Stables, &amp;c. vvere all burn'd, yet his dwelling houſe ſaved; but a ſervant of his returning into a houſe that vvas a fire, vvas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſurprized, the roof falling in, and ſcorched in ſo miſerable a manner that if he be not already dead, it ſeems in humane conjecture an impoſsible thing he ſhould recover: vvhich is the onely man, I hear of, that ſuffered by the fire as to his perſon; there vvas
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64959:4"/>
at the firſt a difcourſe of two Children that were burned to aſhes, but upon examination I cannot find that there was any thing of truth, or ground for that report, nevertheleſs at the time of my leaving the Town (which was but on Saturday-night) it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to hear of all the miſchief that this ſad and implacable enemy had wrought there, for the people were full of complaints when they miſſed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Relations, fearing they might be Burned in thoſe mercileſs flames, with which they ſometimes ſo encompaſſed, that the moſt wary could hardly find a way to eſcape.</p>
            <p>And now having given you this ſhort and true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſo ſad an accident, I hope thoſe to whoſe hands it ſhall come, will not be contented barely to gratifie their curioſities in a curſory peruſal of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (forſooth) i is a ſtrange ſtory; This is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and uncharitable employment for the thoughts of any perſon that is ſerious or good, and looks as if a man took a kind of delight in novelty, though the Subject were never ſo Tragical; and truly I ſhould be very ſorry (as much Pamphlet as this is) that ever it ſhould come into ſuch a hand. For I look upon every perſon that reads this ſtory to be ſo far concerned in it, as to bleſs God that has ſpared him a competency of Temporal Bleſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings, and to commiſerate thoſe poor ſouls upon whom this judgement is fallen, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hereafter (if there ſhould be any occaſion) to contribute ſomething to the reparation of their loſſes, or at leaſt, to pay them the juſt tribute of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64959:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And as for thoſe that have been ſufferers by this or any ſuch like Calamity (if I might be thought worthy to adviſe them) methinks they would do well to bear their afflictions with patience, and acquieſie in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Gods providence, without murmuring or repining at the inſtrument, and look on themſelves as the Authors of their own misfortunes; had not they ſin'd doubtleſs God had not puniſh'd them; therefore let no man ſay I am injured; but follow his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chearfully, and doubtleſs God will either raiſe his fortunes to his mind, or humble his mind to his condition which is known by every one that enjoys it to be the greateſt of worldly bleſſings.</p>
