            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>m me with his own weapen. Thus Dauids beating down that Tower of the Philistines, seemed to the Israelites, to haue been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest ouer ten thowsand Enemies, <hi>Saul percussit mille, &amp; Dauid decem mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> because he cut of Golias head, with Golias sword. Thus the sone of God &amp; our dearest Sauiour, purchast the noblest of all victories, against the strongest of all Enimies, <hi>vt qui in ligno vincebat in ligno quoque vinceretur.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he who ouercame vs by a tree, was through him by a tree ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. And thus, our deare Redeemer hauing been furiously attacked by the Tempter in the desert with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his own word, put to flight and vanquished the same Tempter by
<pb facs="tcp:47142:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the authority of the same word which he had pressed against him. Hence it is, that not the sling of Dauid were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he begunne, but the sword of Golias was reserued, and wrapt vp in a holy Ephod, in the Tabernacle, as an eternall trophe, and monument of his victory. Hence, that anciently most ignominious, &amp; hatefull of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the crosse, is now erected in triumphal maner not only vppon the highest towers of Christian temples, but vppon the most sacred and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne heads of Christian Emperours. And hence it also is, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licque Church, hath soe carefully conserued, soe religiously honored, and gloriously triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed in those bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athes of diuinity the holy Scriptures, because that as her spouse stopt the fontaine, soe she by the heat of his spirit hath dried vp the troubled and diuided streames of all errours, and heresies, trough theyr heauenly light and authority.</p>
            <p>This is the victoty which I represent
<pb facs="tcp:47142:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in triumph in this present treatis, as the most heroicke amongst all others of the Romane Church; because it conquers heresie, by the weapen of heresie, vt qui <hi>in verbo pugnabant, in verbo quoque vincerentur; that those vvbo haue hitherto fought vvith the sole vvord, might be ouercome vvith the sole vvord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Romane Church, euen from the first Challenge of her aduersaries in these last ages, hath giuen them the foile (nay quite defeated them) at the weapens of Antiquity, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, vnity, succession, visibility, sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, miracles, Fathers, Councils, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, authority, but these were soe farre and clearly her weapens, that they scarce euer dirst lay clayme to any of them, and soe the victory (glassed in theyr eyes) seemes eyther none, or small, because not gayned with a weapen of theyr chusing, now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to accomplish what she hath soe prosperously attempted, she accepts the combat euen with that weapen,
<pb facs="tcp:47142:4"/>
which they take (by mistaking) to be theyr own.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>vvrit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en vvord of God, the sole vvritten vvord,</hi> to which all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peall, here they boast and glory, here they exult and triumph, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the victory, but befote the fight, this and this alone they take for theyr bucklar of defense, for theyr armour of proofe, for theyr deepe piercing dart, theyr swift flying arrow, and theyr sharp edged sword; this they brandish before the eyes of innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, with this they florish in theyr bookes, and Pulpits, in theyr publicque meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and priuate conuenticles, nay in the very streetes, and tauernes; and that soe seemingly with a glosse as false as it is faire, that they dazle the eyes of the vulgar, and strike them with admiration in each motion of it.</p>
            <p>Here they fully perswade themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that those of the Roman Church dare not medle with them, and take for granted, that whatsoeuer wee haue gained vppon them by other
<pb facs="tcp:47142:4"/>
weapens, yet wee yeeld our selues clerely conquered by this. So confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are our Aduersaries in theyr own conceipts! where as the Roman Church, neuer as yet acknowledged to haue been eyther worsted, or soe much as touched by any one text of Scripture which they euer pressed against her, witnesse the many &amp; lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge volumes of full and cleere answers to euery sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce objected by her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries. Neyther euer refused she to incounter her enemies, with this weapen of theyr own chusing. True it is she requiers iudges present, to see and determine which party hath the better in the incounter, but they refuse all other iudges (quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the light of reason) saue that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weapen where with rhey fight, and though she still keepe the feeld, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, &amp; maintaine the quarel, without soe much as yeelding eyther a step or hairs breadth, not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding she must be worsted, only because her aduersaries say she is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47142:5"/>What will an impartiall ey iudge of such proceedings? yet to shew how empty and vaine all these flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishes are, and how strong desires she hath of the eternall good of her enimies, rather then leaue them wholy destitute of redresse, she free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like an indulgent mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to theyr infirmities, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes her selfe to theyr wayward humours, and that soe farre, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the equitie of her cause euen to the iudgement of her very Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and confides with holy Dauid, <hi>&amp; inimici nostri sunt iudices,</hi> that euen her most forward enimies, will not be soe voyd of light, reason, and equity, as not to acknowledge her conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and themselue vanquished, euen in theyr own iudgements, and with theyr own weapen.</p>
            <p>Thus she enters the list, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides in the strength of her God and spouse that the day wil be hers. And findes noe surer meanes to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe it, then by disarming her eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb facs="tcp:47142:5"/>
because to dissarme him him, is to dissanimate him, for yeeld he must, when he can feight noe longer.</p>
            <p>I haue indeauored in this present Treatis, to giue my Readers an essay of this kinde of victory of the Roman Church, where in I hope he will finde it manifest that the texts which our Aduersaries vsually alleadge against the Romane doctrine in such points as I haue tuched, are not arguments, but mistakes.</p>
            <p>And that soe grosse and palpable that halfe an ey may discouer them. Thus therefore the matter stands, and the combat proceeds betwixt vs.</p>
            <p>Our Aduersaries haue now aboue a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeares proclamed through the eares of Christendome that the Romane Church resists the known truth, and the euident testimonies of the written word of God: a heauy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation! I demand in the poursuit of this discours, that these testimonies be cited and euidenced out of the authenticall editions, and originall
<pb facs="tcp:47142:6"/>
languages of the holy Bible. In place of these they presse the words of theyr own late translations. These I proue to be dissonant &amp; dissagreeing from the originall, and soe not the words of true Scripture, but of a false translation, will make against vs. They tell me that whatsoeuer the words are in the originall, yet the sense is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly against the Roman Church. I dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how, shall the sense (at least in theyr principle of sole Scripture) euer euidently appeare but by the words of the originall. They tell me, whatsoeuer the words be, yet the sense is euident. I reply that I am nothing mouued with theyr saing, without theyr prouuing. They bid me proue that it is not euident. I tell them, that it belongs to him who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, to proue his own assertion. which if they refuse, the whol world will discouer that they haue nothing eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the whol Bible against the Tenets of the Roman Church. Yet to comply beyond all obligation, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb facs="tcp:47142:6"/>
to proue that the texts which they most presse against vs, are neyther euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not soe much as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but euidently insufficient, and not soe much as capable of that sense which they draw from them to make them sound against vs, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nothing but pure mistakes.</p>
            <p>And yet farther, that nothing may be vvanting to a full victory, I presse against them clere vvords eyther out of theyr own Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slations, or out of the originall, the force whereof they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly auoyd, but eyther by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijng, the plaine and proper sense of the vvords, and flying to tropes, and figures, &amp; improprieties, &amp; shadows and abscurities, and that vvithout any necessity, saue only of mainteyning theyr own assertions; or translating the vvords in a secondary significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leauing the primary and most proper vvhen it makes against them, vvhich notvvithstanding they put in other places vvhere it makes not against them; or by translating the
<pb facs="tcp:47142:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>The discouery of these, and such like particulars, is the maine drift, and summe of this Treatis. vvhich I haue intiteled, <hi>Scripture mistaken the ground of Protestants,</hi> &amp;c. The occasion of my falling vppon which, vvas as follows.</p>
            <p>This Treatis, vvas at first a priuate controuersie, in answer to a long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalogue of texts, <hi>taken (and mistaken)</hi> out of the Protestants Bible, and sent to a Persone of quality, to diuert him from the Romane faith. Through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of friends I condescended, that it might passe the print, hoping that some might reape profit from it, and therefore couched it in a plaine &amp; easy stile that not only the learned,
<pb facs="tcp:47142:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the vulgar also might vnderstand it. I keepe my selfe close to Scripture in the vvhol processe, and connexion of my proofes eyther against my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary, or in my own cause, scarce affirming any thing vvhich I confirme not by one clere texr or other, and those such as I haue read, and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly examined my selfe, in vvhat language foeuer I cite them, and therefore, if any false dealing be found in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations I am content, (as in that case I should vvell deserue) to bere the shame of it. The texts whieh I answer, are those vvhich are commonly, and cheefly stood vppon by Protestants, and indeede vvhich mainly vvithhold them from imbracing the Romane faith, and the points of controuersie, such as are the most pressed against vs, and maintayned by our Aduersaries, soe that I haue noe reason to doubt, if the Readers be once conuinced that they haue noe ground against vs euen in theyr own Bible in these maine, and radicall controuersies, (as I am in
<pb facs="tcp:47142:8"/>
greate hope they vvil be) that they vvill at least beginne to suspect the vveakenesse of theyr own, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouer the strength of our cause, and soe put themselues in a fare vvay of returning to the bosome of that mother-church, from vvhich the late <hi>mistakers,</hi> and <hi>misusers</hi> of holy Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re haue seduced them. Some contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerfies of lesser moment set down in the paper, I haue here omitted (which I reserre to an other occasion) being now pressed, for vvant of time, to content my selfe vvith these.</p>
            <p>Wherein that I may proceed vppon a suer foote, I obserue this methode, first I set down plainly and vnques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, the Doctrine of the present Romane Church, deliuered as such in the expresse vvords of the Council of Trent, in each controuersy vvhich I treat, there by stating aright the question, &amp; disabusing the Protestant Readers, vvho are commonly vvholy missin formed of our doctrine, by a vvrong conceipt of it, in stilled into
<pb facs="tcp:47142:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, &amp; preserued in them, by eyther the malice, or ignorance of theyr Teachers.</p>
            <p>Secondly I set down the Protestant positions, eyther as I finde them in the paper, or in the nine-and thirty Articles of the English Protestant church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I cite and answer the texts, of the Aduersary, by discouuering clerely the seuerall <hi>mistakes</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in them. and lastly I alleadge some plaine passages of Scripture, as they stand in the Protestant Bible, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our doctrine.</p>
            <p>The greatest fauour therefore that I expect from you deare contrymen, is, that you spare me not, neyther in troughly examining what I alleadge, nor in demanding satisfaction in matters which you cannot fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, of persones abler, and learneder then your selues.</p>
            <p>Please therefore to ponder vvhat you read noe lesse impartially, then seriously, to disingage your selues
<pb facs="tcp:47142:9"/>
from that vvithdrawing bias, vvhich education, custome, contry, friends, selfe loue, will, and iudgement haue insensibly instilled into your harts. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with a strong &amp; humble desire to be informed aright, with a loue of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aboue all transitory interests of this short and miserable life, &amp; lastly haue your earnest recourse to Allm. God, both to discouer what is best for your etetnal welfare, and to imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce it when you haue discouered it, preferre God before creatures, your soul before your body, heauen before earth, and before time, eternity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Whence it is cleare, that according to the Council of Trent (to whose doctrine all those of the Romain Church hold themselues obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to subscribe) first, that wee pray not the Saints, That they Should procure any bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings by theyr sole force and vertu indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of God, but only that they present theyr praires to God to obteyne them of him, for vs, <hi>orationes suas pro hominibus Deo offerre,</hi> which plainely cleares vs from all idolatry, in this particular, both they and wee praying to the same one only God.

               <p>Lastly we are here taught, that this humble inuocation of the Saints (and the same is of Angels) is good &amp; profitable, but the Council teaches not, neyther giues any generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to inuoke them, nor that the actual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it is absolutly necessary to Saluation, or that noe man can be saued, who has not thus humbly inuoked the Saints, for theyr praires are only furthering helpes, not necessary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes to Saluation, soe that, noe man is bound to beleeue any absolute necessity of it, but in rigour it is sufficient not to reiect it as bad, or

                        <note place="margin">Ps. 31.23.</note> for if God only that is none saue God were to be loued then noe man were to loue his neighbour, which not with standing is most strictly commanded, as all know, nor husbands to loue theyr wiues, which S.

Mat. 4.10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God</hi>; howsoeuer that text Psal. 99. is mistranslated by Protestants, as I shall shew here after. Ande the Prophete Isay foretels that the enimies of Hierusalem, should worship the steps of her feete, Isay 60.14. but what soeuer be meant by those steps, certainly it cannot be God, therefore the text of Scripture, cited Mat. 4. commands not, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47142:12"/>
God <hi>only</hi> should be worshipped. If any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant shoud say, that though the word <hi>only,</hi> be not ioyned to <hi>worship,</hi> yet it is ioyned <hi>to serue</hi> in the text cited, Mat. 4. <hi>and him only shalt thou serue,</hi> which seemes to be of as much force, as if it were ioyned to <hi>worship.</hi> I answer, that if the Opponent had framed the Protestant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thus, <hi>God only to be serued, therefore neyther Sainct nor Angell,</hi> the latter part of the text hauing, <hi>and him only shalt thou serue,</hi> there might haue beene some shew of proofe, in alledging these words Mat. 4. But seeing the position runs thus, <hi>God only to be worshipped,</hi> and the text saith not, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God <hi>only,</hi> but thou <hi>shalt worship the Lord thy God,</hi> who sees not, that there is noe shew at all of proofe in it? as when the Scripture sayth, <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God,</hi>

                        <hi>and him only shalt thou serue,</hi> one might at least seemingly proue from this sentence, <hi>that God only, is to be serued,</hi> but one shall neuer proue, by the force of those words, <hi>that God only is to be feared.</hi> If a Protestant should reply, that <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>serue,</hi> seeme to signify the same thing, and soe <hi>only</hi> being added, to <hi>serue,</hi> is as much as if it were added to <hi>worship.</hi> I answer that if wee haue regard to the Greeke text, (in which only the difference betwixt <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>serue</hi> in Mat. the 4. v. 10. is clearly discouered) there is a large difference betwixt those two words, the one signifying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47142:13"/>
properly, and by mere force of the word, worship in generall, and soe vsed familiarly in holy Scripture, to signify both rhe worship due to God, and to men, Saincts, and Angells, and the other a seruice due to God only, and neuer applyed to the religious seruice of any creature, which I shall here after make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. Beside, serue signifies more largely, then worship, for wee serue God by faith, hope, charitie, obedience, and all good workes done to his honour, but wee worship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thus we read in Genesis, <hi>The sones of thy father shall adore,</hi>

Soe the Romaine Catholique position, that <hi>some kinde of worship, is to be exhibited to others, then God,</hi> is both euidently consonant to these texts, and noe way dissagreeing, from that of Mat. 4.10. and the like texts, wich command vs to worship God, nay though they should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47142:14"/>
vs to worship God, <hi>only,</hi> beecause such commands are all wayes to be vnderstood, of that first, and highest kinde of worship, aboue mentioned; neyther is there any possible meanes to reconcile, different places of Scripture, which seeme to ascribe to God only, that, which in other places is ascribed to creatures, but by such distinctions, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or worships, as I haue declared. And this is soe cleare, that it must be, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, by Protestans themselues, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally graunt, that Religious worship is to be giuen to God only, but ciuil worship to creatures; wich distinction being once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the opponent, will neuer be able to conuince any thing against the worship of Saincts and Angels, out of Mat. 4.10. for if one will terme the worship giuen to Saincts and Angels, a ciuil worship, as I will presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate Protestants must doe, if they make noe distinction betwixt religious worships, then euen Saincts and Angles may be wors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipped at the least with some kinde of <hi>ciuil worship,</hi> euen according to Protestants, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding thath text of Mat. 4.10. which according to them must be vnderstood to forbid only Religious worship to any saue God. But because the common tenet of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Doctours is, that things created may be worshipped with some kinde of Religious

worship, I will make it euident out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that some Religious worship hath been, and may be lawfully exhibited to creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and soe not to God only. Thus wee read in the bookes of kings, that the captaine of 50 men worshipped Elias the Prophete,<note place="margin">2. 4. Reg. 1.13. 2. 4. Reg. 2.15. 2. 4. Reg. 4.37. Exod. 3.5.

                     <p>Now that it may appeare, that these acts of worship, were Religious, and not meerely ciuill, wee must know in generall, that <hi>worship is nothing but an humiliation of our selues in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of some goodnesse, and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, in that which wee worship.</hi> Soe that there are two kinds of worship the one interiour, the other exteriour, the interiour is in the minde, and soul only, the exteriour is that interiour signifeyd by some humiliation of the body, soe that though one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47142:15"/>
may haue the inward of the soule, without any outward or exteriour in the body, yet one can heuer haue a true act of exteriour, or bodily worship without an interiour worship, in the soule, thus the souldiers in the tyme of our Sauiours passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though they bended their knees to him, which is one part of exteriour worship taken Separately, and absolutely in it selfe, yet because it was not accompanied with the inward humiliation of the soule, it was noe act of worship, but of mockerie. I say it followes, that as the outward corporall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is constitured, an act of true worship, by the inward intention of the minde, Soe are the different kinds of worships distinguished only by the different intentions, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations of the soule; For the very same, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall comportment and prostration of the body may be vsed both when wee worship God, an Angell, a Saint, an Apostle, a Bishop, a Priest, a King, a Magistrate, a father, a mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, &amp;c. thus the very same hebrew,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.4.

                        </gap>ome different kinds of worships, according to the different humiliations, intentions, and acknowledgments, which he who worships
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47142:16"/>
desires to exptesse by those outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of the body. Thus if when I kneele I intend to exhibite worship to the Creatour and maker of all tkings; that kneeling will be a diuine worship proper to God only; If I kneele with intention to acknowledge only some ciuil dignity, or morall exccllency in the person before whom I keele, it will bc a meere ciuill worship, but if I kneele before, or to some other thing, or person, with intention to acknowledge in them 'a worth or dignity, neyther infinite nor diuine, but finite and createed, neyther yet ciuil, morall, humane, and naturall, but christian, spirituall, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, such a kneeling will neither be an act of diuine worship, proper to God only, nor of ciuill worship, proper to persons or things indued with meare humane, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, excellences, but will be an act of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and religious worship taken in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sense, as I shall presently declare. Thus wee see that the different intentions of the mynde, make the same externall, kneelings of the body, to be differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t kinds of worships, by intending there by to acknowledge, a worth in that which is worshipped, diuine, Supernaturall, or ciuill; soe that all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in this matter, consists in shewing clearly, that there are these three different worths, or excellencies, to be acknowledged and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47142:16"/>
by an act of worship. Two of these, to witt, diuine, and ciuill excellency, the one found in God alone, the other in the ciuill Magistrate, all Protestans Acknowledge, the difficulty therefore at the last, comes to make it eleare, that there is allso a third worth, and excellency, which is neyther infinite, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, nor diuine, nor yet humane, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but wholy spirituall, and supernaturall, inspired or communicated, aboue all reach, of naturall force and light, from the holy Ghost, and giuen to men, through the only merits, and by the authority of our Sauiour. These heauenly excellencies I find to be of two sorts the one internall, and iustifying graces and gifts, or at the least giuen freely to men, as other supernaturall things: the other externall powers and authorities: both which I will conuince out of holy Scripture, to be such supernaturall gifts of God as I haue affirmed. S. Iames, speaking of the internall graces saith thus.<note place="margin">Iames 1.17. 1. Ccr. 15. v. 10. Iohn. 15. v. 5. Iohn. 1.10.</note>

euidently proue, that all true grace, and Sancttitie, is a free gift of God, aboue the force of mans nature, vnderstanding and will, and this Protestans commonly graunt, and noe Christian can deny, without falling in to Pelagianisme. Concerning the externall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, dignity, and preheminencie of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall persones in the true Christian church, they are as euidently ascribed to Christ, and the holy Ghost as the former.

all soe to other things in Scripture, to which God hath freely communicated certaine blessings and priuileges. Thus we read in Iosua. <hi>Loose the shoes from thy feete,</hi>

The holinesse of these, and the like things, where in soeuer it consisted, issued not from any ciuill, or humane power, but was drawne from the power, and authority of God, as authour of the true Sauing religion of those times. Thus I haue made it cleare out of Scripture, that there is a worth, a dignity, a power, an excellency, which is meerely created, and infinitely inferiour, to the attrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, and perfections of God, and yet far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all ciuill, and humane worth, and aboue the reatch, sphere, and force of all ciuill power and authority. The most cleare rule, to the capacity of the vulgar, to disting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish, ciuill, worths and excellencies, from Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47142:19"/>
and supernaturall, is, that those which are common to the true religion, with all other kinds and professions of men, are only ciuill and naturall, such as are, wit, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, knowledge, learning, eloquence, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, valour, Gouernment, Magistracy, &amp;c. But those which are proper to the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are Spirituall, and Supernaturall, as are, the dignity of a Saint in heauen, of an Angell, a holy man yet liuing, a Prophet, an Appostle, a Bishop, a Priest, a Godfather, a God mother, &amp;c. And because these and the likc <hi>excellencies,</hi> are proper <hi>to religion,</hi> they may in a large sence, be termed <hi>religious excellencies, or dignities</hi>· That this may be better vnderstood, the Reader, may take notice, that the word <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> may eyther be taken in a strict sense, for the vertue of Religion, as it is distinguished, from othet infused, and supernaturall vertues, <hi>whereby true worship and honour is giuen to God</hi>: or in a more large and generall sence, for the whole profession of those who esteeme them selues to haue the true sauing way of seruing God, and attaining Saluation. And this is the more obuious, and vulgar vnderstanding of this word <hi>Religion,</hi> thus we commonly say the Catholicque <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp;c. that is theyr whole beleefe, and profession. In the first strict and and rigid sense, <hi>Religion</hi> is taken amongst the Schoole doctours, when they dispute of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47142:19"/>
nature of infused vertues: and in the like sense it is often taken in the bookes of Moyses, Exod. 12.26.43. Exod. 29.9.

This large acception therefore of these words <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> being soe clearely deliuered in Scripture It will be sufficient for defence of the Catholique Romaine faith in this point, to affirme, that when our Doctours say that any thing created may be or is, worshipped with <hi>Religious worship,</hi> that it is Religious in this large acception found soe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly in Scripture, that is, vertuous, pious, christian, a worship belonging to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, proper to our Religion, and tending finally to the acknowledgment of God, and our Sauiours honour, as authour of our faith and Religion.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47142:20"/>
in this larger sence.

These things <hi>God commaunded to be giuen to them</hi> (that is to Aaron, and his ofspring, as it is in the precedent words,) <hi>from the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, by a perpetuall Religion in theyr generations.</hi> Secondly S.

                     <p>And the giuing such a Religious worship as this, which I haue described to a creature is soe far from derogating any thing from the due worship of God, or from ascribing any worship proper to him, to any creature, that it would be an insufferable iniury to God, And horrid Sacriledge, to affirme that he is to be worshipped, with any such worship for that were to acknowledge in him only a created, finite, &amp; imperfect excellencie, which were

Neyther can his honour be any thing diminished by exhibiting this kinde of Religious worship, to a creature indued with spitituall graces, for his honour cannot be iniured, but by giuing to a creature the wotship proper, and due to him only, seeing therefore this is no worship due to him neyther only nor at all, it cannot be any way a preiudice to his honour.

Peeter refused this worshep (though he might laufully haue accepted it. as beeing due, no lesse then the like worship was accepted by Elias, and Eliseus) that S. Peeter, I say not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, Refused it out of humility and respect, which he bare to Cornelius: and this supposed, Protestants must giue vs leaue to apply (with the greatest part of the ancient Fathers and Doctours) the same answer to S. Iohn's worshipping the Angell, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing it; for some worship was noe lesse due to this Angell then it was to the two Angells, which Lot worshipped. Gen. 19. v. 1. and the Angell which Iosua worshipped, Iosua 5. v. 14. now cited: and yet this Angell refused it out of humility and respect, which he bore to S. Iohn, as S. Peeter did, Acts 10. v. 25. and 26.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47142:28"/>
or if this answer seeme, not soe conuenient to this plare of the Acts, a Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t must answer, that Cornelius here gaue him the worship which was due to God only, that is, the highest diuine worship, which he therefore refused' as iniurious to God noe otherwise then' S. Paul and Barnabas with all earnestnesse possible,<note place="margin">Act. 14. v. 10.11.12.13.14.</note> refused the saerifice which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Priest of Lystra would haue offered to them, as to two Gods, Iupiter and Mercurius, whom they tooke them to be. And if they like of this answer, they will giue vs alsoe leaue to apply the same to the passage of S. Iohn. Reu. 22. v. 8.9. not that S. Iohn committed any Idolatry or false worship, willingly and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but that the Angell vppon good ground eyther thought, or at least feared, that S. Iohn tooke him to be our Sauiour, &amp; soe gaue him presently the worship due to the Diuine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which he thought him to be: for though it be wholly improbable, that Cornelius gaue diuine worship to S. Peeter Act. 10. because he was noe heathen, but a true beleeuer, and soe knew that diuine honour, was to be giuen to God only; and religious and fearing God, as appeares, v. 11. and soe was far from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting Idolatry, and knew well enough that S. Peeter was a man, v. 5. and the 6. and soe could not suppose him, out of ignoranee to be God, and though it seeme as improbable, that S. Peeter
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47142:28"/>
conceiued that Cornelius intended to worship him with diuine honour, seeing he was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently informed, that he was a true beleeuer, and Professour of the law of Moises, v. 22. yet many ancient fathers teach that S. Iohn did really thinke that this Angell which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, was not an Angell, but our Sauiour, or at least it was very incident to the Angel, to conceiue or feare (being ignorant of S. Iohns intention) that he tooke him to be our Sauiuor, because the Angel sayd in the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t verse <hi>behould I come quickly,</hi> which was the vsuall phrase &amp; speech which our Sauiour vsed to S. Iohn when he appeared to him, as is manifest chap. 2. v. 6. chap. 3. v. 21. c. 16. v. 15. c. 22. v. 12. and must necessarily haue beene pronounced, eyther by our Sauiour himselfe, or by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell in his place, and speaking in his name, because these words, <hi>I come quickly</hi> (as is cleare in all the afore cited places, and particularly chap. 22. v. 12. presently following) can neyther be meant nor verifyed of any one but of our Sauiour: and this to haue been the opinion of S. Iohn, by reason of those next precedent words, Behold <hi>I come quicly,</hi> may haue some ground in the text it selfe here cited by the opponent, <hi>And when I had heard and seene, I fell down to worship,</hi> &amp;c. for the seeing of those strange visions, and hearing those precedent words. Behold <hi>I come quicly.</hi> Soe proper to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47142:29"/>
out Sauiour, gaue this occasion to worship the Angel, as taking him to be our Sauiour: and therefore the Angel presently disabused him, and let him vnderstand that he was not our Sauiour, but a creature and seruant of God, as appeares in this text obiected v. 8. and 9. if it should be obiected that c. 21. v. 9. S. Iohn affirmes, that this very Angell which he worshipped was one of the seauen Angells, who caried the viols filled with the last pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and therefore could not thinke that it was our Sauiour. I answer that though in the begining and continuance of this vision he seemed to him to be an Angell, yet when he heard him pronounce words proper to our Sauiour, he might haue sufficient reason to thinke that his former apprehension was amisse, and that whatsoeuer he seemed before, yet it was our Sauiour appearing vnder the forme of that Angell. If it be further obiected that S. Iohn writes expresly that it was one of the Seauen Angells, which appeared to him, and therefore could not after doubt of it, it may be answeared that when the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gclist writ this he was wholy assured that it was an Angell, because the Angell had, before this was written, determinaetly assured him, that he was not our Sauiuor; yet whilst the vision happned, before it was eyther written, or the Angell had rectifyed the iudgment of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47142:29"/>
S. Iohn, he had ground inough to thinke it was our Sauiour, when he heard those words proceede from him, <hi>behould I come speedily.</hi> Neyther is it any wonder that S. Iohn was ignorant of some things, concerning the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which appeared to him. For he thought that none could be found worthie to open the seauen seales and therefore wept, and was as much forbidden to weepe by the Angell, c. 5. v. 4. as to worship, c. 19. v. 10. Hee aeknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges alsoe that hee knew not who they weare who appeared in white Stoles. c. 7. v. 13.</p>
                        <p>Though these answeares may satisfye all that is opposed against them, yet because the matter is in it selfe obscure, and leaues a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability on both sides, I rather sticke to the other answer that though S. Iohn knew it was noe more then an Angell, yet the Angell refused the worship he gaue him, at S. Peeter did that of Cornelius. And yet whatsoeuer may be thought of these two answers, that which is most cleare and vnquestionable is a third answers. That though S. Iohn knew that he who speake to him was an Angel, and not our Sauiour, and soe gaue him, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship only due to an Angel, yet the Angel being ignorant of S. Iohns intention, might diseruedly feare, or conceiue, that he tooke him to be our Sauiour, and soe gaue him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship, and therefore, he presently
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47142:30"/>
dissabused him, telling him that he was one of his fellow seruants, &amp;c. And each of these answers may be equally applyed to the like text,<note place="margin">Reu. 22. v. 9.9. Reu. 19.</note> Reuel. 19. for out of the same ground of Act. 10. it may be sayd that he refused this worship though in it selfe lawfull, as S. Peeter did that of Cornelius: or that he supposed him to be our Sauiour, (and soe gaue him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour which was no way due to him) because he there vsed the phrase of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, when he sayd <hi>scribe,</hi> write, as appeares in the three first chapters, and chap. 14. v. 13.14.15. neyther can it be clearly proued that any one commaunded S. Iohn to write, saying to him, <hi>Scribe,</hi> write, but our Sauiour, saue only in this place, through the whole Reuelation; and then it was spoken in the name and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ by the Angell; soe that S. Iohn had great reason to thinke that it was the voyce of our Sauiour, and therefore gaue him the honour due to our Sauiour, till he was better informed: or according to the third, and clearest answer, the Angel had reason to thinke, that S. Iohn worshipped him, (when he heard him vse that phrase of our Sauiour) with diuine worship, as taking him to be our Sauiour, though S. Iohn, knew that he was but an Angel, and soe gaue him only the worship which was due to an Angel. And thus much for the text of S. Iohn.</p>

different significations, it is not the <hi>worshipping</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the <hi>religion</hi> of Angells, which is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; for soe the vulgar translation hath it, which is ancient about twelue hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: and how can any Protestant, though learned, euer conuince out of Scripture, that the word <hi>threskeia,</hi> is rather to be translated <hi>worshipping,</hi> then <hi>religion</hi>? seeing the greeke word signifies both, and the scope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the Apostle rather agrees with <hi>religion</hi> then <hi>worshipping</hi>; nay how shall the pore vnlearned readers be certaine that their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is the word of God, and the true and only signification of the word in the originall in that place, when the originall word hath sundry significations? and further, how shall they not haue cause to doubt of, and call in question the whole translation of the bible? seeing they know not when the words in the originall haue different significations, or only one, and so may doubt wether the true signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and that which is only meant there by the holy Ghost, is put, or rather an other which was not intended by the holy Ghost in that place, especially in places of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy, where their Translatours vse to take all aduantages against vs, as I haue shewed: And yet neyther of those two inconueniences toutch Romain Catholikes, because their translation is commended and approued by

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47142:34"/>
worship is forbidden, to be giuen to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells. I answer, that if wee take religion and religious worship as it is strictly and presly taken amongst the Doctours in its prime and formall acception, for a vertue whereby due honour is giuen immediately to God; it is true that all such religion or religious worship is there forbidden to be giuen to Angells: and in this sense noe Catholike teaches that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship is to be giuen to Angells, or any creature, but only to the creatour of all things, because he only it true God: but if by religion or religious worship be vnderstood in a larger sense, a vertue or reuerence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to religion, and exceeding the bounds of nature and ciuill worship; then religious worship to Angells is not forbidden in this place. Now that religion may be taken in this larger sense, is cleare as I haue allready shewed out of S. Iames now cited chap 1. v. 26. and 27. <hi>If any man amongst you seeme to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouus, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiueth his owne hart, this mans religion is vaine. Pure religion and vndefyled before God and the father, is to visit the fatherlesse, and widowes, in their afflictions, and to keepe himselfe vnspotted from the world.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Where wee see. that actions performed to creatures of piety and mercy, are called reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and are religious actions: and so this worship, though it be done to creatures, may
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47142:34"/>
according to the phrase of Scripture be called religious worship, at least in this large sense, that workes of piety and mercy are called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or religious actions here by S. Iames. And thus much for the second place.</p>

                        <p>THis text is in the mouth of euery igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Protestant, to proue that wee are neither to pray to saint nor Angell, but to Christ alone. <hi>Come vnto mee,</hi> saith our Sauiour: he bids vs not come vnto Saints, ot Angells, say some illiterate Scripturistes: therefore wee must neither come to Saints nor Angells ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Sauiours command. But how far this discourse is from common sense, euery vnderstanding person will easily discouer: for, to say that our Sauiour bids vs not here come to Saints or Angells expressly, is most true: but that shewes only that coming to Saints or Angells is not here commanded, which no man makes question of: for though the coming by prayer to them be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded here, yet that hinders not but eyther in some other place of Scripture, or by other lawfull authority commended in Scripture, it may be either commanded, or allowed: as if one should argue against Protestants euen out of this place in this manner: our Sauiour sayes Matth 11. v. 28. Come vnto mee all yee that labour &amp;c. Hee sayes not here addresse your prayers expresly, and by name to God
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47142:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Father, or the oly Ghost, by saying <hi>our Father which art in heauen</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>come holy Ghost eternall God</hi> &amp;c. but come <hi>vnto mee,</hi> therefore it is vnlawfull to vtter such perticular prayers to God the Father or the holy Ghost, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing them by name, but all must be made to our Sauiour only. who sees not how false and senslesse this reasoning is? for though our expresse coming to God the Father and the holy Ghost be not commanded here, yet neyther is it forbidden, and is commanded in other places, and practized by the whole church of God, yea and by the Protestants themselues.</p>
                        <p>Others vrge the Same text in this manner, <hi>Come vnto me,</hi> sayth our Sauiour, Therefore to mee alone and to no other, and so neyther to Saint nor Angell; which hath as much force as this; <hi>Come vnto mee,</hi> sayth our Sauiour: therefore goe not by name to any other diuine person but to me, and so neyther to God the Father, nor to God the holy Ghost expressly, who are two distinct Persons from him: or as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible as this, come vnto me all yee that are pore and needy, and I will releeue you, saith some rich charitable person, to the pore of the citty where he dwells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to come to no other but to him, and forbids them the asking almes of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47142:37"/>
me</hi> &amp;c. sayth our Sauiour: therefore to no other but to him; and so forbids children to pray to their Parents, or to beseech other Christians yet liuing to pray for them &amp;c. which notwithstanding Protestants dayly practise: for if our Sauiours meaning be to exclude all saue himselfe, when he said, come vnto me &amp;c. then the liuing must be excluded noe lesse, then the Saints and Angels of heauen: and if the Saints yet liuing be not excluded, then our Sauiour did not intend by those words to exclude all, and if not all, then it can neuer be prouued from this text alone, that the coming, as wee doe, to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is forbidden in this text.</p>
                        <p>I answere therefore, that though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in these words command all sinners to come vnto him; yet he commands them not to come vnto him <hi>only</hi>; and so forbids not the comming vnto others, and this answer will, I hope satisfy any considerate person standing precisely in the force of the wotds, and in what by true discourse may be deduced from them.</p>
                        <p>Yet for a more full satisfaction, all Protestants are to understand, that when Catholikes come by prayr vnto any Saint or Angell, they still performe, what our Sauiour here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of comming to him: for wee come by their intercession mediately vnto him, when

wee beg of them to pray to him for vs, no lesse then Protestants children come mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto him by the intercession of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents when they desire them to pray to God to blesse them: and as the Centurian who by one Euangelist is sayd to haue gone to our Sauiour; and yet by an other,<note place="margin">Matth. 8. v. 5.6, Luk. 7. v. 2.3.4.5.</note> he only went to some of his friends to speake to our Sauiour for him; which was to come mediately, or by their meanes to him: especially seeing that when wee pray to any Saint, or Angell,<note place="margin">Concil.

Iohn in the Reuelations, if these words be not, by negligence of Pastours, or Ministers, well explicated: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as these words, <hi>he sits at the right hand of God the Father Allmighty,</hi> and the like, are not to be blotted out of the creed, or Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but to be well explicated; so also those pictures, though some, through their Pastours negligence, may fall into errour by them, are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47142:47"/>
not to be taken away, but explicated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the grounds of the Christian faith, and the doctrinc of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Chruch. Yet if any one would vrge that some attributes of God may be signifyed by some pictures which are vsed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church, I answer, that thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not that we intend to picture the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, or nature of God, or to signify that it is a visible, corporall thing like to that picture, but only to make a hieroglyphicall expression of certaine attributes as wee doe when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vertues or vices in certaine shapes, of men or weome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the better to expresse the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, not to signify that they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, or like to those persons. Thus the white haire mentioned by Daniell, signifycs the neuer begining, nor ending eternity of God: the crown, scepter, and world his absolute dominion ouer all things: the light about him, his infinite glory and so of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Only here I thought fit, to note, that (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Council of Trent aboue cited) The Church of Rome, hath not commanded, nor ordayned, that the Pictures, which thus represent the apparitions of God the Father or God the holy Ghost, should be had, and reteyned espeacially in churchs, for there the Council mentions only the Images of our Sauiour, and of Saints; but she only tolerates,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47142:48"/>
or permits that such other pictures may be made, when it is found expedient; and that only historically.</p>

                           </gap>, an Idol, or false God, and the Latine, <hi>sculptile,</hi> which in the eeclesiasticall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is always through the whole Scripture taken for an Idol or representation of a false God, when it is forbidden; as also the Hebrew word <hi>pesel,</hi> which is neuer taken in a good sense for any Image truly representing any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing existent as it is really in it selfe, as carued or grauen curiosityes.</p>
                        <p>Now the difference betwixt an Image, and an Idol is this: an Image is a representation of a true thing, which either is, or is possible to be, in that very maner wherin he who makes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47142:49"/>
or vses the Image, intends to represent it as the paintings or caruings of trees, of flowers, of beasts, of men, or women, which we ordinarily vse in our houses. Thus the word <hi>Image</hi> is taken, Gen. 1.26. and 27. Gen. 5. v. 36. Deut. 4. v. 16. 2. Cor. 4. v. 4. Coloss. 1. v. 15. and in many other places: and in Hebrew it is called <hi>tsalem</hi> in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>But an Idol is a representation of what neither is, nor can possibly be as he who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, or vsees it, intends to represent it; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called Abacuc 2. v. 18. <hi>a false phantasie</hi> in the 70. Interpreters, and according to the Hebrew, a thing which tells a lye, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that to be, which neither is, not can be. And Isay 44. v. 10. an Idol is called vanity, or, profitable for nothing. And S. Paul 1. Cor. 8.4. we know that an Idol is nothing in the world; because it represents that to be God, which neither is, nor possibly can be God, because there is but one only true God; and therefore in Hebrew, Idols are called Elilim, that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or falsity; and in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, an empty and Idle fiction of the brayne. Hence it comes to passe that the very same materiall representation, may in diuers respects be an Image, and an Idol; an Image, in regard of that which is truly represented by it; an Idol, in reference to that which it represents falsly and lyingly. Thus the picture of the Sun is an
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47142:50"/>
Image therof, so far as it represents the face, beames, and figure of the visibile sun, and puts vs in remembrance of it: But the very same materiall picture will be an Idol in as much as it is made to represent the sun as a God, and a soueraine diuine power, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thens represent it in their Idols; And hence by different persons, the same materiall pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or statue may be esteemed and respected as an Image, or as an Idol: for a true Christian seeing the Image of the Sun, will regard only the true representation of the true sun<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e in it; but the Heathen will esteeme it as conteyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or representing some diuinity or deity, and so to him it will be an Idol. That which here I exemplify in the Sunnes picture, is to be extended to all other representations of men, or other creatures: for if any one, in an historicall way would represent some reall passage in the life of Mars, Iuno, Iupiter, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, Venus &amp;c. as they were men, or weomen once here liuing vppon earth, and go no further; those very pictures will be Images only, that is, true representations of that which once was; but if one intend to draw their pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or carue their statues, with designe to represent them as Gods and Goddesses; it will be in that regard no Image, but a pure Idol, falsly representing that to be God, which neither was, nor can he God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:47142:50"/>And the very same different respect is in force in those very pictures which Protestants allow of: for if one should haue the pictures of Queene Elizabeth, or King Iames, merely to represent them as they indeed were, the one true King, the other true Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the would be Images only; but if a Heathen should make a God of each of them (as they vsed to doe of their ancient Kings and Queenes) and intend to acknowledge them, by that picture, as such, those very pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would become Idols, falsly representing, what neither was, is, nor can be. And the same rule is to be verifyed in the Catholike pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Saints: for if they be only represented as holy persons, as Martyrs, as Virgins, as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in heauen with their and our God, then their pictures are only true Images, as truly representing the Saints as they are.</p>
                        <p>But if any one through ignorance, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, should attribute any diuine power, or any thing proper to God, to them, or account them Gods, or Goddesses, to such the pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Saints would be no Images, but Idols.</p>
                        <p>This therefore supposed as necessary to distinguish, betweene an Image and an Idol, I answer to the text of Exodus cited in the obiection,<note place="margin">Exod. 2. v. 4. d.</note> that both according to the hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47142:51"/>
forbidden, is an Idol, and not an Image, as the Protestants English Translation falsly hath it; and consequently the other word following <hi>Temounach,</hi> which in hebrew signifies an Idol also, which represents any creature falsely as a God; it being only a deelaration of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer word <hi>pesel,</hi> and so signifying the very same thing which <hi>pesel</hi> signifyes, that is an Idol; which the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction <hi>ve (and</hi> in English) not obscurely declares to such as are skilfull in the hebrew tongue, which ioynes two words togeather, in the same signification for greater explication: and yet this is made wholy out of doubt Deut. 5. v. 8. as it stands in the hebrew <hi>Lo tegase lecha, pesel, col temounach</hi> &amp;c. where the very same words of Exodus 20. are repeated, <hi>thou shalt not make to thy selfe an Idol, all the likenesses in heauen:</hi> where the sense is nothing but this, thou shalt not make to thy selfe an Idol, that is any likenesse or figure in heauen: so that all the likenesses forbidden in the 20. of Exodus, are the same which are forbidden here Deut. 5. that is, such as are <hi>pesel, Idolls,</hi> or representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of false Gods. And this is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed out of Exod. 20. v. 33. where God himselfe explicates those former words in the same chapter. v. 4. <hi>you shall not make to your selues Gods of siluer: nor you shall nor make to your selues Gods of gould,</hi> which are <hi>pesel,</hi> and <hi>temounach,</hi> Exod. 20. v. 4. and yet lastly that <hi>pesel</hi> put there
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47142:51"/>
in the Hebrew, signifyes the same with <hi>el,</hi> a God, is most cleare out of Esay 44. v. 10. <hi>who hath formed a God, or molten a grauen Image which is profitable for nothing.</hi> in hebrew the word here is <hi>pesel;</hi> and though the Protestant Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish translation haue it, <hi>grauen Image falsely,</hi> as I noted before, yet certayne it is, that euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your owne translation, it here signifyes the same with a false God, as is cleare out of the words, and yet much clearer in the 17. verse, <hi>and of the risidue of it he maketh a God, euen his grauen Image,</hi> saith your translation; where the same peece of wood carued, is called a God of the heathens, and a grauen Image, in hebrew, <hi>lephislo, his Idol,</hi> or grauen representation of a false God, and yet to shew vnanswearably that this word <hi>pesel,</hi> euen by Reformes ought to be translated <hi>Idol,</hi> or at least is capable of that signification, let any Protestant read his more ancient translations, and he shall find that which is called <hi>grauen Image,</hi> in the later translations, to be called <hi>Idol,</hi> or <hi>his Idol,</hi> v. 17. of the 44. of Isay in theyr more ancient, which in Hebrew is <hi>Phesel Phiselo,</hi> which in this 20. of Exodi v. 4. they alwayes translate <hi>grauen Image.</hi> (See the Bibles printed, in King Edwards tyme, and others of the most ancient Protestant Prints,) comimg of the word <hi>pesel</hi> so often cited.</p>
                        <p>Hauing therefore demonstraded, that in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47142:52"/>
the two places cited in the obiection, Exod. 20 v 4, and Leuiticus the 26. v. 1. no other picture, representation, or likenesse of any creature is forbidden, but only such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to represent them, by way of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as Gods, and deityes, (which they neither are, nor can be) and not as creatures, Saints, Angells, &amp;c. which they truly are. The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d poynt propounded in the obiection, about the worship of pictures, or Images, of our Sauiour, or Saints, &amp;c. will easily be determined: for it must be a worship, (which is forbidden in the forenamed places) proportionate or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to the thing which those Idols re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a God; and that can be nothing else but a diuine worship, or an homage giuen to a diuine power: and this is so cleare, that none who vnderstand it, can doubt of it. Yet because I intend, as much as may be, to confirme euery thing I say, by cleare texts of holy Scripture, we must first note, that the foolish Idolatry of the Heathens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in holy Scripture (almost through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) is that they did adore, worship, and pray to that very materiall grauen, or paynted thing (which they had before theyr eyes) as a God: This is so euident out the 44. of Esay, v. 17. iust now cited, that it puts the matter out of question, euen as it stands in your owne Bible: <hi>And the residue therof he maketh a God, euen a grauen
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47142:52"/>
Image; he falleth downe vnto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth vnto it, and saith, deliuer me, for thou art my God.</hi> So also is this matter clearly set downe in the booke of wisdome, chapters 13. and 14. in many verses at large which, though Protestants receiue not as Canonicall Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, yet they put it in their Bibles, and therefore esteeme it not to be a lying fable, especially agreeing so well in this matter with other parts of Canonicall Scripture. So also Ieremy 2. v. 28. and 16. v. 20. Dan. 3. v. 12.14.18. and the 5. v. 4.23· Oseas 8. v. 6. Psal. 133. v. 4. and many other places which I omit for breuitys sake: where it appeares clearly that the Heathens, and Idolaters esteemed that visible picture befote them to be a God, and to haue power to heare their prayers, and to helpe them, and so they bowed vnto it, worshipped it with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour, prayed to it, and put their hope in it. This supposed as certaine, it will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be thought most reasonable to vnderstand that worship of pictures, or resemblances of things to be forbidden, Leuit. 26. v. 1. and Exod. 20. v. 4. which is generally explicated in so many other passages of holy Scripture; for by clearer places the more obscure are to be explicated and expounded, euen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Protestants: Seeing therefore, the word <hi>bowing downe, and worshipping</hi> in the Protestants translation is set downe in the two sayd pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47142:53"/>
generally and without clearly expressing what kind of worship is meant, we must gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her the further explication of it out of other places of holy Scripture, where it is more distinctly and clearly deliuered: and indeed, though the text in the 20. of Exod. be obscure, and generall in Protestants translations in these words, <hi>thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them,</hi> yet in hebrew, and the 70. in greeke there is light enough giuen to direct vs in the true vnderstanding of them, namely, that it is a diuine worship alone, which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; for the hebrew words <hi>ve lo tagauethen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47142:53"/>

And to vrge an other place, this partiality is clearly conuinced out of the first text cited by the person who writ it: Matth. 4. v. 10. <hi>It is written, thou shalt worship the Lord by God, and him only shalt thou serue:</hi> where the 6. of Deut. v. 13. (from which that of S. Matthew is taken) hath the very same hebrew word <hi>gauedth,</hi> which is here translated <hi>worship</hi> in the 20. of Exodus, and there <hi>serue.</hi> But to put all out of question, and to bring an vndeniable discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their fraud and falhood in the translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this hebrew word <hi>gauedh worship,</hi> not <hi>serue,</hi> it is to be noted, that in their more ancient translations of these words. Exod. 20. v. 4. they translated it, thou shalt <hi>not bow down vnto them, nor worship them,</hi> as appeares by the text here cited in the obiection, and by the Bibles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: but in their later impressions and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the yeare 1638. and somwhat before, and since, they haue corrected this errour, and put it, <hi>thou shalt not bouw down vnto them, nor serue them,</hi> both in Eod. and Leuiticus: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had taught all the common people to say it after the ancient erroneous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, it is

still in the cate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hisme set down in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayre booke, <hi>thou shalt not bow down vnto them, nor worship them,</hi> least if they should haue changed it there, the people might haue discouered that they had beene taught their commandements amisse, and that in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient editions of the common prayer, the commandements were otherwise then in the latter:<note place="margin">Exod. 20. v. 4.</note> but the correction in the Bible might more easily be admitted, because few of the common people read the commandements as they stand there. But that at one view may be seene the manifold tricks and diuises, frauds, and deceits vsed in the sophisticating and falsifying of this text in their translations, I will briefly set them all down together: First therefore, contrary to both hebrew and greeke, and Latin, and all antiquity, they translate, <hi>pesel, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, sculptile</hi>; grauen Image. Secondly, they ad the word <hi>any; thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image</hi>; which is not in the hebrew, but thus, thou shalt not make to thy selue <hi>an Idol</hi>: or if the Protestant trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>pesel</hi> were true, it should haue beene <hi>a grauen Image,</hi> not, <hi>any grauen Image.</hi> And this they seeme to adde, therby to make the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant beleeue that all sorts of Images what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, euen of our Sauiour, and of his Saints, are here forbidden by this generall clause, <hi>thou</hi> shalt not make to thy selfe <hi>any</hi> grauen Image<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47142:55"/>
Thirdly, to make the text yet more to sound against vs, in the eares of the vulgar, they make it say, nor the likenesse <hi>of any thing</hi> that is in heauen aboue &amp;c. when it should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hebrew, <hi>col tegumach asher,</hi> nor any likenesse which is in heauen, or verbatim thus, or all and euery likenesse <hi>which</hi> is in heauen, not <hi>of any thing</hi> which is in heauen, these words <hi>any thing</hi> being added vnto the hebrew text; therby to perswade the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, that the likenesse of all things in heauen and consequently of our Sauiour, the Angells, and Saints, are here prohibited: wher as the direct meaning of the text is, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde these likenesses to be made which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare visibly in the materiall heauen to the corporeall eys, as the sunne, moone, slarrs &amp;c. as is cleare Deut. 4. v. 19. which agrees well with the hebrew text, <hi>any likenesse which is in heauen</hi>; for at that time, when this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was giuen, there was nothing in the imperiall heauen, which had any visible figure, or could be immediatly expressed by any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible picture, as a true Image of it, for there was nothing then in heauen but God and his holy Angels. But the English translation, <hi>the likenesse of any thing which is in heauen,</hi> is subiect to giue occasion to the simple reader (who being taught that our Sauiour with his Saints are in heauen, and that they are forbidden in this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47142:55"/>
commandement to make the likenesse <hi>of any thing</hi> which is in heauen, to thinke that they are clearly forbidden to make the likenesses or Images, of our Sauiour, &amp; the Saints: and thus the common people of our nation or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily vnderstand it, and their ministers, and teachers, nuzzle them vp in this errour. Fourthly, yet further to extend the words of this commandement to all sorts of holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesses, and similitudes, though in the little catechisme contayned in their common prayer-booke, they put the commandement thus, <hi>nor the likenesse of any thing mhich is in heauen aboue</hi> &amp;c. which was lesse intolerable, yet in their Translations from the yeare 1638. they adde another <hi>any</hi> to the text, thus, nor <hi>any</hi> likenesse of <hi>any</hi> thing, that they may be sure to include all. And though in their later Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, they put the word <hi>any, any</hi> Image, <hi>any</hi> thing, in a different letter, to signify to the more learned, that it is not in the originall; yet in theyr little Catechisme they are still put in the very same letter with the rest, as if they were no lesse in the originall then the other words; which may be noted for an other fraud: and I finde these words of Exodus thus translated, in a booke called <hi>the confession of faith,</hi> reprinted at London for the Compaignie of Stationers, 1652. all the words being in the same leter: pag. 167. <hi>Thou shalt not make vnto thee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47142:56"/>
any grauen Image, nor any likenesse of any thing.</hi> Lastly, for <hi>serue,</hi> they haue put <hi>worship,</hi> as I haue now declared. So that in these few words, <hi>thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, nor any likenesse of any thing</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou shalt not bow down vnto them, nor worship them,</hi> are six mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, corruptions, or additions to the text. And though some of these, in themselues, may be iudged to be of no great moment, and might passe amongst such as with a sincere mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should admit some of them in their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yet in our new Reformists, who labour all they can to presse this text to common people aboue all others, against vs, and about the meaning wherof wee are in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy: and who professe, reiecting all other Translations, to stand closely and strictly to the hebrew text, they are wholy inexcusable. Now if any illitterate Protestant much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to his ministers, and teachers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of their sincerity in Translating God's word, should not be brought by what I haue yet sayd, to beleeue that they would put <hi>Image,</hi> in the place of Idol, and adde other words to the text, which are not in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, thereby deceiuing the people: for a cleare and vndeniable proofe of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and deceit in this particular, let him exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the 11. chapter to the Romans, v. 4. and the first of the Kings, c. 19. v. 18. and his own
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47142:56"/>
eyes will tell him that they haue added the word <hi>Image</hi> to the text: for he shall find in the Translations of the yeare 1648. and about that tyme, these words, Rom. 11. v. 4. <hi>who haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal:</hi> where these three words, <hi>the Image of,</hi> are added to the text, being neither in the greeke, Latin, nor hehrew for it should be, <hi>who haue not bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> Not as they haue it, <hi>to the Image of Baal,</hi> the word <hi>Image</hi> being added of putpose (as it seemes) to create a hatred in the harts of the common people, against the vse of holy Images, seeing them so expresly forbidden in their Bibles, euen in the new Testament. Now that it may vnanswerably appeare, that this word <hi>Image</hi> is added to the text, looke into this very text cited by S. Paul, out of the first of the Kings, c. 19. v. 18. in their own Bible, and you shall find it thus, <hi>all the knees which haue not bowed vnto Baal,</hi> without these words,<note place="margin">Rom. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> v. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>the Image of</hi> Baal. And that they may vndoubtedly know that these words are added to the text in those later Translations, let them peruse this place in the more ancient Translations, of King Edwards, or Queene Elizabeths tyme, and they mill find this text to the Rom. c. 11. v. 4. without this addition, thus; <hi>which haue not bowed the knee to Baal,</hi> as indeed it should be. And though in the latter Translations, those words <hi>the Image</hi> be put a different print,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47142:57"/>
or letter, which may signify to such as are learned, that they are not in the originall, yet this may reasonably be called into question, because the word <hi>of,</hi> which hath a necessary relation to the two fotmer words <hi>the Image,</hi> is put in the same print or letter with Baal, and the rest of the text, which is in the originall; thus, which haue not bowed the knee to <hi>the Image</hi> of Baal; and for what belonges to the vnlearned, who are most in danger to be seduced by such shifts as these, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ignorant of the reason why some words are in <hi>different or lesse letters,</hi> and all they find in the text, they take to be equally Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the word of God, as I haue had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of about a hundred togeather, who all esteemed the words <hi>the Image</hi> to be no lesse Scripture, then the rest of that text, yea I found one who very eagerly and strongly vrged this text, against Images, telling me, and glorying in it, that Images were condemned expresly in the new Testament by these words of S. Paul. Neither can it stand with the rules of true and sincere Translatours, to adde when they please, and when it makes for theyr aduantage, and indangers the deceiuing of the vnlearned in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; (as here it doth) by adding certaine words, which are neither found in the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, greeke, nor Latin, (as these are not)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47142:57"/>
though it be in a different letter. In the Bibles printed, 1648. at London, by Robert Barker, I find the said words in the same letter with the rest, thus, <hi>which haue not bowed the knee to the Image of Baal,</hi> by which the vnlearned Readers cannot iudge but that these words, <hi>the Image of,</hi> are as much the word of God as the rest, seeing them all in the same print and leter, with the other words of the text, especially when they marke, that in a hundred other places, the words which are not in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall are printed in a different leter, from the others in that very Bible. which makes it probable in a high degree, if not certaine, that the maner of printing in this text, is a mere corrupt dealing of our aduersaries, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full adding to the word of God, to incense the ignorant against Images.</p>
                        <p>M. Fulck, in his English translation, and commentaries vppon the new Testament. Printed at London by the deputies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Barker, 1589. exuses this addition by alleadging that in the greeke text here in S. Paul, Rom. 11.4. the article is of the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine gender, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. &amp; therefore must agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, image, beeing also of the feminine gender, which word though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the greeke, yet saith Fulck, it is to be vnderstood, and soe might lawfully be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the English translation. But that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47142:58"/>
this answer is a mere euasion, grounded vppon a false principle, I will presently make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest for first it is not the custome of Greeke authours, speaking of the statues, or Idols of theyr Gods, to expresse them in the feminine, as referred to <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> but in the masculine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, as referred to the God, whose name that statua beares.</p>
                        <p>Secondly Acts 19.35. those words which M. Fulck and other Protestants vnderstand, of the statua, or Image of Diana, are not put in greek with the feminine, but with the mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine or newter gender, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, whereby is manifest, that when the greeks speake of theyr Idols, and statuas, they referre them, not to <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> &amp; the feminine, but rather to <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, of the newter gender, or some such like word.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in the 1. of Kings 19.18. whence this text of Rom. 11.4. is taken, the Septuagint haue it in the masculine gender, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. and yet both this place, and that of S. Paul must necessarily be vnderstood to speake of the same thing, and in the same sence, which seeing the Protestants will haue to be only, the statua, or picture of Baal, it must needs follow, that the reason why S. Paul hath it in the feminine gender, is not because it speakes of that visible, and artificiall Idol, for 1. Kings 19.18. speaking also of that, hath it in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47142:58"/>
the masculine gender <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. This therefore is not the Reason, but S. Paul puts it in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine and the Septuagint in the masculine gender, because Baal was a common name to the Idols of the heathens, which weare adored by the Iews, thus nothing is more familiar in the old Testament, then to put that word in the plurall number, Baalim, because it was common to many false Gods, which weare comprised in that name- now those Gods some were males, and some femalls, and soe of both genders; amongst which Astarthes Queene, and Goddesse of Sidonia, was the most famous, where of familiar mention is made in the old Testament, speaking of Baalim, and Asteroth. Seeing therefore that both S. Paul,<note place="margin">1. Kings 11.5.33.</note> and the booke of kings speake of a generall worshipping of Baal through the whol kingdome of Israel, which must be extended to all theyr false Gods whether men or woemen, it might likewise be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated truly both in the masculine gender in the first of the kings, and in the feminine in the 11. to the Romains, as comprehending both. And soe S. Paul hath it <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, in the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, not in reference to <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Image, as Fulk would haue it, bur in reference to Astarthes, or other woemen Goddesses, comprehended in that generall word <hi>Baal,</hi> as Catholicque doctours vnderstand it, for according to this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47142:59"/>
exposition, both the old and new Testament are easily reconciled, but according to Fulk, neyther can the old be here reconciled with the new, nor the new with it selfe, as I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>I finde the like addition of the word <hi>Image,</hi> Acts 19.35. aboue cited, where though the greek word be of the masculine gender, (as I haue declared) yet the word <hi>Image</hi> (which is not in the originall as M. Fulk acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges) is put into the English text, thus, <hi>of the Image which came down from Iupiter,</hi> where there was noe reason at all to put Image, seeing the greeke words are masculine, but the Reade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> may easily discouer by such indirect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as these, that it is not the gender, but the generall disgust against <hi>holy Images,</hi> which caused these additions, for whether the greek article be masculine, or feminine, Image must come in, as is euident from these two texts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Neyther is that which M. Fulk alleadges of any force, for the greek words may be refered, to <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47142:59"/>
with soe greate honour in the temple of Ephesus, yet by reason of the great stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and brutality of the Heathens described in many places of holy Scripture (as I shall here after declare) that very Idol,<note place="margin">Isa. 44.15.17. Luc. 19.3. Oseae 11.2.</note> was held by them to be a true deity, and the liuing God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse Diana, and therefore they made soe loud, and strong acclamations, <hi>magna est Diana Ephesiorum, great is Diana of the Ephefiens,</hi> who was noe other, then that dull, and dead Idol, which was adored by them in the temple of Ephesus. But though they had been wiser then the ordinary strayne of Idolaters, and soe had esteemed that Idol, to be a mere representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theyr Goddesse, yet seeing that the originall, hath noe word which signifies <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,</hi> but vses a generall expression, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, to the one, or other of these explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, why should not the English, as well as the greek haue only sayd, <hi>that which came down from Iupiter,</hi> neyther expressiing <hi>Image,</hi> nor any other determinate thing, if they had as fully intended to follow the originall, without all passion against holy Images, as they pred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end it?</p>
                        <p>But that I may further lay open how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently they were transported in the first appearance of theyr new Church, against the vse of Images, I will breefly alleadge some other places of Scripture wherein theyr trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

of the yeares 1562. and 1577. as M. Fulk acknowledges, and 1589. they haue translated the greek words, <gap reason="foreign">

Fulk acknowledges, fol. 456. that <hi>the vse of our English speach hath made the name of Idol odious, and of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge indifferent.</hi> whence follows necessarily, that the word <hi>Image</hi> according to him may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie noe lesse a good then a bad representation, but the word <hi>Idol</hi> allways a bad, soe that the word <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>Images</hi> cannot be put absolutly in those places of Scripture, where they are vniuersally to be vnderstood of things bad, or vnlawful; thus therefore, 1. Iohn 5.2. where the Apostle saith, <hi>Babes keepe your selues from Idoles,</hi> being an indefinite, and soe an vniuersall precept he commands Christians to keepe themselues from all kinde of <hi>Idoles</hi> what soeuer, and soe is fitly, and truly expressed, by the word <hi>Idoles,</hi> because that word is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47142:60"/>
alwayes taken in our language (euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to M. Fulk) in an odious, and bad signification: but it can neyther fitly, nor truly, be expressed by the word <hi>Images</hi> put absolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with our any adjunct, as it is in those first ttanslations of English Protestants, <hi>babes keepe your selues from Images,</hi> for then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept could not be indefinitly, and vniuersally vnderstood, as it must be, to keepe themselues <hi>from all Images whatsoeuer,</hi> for all Christians should be here commanded, to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from all monie,<note place="margin">Mar. 32.16.

But if Protestants would vse the word <hi>Image,</hi> in this text, fitly and truly, they must haue added some adiectiue, to it, which would haue tyed it to signifie something which is vniuersally vnlawfull, thus <hi>Babes keepe your selues from false Images,</hi> or from <hi>bad Images</hi> &amp;c. but this they refused to doe, first because there was noe such adiectiue in the originall, and and secondly, because the addition of that adiectiue, would haue made the text to haue had not soe much as any seeming force, against the doctrine of the Romain Church, for we should presently haue answered, that our Images are neyther false, nor bad but true, and

holy, and soe not forbidden in that place. Thus though the word <hi>desire,</hi> be indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to signifie as wel bad, as good <hi>desires,</hi> yet this would be a very absurd command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>keep your selues from defires,</hi> for that were to oblige one to abstayne from <hi>all desires,</hi> and therefore the Apostle, when he giues a command about desires, he speakes not indefinitly, but expresses by the adiectiue, which he adioynes, what desires he meanes, <hi>Abstinete vos à carnalibus desiderijs,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.12</note> 
                           <hi>Keepe your selues from carnal desires,</hi> all which are bad and vnlawfull. whence appeares that Protestants, by this theyr translation, make S. Iohn, and the holy Scripture, to deliuer a commande, not only false, and senselesse, but euen wicked, and blasphemous; for it must command Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to keepe themselues from all Images, and consequently, not only from all Koyne, and Company, of men, which are <hi>Images,</hi> but euen from Christ himselfe, who is the <hi>Image</hi> of his eternall father.</p>
                        <p>The like inconueniences follow, from the other texts now cited, where <hi>Image,</hi> is put ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutly. for <hi>Idoll.</hi> for when the Apostle, Ephes. 5.5.

                        <p>The like follows, from theyr translation of Gal. 5.20. where the Apostle giuing a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of those capitall sinnes which vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented depriue a soul of eternall happinesse, amongst many others, names, <hi>Idolorum seruitus,</hi> in greeke <hi>Idolatry,</hi> now as all the rest when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they are done; are sinnes, soe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any kinde, or act of Idolatry is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it is a sinne; but the Protestant chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idolatrie, <hi>into worshipping of Images,</hi> must make the Scripture say, that as whensoeuer any fornication, adultery, witchcraft, idolatry, or any other here named, is commited, sinne is committed, soe when any kinde of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of Images is committed, sinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which notwithstanding is manifestly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47142:62"/>
false, for neyther is the ciuil worship of an Emperours Image a sinne, and much lesse the diuine worship of our Sauiour, who is the Image of his father; Thus is it made euident, that whilst Protestants shew theyr vehement passions against <hi>holy Images,</hi> they make the Scripture to speake not only falsities, but euen blasphemies. which the later Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slaters hauing obserued, ashamed of soe foul errours, haue corrected (as any one may see) theyr former, and ancienter translations, and haue restored Idoles, <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> to the respectiue texts, which I haue aboue cited. neyther is that which M.

Notwithstanding all that I haue sayd in manifest and vndeniable proofe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47142:62"/>
of the false translation of the commandement Exod. 20. v. 4. &amp;c. yet to shew how little force these texts haue, euen as they stand in the Protestant Bibles, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image</hi> &amp;c. to proue any thing against the vse of holy Images practised in the Romain Church; I most easily answer, that if they vnderstand by <hi>grauen Image</hi> such as are also Idoles as it is taken, Isay. 44.17. Ps. 105.19. Ps 78.5. Iudg. 18. where that which v. 17. &amp; 18. &amp; 20. is called a graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; a molten Image, v. 24. is called Gods, &amp; in the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Bibles in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent other places, as I haue already shewed, nay through the whol Protestant Bible, the word <hi>grauen Image,</hi> is neuer taken but for an Idol, or a false God, for as much I euer could yet discouer in it: then I grant that such Images are neither to be <hi>made,</hi> worshipped, nor serued: but this concludes nothing at all against the Romain Church, who abhorres, detests, and anathematizes all such Images, with the wotshipping, and worshippers of them. But if they vnderstand by <hi>grauen Image,</hi> an Image wich is no Idoll, but a true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of some holy person now in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blisse, such as where the images of the two Cherubins Exodus the 25. then I deny that such <hi>grauen Images</hi> are forbidden, either to be made, or worshipped, according to the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation already deliuered. Now the reason of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47142:63"/>
this answer, and distinction is cleare; for if true Images of holy things and persons were forbidden Exod. 20. v. 4. then that place of Seripture would be contrary to the others, Exodus the 25. which command them: and if all kind of reuerence, respect, and worship be here forbidden to <hi>holy Images,</hi> then this text Exod. 20. v. 4. would be contrary to the Psal. 98. alias 99. v. 5. where we are commanded to worship, or <hi>adore the footstoole of God,</hi> which was nothing but the Arke of the Testament with the two goulden Cherubins in the holy of holyes. <hi>Adore, or worship his footstoole,</hi> saith there holy Dauid;<note place="margin">

Some ignorant reader may happily say, that those pictures of the Cherubins Exod. 25. were commanded only to the Iewes, and to be vsed in the old law, and so tutch not chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians any thing. I answer first, the forbidding of Images is also only in the old Testament, Exod. 20. v. 4. &amp;c. Secondly, that command Exod. 25. to make some Images, was brought to shew that all kind of Images were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, Exod. 20. v. 4. and consequently, that some images might be lawfully made, and seeing there is now no prohibition forbidding all Images, giuen to Christians, it is lawfull for them, to make holy Images, like to the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins Exod. 25.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:47142:63"/>Seeing therefore one place of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot be contrary to another, for then the one should be false, (and so could not be the word of God, as it is supposed to be) they must necessarily be reconciled and made to agree. And seeing the Images of the Cherubs are so expresly commanded to be made by Allmighty God himselfe, that there is no way to deny or avoyd it, if a christian will recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile and agree these two places, he must grant that all kind of Images, euen such as are no more Idols, nor lesse truly sacred and holy Images then those Cherubs in the Tabernacle were, are not forbidden in the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Exod. 20. v. 4. for if they were, then God should forbid Exod. 20. what be commands Exodus 25.18. and so contradict himselfe. And what is sayd about the vnderstanding of the word <hi>grauen Image,</hi> is respectiuely to be applied to the word, <hi>worship</hi>: for if all kind of worship of Images be forbidden in the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Exod. 20.4. then holy Dauid will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Gods command, when be commands the Israelites to worship his footstoole, where those Images of the Cherubs were. There is therefore no other possible meanes to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile those two commands, but by saying, that Exod. 20. forbids not all kind, nor can be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of that which holy Dauid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes, but only such a worship as is wholy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47142:64"/>
vnlawfull, superstitious, and Idolatrous, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the creature is worshipped and prayed to, as God; and the Image made an Idol, or a false God: wich is neither commanded nor allowed in any place of holy Scripture, but alwayes forbidden and condemned. Neither can it be sayd, that Allmighty God. Psal. 98. dispensed with his command giuen Exod. 2. for if there were forbidden all kind of Images, as being superstitious and Idolatrous, and iniurious to Gods honour, and so of themselues, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecally (as the schoole speakes) vnlawfull, and all kind of reuerence or worship exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to them, as in it selfe dishonorable to God, as Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnderstand this command. Then it cannot be sayd without most high blasphemy, that God dispensed with this command: for then he should dispence with men to commit superstition, Idolatry, and dishonour to him by a command to do them, which were to make him not only authour; but euen fauorer, and commander of sin.</p>
                        <p>Neither can it auayle Protestants to say, (as some others haue sayd) that the making all kind of Images, and all reuerence to them, was forbidden to the Iewes Exod. 20. v. 4. though not vnlawfull in themselues, by reason of the great danger they were in, to be broughr into Idolatry by them, as appeares in the brazen serpent, and their perpetuall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47142:64"/>
falling, vppon euery light occasion, into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. This, I say, nothing auayls Protestants: first, because I haue already shewed that it is Idolatry only, and Idols, which are here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Secondly, because if this command of forbidding all kind of Images, and worship of them, though good and holy in themselues, was only directed to the Iewes as long as they were in so eminent danger of falling, by reason of them, into Idolatry, superstition &amp;c. then it cannot be pressed now against Christians; whom it touches not, they being not in any such danger of committing heathenish Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but destroying it, and rooting it out through the whole world; and so it will be lawfull for them to make, and worship (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my former explications) holy Images, as hauing no command to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>From what I haue now sayd, will easily appeare how little reason the Romain Church hath, to blot those words, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any Idol</hi> &amp;c. out of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as vulgar Protestants are made beleeue by a most false aspersion of their ministers: for if they make nothing at all against her, as I haue shewed, why should she blot them out? But that I may giue a full and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pleat answer to this mistake of common people, which I haue learned by long experience to be one of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47142:65"/>
the greatest stumbling blocks, that hinders them from imbracing Catholike Religion: because, say they, we leaue out the second Commandement: I will breefly cleare this poynt, and conuince euidently, that it is a mere deuise to catch the ignorant, hauing neither truth nor substance in it For first, there neuer was yet so much as one sole Bible, of ours in whatsoeuer language, place, tyme, or edition, which hath not these words, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, call the seeond commandement, as fully and compleatly as any Protestant Bibles haue: and I challenge the best versed amongst them, to produce one only in the whol world, which hath them not, and that the more ignorant, who vnderstand English only, may haue what assurance they are capable of in this particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let them presse their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, to shew them the Remish Bible set out by Romain Catholike Diuines: and there Exod. 20. and Deut. 5. they shall find, all the sayd words fully an intyrely.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, not only in all our Bibles, but in our larger and fuller Catechismes, this whole commandement is expressed. So Catechismus Romanus set out by order of the late Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Trent, parte 3. pag. 298. n. 8. and Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius his Catechisme, de Charitate &amp; Decalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go 1. q. 5. p. 74. 75. where setting down the commandements, he puts the first thus: <hi>Non

And in an English Catechisme, called a Summary of Controuersies, composed by P.C. of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Iesus, and printed in the yeare 1639. The third edition chap. 3 q. 5. pag. 68. hath it thus: <hi>Thou shalt not haue any strange Gods before me: thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image to worship it.</hi> And in the same maner are they set down in an other English Catechisme, which I haue seene and read in a publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory of Protestants.</p>

Deut. 5. is abridged and brought to so many words as merely serue to expresse the substance of them, omitting the rest, thus. 1. <hi>I am the Lord thy God: thou shalt not haue any other Gods before me.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vayne.</hi> 3. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou sanctify the festiuall dayes.</hi> 4. <hi>Honour

Deut. 5. but to the three ensuing also, are here for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity's sake omitted: setting down in few words the substance, and making no mention of the reasons and amplifications found in Exodus, and Deuteronomy, least, were they all sett at large, as they are there, both the memory of yong children might be ouercharged, and their weake vnderstandings confounded, not being able to distinguish the substance of the command, from the reasons and amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.</p>
                        <p>Now if we deliuered the commandements with this preface, as Protestants do in their common prayer booke, <hi>The same which God spake in the</hi> 20. <hi>chapter of Exodus, saying</hi> &amp;c. we were obliged to put them all word for word as they are found there: For otherwise the commandements would not be answerable to the Title. But seeing we find them in other places of Scripture, set down in a much briefer manner then they are there; and find no precept neither in Scripture, nor in the Church, to deliuer them to Christians as they are deliuered in Exod. 20. and Deut. 5. rather then in other places; our aduersaryes can no more condemne vs of falsefying them when we put them briefer, then they can the holy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47142:66"/>
Scripture it selfe for abbreuiating them more in other places then they are in Exodus now cited, and Leuiticus.</p>
                        <p>That they are thus abbreuiated in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is manifest Leuit. 19. v. 1.2.3. <hi>And the Lord spake vnto Moyses, saying; speake vnto all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the children of Israel, and say vnto them; yee shall be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy; yee shall feare euery man his father and his mother, and shall keepe my sabbaths: I am the Lord your God: yee shall not turne vndo Idols, nor make molten Gods, I am the Lord your God</hi> &amp;c. where that which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaryes account the second commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is put euen shorter then many of our catechismes, haue it: <hi>Turne not your selues vnto Idols, nor make vnto your selues molten Gods</hi>: as it is in Exod. 20. v. 23. <hi>Yee shall not make vnto your selues Gods of siluer:</hi> neither shall yee <hi>make Gods of gould.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither indeed is it any way conuenient to deliuer the commandements publikely and generally to Christian people word for word as they stand Exod. 20. Leuitit. 26. because therby they are indangered, either to take sunday to be saturday, or the Iewish Sabbath; or must hold themselues obliged to obserue Saturday with the Iewes, that alone being <hi>dies Sabbati,</hi> the Sabbath day, wherin only, God rested after the creation of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which only he also Sanctifyed, and commanded to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47142:67"/>
be kept, as clearly appeares by the words of the commandement: soe that it is not any seuenth day, or one indeterminately euery weeke, which God commands to be kept holy in this precept, but one only, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, that is the same seuenth day, where in God rested from the worke of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as appeares, Gen. 2.1.2.3. <hi>Et benedixit diei septimo, &amp; sanctisicauit illum, quia in ipso cessauerat ab omni opere suo quod creauit Deus vt faceret. And God blessed the seuenth day and sanctified it, hecause that in it he had rested from all his workes, which God created and made.</hi> now it is most euident, that God rested only, vppon one determinate day, and that, noe other then the Iewish Sabbath, or Saturday. or if they vnderstand well what day is meant in the commandemenr, they must needs be scandalized, to see a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement vniuersally deliuered to them of keeping the Iewish Sabbath, which is, and euer was, Saturday, and yet neuer obserued by any of them, but Sunday in place of it.</p>
                        <p>Hence therefore we see in generall, that it is very inconuenient to propose Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements publikely to Christians word for word as they stand in Exodus: and so wee can neuer be iustly condemned if we put some of them as they are more briefly deliuered in other places of Scripture, or now to be in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance amongst Christians.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="117" facs="tcp:47142:67"/>But there is an other poynt boggeled at chiefly by the ignorant, about the diuision of Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. <hi>Yee</hi> (obiect they against vs) <hi>put the two first commandements into one, and diuide the last into two.</hi> I answere, that a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like seeing their diuision, may with much more reason tell Protestants, <hi>yee put the two last commandements into one, and diuide the first into two.</hi> Briefly therefore to cleare this poynt, it is to be noted: that though it be expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in Scripture that Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ten in number, and written in two tables, yet through the whole Bible neuer is it declared which is the first; second, third &amp;c. nor so much as one word spoken concerning the diuision of them: but this was left, either to tradition, or to the prudent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Doctours: so that, howsoeuer they are prudently diuided, there will be nothing contrary to Scripture, so long as the whol substance be expressed, and the number of them be obserued.</p>
                        <p>Hence, in and euen before S. Augustins tyme, (as he witnesses) there was a double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the commandements amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: some diuiding them as we doe; and others as our aduersaryes. Yet both S. Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne himselfe, q. 71. in Exod. and S. Hierome Comment. in Psalm. 32. and Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus lib. 6. Stromatum, follow our diuision,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47142:68"/>
S. Augustin prouing it very largly to be the better, and putting in the first commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Idol,</hi> not <hi>Image</hi>; and <hi>serue,</hi> not <hi>worship</hi>; and S. Hierome setting down the three comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements conteyned in the first table,<note place="margin">Item Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therus impr. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae 1589. pag. 117. Et Hus Norin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergae 1558. pag. 30.</note> as short, or shorter then any of our Catechismes doe: and from them euen to our tymes, it seemes to haue beene the receiued diuision, at least in the westerne Church, and should haue beene followed by those of our nation, (who euer before the breach, were estemeed a part of it, and yet pretend to be so) had not the spirit of contradiction against the Romain Church induced them to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Now as we haue authority, so haue we solid reason to prefer this diuision, before that of our aduersaryes: for certaine it is that each different commandement forbids a different maine sin; so that neither are we to make two forbid one capitall sin, nor one, two sinnes. This our diuision strictly obserues, but that of our aducrsaryes, not so: for their two first commandements forbid only the sin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as being the capitall sin forbidden in them both, and so can be but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as we put them: and their last prohibites two maine distinct sinnes, the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of adultery, <hi>thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife,</hi> and the desire of theft, <hi>thou shalt not couet thy neighbours goods</hi> &amp;c. which are as different in

thought, as adultery and stealing are in act: if therefore, as they acknowledge, there be two commandements to forbid them; in all reason there must be two to forbid the desires of them; and this reason is pressed by S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin in the place alleadged.</p>
                        <p>It is further most manifest, that these which are made two commandements by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, can be noe more then one and the same commandement, for in the 2. of Kings 17. v. 35. the whole substance, of that which Protestants call the second comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is put in one single sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, togeather with the first in these words, <hi>you shall not feare strange Gods, neyther shal you worship them, neyther shall you serue them, neyther shall sacrifize to them.</hi> now, what is meant by those strange Gods, is declared, v. 40. and the 41. <hi>How be it they did not harken but they did after theyr former maner, soe these nations feared the Lord, and serued theyr grauen Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> whence it is euident, that that which is called <hi>strange Gods,</hi> v. 35. is called <hi>grauen Images,</hi> v. 41. and soe to forbid the seruice, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>strange Gods,</hi> which is in the Protestants first commandement, and to forbid the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and worship of <hi>grauen Images,</hi> is the same command, as forbidding the same thing.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47142:70"/>
to things inanimate and without knowledge, but not <hi>seruice</hi>; the Protestants themselues grant that ciuill <hi>worship</hi> may be giuen to te chayre of state, or picture, of a temporall King; but <hi>seruice</hi> only to his Royall person, not to his picture; so that no man can be rightly sayd to serue the Kings chayre of state or his picture, but to serue the Kinge, and yet they may be, and are sayd truly, to worship or honour, by some externall signe, his chayre of state, &amp;c. In the very same manner with proportion, one may truly be sayd to worship or reuerence the picture of our Sauiour, or his Saints, as things known and esteemed to be (as indeed they are) wholy dead, and inanimate, without any power att all, in themselues, to heare vs, or helpe vs, merely because they represent those holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose pictures they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we cannot be sayd in any true or proper sence, <hi>to serue</hi> them, so long as we make only this esteeme of them. And hence it is, that the reuerence or worship wich we yeeld to holy Images, is not intended to them, or to begge any fauour of them, or thinke that any help can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vppon vs by any power in them,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. sess. 24. c. 2.</note> and no Romain Catholike is to doe otherwise. But we pray before them, that we hauing them before our eyes, may better and more attentiuely thinke of those whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47142:71"/>
and the reuerence and honour which we giue to them, is in a double respect; first we giue them that reuerence which is due to holy things, dedicated, and consecrated, or tending to the worship of God, as are altars, holy vessells, and such like; and in this respect we giue them no more honour, nor worship, then the Protestants vse to doe to Churches in England, by keeping their hats of, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp;c. for as they doe that to such places, rather then to theyr own houses, because they are the houses of God; so doe we reuerence holy Images, because they are holy things, putting vs in remembrance of God, and heauenly things. Neither doe we this without warrant of holy Scripture: for Iosue 5. v. 15. an Exod. 3. v. 9. Iosue and Moyses are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to put of their shoes because the earth was holy wheron they stood; which was nothing but a reuerence vnto that earth made holy by the presence of God, or an Angell: and if a piece of ground must haue beene re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>erenced because it was holy, why not all other things, which are consecrated or referred to the worship and reuerence of God?</p>
                        <p>The second respect which we haue in worshipping holy Images, is particular to them as they are Images and representations of other things: and in this respect, all the acts
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47142:71"/>
of externall reuerence or worship, which we exhibite to them, is not directed to them, as the ende or reason of our worship, but it is only to passe by meanes of them, to that which is represented by them; where it wholy and only rests, as in a thing intended to be worshipped by it. Thus when wee doe any reuerence to an Image of the Virgin Mary, respecting it merly as her Image, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or worship passes by meanes of that to the B. Virgin, and there only rests and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates it selfe; and it is impossible to honour an Image, as an Image, otherwise: for being in its, proper nature, nothing else but a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such or such a person, or thing all which is done to it, is intended by it to that which it represents: neither is it possible, at least in this life, to giue any honour to God, or his Saints, otherwise then by meanes of one Image or other eyther corporall, of spirituall: for it is impossible to honour or worship any thing vnlesse we thinke vppon that which we worship: and it is impossible to thinke of any thing vnlesse there be framed in our heads, or vnderstandings a representation of that thing which we thinke of: now nothing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, without some representation, as is cleare, and euery representation is an Image and likenesse of that thing which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. So that we always honour whomsoeuer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47142:72"/>
we honour, through that Image of our thought, which we frame of them; and all our acts of honour of worship passe through that interiour imagination or thought which we haue framed, to the obiect or thing, which is represented by it. Now for the better help of our imagination, or internall thought, we vse some externall thing as an obiect of our senses, to excite vs to such thoughts, and keepe vs more liuely and fixedly in them: thus words and discourses (wherin the things which we intend to worship, are described, or signifyed) help vs to a more strong and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue thought of them, and are the Images of the eare; through which as through represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of what we worship, we giue honour to that which they represent to vs: thus pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and images, paynted or carued, help the eye to frame a more full and ferme imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or thought of that we worship; now we haue warrant enough in holy Scripture, to giue honour, or adoration, to such things as helpe vs to thinke of God, and haue a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence giuen them to that end.</p>
                        <p>Thus in the 98. Psalme alias the 99. v. 5. <hi>Adorate scabellum pedum eius, worship or adore his footstoole,</hi> which was nothing but the Arke of the Testament, as all agree, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here is a command to worship it. Your English translation to auoyd the force of these
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47142:72"/>
words, translates it in this manner <hi>worship at his footstoole:</hi> as though indeed no worship at all were commanded to be giuen <hi>to it</hi>; but only that God were to be worshipped <hi>at it.</hi> But this is another manifest fraud: for the hebrew word, and greeke is the very same here with that of the 20. of Eodus, <hi>lo</hi> tishtachaue lachem, and here, ve <hi>hishtacauou la hathom ragluau.</hi> and in Exod. 20. because they will exaggerate the command against holy Images, it must be, <hi>thou shalt not bow down vnto them</hi>: and here, Psalm. 98. v. 5. because they feare that the people might gather from hence, that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Images, (such as were the two Cherubins in the tabernacle, putting vs in mynd of the true God, were to be worshipp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it must be with them, <hi>worship at his footstoole.</hi> Thus they change and chop the words of holy Scripture, to serue their own turnes, at their pleasure so far, that euen two Psalmes before Psalm. 97. v. 7. they translate the same word and phrase in hebrew, <hi>worship him all yee Gods:</hi> and here it must not be <hi>worship his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole,</hi> but, <hi>worship at bis footstoole:</hi> nay in hundreds of other places of Scripture, where the same word and manner of speech is in the Hebrew either attributed to God, or men, or Idols, or false Gods, they translate <hi>worship</hi> or <hi>worship not,</hi> the things forbidden or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: only here forsooth, because it makes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47142:73"/>
quite against them, if it be truly translated, they will needs haue it, <hi>worship at his footstoole:</hi> but both the hebrew, and greeke, and the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta, and the ancient vulgar Translation haue it plaine enough <hi>bow down vnto his footstoole,</hi> or, <hi>worship his footstoole.</hi> whence I gather, that it is warranted in holy Scripture, to giue reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and worship as I before explicated, to such things as put vs in mynd of Allmighty God, and consequently to holy Images. And as this is cleare in Scripture, so is the practise thereof no lesse cleare euen amongst Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants: for what more common amongst the more moderate of them, then to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found adoration at the name of Iesus? which is nothing but a representation, or Image of our Sauiour, to the eare: which practice seeing it is grounded (according to them) in those words, Phil. 2.10. <hi>In the name of Iesus euery knee shall bow,</hi> and those words, extend themselues as much to that sacred name seen by the eye, as heard by the eare, brings in a necessity, of granting a religious worship, to that most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine name, when we see it eyther printed in a booke, or carued in a stone &amp;c. what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship soeuer therefore, a well minded Protestant should iudge to be giuen to that name thus ingrauen, with out all superstition or Idolatry, or breach of this commandement, let him giue the same to any Image of our Sauiour,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47142:73"/>
and in the same maner, or at least iudge that the like may lawfully be giuen to it, and noe more in this point will be required of him, to be esteemed conformable to the doctrine, and practice of the Romane church. &amp; what more generally practised before these troubles then to kneele in receiuing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, which is only a resemblance or likenesse of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Passion with them? and so giuing the reuerence of kneeling to it, they properly worship an Image, or similitude, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, of our Sauiours death. And if any should answer that they worship not the bread and wine in the Lords supper, nor kneele to them, but only to God when they receiue them, I demand presently, whether they exhibite any kind of reuerence to the bread and wine as a representation of our Lords Passion, or no? if they answer that they giue none at all to them: why then doe they make an exteriour shew, and that by way of command and obligation, of exhibiting reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and respect to those signes, seeing that in the exteriour, none who see them, can iudge that they giue not some reuerence euen to them? againe, if they giue no reuerence at all to them, what greater respect doe they beare to the Lords supper, then they doe to their own in their houses? so that if a zealous bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would kneele to God at the same tyme
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47142:74"/>
when he eates his supper, he whould shew as much respect to a brown loafe, as he does to the Lords supper when he kneeles only to God, in receiuing it. And yet further, if one who goes to their communion, had no maw to adore God at that tyme, but should put it of to some other, when he found himselfe more moued by the spirit, why could not he receiue sitting, or standing, and that without any externall reuerence at all, to what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues visibly?</p>
                        <p>Nay how could he in conscience receiue kneeling 'or shewing any externall reuerence? If they answer that they exhibit some reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to the externall signes, as representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Lords death; I demand, whether it be a ciuill or a religious reuerence: to say it is a ciuil reuerence, were absurd: for that is in matters of state and ciuill authority only; and this is in matter of Religion. If they say that it is a religious reuerence, then I haue my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that euen Protestants doe exhibite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reuerence to signes, figures. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of our Sauiour, no lesse then Catholikes: and then I demand further, by what externall signe they make profession of such a reuerence to the signes of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: certainly they will find no other which shewes it more clearly and fully, then their kneeling; or whatsoeuer they name, it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47142:74"/>
is an externall exhibition of religious reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which is nothing but worship in a true and Christian sense: whence appeares that Protestants themselues are guilty of what they accuse vs, that is, of giuing woiship to an Image or figure, of our Sauiour dying vppon the crosse for vs. That which I haue answered to the 20. of Exodus, is in like manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to the 26. of Leuiticus, v. 1. and to the 6. v. 73. for they speak only of Idols, and false Gods: from which, all Roman Catholikes abhorre far more then Protestants.</p>
                        <p>It is not my intention here to enter into any schoole questions, which can neyther easily be made plaine enough to be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, by all those whom I intend to infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in this treatis, nor are they necessary to be known by all Catholicques, nor if they were known, is it necessary to beleeue them. So long therefore, as the doctrine of the Council of Trent cited in the beginning of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie is beleeued and obserued, noe more will or can be required, (for soe much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this point) of any one who eyther is, or intends to be, a Child of the Roman Church. which doctrine is not only without all danger, but euen without all possibility of Idolatrie: for seeing an Idolatrous worship must acknowledge <hi>a diuine power,</hi> and vertu in that which it worships, and the Council
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47142:75"/>
expressely theaches that noe such <hi>diuine power</hi> is to be acknowledged in any <hi>Image,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to follow this doctrine, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatrie in the worship we giue to any Image, all therefore which is required to vnite a Protestant in this particular to the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Roman Church, is only this, that he beleeue noe more that there is eyher life, vertu, or diuinity in any Image, then he now beleeues there is in the name of IESVS spoaken or written; that he put noe more confidence, nor hope in the picture, then he now puts in the name, that he pray noe more to the picture, then he now prayes to that name, if kneeling before the name of IESVS grauen vppon some stone, he pray to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: but as he now puts of his hat and boweth his knee or body, when he sees or heares that name, he hold it lawfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the same reuerence when one sees the picture of our Sauiour, and as he may now kisse that sacred name in deuotion to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, soe he hold it lawfull to kisse our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours picture in deuotion to him, or in his regard.</p>
                        <p>If a Protestant should demande, whether there be as cleare proofs of Scripture for the worship of Images, as there are for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the name of IESVS, I answer there are. That some Images may be lawfully made,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47142:75"/>
is cleare in the Brrazon serpent, Num. 21.8.9. That they may lawfully be put in places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the seruice of God, is euident in the two cherubins of gould, Exod. 25.18. That they may haue a reference to diuine seruice, and be ordinances helonging to it, is manifest Hebr. 9.1.5. That it is lawfull to exhibite some worship to them, is all ready proued, Ps. 99.5. <hi>Adore his footstoole.</hi> That the worship which is done to the Image of another, tends as much to his honour whose Image it is, as the worship done to his name, tends to the honour of him-whose name it is, is vndeniably prouued, Reu. 13. v. 15.16.17. <hi>And he had power to giue life to the Image of the beast, that the Image of the beast should both speake, and cause that as many as would not worship the Image of the beast should be killed; and he causeth all both small and greate, rich and pore, free and bond, to receiue a marke in theyr right hand, or in theyr foreheads: and that noe man might buy or sall, saue he who had the marke or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</hi> whence is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the worship of <hi>the Image,</hi> of this accursed creature, tended to his honour, otherwise he would neuer haue compelled men to worship it, and that he was honored noe lese in this, if not more, then in carijng his <hi>marke,</hi> and <hi>his name.</hi> which can be deduced from no other principle then this, that all worship done proportionally to the Image, is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47142:76"/>
an honour to him who is represented by it, and consequently, that in this our Sauiour and the Saints are honoured as truly as any other in theyr Images.</p>
                        <p>If any Protestant, demand farther whether there be any expresse command in the new Testament, to worship holy Images. I answer there is noe expresse command. If it should be replied, that nothing is to be held, or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Christians which is not set down in expresse words in the new Testament. I answer that that is manifestly vntrue, and must be confessed to be soe euen by Protestants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for they can neuer find any expresse mention in the new Testament: that nothing is to be beleeued, or practized lawfully by Christians, saue that which is expressed in the new Testament, 2. that any churches were made or to be made amongst Christians, disti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nct from dwelling houses, 3. that fonts for baptisme were put in those churches, 4. that childeren were euer actually baptised in those fonts, 5. that God-fathers, and God-mothers were to be vsed in Baptisme of childeren, 6. that any spirituall kindred arises by vertu of Baptisme, betwixt those God-fathers, and God-mothers, on the one side, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deren Baptized, &amp; theyr Parents respectiuely on the other. If therefore none of those can be found mentioned expressely in the new
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47142:76"/>
Testament, with what shew of reason, can Protestants demand, that the worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, should be mentioned in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, seeing they practice these particulars, noe lesse, then we the worship of Images? But in these, and such like religious practices, it is sufficient (euen according to the Protestant Principle of sole Sctipture) that eyther there be expresse mention made of them, eyther commanding or allowing them in the old Testament, which is neuer reuoked or diss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed in the new (as is that of the worship of Images) or at least, that the lawfullnesse of them, can be deduced, from the old, or new Testament, by a good consequence, drawn according to the rules of right reason, as the worship of Images is manifestly, from the 13. of the Reuel. now cited, for if the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Image tend to the honour of him who is represented by it, (as is there euident) and that it is lawfull to doe all that which tends to the honour of our Sauiour, then it follows ineuitably, that the worship of his Image, is lawfull, and the like is of the Images of Saints.</p>
                        <p>Thus haue I indeauored to discouer the different mistakes of Protestants, in the texts of Scripture cited by them against the vse of holy Images, taught, and peactized in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and with all the strange mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translations

                     <p>From these authorities of the Council, it is manifest, that in this matter of Iustification, the Church of Rome, theaches, 1. that noe workes done by the mere naturall force of our freewill; 2. nor by the sole doctrine or knowledge of the diuine law, can iustifie a sinner in the sight of God. Can. 1. 3. That noe vniust persone, can without the preuenting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the holy Ghost, doe any thing (as it should be done) to obteyne, the grace of iustification. can. 3. 4. That neyther faith, nor workes, done by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, before Iustification, can merit Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for it is a free grace of God, giuen not of workes, but by the sole mercy of God, and for the sole merits of Christ. cap. 8. 5. That though the iustification of a sinner cannot be merited, yet a soul may be disposed, &amp; prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to instification, by acts inspired by the holy Ghost. c. 6. 6. That we are not thus disposed by faith only, but also by other good motions of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47142:80"/>
our will, preuented and assisted by the grace of God. can. 9. 7. That being thus freely iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; become the childeren of God through the assistance of Gods grace in Christ, we may doe good workes, and by them (accepted through Christ's merits) become more and more iust, in the sight of God. cap. 10. where in cheefly, consists the Roman doctrine, of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by good workes.</p>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of a iustification before men: for we are no more iustifyed <hi>by saith</hi> before men, then we are vnderstood amongst them <hi>by our thoughts:</hi> and therefore it must be interpreted of a iustification before Allmighty God; who only vnderstands our faith as he does our thoughts (by his own power and knowledge) and can only see whether our faith be true, sincere, and iustifying, or no; faith being nothing else but a thought, assent or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soul.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnderstand an internall iustification in the sight of God, so must they (will they not be vnreasonably and willsully partiall) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the same by iustification by faith, in this place of S. Iames, which is cleared v. 2. <hi>was not Abraham our father iustifyed by worket when he had offered Isaac his sone vppon the altar</hi>? for this hauing beene done priuatly in the desert could not, when it was done, iustifie him before men. and yet more clere v. 22. <hi>seest thou not how faith wrought with his workes, and by workes was faith made perfect</hi>? what is here spoken of but the operation of faith and workes in the soule, iustifying in God's sight? For faith cannot be truly made perfect but declared to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by workes soe farre as they iustifie only
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47142:82"/>
before men. And it is further demonstrated v. 23. <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled which sayth, Abraham beleeued God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. v. 1.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and it was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse, and he was called the friend of God.</hi> Can any Protestant deny this to be meant of an imputation of righteousnesse, as they terme it, or a iustification before Allmighty God, seeing it is the very same iustification which is mentioned by S. Paul to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes which they mainly contend to be a true iustification in the sight of God: or if they will haue it here a iustification only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, they must acknowledge that the same mentioned to the Romanes is no other then before men; and so, by endeauoring by such shifts to weaken the force of this text against themselues, they take away all force from that of Rom. 4. to conclude any thing against vs. Besides, this iustification of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham here mentioned by S. Iames, can be no other then that which is true and interuall before God: for, as it followes in the text, <hi>he was called a friend of God</hi>; and that truly, for he was indeede, as he was called, a friend of God: and hence it follows ineuitably, that the iustification which S. Iames deduces from that of Abraham, <hi>by works,</hi> and <hi>not by faith only,</hi> as appeares by the word <hi>then, wee see then</hi> &amp;c. is a true intrinsecall iustification in the sight of God; for no other, saue that, could be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47142:82"/>
rightly inferred from the former. And indeed though we had none of the foresayd euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to conuince the true meaning of S. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, yet what man of iudgment can imagine that this holy Apostle would labour so much to proue that Christians are iustifyed by their good works before men, when that is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too cleare and known, to need proofe, and too light and friuolous to deserue it? or what considerate man can thinke that this Blessed Apostle or the holy Ghost by whose inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he writ this, would so earnestly exhort Christians to abound in good works, to the end that they may be iustifyed before men? seeing corrupt human nature is too too prone to doe good workes for such by endes as these, and hath more need of a bridle then a spurre in this particular, and rather to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from it, then put vppon it, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did the Stribes and Pharisees, who did their works to be seene, and consequently to be praysed and iustifyed before men. This text therefore hauing been demonstrated to be meant of iustification before Allmighty God <hi>by works,</hi> and <hi>not by faith only</hi>; seeing S. Paul inspired by the same holy Spirit, in what is cited out of him in the insuing text, cannot possibly contradict S. Iames here, as he must needs be thought to haue done if he sayd (as Protestants would haue it) that we are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47142:83"/>
in the sight of God <hi>by faith only,</hi> and not by good works, working with faith and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it, informing and vinificating it, as S.

by S.

By all these particulars duly pondered, appeares, that this text of the Apostle, Rom. 3. v. 28. <hi>therefore we conclude that a man is iustifyed by faith without the works of the law,</hi> sayes nothing but what is taught by Romane Catholikes vniuersally. But if Protestants would conclude any thing against vs, they must produce a text which sayes, <hi>good workes of such as are iustifyed already, done by vertue of the grace of Christ, and not by the bare knovvledge of the lavv, do not iustify,</hi> (and this only is in question betwixt vs) <hi>that is, augment and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is no lesse cleare that there mention is made of the first iustification wherby a sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms a child of God, v. 10. <hi>VVe sinners by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Iewes, and not of the Gentiles.</hi> Nay the text it selfe obiected, Gal. 2. v. 16. speakes clearly of the first iustification of a sinner to the state of grace, for by the workes of the law shall <hi>no flesh</hi> be iustified; the word <hi>flesh</hi> signifijng most familiarly in S.

such as are already iustified, retayne the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscenses of the flesh in them, yet because they resist and subdue them, so long as they remaine iustified. they are not called <hi>flesh,</hi> by S. Paul, but rather spirituall men.</p>
                           <p>And that he speakes of the law as known by its own force, light, and doctrine is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent also v. 16. <hi>For if by the law be righteousnesse, then Christ is dead in vayne.</hi> which is most true if we speake of the law as known to vs, and working in vs by its owne force, wholy inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the grace and illumination of Christ; but can haue no true sense if we speake of the law as iustifying by the grace of Christ: for then Christ will not haue dyed in vaine; because by his death he merited that grace and light by vertu of which only the law iustifyes. And chapter 3. v. 2. <hi>Haue yee receaued the Spirit by the vvorks of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> wherby is manifest, both that he speakes of the workes of the law, as working before the receiuing the holy Ghost, and of the first iustification, or receiuing of the Spirit, by the faith of Christ. and v. 18. <hi>For if a lavv vvere giuen vvich could viuificate, righteousnesse vvere truly from the lavv.</hi> which shewes eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the Apostle speakes of the law as considered in it selfe, and its proper force: for if we consider it as illuminated by faith, and the grace of Christ, it is able to viuificate, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47142:89"/>
consequently to iustify, as the Apostle here plainly affirmes. And that he speakes of the law as preceding the faith of Christ, is out of all question v. 23. <hi>Before faith came, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vnder the law, into that faith which was to be reuealed.

                  <p>And to shew, that this doctrine, hinders not the humility of a Christian, the Council, giues this admonition.</p>
                  <p>Absit tamen vt Christianus homo in seipso vel confidat, vel glorietur, &amp; non in Domino:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47142:91"/>
cuius tanta est erga homines bonitas, vt eorum velit esse merita, quae sunt ipsius dona.</p>
                  <p>Farre be it notwithstanding that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should eyther confide, or glory in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and not in our Lord: whose goodnesse to men is soe greate, that he wills that those which are his gifrs, should be our merits.</p>
                  <p>And lastly to shew what it is, which iust men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> merit by theyr good workes, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil deliuers this doctrine. can. 32.</p>
                  <p>Si quis dixerit — ipsum iustificatum bonis operibus, quae ab eo pcr Dei gratiam, &amp; IESV Christi meritum, cuius viuum membrum est, fiunt, non verè mereri augmentum gratiae, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aeternam, &amp; ipsius vitae aeternae, si tamen in gratiâ discesserit, consecutionem, &amp; gloriae augmentum; anathema sit.</p>
                  <p>If any one shall say — that a iust persone, merits not truly by his good workes, which are done by the grace of God and merit of Christ, increace of grace, eternall life; and the attayning eternall life, if he depart hence in state of grace, and the increace of gloey; let him be accursed.</p>
                  <p>From these definitions of the Council, is cleare, 1. that none saue persons allready iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied can haue these meritorious workes. 2. That they must all be done by force and vertu of the gtace of Christ. 3. To make euen such workes which proceed from grace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47142:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and truly meritorious is required the free and mercifull promesse of God, wheron all merit is grounded. 4. That this Promesse of God, to reward such workes, and the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of those workes to be merits, are grounded in the sole merits of Christ most sacred passion. 5. That the things which are merited through such promises, and merits of Christ, are increace of internall grace, eternall life, the obteyning of eternall life, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of glory in heauen. amongst which seeing the Council puts not actuall grace, that is the inlightning of our vnderstanding by heauenly thoughts, and the inflaming of our will by pious affections, it giues free liber for all Christians to beleeue, that noe iust persone, can by his good workes or merits, deserue to haue such actuall graces, but that they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the free grace, and mercy of God, bestowed liberally vppon euery just persone, for the sole merits of Christ, and not dew to any whatsoeuer of his good workes. 6. Hence the Council affirmes that all our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are the true gifts of God, coming from his free grace, and that soe we are neyther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, nor glory in our selues, but only in God. 7. Hence clearly follows, that this doctrine of merits, cannot possibly be any way injurious to our Sauiours passion, seeing it is grounded, both according to the grace where by such
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47142:92"/>
meritorious workes are produced, and the free promesse of God to accept of them, as meritorious, and to render a reward to them, for the sole passion of our dearest Sauiour, the vertu whereof is applied to vs by the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious force of such workes. as it also is by the impetratory force of prayres, the first dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating noe more from the power of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, then the second of his praires.</p>
                  <p>That which is here sayd, of the impretato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and meritorious, is to be extended to the satisfactory vertu of good workes. For so the Council of Trent, speakes of them. Sessione 14. cap. 8. neque verò ita nostra est satisfactio haec, quam pro peccatis nostris exoluimus, vt non sit per Christum IESVM: nam qui ex nobis tanquam ex nobis nihil possumus; eo coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante qui nos confortat omnia possumus, ita vt non habeat homo vnde glorietur, sed om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis gloriatio nostra in Christo est, in quo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uimus, in quo meremur, in quo satisfacimus, facientes fructus dignos poenitentiae, qui ex illo vim habent, ab illo offeruntur Patri, &amp; per illum acceptantur à Patre.</p>
                  <p>Neythcr is this satisfaction soe ours which wee pay for our sinnes, that it is not through IESVS Christ. For wee who of our selues, as of our selues, can doe nothing, he cooperating who comforts vs we can doe all things, soe that man hath nothing where of to glory, but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47142:92"/>
all our glory is in Christ, <hi>in vvhom vve liue, in vvhom vve merit, in vvhom vve satisfie,</hi> bringing forth worthy fruits of penance, <hi>vvhich haue force from him, are offered by him to the father, and are accepted by the Father through him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To these Athorities of the Council of Trent in declaration of the Romane doctrine, I thought fit to adde one clause of the 39 arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which fauours much the merit of Good workes.</p>

                        <p>If it be replied, that at least the substance or meaning of those words, are expressed in Scripture; I answer the same of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> which I demonstrate in this maner. Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is nothing else according to the Council of Trent now cited, but <hi>a place where temporall punishments are suffered by iust persones after death, vvich they deserued in this life.</hi> Now if any iustified soul be and often is liable after death to suffer such punishments, then certainly there must be some certaine place where they must be suffered. But iustified soules may be and often are liable to suffer such punishments after death, ergo there must be such a place where in they are to suffer them. That iustified soules may be and often are liable to such punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I proue thus. Iustified persones yet liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the remission of theyr sinnes, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47142:102"/>
consequently of eternall torment, are liable to some temporall punishment, therefore souls departed of iust persones, may, and often are liable to the like. I proue the antecedent, out of the, 2. Sam. 12. v. 13.14. <hi>And Dauid said vnto nathan I haue sinned against the Lord, and Nathan said vnto Dauid, the Lord also hath put away thy sinnes thou shalt not dy: Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast giuen great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also which is borne vnto the, shall surely dy.</hi> whete for that very sinne which was <hi>put away,</hi> and forgiuen, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was punished by the death of his child, <hi>because thou hast giuen by this deede,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 6. v. 23.</note> &amp;c. the child shall dy.</p>
                        <p>The same is proued by the example of Adam whoe after his sinne was forgiuen him, was notwithstanding liable to the punishment of death (which is the wages of sinne) as are also all iust persones, for the same reason.</p>

                     <p>If this objection intend to proue (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it doth) thar our Sauiour tooke, blessed, brake, and gaue bread to his disciples so, that that which he gaue them, was bread remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same substance of naturall bread which it had when he tooke it, I deny that our Sauiour gaue bread to his disciples, or that the three Euangelists and S. Paul cited agree in this: the proofe that our Sauiour gaue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bread to his disciples, <hi>because</hi> (saith the objection) <hi>he that saith Iesus tooke, bread, brake, and gaue</hi> it, <hi>saith plainly enough that he brake and gaue bread:</hi> is grounded in a false translation or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the text of holy Scripture in the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47142:106"/>
English Protestant Bibles: for neither hath the greeke nor latin the word <hi>it</hi>; and though the Protestant Bible, of the yeare 1630. and 1632. haue these words, <hi>Iesus tooke bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his disciples,</hi> all in the same letter and print, as if the word <hi>it</hi> were no lesse in the originall then the others adioyned, yet the latter Bibles and namely that of the yeare 1646. put the word <hi>it</hi> in a different letter, to signify that it is nor in the originall, but added (as they pretend) for greater explication, as appeareth in a thous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and other places: and in the Bibles of the yeares 1630. and 1632. S. Marke and S. Luke haue the words thus, <hi>Iesus tooke bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gaue vnto them</hi>: where the word <hi>it</hi> is not ioyned to <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>gaue,</hi> but only to <hi>brake,</hi> and then the word <hi>it</hi> is put in a different smaller letter then the other words. All which conuince that the word <hi>it</hi> is not in the originall; and so is not holy diuine Scripture, but an addition of men and so no solid argumenr can be drawn from the word <hi>it</hi> as from the word of God, not being the word of God, but of men. And hence also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, how cunningly the Protestant trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours detaine the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t readers by putting in words seruing, as they thinke, to their own purpose in the very same print and letter with the rest whieh are ioyned to them, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47142:106"/>
are in the originall, as if they were in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall no lesse then the others; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in othet editions, translations, and places of Scripture they signify, not to be in the originall nor Gods word, by print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in a lesser letter, after they were conuinced of fraud and falsity in the former. And thus, in some editions putting this and such like words in the same letter with the rest, and in others in a different, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned which are not able to examine, what is, and what is not in the Originall, may be in doubt which of these translations is the true word of God, and cannot be infallibly certain of either of them seeing the translatours of theyr Church, which are of equall authority, some of them put a word in their text in the same tenour, as if it were no lesse Scripture then the rest; and others in a different letter. to signify, that that word is not Scripture, but added by them (as they suppose) for greater clarity.</p>
                     <p>If it should be answered, that whether the word it be in the sacred text, or no, yet the argument will haue force, for though the text runne thus, <hi>Iesus tooke bread, and blessed, and brake, and gaue to his disciples,</hi> yet it may seeme that he blessed, brake, and gaue no other thing then that very bread which he tooke, remayning in its own substance and nature. For certainly
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47142:107"/>
he must haue blessed, and broken, and giuen somthing to his disciples: and what can that be imagined to be but what he tooke? that therefore which he tooke, hauing beene true naturall hread, as the text expressly sayth, <hi>Iesus tooke bread,</hi> he must be supposed to haue <hi>blessed,</hi> and <hi>broken,</hi> and <hi>giuen</hi> true naturall bread to his disciples.</p>
                     <p>I answer, that our Sauiour, though he be supposed to haue blessed, broken, and giuen some thing to his disciples, yet it follows not that he broke and gaue naturall bread: for he might take bread remaining in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and after breake and giue his Body, wherinto the bread which he tooke, was changed: as in the marriage feast of Galilé after the vessells were filled with water, and our Sauiour sayd, <hi>draw now and beare to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the feast</hi>: certainly they drew, and caryed, and the gouernour of the feast drunk somthing; yet it followes not, that as they filled the vessells with water, so they drew, and carryed, and the gouernour of the feast drunk naturall water; but as it is sayd v. 9. <hi>water made wine,</hi> or wine wherinto the naturall water wherwith the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts filled the vessells, was changed. yea though the word <hi>it</hi> had beene in the text, or were supposed to be rightly ioyned to it, could any one thence proue more, that, as our Sauiour tooke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47142:107"/>
bread, so he brake and gaue naturall bread remayning the very same which he tooke, then one can proue from the water of Galilé that as the seruants filled the vessells with naturall water, so they drew, and caryed, and the maister of the feast drunk naturall water remayning the very same which was filled, because the text sayes v. 8. <hi>and they caryed</hi> it, and v. 9. <hi>the ruler of the feast knew not whence</hi> it <hi>was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the objection in preuention of this answer vrgeth the former argument yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this manner.</p>

                     <p>This argument proceeds from misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and mistaking this text of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though it saith, our Sauiour brake, and gaue to his disciples, and sayd, <hi>This is my Body</hi>; yet it sayes not (as the objection would haue it say) that our Sauiour after he brake and gaue to his disciples, sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> these being very different senses: for though the Scripture first mentioneth <hi>brake</hi> and <hi>gaue,</hi> and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47142:108"/>
then sets downe that our Sauiour sayd <hi>This is my Body,</hi> yet it may well stand with the truth of the words, that at the same tyme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant whilst he brake and gaue, he sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and so gaue not bread till it was changed into his Body, as if one should giue a peece of bread to a person in want, one might say truly, <hi>he tooke bread and brake it, and gaue it to him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 22. v. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>and sayd, take this almes,</hi> though he spake these words, <hi>take this almes,</hi> at the very same tyme when he gaue it. And that our Sauiour spake these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> whilst he was giuing what he gaue to his disciples. and not after, is manifest: first, because S. Luke affirmes it to be so, <hi>he tooke bread, and brake, and gaue to them, saying, This is my Body</hi>: that is, whilst he gaue, he was pronouncing these words. and though in the institution of the chalice, S. Marke sayes, <hi>and he tooke the cup, and when he had giuen thankes, he gaue to them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and sayd, This is my Bloud of the new Testament, which shall be shed for many.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke 22. v. 20.</note> Yet S. Luke saies: <hi>Likewise the cup allso after supper, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my Bloud, which shall be shed for you.</hi> S. Paul also in the same manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. v. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>also he tooke the cup when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new Testament in my Bloud.</hi> Secondly, because all, as well Ptotestants, as Catholikes, agree that our Sauiour gaue his disciples a Sacrament; and, as they say, a signe of his Body which was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47142:108"/>
made a Sacrament by vertue of these words, <hi>This is my Body</hi>: therefore it were an impiety to say that our Sauiour gaue bread to his discip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les before these words were pronounced; for then he had giuen a meer peece of bread, and neither Sacrament, nor his Body, nor signe of his Body. Thirdly, if our Sauiour had perfectly giuen that which he put into the disciples hands, before he had pronounced the words of consecration. the Scripture sayinge, <hi>he tooke bread, brake, and gaue to his disciples, and sayd, This is my Body.</hi> then it would follow by the same argument that our Sauiour gaue bread, that is to say, put bread into the hands of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before they tooke it into their hands, which is impossible: or, that he bad them take what they had already taken, which were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, because S. Matthew relates the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so, that he mentioneth first <hi>gaue,</hi> and then <hi>take</hi> Iesus tooke bread, and blessed, and brake, and gaue to his disciples, and sayd, <hi>take, eate, this is my Body.</hi> If indeed the Scripture had affirmed that our Sauiour gaue to his disciples, after he had sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument had been of force: but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>S. Paul's words, according to the Protestant translation, are these, <hi>tooke bread, and when he had giuen thankes, he brake it, and sayd, Take, eate, This is my Body.</hi> where there is no expresse mention of giuing to his disciples at all: and therefore what the obiection here affirmes, that S. Paul obserues that after <hi>he brake and gaue,</hi> he sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is very farre from truth. Againe, though S. Paul sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> yet he sayes not that after he brake, he sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> as the obiection affirmes. Neither sayd S. Paul, <hi>when he had broken, he sayd, Take and eate,</hi> as he sayes, when he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thankes, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> for that would haue some shew of proofe that he pronounced the words after he had broken; but only affirmes, he brake and sayd, <hi>This is my Body</hi>: which words may as properly signify that he brake and spake these words morally at the same tyme, as that he first beake, and then pronounced them. As when it is sayd in S. Matthew, <hi>In those dayes came Iohn Baptist preaching in the desert, and saying, Repent</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47142:109"/>
where, though <hi>saying</hi> be put after <hi>preaching</hi> in the text, yet no man is so senselesse as to thinke that he preached before he sayd somthing; or, that he preached before he sayd what the Euangelist affirme him to haue sayd as the subiect of his preaching, <hi>Repent</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Iob 21. &amp; alibi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> So also in Iob different tymes Almighty God, Iob, and his friends are affirmed in the English Bibles, then Iob <hi>answered and sayd</hi> &amp;c.

And so meerely thence can be drawn no forcible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this particular. And yet if we should grant for other reasons and circumstances, that our Sauiour brake the bread before he pronounced the words of consecration, whilst it was yet but bread; what would this helpe our aduersaryes, or hurt vs? for then it would follow, that bread was broken whilst it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in its own substance; but giuen to the disciples after it was changed into the Body

                     <p>If we vnderstand by <hi>broken</hi> mentioned by S. Paul when he sayd. He <hi>brake,</hi> and sayd, <hi>Take, eate, this is my Body,</hi> that he brake the bread changed into his Body by consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in a morall vnderstanding, whilst he changed and consecrated it by these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> it might happily containe no great absurdity, to grant that this second word <hi>is broken</hi> may haue relation to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>he brake</hi>: for in both of them (according to this opinion) his Body was mysteriously and sacramentally broken for vs.</p>
                     <p>But if we vnderstand by <hi>brake,</hi> as the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection supposes vppon a false ground (as I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47142:110"/>
hauc already demonstrated) the breaking of naturall bread before he sayd <hi>This is my Body,</hi> then it is wholy false, and iniurious to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour and the worke of our Redemption to vnderstand that these words <hi>whith is broken for you,</hi> haue relation to brake which was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before. For that were to say, that <hi>a meere piece of bread,</hi> before it was made either a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or his Body, or so much as a signe of his Body, <hi>was hroken for vs</hi>; which neither Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, nor Protestant, nor Christian doth or can affirme without blasphemy: for before these words, <hi>This is my Body</hi> were pronounced, all agree that the bread was neither made his Body, nor any Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall signe of it. Neither can it possibly stand with the other Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, that <hi>broken</hi> here should be only a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of common and naturall bread before it was made a Sacrament by these words, <hi>This is my Body</hi>: for it is certaine that S. Paul here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands by <hi>broken for you,</hi> the same which S. Luke signifyes by <hi>this is my Body which is giuen for you</hi>; especially seeing that by <hi>breaking</hi> &amp; <hi>giuing</hi> thinges belonging to eating, whether temporall or spirituall, the same thing is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed in many places of Scripture, according to the Hebrew phrase. Now to say, that a piece of naturall bread vnconsecrated, was giuen for vs, is an intolerable blasphemy. And yet this is clearer in the other species of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47142:111"/>
chalice:<note place="margin">Mark. 14. v. 24.</note> for S. Marke relates it thus, <hi>This is my blood of the new Testament, which is shed for many.</hi> and S. Matthew, <hi>VVhich shall be shed for many for the remission of sinnes.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 26. v. 28.</note> Which no hart truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can imagine to haue any relation to pure and common wine before consecration.</p>
                     <p>To that which the Obiection adds, that therefore <hi>broken for you</hi> must haue relation to that bread broken before he sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> because he did not breake it againe after he had sayd these words: I answer first, that it can neuer be prooued from the words of S. Paul, that the first breaking here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by S. Paul, was not presently (speaking in a morall sense) after these words were, pronounced; for though it be mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it followes no more thence that it was not presently after, then when S. Marke sayes, speaking of the chalice, <hi>and they dranke all of it</hi> before he mention the consecration of the chalice, that the disciples dranke not after the consecration of the sayd chalice, and after it was made a Sacrament, as all do and must grant they did. and so there will not be two actuall breakings, but one actuall or mystycall or Sacramentall togeather signifyed by these two words <hi>breake,</hi> and <hi>broken for you,</hi> which happened after consecration.</p>
                     <p>But if we say that the first breaking was before consecration, and the second <hi>broken
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47142:111"/>
for you,</hi> signifyed somthing done after conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, that is, the giuing of Christs Body for the remission of sinnes, as the Euangelists seeme to signify, then it will not be necessary that either the bread should haue beene twice visibly broken, or that <hi>broken for you</hi> should haue relation to the bread broken before he sayd, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> as the obiection contends.</p>

                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>The maine diffiulty here vrged, is about the word <hi>this</hi> in the words of consecration, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> I demand first, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour changed water into wine in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Galilee, whether he could truly haue sayd these words vppon the water, <hi>this is wine,</hi> and by vertue of these words changed the water into wine. the water remayning when the word <hi>this</hi> was pronounced by him, and changed into wine when the whole proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>this is wine,</hi> was spoaken, as wee hold it happens, in the change of bread into the Body of our Sauiour in the Eucharist.</p>
                     <p>I scarce thinke that any Protestant will be se bold and temerarious as to deny that God can do this; and yet all the difficultyes that are inuented and vrged against the word <hi>this</hi> in the words of consecration, are the very same here, as is manifest. So that the obiection about the word <hi>this</hi> proues not only (if it prooue any thing) that the Body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour is not de sacto put really in the place of bread by vertu of these words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> but that it is wholy impossible for our Sauiour to worke any such change by vertu of these words: for, if whilst the word <hi>this</hi> is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, water (being only there actually) must necessarily be signifyed by the word <hi>this,</hi> as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47142:112"/>
the obiection conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, then it is impossible by vertu of this proposition <hi>this is wine,</hi> that water should be changed into wine: for the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this proposition <hi>this is wine,</hi> would require the presence and continuance of water by reason of the word <hi>this</hi> which is supposed to signifie water: and the change of water into wine would require the absenec or non existency of water, it being supposed to be <hi>changed into wine,</hi> and so water would be and not be at the same tyme, which is a formall contradiction, and acknowledged by all to be wholy impossible. So bold are Protestants in restrayning and limiting the Omnipotency of God to defend their own groundlesse phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, who oppose the Romane Church in this manner. And therefore the more moderate and considerate amongst them grant this to be possible; and soe vrge not this argument because it proues either too much, or noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Secondly demand, when our Sauiour sayd, <hi>this is my command that yee loue one another,</hi> what was meant by the word <hi>this</hi>?<note place="margin">Iohn. 15. v. 12.</note> either somthing, or nothing was meant by it: if somthing, that was either the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand which he gaue after the pronuntiation of the word <hi>this</hi>; and so somthing which was not when he pronounced the word <hi>this,</hi> was vnderstood by it. And then in our present question why cannot by the word <hi>this</hi> somthing be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47142:113"/>
which was not at that instant when he pronounced the word <hi>this.</hi> Or by the word <hi>this</hi> in the former speech of the command, was vnderstood somthing which was not his command: but this is absurd; for then he should haue sayd <hi>that which is not my command, is my command.</hi> if it be sayd, that nothing was vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the word <hi>this</hi> it will follow, that the word, <hi>this</hi> signifyed nothing; and so his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was nothing, or nothing was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or the word of God signifyed nothing all which is absurd.</p>
                     <p>Hence therefore it euidently followes, that the word <hi>this</hi> in the text <hi>This is my command that yee loue one another</hi> &amp;c. cannot haue any other sense saue this.<note place="margin">Iohn 15. v, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>This which I am presently to say to you, to wit, that yee loue one another, is my command.</hi> and this sense, and manner of speech is so ordinary, both in holy Scripture, and common discourse, that there can be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the vnderstanding of it: for it is not necessary that the thing which is signifyed by the word <hi>this</hi> in such manners of speech be then existent, or in being when the word <hi>this</hi> is pronunced; for ir may be either past, or to come. thus it is ordinary to say in the day tyme, <hi>I hope to sleepe well this night,</hi> that is the night <hi>to come:</hi> or, in the morning, <hi>I haue slept well this night,</hi> that is, <hi>the last night past.</hi> and this, not only by reason of the thing it selfe whereof
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47142:113"/>
we speake, but also in regard of the meaning and intention of the person who speakes: for words were not instituted to signify thinges and obiects only, but also, (and that more immediatly (the thoughts and affections of him who speakes: and hence it comes to passe, when the same word signifyes many things, it is to be explicated and taken in that sense only which appeares to haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them who speake. hence, therefore it happens, that, seeing things not yet in being when the word <hi>this</hi> is pronounced, may be vnderstood by it, we must gather that a thing not yet existent, is to be vnderstood when it appeares by other cleare circumstances, that the meaning and intention of the speaker is, to signify somthing which is not actually when the word <hi>this</hi> was pronounced, but after is to be.</p>
                     <p>Thus in the forenamed example, where our Sauiour sayd, <hi>This is my command, that yee loue one another,</hi> it is cleare that his meaning was, by the word <hi>this</hi> to signify that which he was presently after to say; and not. what was iust then when he sayd the word <hi>this.</hi> for then no command was giuen. And that this significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>this,</hi> is most common and familiar, euen in ordinary discours, is manifest in a thousand instances: thus when I beginne to draw a circle, and when I haue drawn,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47142:114"/>
only thus much of it C (precisely when I say the word <hi>this</hi>) I may truly say <hi>this is a circle</hi>: wherby my meaning is not, <hi>this c beeing a little part of a circle, is a circle</hi>; (for that is no circle) but, <hi>this figure which now I am a drawing, or shall presently draw, is a circle.</hi> Thus, if one beginning to power wine into a glasse, when he hath powred some few dropps, or small quantity, into the glasse, should say, <hi>this is a glasse full of wine,</hi> it being only full when the last word <hi>wine</hi> is pronounced, certainly the word <hi>this</hi> cannot signify that small quantity of wine which was in the glasse precisely when the word <hi>this</hi> was pronounced; for that is not a glasse full, but the wine which he is then a powring into the glasse, till he haue filled it with wine, must be signifyed by the word <hi>this.</hi> In the same maner, if one desirous to shew to another, how quikly flax becomes fire, holding flax in one hand and a candle in the other, flax being in its own naturall substance in that precize instant, when the word this is pronounced, should say <hi>This is fire,</hi> and as he pronounces the words, he kindles the flax, soe that when the whole sentence, <hi>this is fire,</hi> is pronounced, the flax is kindled, and changed into fire, noe man can be soe simple to thinke, that his meaning is, this flax rema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing as it now is vnkindled, is fire, but this which I am now a shewing, to wit, flax kindled <hi>is fire</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> noe other
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47142:114"/>
wise happens it in our present case, where our Sauiour, by the word <hi>this,</hi> intends not to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, this bread remaining as it now is, when I prunounce the word <hi>this</hi> is my Body, but being consecrated, and by consecration changed into my Body, (as flax by being kindled is changed into fire) <hi>is my Body.</hi> This supposed, as a ground of this truth, I answer to the whole discours of the obiection, that, when our Sauiour sayd, <hi>this is my Body, this is my Bloud,</hi> his meaning was, <hi>This which I am to giue vnto you. and which yee are presently to eate and drinke, is my Body and my Bloud:</hi> which, though it were not existent actually then when he pronounced the word <hi>this,</hi> yet it was to be presently after; no otherwise then when he sayd, <hi>this is my command</hi>; not of any command which was then giuen, but of one which he was presently to giue when he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the word <hi>this.</hi> That this was the meaning of our Sauiour in the institution of this Sacrament, is most cleare to all such as vnderstandingly reade the text for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his disciples to <hi>take and eate</hi> what he was instituting in this holy Sacrament, <hi>Take, eate, this is my Body.</hi> Therefore his meaning was to signify by the word <hi>this,</hi> that which his disciples were to take and eate. now his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were not to take and eate any thing but what was instituted and made a Sacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

before it was eaten: neither was the Sacrament instituted but by the words of consecration, <hi>This is my Body</hi>; which I haue allready proued. Therefore the word <hi>this,</hi> according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours meaning, must signify somthing which was to be after the words of consecration, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> So farre from truth is it that by the word <hi>this,</hi> our Sauiour intended to signify that which he held in his hands whilst he precisely pronounced that word <hi>this,</hi> that he signifyed that which he was to giue out of his hands, and put into the hands of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and therefore he sayes not <hi>see, behold,</hi> but, <hi>take, eate, This is my Body</hi>; that is, not what ye now see whilst I say the word <hi>this</hi>; but what I command you to take and eate presently, <hi>is my Body.</hi> And yet this truth is made clearer in the institution of the chalice,<note place="margin">Matth. 26 v. 28.</note>

Certainly in the whol new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment no such expresse words as these, are to be found. Seeing therfore our Sauiour sayes in expresse and plaine words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and neuer sayes in as expresse termes, <hi>that is to say, a commemoration or remembrance of my Bady,</hi> nor so much as once names <hi>the commemoration
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47142:117"/>
of his Body,</hi> is it not to glosse the word of God, and adde some thing of your own, to affirme that he says what he neuer sayd nor named in the whole new Testament? If therefore you stick to your rule iust now deliuered, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the expresse word of God without all glosse or addition, you must stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without all scruple, that out Sauiour gaue his true Body to his disciples; seeing what you say of the commemoration of his Body, is no where our Sauiours expresse words, but your own glosse and addition to them.</p>
                     <p>If you answer, that though he says not in as expresse words, that what he gaue to his disciples, was a commemoration of his Body, as he says, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> yet that may be gathered to be his meaning by other words: giue me leaue to reply first, that supposing any such matter could be gathered from his words (which I will presently proue to be false) yet the consequence or collection drawn from an others words, is not to be preferred before his direct, cleare and expresse words to the contrary, and if you will follow the rule of good interpreters, you must expound the more obscure words by the more cleere and expresse, and not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary as you doe here. Secondly when you draw from other words of our Sauiour this consequence that he meant
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47142:117"/>
that that which he called his body was as much as to say, <hi>commemoration or remembrance of his Body,</hi> either you haue some expresse place of Scripture which warrants that consequence to be good (and that place must be alleaged which will he as hard to find as the other proposition <hi>this is a commemoration of my Body,</hi> neither the one nor the other being any where in Scripture) or you must beleeue some thing with a Christian faith (as you professe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this consequence) which not withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not in Scripture: which is contrary to your own principle of <hi>beleeuing nothing which is not in the written word of God.</hi> and if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence be not in the written word of God, then it is framed only by your own discours and iudgement. what impiety then would it be to preferre your own discours before the expresse words of our Sauiour, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them, and draw them from theyr own naturall, proper and direct sense, to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and figuratiue by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by humane discours only, neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed nor warranted to be good expressely in any place of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly that I may giue a full and compleat answer to this objection so frequently in the mouth of euery Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I denie that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour euer speake or meant our could possibly meane that that which his Apostles did eate,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47142:118"/>
and he affirmed to be his body, was only <hi>a commemoration of his Body:</hi> or that by these words <hi>my Body</hi> is vnderstood <hi>a commemoration of my Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this may appeare, I only contend for the present that in time of our Sauiours insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrament at the last super that which the Apostles did then receiue and eate, was <hi>for that time</hi> not affirmed to be a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Body, nor did our Sauiour speake any words in the said institution where by he signified that he gaue <hi>then</hi> to his apostles a remembrance or commemoration of his body, which if I proue, I conuince euidently against the obiection, that our Sauiour (not hauing euer said or meant it to be a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of his body; and so these words, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> being noe explication of the former word: <hi>This is my Body</hi>) gaue his true and reall body substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tially present vnder the forme of bread to his Apostles in his last supper, and consequently that it is still giuen in the same manner to all true Christians in this Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>I haue proued, and the obiection it selfe confesses that these words taken in themselues and without relation to any thing going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are to be vnderstood of the reall body of Christ, and that our Sauiour said that the thing which he had in his hands, <hi>was his body.</hi>
                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:47142:118"/>
I will now proue that this plane and cleere signification of these words as they sound, is not hindred or taken away by any thing following these words. The maine ground where vppon is built the obiection, for the figuratiue explication of these words is this that our Sauiour sayes, <hi>This is my Body which is gIuen for you: this doe in remembrance of me.</hi> and S. Paul, <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you, doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> From these textes the obiection gathers this consequence that our Sauiour saith that that which he calles in the former part of the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in expresse words, <hi>his Body,</hi> in this latter he calles (by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>the remembrance or commemoration of his Body.</hi> So that by these words <hi>my Body</hi>: he meant the remembrance or commemoration of my body: and indeed if our Sauiour had expressely said thus, <hi>This is usy Body, that is the cowmemoration or remembrance of my Body</hi>: the difficulty had beene at an end. but this was neither said nor meant by him, but imposed vppon him by a false glosse and grosse mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke of Protestants; for to say: <hi>doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> and to say: <hi>this is a remembrance of my Body</hi> are as different as to say when one friend lends a booke vnto an other: <hi>read this in remembrance of me,</hi> and, <hi>this is a remembrance of my Body,</hi> which euery child will see to be quite different: and if any one should say that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47142:119"/>
these two sayings were the same in meaning and signification he would either be thought to haue no wit, or to haue lost what he had: for the one speakes of an action which passes, <hi>doe,</hi> or <hi>read this</hi>: the other of a thing permanent <hi>this thing,</hi> or <hi>this booke.</hi> the one speakes of <hi>a worke done in remembrance,</hi> the other affirmes <hi>a thing to be a remembrance.</hi> the one speakes of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>of me</hi>: the other of <hi>a Body</hi> which is but one part of the person who consists both of soul and body vnited: so that the whol proposition is quite different the one from the other.</p>
                     <p>Secondly though these propositions had not beene so different as they are, yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour cannot possibly be thought to haue meant by these words <hi>my Body, a mere remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Body,</hi> because this explication must be verified of the bread which was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by our Sauiour in his last supper, as it is euident. For he speakes of that euen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Protestants. now that could not be a, remembrance of his body, for nothing is said, according to Protestants to be a remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of a thing which is actually and visibly present as the body of our Sauiour then was to the Apostles being seene &amp; heard by them: neither could it be a remembrance of his passion because we remember things past, not to come as the passion of our Sauiour then was, and so it should haue been a type of our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47142:119"/>
Sauiours death, as the ceremonies of the old law were before he dyed, and not <hi>a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> or commemoration. Therefore it is euident that by the thing which he called his body in his last supper, could not be meant a remembrance of his body as Protestants would haue it, and so this explication is very false. Therefore when our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apostles in these words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> he could not meane any action or thing then present or done at that time, but an action which he enioyned the Apostles and their successors to doe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Christian Church, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his passion principally, which is cleerely deliuered by S. Paul 1. Cor. 11. v. 26.27. <hi>This is the new testament in my bloud, this doe as often as you drinke in remembrance of me.</hi> where the greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies, shall drinke, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiescumque bibetis, doe this so often as you shall drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.</hi> and so it is translated by Beza, in his latin translation, <hi>quotiescumque biberitis,</hi> as often as you <hi>shall drinke,</hi> and should haue been by our English Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slatours, had they closely followed the greeke text, as they pretend to doe, but here it made not for theyr pourpose, and soe they put it eyther falsly, or at least obscurely, soe often as you drinke; which euidently shews that our Sauiour meant by: <hi>doe this.</hi> not any action which was done in time of the last
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47142:120"/>
supper or institution and receiuing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by the Apostles, but what they were to doe in the future: and that our Sauiour in these words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> did not command the present action of eating and drinking when our Lord celebrated his last supper, is euident, because had it been of the present action, it would follow that he twice commanded the same action to be done at the same time, for he commanded his Apostles to doe what was then to be done when he said, <hi>take, eate. drinke</hi> &amp;c. therefore to free our Sauiour from a nedelesse tautologie, must be vnderstood the command of doing some thing else, and at some other time, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in these words, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me</hi>: especially considering that the mention of remembrance could not be vnderstood of any thing then visibly present, or after to come, as I said before. These words therefore being to be vnderstood of the consecrating and frequenting of this Sacrament for the future only, cannot possibly be an explication of the former words, <hi>this is my Body</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which speake only of a thing that is then present, as is euident, and consequently those words (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the obiection) are plainely &amp; simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be beleeued as they sound, without any glossing of the words of our Sauiour (there being no ground in this place of Scripture for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47142:120"/>
any such figuratiue glosse, (as I haue prouued) and each Christian must beleeue that that thing which our Sauiour gaue his Apostles was his very body as his affirmed it to be.</p>
                     <p>If happily not withstanding that this were granted, some Protestants should gather from these words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> that this Sacrament in times insuing after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours death was only to be a remembrance of his body, and so not his body, whatsoeuer is to be said of rhat Sacrament in the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I answer that though some ancient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques haue been of this opinion, yet I neuer heard of any Protestant who held that the Christians after our Sauiours time receiued not the same which the Apostles did from his hands; and so this obiection is to noe purpose for the Protestants.</p>
                     <p>Yet that I may cleare all difficulties which may probably occurre against what I haue said in this matter: I answer that this is noe good consequence: our Sauiour would haue this Sacrament celebrated and frequented in remembrance of him, therefore the hoast after the consecration is only a remembrance of his body and not his true body: or thus, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which Christ called his body in the institution, is now amongst Christians only the remembrance of his body. for if these words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> were not an
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47142:121"/>
explication of those others: <hi>This is my Body</hi>: in the first institution, they will neuer be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieation of them, and so there will be noe reason to say that the meaning of thesc words: <hi>this is my Body, is this: this is a remembrance of my Body,</hi> by reason of these words: <hi>doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me:</hi> for these words only signifie that the action here commanded, <hi>doe this</hi>: is to be in remembrance of me, not that the thing conteyncd in the Sacrament was to be a remembrance of him. now who can doubt but the same person may doe one action in remembrance of himselfe, that is, of some action which he had done before? how ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary is it for any one to write his own workes and what he himselfe hat done or suffered? did not S. Faul doe this? and was not this done in remembrance of himselfe, doing or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such things: and shall any thence make this consequence: S. Paul writ this in remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of himselfe, therefore he was a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of himselfe, therefore it was not S. Paul who writ it, for nothing can be a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it selfe: who sees not how false and childish this discours is? may we not say the same of our Sauiour when he appeared to S. Thomas whom he put in remembrance of himselfe suffering vppon the crosse, when he commanded him to put his hand into his side, and looke vppon his hands and feet &amp;c.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47142:121"/>
and shall we then say that our Sauiour was not himselfe, or that is Body was not that which suffered because it did something in remembrance of his body crucified? what Christian will dare to discours in this manner? if then our Sauiours own body that suffered vppon the crosse can doe something to put vs in remembrance of the same body crucifyed once for vs, why should we denie that the same body sacrificed vppon the altar, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated vppon the table of God should be able to put vs in remembrance of the passion of our Sauiour, and of the very same body crucified, that is those actions there done of consecrating the hoast separate from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, of sacrificing, of giuing to others, eating, drinking &amp;c. should signifie that our Sauiour there inuisibly present, suffered for vs many yeares agoe and sacrificed himselfe to nourish vs to eternall life. and so our Sauiour not hauing said, <hi>this is a remembrance of my Body,</hi> but, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> by vertue of these words precisely made the actions done to him in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and not himselfe or his body, a remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of himselfe as béfore crucified.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>son may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of themselues considered in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent circumstances, for though nothing in the same time, place and circumstances can be a remembrance or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of it selfe, for that were to signifie <hi>idem per idem,</hi> the same by the same, which is absurd: and in this sence the obiection sayes well; yet it would nor be absurd to say I giue you this ring now to be a remembrance or commemoration here after that this same ring was giuing you by me for who can doubt but that very same ring when he lookes or thinkes vppon it who receaued it, is apt to put him in remembrance that it was giuen to him by such a friend so many dayes or yeares before and so at one
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47142:122"/>
time it is a remembrance of it selfe, as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a nother different precedent time. Thus when friends and ancient acquintance after a long separation meet first togeather, they presently put the one the other in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of themselues, and so are accous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to say, I remember you very well: Thus if a king or Generall should act his own part vppon a stage. he would put his subiects or souldiers there present in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of himselfe fighting or becoming victorious in some precedent battel. Thus our Sauiour appearing to S. Thomas made him presently beleeue and remember that he was the same person who not many dayes before was crucified for him, and to say: <hi>Dominus meus &amp; Deus meus</hi>: my Lord and my God. Hence appeares manifestly that the very same body which was giuen and that very blood which was shed for vs remaning in its own proper substance and nature in this Sacrament which it then had (but after an inuisible and diuine manner) by reason of the visible actions of consecrating, sacrificing, eleuating, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of him, puts vs in remembrance of that same body, blood and person which so many yeares agoe was giuen, shed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified out of pure mercy for vs. If any one here shouid replye that though in the fore named instances he proued that one thing or
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47142:123"/>
person may put vs in remembrance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in different times and circumstances, yet the same thing cannot properly be said to be a remembrance, commemoration or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of it selfe euen in those different ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes according to the ordinary cours of speach amongst men. I answer that when a thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in its whole visible substance as it was before, there may be some difficulties whether it be to be called a memoriall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it selfe or noe, though it he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of putting one in remembrance of it selfe, as existent in some other time, because it hath other functions and perfections properly belonging to it which being of cheefer and more primary vse and consequence giue the name to the thing, and so it is not rightly termed a memory or remembrance of it selfe, but when it actually reduces any one to the temembrance of it. But when a thing is so changed in respect of its proper functions amongst men (though it remaines the same in substance and all other proprieties that it was) that one of the maine ends for which it is put in that manner, is to be a remembrance of what it did or suffered in former times, then it may properly be called a memoriall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, remembrance or memory of it selfe. Thus though our Sauiour appearing to his disciples after his resurrection in a visible
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47142:123"/>
and liuing forme put them in remembrance of his passion, or that he was the same who suffered, and yet because his other actions of teaching, inlightning, comforting, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming in faith, &amp;c. were his primarie actions he had his appellations according to to them, and not from the remembrance which he caused in them, because that was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary and of lesse consequence. But by reason that in this holy Sacrament he hath noe vse of any of those functions or the like, but is put in an inuisible and hidden manner as the food of our soules, and the end why he is so put is cheefly to continue a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his bitter death and passion, he is most deseruedly termed a memoriall of himselfe suffering vppon the crosse. Thus for the like reason a sword wherewith some va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant champion hath atcheeued some notable feate of armes, so long as he weares it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or any other vses it, it cannot properly be said to be a remembrance of it selfe, as the instrument of those famous exploits: but if it be hung vp as a monument for those exploits in some publike place or temple, it becomes a memoriall of it selfe as working those noble actions, and in this sense the sword of Golias vsed by Dauid in the beheading of that tower of flesch, and kept in the temple as a monument, was a true memoriall of it

                     <p>The obiecter would make vs to be of a very short memory, should we forget these words which vsually we pronounce euery day in saying Masse: we therefore remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber very well that our Sauiour sayd according to S. Luke and S. Paul: <hi>This cup is the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my blood.</hi> but we remember not that either S. Luke or S. Paul or any other writer of holy Scripture euer alleadged this reason here mentioned in the obiection, that this sacred cup was called by our Sauiour the new Testament in his blood, for that <hi>it was a holy signe of the new Testament,</hi> and I would gladly haue any Protestant helpe the weakenesse of our memory by producing any clere text of Scripture where this reason is giuen, and if there be noe such to be found (as vndoubtedly there is not) then they must giue vs leaue to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47142:125"/>
esteeme this explication (according to their own principles) groundlesse and noe way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Christian faith, but a mere glosse framed from their naturall discours or rather a pure mistake grown from their ignoranee of the true meaning of the word, <hi>new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here, according to the Scriptures accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that word, which that it may appeare.</p>
                     <p>We must not by new Testament here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand (as many ignorant readers of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may and doe happily misconceaue) the bookes of the Gospel commonly called <hi>the new Testament,</hi> for none of those were then written, neither is there any one of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing who will thinke that the cup which our Sauiour had in his hand was a signe of the bookes of the new Testament, much lesse that by new Testament in our Sauiours blood should be vnderstood a signe of the said bookes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly we must conceaue that the very same thing may be a signe in respect of one thing, and an essentiall and substantiall part in regard of another: thus words and sentences are signes of the inward thoughts and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the speaker, but part of his outward discours, and in this manner the words, <hi>new Testament</hi> were a signe of our Sauiours inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall will and intention, but withall were a necessary part of the compleat Testament of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47142:125"/>
the new law then inacted by our Sauiour, and so beare the name of the whol Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we shall presently see.</p>
                     <p>I answer therefore to the obiection, and deny that by <hi>new Testament,</hi> is vnderstood a signe of the <hi>new Testament,</hi> but truly &amp; really (though partially) the new Testament it selfe solemnised by our Sauiour in his last supper not long before his death, and that in his own most precious blood there properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued and diuided amongst his Apostles: whereby he certified and obliged himselfe to be the authour, head, protectour &amp; defendour of his law and all those who should truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it by giuing what he held in his hands to the Apostles, and they testified and obliged themselues and all Christians representatiuely to teach, professe and continue in that law by receauing and diuiding of it amongst them.</p>
                     <p>Now to make cleare what I haue sayd, wee must also know in generall what a Testament is. In latin it is called <hi>testamentum</hi>: of wose ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie Iustinianus Instit. de testamentis or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinandis, sayes, <hi>Testamentum ex eo appellatur, quòd testatio mentis sit.</hi> it is called a testament, because it is the testification of our mynde, or will: so that a true testament includes two thinges, a reall minde and intention to doe what we testify: and an outward testification of what we intend, or oblige, our selues to doe. so that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47142:126"/>
neyther this outward <hi>testimony</hi> without the inward <hi>will,</hi> nor the inward <hi>will</hi> without the outward <hi>testifying of it,</hi> can be compleatly termed a testament. not the inward will alone, because that cannot be vnderstood amongst men vnlesse it be externally testifyed: not the outward testimony alone, because it must haue something reall which it testifyes; but the outward testification as corresponding to the inward will, and exhibiting it to others, is a testament. now all kindes of externall signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of our wills ot intentions, are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but such as signify by way of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate confirmation, that the will of him who makes this testament, is such as it is signifyed there to be: and hence it is that so many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, subscriptions, seales, and other solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes are not mere signes, buts parts of the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the pronuntiation of the wordes in a sermon, though it be a signe of the minde of a preacher, yet it is essentially required as a part of the sermon.</p>
                     <p>Now this outward part of the testament, or last compliment or confirmation of it, was accustomed to be exhibited in bloud;<note place="margin">Liu. l. 1.</note> as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Liuie speaking of a solemne league or testament made betwixt the Romans and the Albans and no lesse Moyses in Exodus,<note place="margin">Exod. 24. v. 8.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47142:126"/>
our Sauiour may we haue alluded in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the chalice. vsing according to the first two Euangelists, the very same phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, or maner of speech, <hi>This is the bioud of the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which our Lord hath made with you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>This is my bloud of the new Testawent,</hi> &amp;c. the word testament is in Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>diatheke,</hi> and though the Hebrew word signify a pact, league, or solemne promise mutually obligatory betwixt two parties, and the Greeke word a testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or last will of a person before his death, and confirmed by it,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.53. Ps. 54.21. Ps 29.34. Ps. 105.45</note> as S. Paul sayes Hebr. 9. yet because that last will is the most solemne and strong of all other pacts, or leagues, the Greeke word diatheke often signifyes a pact or promise mutuall, in Scripture. And the Septuaginta translate the Hebrew <hi>Berith</hi> by the Greeke <hi>diatheke,</hi> as S. Hierome notes Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. 9.11. and Psal. 82.1. Mach. 1. and often the English Protestant translations for <hi>berith</hi> put <hi>testament</hi>; thus they call the arke of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the arke of the testament, <hi>Berith</hi> in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore in the 24. of Exodus, the bloud is there sprinkled first vppon the aultar, which supplyed the place of God, and then amongst all the people wherby, as Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and ancient authours obserue, was signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed that the bloud of that party who first
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47142:127"/>
broke this pact, or testament, should be shed, and dispersed as that was, and that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in S. Matthew and S.

                     <p>And hence may clerly enough be gathered, first, that our Sauiour himselfe held, the cup of his bloud, to confirme this league, or pact betwixt him and mankinde, of his part, as the Apostles tooke it and drunke it to confirme it of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>yrs; and so it is called, as it is, his bloud of the new testamens, that is, whereby the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament of the law of Grace was stregthned, confirmed, and accomplished on both parts. Secondly, that as in a testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, an authenticall instrument drawn of any dying mans wili,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47142:127"/>
witnessed, subscribed, sealed, &amp;c. is rightly and ptoperly called his last will, and testament; so in our present occasion, the couenant, or will of our Sauiour, testifyed or confirmed by his bloud, is rightly called the new Testament of Christ, and that sacred bloud of his as testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and confirming this will, and decree, is most properly termed by our Sauiour, in S. Luke, and S. Paul, the new Testament in his his bloud, that being the authenticall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherby this will of his was confirmed, and testifyed. And hence euidently appeares how vaine &amp; false the explication here giuen by the oppone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, for if here by new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be only to be vnderstood a signe of the new Testament, then Exod. 24. by Testament should be only vnderstond, a signe of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament then made betwixt God and the Isrealites, (the very same phrase being vsed in both places) which were ridiculous.</p>

                     <p>I am not obliged to defend euery mans different opinion, each hath his particular reasons, and wayes to maynteyne his own: it is sufficient that I defend what before I haue answeared, and demonstrated out of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that our Sauiours meaning by the word <hi>this,</hi> was to signify nothing precisely present by way of a Sacrament when the word <hi>this</hi> was pronounced, but what was to be present when the Apostles tooke, and ate it, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently before; that is, so soone as the wholl proposition <hi>this is my Body,</hi> was pronounced. which sense, by way of instance may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the expression vsed here by the opponent, when it is sayd, <hi>for whether by this worde, this,</hi> and, <hi>or that they will by the worde,</hi> this.

To this objection I answer that it is a mere calumnie forged by Caluin, and from him dispersed amongst the vulgar, that any Romane Catholicque Doctours by the word <hi>is</hi> vnderstand <hi>shall become,</hi> or, <hi>shall be transubstantiated</hi>; for though they gather, as a necessary sequel, transubstantiation, from the reall and proper signification of these words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> yet they all vnderstand the word
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47142:130"/>
is, in its own natiue, common, and ordinary signification, and none of them take it for <hi>transubstantiated,</hi> or <hi>become my Body,</hi> neyther indeede can they, vnlesse they destroy their own principles, for if they should by <hi>is</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <hi>become,</hi> or <hi>transubstantiated,</hi> then they must vnderstand by the word <hi>this, bread</hi>; (seeing they all affirme that bread only beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, or is transubstantiated into Christ's body) but that were plainly to contradict themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, it being one of the maynest points in this controuersy betwixt Caluinists and vs, they affirming that <hi>hread</hi> is vnderstood by the word <hi>this,</hi> and we denying it.</p>
                     <p>That which is added, that, <hi>those distractions can be no testimonyes of truth,</hi> that is, the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinions amongst vs here reckoned vp, about the vnderstanding of these wordes <hi>this.</hi> and <hi>is,</hi> seemes to me to haue something of that eye condemned in the Gospell, which sees a mote in anothers eye, and discouers not a beame in it selfe. The opponent summes here vp fower differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t opinions, whereof the last, I haue proued to be a false imposition and no opinion of ours: the first and second, of the word <hi>this</hi> signifying <hi>vnder this,</hi> or <hi>vnder these species,</hi> are one and the same opinion, set down by the opponent in different words; for seeing by <hi>vnder this,</hi> none of our Authours vnderstand <hi>vnder this bread,</hi> they must needs
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47142:130"/>
meane by it, <hi>vnder these species of bread,</hi> to omit that no Catholicque Authour sayes, that the word <hi>this,</hi> precisely signifyes, <hi>vnder this,</hi> or <hi>vnder these species,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>that which is vnder these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, is my Body:</hi> the third opinion, that by the word <hi>this,</hi> is signifyed <hi>nothing present,</hi> if by <hi>noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present,</hi> be meant, nothing present after consecration, it is another imposition vppon Catholicque Authours, making them speake like Caluinists, against themselues: but if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be meant, nothing present precisely in that mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t when the word <hi>this</hi> was pronounced, it is true, and Catholicque, as I haue shewed; but then it is not opposite to the former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for seing no Catholike teaches that the body of our Sauiour is vnder the species of bread, till the substance of bread be transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated into it, agrees well with their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that nothing in particular be vnderstood by the word <hi>this,</hi> which is existent when that word was spoktn, bread being then vnder its own species. Thus, vppon a iust examination, we finde that in truth there is but one only opinion of Catholicques in the whol reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore vnderseruedly termed <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,</hi> or <hi>no testimonies</hi> of truth. But had the opponent put some reall diuersity of opinions amongst Catholicque Authours about the vnderstanding of these words, and brought them to the number of fower, as here is a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47142:131"/>
shew made, yet seing they all agree in the proper and natiue signification of these words <hi>This is my Body,</hi> without all figures or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, which exclude the reall presence: this variety can be no more termed no testimony of truth in this poynt controuersed, then are other different opinions of Schoolemen in many other mysteries of faith, being nothing but diuers wayes which learned men take to explicate or defend the same point of faith wherin they all agree against Infidells or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques. But had the Opponent known or considered the diuersityes of opinions risen vp within the space of few more then a hundrcd yeares, about the vnderstanding of these words <hi>this is my Body</hi> amongst Protestants, and that in the mayne signification of them, which Luther confesses to haue amounted to the number of ten before his death, and another not many yeares after rekons vp to the number of two hundred there had beene iust occasion giuen to say, <hi>these dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Opponent cannot deny but our Sauiour might haue sayd of that which he had in his hands (<hi>this is bread</hi>) when he sayd the word <hi>this.</hi> now I demand, seing according to all, there were two thinges (as the Opponent termes them) the substance of bread, and the <hi>species</hi> of bread, whether these words <hi>this is bread</hi> had been only halfe true, or no? if it be answered that they had been but halfe true, it will follow, that whensoeuer we demonstrate any thing; in ordinary conuersation, saying, this is a man, a horse, a tree, a stone &amp;c. we speake but halfe truly, because there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the substance, and species, or accidents of those things, yea when S. Iohn Baptist sayd, behold the lamb of God, or the heauenly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47142:132"/>
Father, <hi>this is my beloued Son,</hi> our Sauiour hauing both substance and species, those propositions had been but halfe true. if it be answered, that this proposition <hi>this is bread,</hi> is absolutely and entirely true, then I answer the same to all that is here opposed; for species, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are not different thinges, absolutely speaking, but relatiue appendixes, dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, adjuncts, or exhibitions of thinges which are so absolutly denominated, that is, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; as when we see a person cloathed, it is absolutely, and wholly true to say, this is Peeter, or Iohn; for though there be two things, the person, and the cloathes, yet the cloathes being only adjuncts, or meanes to demonstrate the person whose they are, are not intended to be included in this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. and so, if one hauing only regard to the cloake of a person, should say, <hi>this is not Peter,</hi> meaning <hi>this cloake is not Peeter,</hi> though he should speake true to such as know his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet in ordinary conuersation, vnlesse by some particular signe he gaue to vnderstand his meaning, he would either not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or vnderstood to speake false, because the demonstration <hi>this</hi> is instituted in such circumstances, to signify the person or thing demonstrable, and not their adjuncts, ot acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Apply this to our present purpose, and all is solued.</p>

                     <p>That which our Sauiours tooke, blessed, brake, and gaue, was bread: for certaine it is that which he tooke, was bread, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to haue been so by both sydes: but that which he tooke, he blessed, that which he blessed he brake; that which he brake, he gaue; therefore from the first to the last, that which he gaue his disciples, was bread. I
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47142:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
answer that all this is true; for it was bread in denomination both which he tooke, blessed, brake, and gaue; but the bread which he tooke, was bread remayning in its own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, the bread which he ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, was <hi>bread made his body,</hi> and yet it was the same bread in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; for the very same bread which was yet in its own nature when he tooke it, was made his body when gaue it.</p>
                     <p>Now if one should reply that this is sayd gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, and seemes to be a mere shift, for obscuring and inuoluing the matter to escape the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, or rather an explication destroying and contradicting it selfe; I will shew that this is sayd with great ground, euen in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it selfe: for if an Infidell should oppose the change of water into wyne, in the second of S. Ihon with the like argument, &amp; say, that that wherewhith the seruants filled the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels at our Sauiours command, was that which they drew out of the vessels; that which they drew out, was that which they carryed to the maister of the mariage-feast; that which they carryed to him, he drunke; but that which the seruants filled the vessels first withall, was water; therefore that which the maister of the feast, drunke, was water. A Christian vnto such an objection may answer, that all this is true; if we respet only the name or denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the thing: for that which was put
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47142:134"/>
into the vessels, the maister drunke, and as it is true that water was put into them, so is it true (to say) that the master of the feast drunke water; but the very same water which re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayned in its own nature when in was put into the vessels, was denominated <hi>water made wyne,</hi> when the maister drunke it.</p>
                     <p>And that this may appeare to be no fiction of myne, all that I affirme herof, is plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the Protestant Bible the words are these. <hi>Iesus saith vnto them,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Io. 2. v. 7.8.9.</note> 
                        <hi>fill the water-pots with water.</hi> here behold water was to be put into them; <hi>and they filled them to the brimme:</hi> see here is water put into them by the seruanrs. <hi>and he sayd vnto them, draw out now, and beare to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the feast, and they bare it.</hi> marke yet here, the seruant bare it, that is, that which they had put into the vessells, which was water. <hi>when thc Ruler of the feast had tasted the water which was made wyne and knew not whence it was,</hi> behold it is still called water, not water remayning in its owne being, but water made wyne: <hi>but the seruants which drew the water, knew</hi>: still it is called watcr: and <hi>the water,</hi> that is, the very same that it was in denomination, when it was put in, but <hi>changed into wyne.</hi> Apply this in each particular to the present mystery, and it will appeare how light the objection is, fit only to deceiue vnlearned people who are not acquainted with such subtilityes, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phismes

                     <p>I haue giuen iust now a full answer to that which is objected here, that S. Paul calls the hoast <hi>bread</hi> three tymes after consecration:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.20.28.</note> for it follows no more that therefore it should be <hi>pure bread,</hi> remayning as it was before the words of consecration; then that the <hi>water</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in its own nature after it was made <hi>wyne,</hi> because after the change it is called <hi>water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither doth yet S. Paul (if his words be well marked) say that the consecrated hoast is naturall and common bréad, such as it was before, fit to be eaten at an ordinary table, as the Protestants must grant it not to be: for at the least it is sacramentall bread, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to a religious and holy vse, according to them, and therefore though he had put the same word <hi>bread,</hi> before and after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it follows not that the signification of that word after consecrati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n should be the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47142:135"/>
same with the signification of the same before consecration; for before it signifyes common, ordinary, naturall, and vsuall bread; but after, sacramentall, significant, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoratiue, holy, diuine bread, according to Protestants, and therefore if Ptotestants must confesse that though the word be the same, yet the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not the same, why blame they Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicques if they giue the same answer, saying that by the word <hi>bread</hi> in S. Paul, before consecration, or blessing, is meant the substance of naturall, and vsuall bread; but after consecration, supernaturall, heauenly, spirituall, diuine bread; which our Sauiour termeth himselfe to be, in the sixt of S. Iohn, six or seauen different tymes, and which euery Christian chiefly begs of God in the Pater noster, or Lords prayer, saying, giue <hi>vs this day our dayly bread</hi>; for it is to be noted, that bread in greeke, familiarly in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is taken for all manner os meate, and not for <hi>bread</hi> only, as it is distinct from all other meates.</p>
                     <p>But to make it yet clearer that S. Paul did not meane naturall bread remaning in its own substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as it was before, when he called the Sacrament <hi>bread</hi> after it was consecrated or designed for a part of that holy mystery: it is particularly to be reflected on, that in this acceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he neuer calls it absolutly bread,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47142:136"/>
but allways with in article determinatiue or restrictiue, referring it to that which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration had made it; and so he calls it, <hi>this bread, this cup, that bread, that cup,</hi> to wit, which was held for a Sacrament, and mystery amongst Christians by force of our Sauiours <hi>words</hi>: and to put vs out of all doubt that it was not that naturall bread and wine, which it was before it was consecrated, he clearly calls it the bread of our Lord, and the cup of our Lord, v. 29. <hi>wherfore whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup of our Lord vnworthily.</hi> &amp;c. and as we gather Ioan. 6. v. 48. that when our Sauiour termed the bread whereof he spoke there, <hi>the bread of life,</hi> he meant not naturall and visible bread, but supernaturall and diuine; in the same manner are we to gather from the words of S. Paul, that by the like phrase the like bread is signifyed; and as our Sauiour termes that bread wherof he spake Io. 6. v. 51.58. <hi>this bread,</hi> to distinguish it from naturall and vsuall bread, and to signify that he thereby meant his true body, so also doth S. Paul here: neyther can it more be gathered, from the being tetmed bread by S. Paul, that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and substantiall bread, then it can be gathered from the canon of our masse, that wee beleeue, it to be the substance of bread, because it is often called bread in the said ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, after consecration.</p>

the <hi>body of Christ which is giuen for vs,</hi> to be any other then <hi>his reall true Body,</hi> one would thinke that the darker or more doubtfull word should in any reasonable mans iudgement yeeld to the more cleare and certaine, and be interpreted by it then the contrary which is here alleadged: and though our Sauiour call his <hi>flesh bread</hi> twice as often as S.

seeme vsuall bread, then to ioyne himselfe with the report of our senses, calling it always bread without any explication?</hi> Thus whilst Protestants frame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments fitter for Infidells then Christians, against vs, they neuer consider what force the like arguments haue against themselues.</p>
                     <p>But it is very vntrue that S. Paul called it bread without any explication, or that he any way draws vs to what our senses would iudge if they were left to themselues, but eleuates our thoughts vnto faith telling vs that it is <hi>panis &amp; calix Domini,</hi> the bread, and cup of our Lord, which our Sauiour confesses himselfe to be. Iohn the sixt: and besides, that he who eats this bread, and drinketh this cup of our Lord vnwortily, <hi>shall he guilty of the body and bloud</hi> of the Lord, which giues enough to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what kind of bread, and cup he meant here: for they cannot be properly sayd to be guilty of the body and bloud of Christ, who receiue vnworthily an externall signe, or remembranee of it, (though otherwise they may highly offend him) as a subiect cannot be rightly said to be guilty of the body and bloud of his King, who receiues not his seale or signet with that reuerence which becomes a subiect te shew to his Prince; but in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Catholikes, it is litterally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petly true, being a most high affront and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury done to the very body, and bloud of

Christ there present: and yet this is more clearly insinuated in the 29 verse: for he that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himselfe, not <hi>discerning</hi> the Lord's body: where the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">

if you vrge S. Matthew and S. Mark's authotity for the one, giue vs leaue to vrge S. Luke's authority for the other, and know that you haue concluded nothing, vnlesse you proue that we are rather to stand to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of S. Matthew and S. Marke, then of S. Luke, which here you haue not done. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that there can be no contradiction nor opposition amongst the Euangelists: the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore seeing S. Luke relates these words, <hi>I will drinke no more of the fruit of the vine,</hi> &amp;c. before the institution of the Sacrament; and the two former Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelists after: and yet none of them expressly affirme that our Sauiour sayd these words after or before the Sacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was instituted, though one put them before, and the other after, we must gather by the context and other circumstances, whether indeed they were spoken by our Sauiour before, or after the consecration of the chalice.</p>
                     <p>That this may be vnderstood. Nothing is more otdinary with the Euangelists (as all Interpreters note) then to set things down by transposition, or anticipation, somtymes putt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things iust in that order they happened: somtymes transposing them into a former or latter place. This supposed, it is more probable that S. Marke sets down those words, out of their proper place, then S. Luke. for we haue a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47142:139"/>
cleare testimony that S. Marke in this very institution of the chalice puts those words by way of anticipation, <hi>and they drunke all of it,</hi> out of their ptoper place, the chalice hauing not then been consecrated, nor any of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles hauing then tasted of it. therefore it is more likely of the two, that S. Marke vses here a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sposition, then S. Luke, who reckons all othet things in their proper places and orders, as they happened. and if there be a transposition admitted in S. Marke, it must be also one in S. Matthew. But though it were that our Sauiour sayd these words after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, and that by this fruit of the vine he meant reall and materiall wine, (which I will presently discusse) yet the argument proues nothing at all against vs. for, our Sauiour hauing drunke in his last supper, true and reall wine with his disciples, before the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this holy Sacrament, may very easily be vnderstood to haue referred words to that first dtinking in tyme of his last supper; and so, in relation to that, say,) <hi>I will drinke no more of the fruit of the vine,</hi> &amp;c. as if some person hauing first drunke wine, &amp; after, some other drinke at a banquet, may vsually say, I will drinke no more of the fruit of the vine till I drinke it in my own house: referring, those wordes only to that which he dranke first. neyther can I see how Protestants according to theyr
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47142:140"/>
principle of beleeuing nothing but what is in Scripture can deny this explication, for seeing our Sauiour sais expresly here, I will drinke <hi>noe more</hi> of the fruit of the vine, &amp;c. and that we haue noe place of Scripture which eyther affirmes, or insinuates that our Sauiour then drank of the consecrated cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice he must necessarily, referre his drinking the fruit of the vine, to some other wine which he had drunk, before the conscration. Vnderstanding the two first Euangelists in this manner, we clearly reconcile them with S. Luke. for he must probably be vnderstood of that which our Sauiour dranke before the Sacrament was instituted; as according to this interpretation the others also must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it: but it will be much harder to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them if those words be referred to the consecrated chalice; for, that hauing not been yet instituted, according to S. Luke's setting down our Sauiour's words, they cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be referred to them. for our Sauiour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Protestant opinion, would presently haue drunke wine in the Sacrament, and so must haue falsifyed his own words as soone as he had spoken them, promising then not to drinke any wine till his father's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were come, and yet presently after drinking it. which is an euident argument if we stand to S. Lukes relation according this
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47142:140"/>
explication, that it was not materiall reall wine which he drunke in the consecrated chalice.</p>
                     <p>And hence followes another conuincing argument against Protestants in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. for seeing our Sauiour sayd, <hi>I will drinke no wore,</hi> &amp;c. and that they referre these words against vs, to the consecrated chalice, and consequently must affirme that our Sauiour dranke of it, (for he could not say he would drinke no more of that whereof he had neuer drunk) I demande of them, whether our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour dranke this as a Sacrament? This they cannot deny: hence it will follow that he tooke it as a memoriall, or commemoration of himselfe in their opinion: and thence it will necessarily follow that Christ had forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selue, hauing need of a remembrance of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Secondly, that a man present to himselfe, can without an absurdity take a momoriall of himselfe. Thirdly, this memoriall was to he taken by the mouth of fayth, as they say, and so our Sauiour should be depriued of his most diuine, all-cleare and beatificall vision, and knowledge of himselfe &amp; all things, (wherby S. Paul affirmes that faith is euacuated) and led by the darke light of faith:<note place="margin">1. Cor, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. v. 8.</note> which no Christian can say without blasphemy. Fourtly he commanded not himselfe, but his Apostles to doe what he did in remembrance of him. and so there is no ground in Scripture to say,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47142:141"/>
that out Sauiours receiued this Sacrament a a remembrance of himselfe: and yet he must haue done so if that first Sacrament had been essentially only a signe and remembrance of our Sauiour, as our aduersaries teach. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Sauiour be supposed to haue drunke of the consecrated chalice, and that he could not possibly drinke a remembrance or signe of himselfe, or his Bloud, he must needs haue drunke his own reall Bloud: for according to the Opponent, if it be not a rememhrance of his Bloud. it must be vnderstood to be his reall Bloud; but if he drunk that which was his own blood, it was not wine, therefore when he sayes, <hi>I will drinke noe more of the fruit of the vine</hi> &amp;c. it cannot be referred to what he drunke after consecration, but to what he drunke before, as S. Luke relates it.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I haue argued, admitting, not granting that when our Sauiour sayd, <hi>I will drinke no more of the fruit of the vine,</hi> &amp;c. he meant reall and naturall wine. now I wil shew, that though those words were referred by the Euangelist to the consecrated chalice, and vnderstood of a reall and materiall fruit of the vine; yet it is not necessary to vnderstand wine by them: for there be many fruits of the vine which may be drunk beside wine: the iuice pressed out of grapes not yet ripe, is properly the fruit of the vine, which may be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47142:141"/>
drunke, and yet is no wine; nay should one presse the young branches, and draw liquour from them, it would be that which is here called in Greek a <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>genimen vitis,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or the thing produced naturally by the vine: and yet it would be no wine. and euen wine corrupted, and quite changed is the generation and effect of the vine: and yet it is no wine. so also in our present case, the accidents or species of wine are <hi>genimen vitis,</hi> the true effects or productions of the vine, &amp; yet are not the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of wine, Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore here euen after consecration, according to the Romane Catholike tenet, those species remayne; our Sauiour might truly be sayd to haue drunke ex genimine, or generatione vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, of the fruit or propagation of the vine, though there had beene no substance of wine there, but in place therof the Blood of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour vnder those species. so that the very literall sense of the words retayned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the consecrated chalice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no more then this, that our Sauiour spake of the species of wine; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the propagation or generation of the vine.</p>
                     <p>But the words beare and admitt as well another explication (plainly suting with the Romane tenet) as of the fruit or issue of a reall vine. For our Sauiour stiles himselfe, as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47142:142"/>
the Opponent presently obserues, the vine. Why then might he not call his Blood here the fruit of the vine? and so referring it to the consecrated chalice, confirme that it was the chalice of his Blood proceeding and issuing from his Body, as the wine or species of wine proceeds from the vine.</p>
                     <p>All these explications shew how little this place proues against vs: or rather how much it aduantages our cause. But if the text be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered entirely as it stands in the Euangelists, it will neither hurt vs nor helpe them, nor so much as tuch the matter in question: for our Sauiout saith thus,<note place="margin">Mattk. 26 v. 29.

But if things be named by the names of what they were before, it doth not follow that we should so take it of the body of Christ. for it is not only false, but impious to thinke that the body of Christ is called bread for that it had been bread before the consecration. the serpent indeed had been a rod, but the body of Christ had neuer been bread. So Adam was called dust because he had been dust: but Christ is not made of bread. The holy Scripture saith well that Moyses rod became a serpent, but the Scripture doth not say that bread was conuerted into flesh.</p>

                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>I answer first that we doe not say that the body of Chtist was bread before consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at least I remember not euer to haue read any such proposition in Catholike authours: because his sacred body still existent visibly and gloriously in heauen cannot be said ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to haue been bread, it hauing been made of the sacred virgins most pure blood for that in its full sense would signifie (if any such proposition were in vse) that the thing which is affirmed to be made of an other, is not existent in an other place, whilst that whereof it is made is changed into it: as neither Adam nor the serpent made of the rod of Moyses were (for then only they
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47142:143"/>
began to be) when the rod of Moyses, and dust were changed into them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly I answer that the objection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds vppon a false supposition, for the rod of Moyses is not called a rod when it was turned into a serpent, because the serpent had been a rod before: nor Adam dust because he was before dust: for though it be true to say that that which was become a man or a serpent, was dust or a rod by reason of the subiect which remaines common to them both (called in philosophie materia prima) yet it is not true in any formall philosophicall sense to say: <hi>Adam was dust: the serpent was a rod:</hi> for Adam neuer was, nor neuer could haue been any thing else then what his essence made him viz: a man and a reasonable creature: nor a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent any thing then what the being of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent requiers, to wit, to be a serpent. when therefore in holy Scripture Adam is called <hi>dust,</hi> and the serpent <hi>the rod</hi> of Moyses, it is not because Adam was once dust, and the serpent a rod (for how can that be proued out of any place of Scripture?) but because Adam was made of dust, and the serpent of the rod of Moyses, which is cleerely testified in Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. so that the supposition and fundation of the ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> failing. that which is built vppon it viz: that the body of our Sauiour is called bread after consecration by S. Paul because it
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47142:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was bread before, must needs fall to the ground. For we say not that the body of Christ was euer bread, but because that which was bread, is now become the body of Christ, bread casing to be vnder those accidents by vertu of Christs body coming in the place of it: so that though this sacred body cannot be said to be made of bread' as a house is made of wood and stones which remaine in their own substances to compose it, nor as fire is made of wood where the matter common to them both remaines, yet if there be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood only that the body of Christ succeds to the substance of bread vnder the same acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and so issues from it as the day issues from the night, as from the terme from which it beginnes to be, as one may say: <hi>ex necte fit dies</hi>: of the night is made the day; so may one say: <hi>ex pane fit corpus Christi</hi>: of bread is made Christs body, as it is mysteriously in this Sacrament, and might be therefore called bread after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, as the wine in Cana in Galilee is called water because it was made of water, and the serpent called the rod of Moyses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was made of the rod of Moyses. or which is the same in other termes; because that which became wine was water, and that which became a serpent was the rod of Moyses which if it be resolued into philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall termes, is nothig but this, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47142:144"/>
matter which was vnited to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall formes of a serpent and wine, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before vnited to the substantiall formes of the rod of Moyses and of water, which happens in other changes of one thing into an other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: it is not the ordinary way of speach to say that all things which are made by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall changes were such things as were changed into them. thus though fire be made of wood, or wood be changed into fire, yet it is an ordinary manner of saying to affirme this fire was wood: neither say we: these flowers were earth, though they were made of earth changed into them. In like manner when our own flesh is produced of the different meates we eate, we vse not to say, our flesh was beefe, or mutton, or hearbes, or btead, or drinke &amp;c. and yet it is made of all these when they are changed into our substance: and hence is true the same proposition of our Sauiour in time of his nourishment: for his meate was as truly changed into his flesh as our meate is into our flesh, and consequently the bread which he did eate, was changed by nourishment into his flesh. and so it is true euen out of holy Scripture which speakes of his eating and drincking and increasing (and by consequence of his nourishment) that the flesh of Christ at least in some part, was made of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47142:144"/>
bread, and yet it is not the ordinary manner of speech to say that those parts of the flesh of Chrtst were bread, not withstanding it would be <hi>neither impious nor false</hi> to say that some parts of Christs flesh were once bread (supposing it were true that the serpent had been a rod and Adam dust, as the Opponent here affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes) to wit, those into which bread was changed by naturall nourishment. if then it might be truly affirmed of some parts of Christs flesh that they were bread in this sense for-named why should it be not only false but impious to affirme that the flesh of Christ as it is in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (for we affirme it noe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?) was bread? there being noe more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the one then in the other. fourthly this change being made in a way wholy super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall where noe part of the substance of bread remaines, to wit, neither forme nor matter, as we speake in the schooles, which happens not in any naturall nor in many su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall changes, where the matter and substance still remaynes, now receiuing one forme, now an other, by reason whereof the thing that succeeds may be sayd (as the opponent contends) to haue been the thing that was changed into it: by reason I say that noe such common subiect remaines here, but the whol substance of bread is changed into the substance of Christs body, it will not be so
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47142:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proper a manner of speech to say that the flesh of Christ was bread as the like would be in other naturall and ordinary changes, if that manner of speech were allowable.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the objection mistakes the compleat reason of Catholikes why S. Paul calls thc Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament bread after the consecration: for it is not only because the bread is changed into the flesh of Christ, for this might haue been done so inuisibily that neither the body of Christ nor the species of bread should haue appeared, and then we should haue had noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common to them both to haue continued the denomination of bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the entire reason giuen by Catholike Doctors is that the bread is changed into the flesh of Christ which is put vnder the outward shewes or species of bread, which giue occasion or ground of giuing it the same denomination it had before. Thus we call the dead carkase of a lamme a lamme, and the dead body of a man, a man, by reason of these outward organs and proportions which remaine the same they were before, though the thing be quite chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what it was. Vnto that which is added that we haue noe where in Scripture that bread is conuerted into the flesh of our Sauiour as we haue that the rod of Moyses was conuerted into a serpent I <hi>Answer</hi> that it is not necessary to haue all things in Scripture
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47142:145"/>
in the like clearnesse and explicitenesse of words, for we haue noe where expressed in Scripture, that the bread our Sauiour did eate was conuerted into his flesh as we haue that the rod of Moyses was conuerted into a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and notwhithstanding euen Protestants must beleeue it. so though we haue it not in expresse termes that bread is changed into the flesh of our Sauiour in this Sacrament, as we haue that Moyses rod was conuerted into a serpent, yet we must heleeue it, because the truth of Scripture cannot stand vnlesse this be granted: for seeing our Sauiour sayd <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and it is wholy impossible and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying contradiction that a piece of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in its own nature should be the true and reall body of our Sauiour (as we haue shewed that those words must import) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes necessarily that the nature and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of bread cannot be vnder those visible spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and therefore bread must cease to be out of the force of Christs body, which must suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in place of bread, vnder the same species which is nothing else then to haue bread changed into the hody of our Sauiour.</p>

                        <hi>panis,</hi> which are both masculine, it cannot be referred to bread. Now to shew out of Scripture it selfe that our Sauiour calls himselfe the dore in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, mysticall and metaphoricall sense only, is cleare out of S. Iohn c. 12. v. 9. I am the dore, if any man enter by me, he shall be saued, &amp;c. which is not true of a naturall dore of wood, for all such as enter in by such a dore are not saued, but such only as enter by the spirituall dore of there soules which is our Sauiour. so also when he calls his Apostles sheepe, he shewes clearely that the speakes of metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall or spirituall sheepe: for he affirmes that they heare his voyce, or know him: and hence appeares also. (by the way) another mistake contrary to theyr own English Bible which Protestants ordinarily vrge against vs, mistaking the words of the Gospel: they tell vs that our Sauiour said he was <hi>a dore, a vine, a way,</hi> which he neuer sayes according to their English Bible; but thus: I am <hi>the dore, the vine, the way</hi> &amp;c. which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the words to a spirituall and metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall sense, as when he sayes: <hi>I am the bread of life, I am the good fheapherd</hi> &amp;c. and when he calles his disciples <hi>sheepe,</hi> he vseth alwayes this restraining and limiting particle, <hi>my sheepe</hi>: which is only true of spirituall sheepe, for our Sauiour had noe other. That which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47142:148"/>
said that our Sauiour was as able to change the Apostles into sheepe as to change bread into his body, is true if the Apostles had ceased to be men and had been so conuerted into sheep, as Lots wife ceasing to be a weoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was conuerted into a pilar of salt. but then the proposition which Protestants pretended out of Scripture: <hi>yee are materiall sheep,</hi> had not been true: neither could the truth of that proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euer haue caused that conuersion as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to it. but this proposition only should haue been true: <hi>yee are made, or are become mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall sheep</hi> by vertu of a miraculous change of men <hi>into sheep</hi>: noe otherwise then the water in the mariage in Gallilee is said to be made wine: fot when one thing is affirmed of an other, then that where of it is affirmed is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be existent, as when I say: <hi>I am a man</hi>: the person must be existent where of it is aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rmed that <hi>he is a man.</hi> but contrariwise when one thing is said to be made an other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, not artificially, then that which is said to be made the other ceased to be what it was, and is conuerted into the other; as when it is said, water was made wine, water ceased to be and wine was made of it. and hence it is a plane contradiction to haue any change or conuersion made in a pure affirmatiue and simple proposition in this manner: <hi>Peeter is a reall and naturall sheepe.</hi> for then this person
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47142:148"/>
                        <hi>Peeter,</hi> is supposed to be and not to be at the some time. to be, because he is affirmed to be <hi>a sheepe</hi> not to be, because he is changed into a sheepe, and so ceases to be as water ceased to be when it was made wine. And the same absurdity and contradiction had followed if our Sauiour had said: <hi>this bread which I now haue in my hands, is my naturall Body truly and really.</hi> for bread should haue remained because it was affirmed to be his body and yet it should haue beene destroyed and so not remained, because it should haue been changed into his body. I am sorry that such speculations as these should be propounded to those who haue not ftudied, but the objections require them. yet I must adde to make this matter out of question: if the propositions: <hi>I am the vine: yee are the vinebranches,</hi> implyed any change of our Sauiour into a reall materiall vine &amp;c. then this proposition adioyned, <hi>and my Father is the husbandman.</hi> would haue implyed a power in God the Father to be changed into a reall hushandman and so God himselfe would be changeable, wich cannot be affirmed without a blaphemy. So then as God the Father is called only a Spirituall husbandman, so also our Sauiour a Spirituall vine, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles spirituall branches, noe more change being implied in the one then in the other. Now that many things affirmed of others, are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47142:149"/>
to be vnderstood, of those thinges as spirituall, not corporall, is most euident, 1.

                     <p>But if by the words: <hi>this is my Body</hi>: should be vnderstood true visible bread, as in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection they are, there will be noe other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or consequence saue this: or Sauiour calls his flesh bread because it is true liuing, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bread: therefore a peece of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon bread is called the body of Christ because it is a signe of his body: which is quite out of ioynt.</p>
                     <p>Now certainely (to answer the question he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e propounded) it is much lesse strange for our Sauiour to call himselfe meat, or liuing spirituall bread &amp;c. then to call a piece of wheaten bread his true and reall body; for he is truely the one, but naturall bread can neuer be the other.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the other question first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, why may not bread be his body figuratiuely? if it had been set down in this manner: why might not bread haue beene his body, figuratiuely? I would haue answered that there is no reason but it might, as were the figures of the old law and amongst them the bread of proposition, and of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech, and many such like types of the old Testament: but the reason why it may not now be so in this Sacrament is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue shewed that according to the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47142:150"/>
first institution, it was our Sauiours will to change bread into his body: and so not being at all, it could not be his body figuratiuely: neither can a figuratiue sense stand with the truth of this proposition: <hi>This is my Body which is giuen for you.</hi> That which is lastly added that <hi>bread is a Sacrament of his body,</hi> cannot stand with the Protestant doctrine: for they define in the little catechisme in the common prayer booke a <hi>Sacrament to be an outward visible signe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward spirituall grace.</hi> now certaine it is that our Sauiours body was as outward and visible to the Apostles in the first institution as was the bread it selfe, and so neither an inward nor spirituall grace, and consequently it could not be a Sacrament of it. and if noe Sacrament, it could be noe signe of it. for Protestants ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge noe other signe here then a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall signe: and though after our Sauiours ascension we cannot actually see his body by reason of the distance betwixt vs, yet that makes it not an inward spirituall grace, for then Rome and Constantinople would be spirituall to those that liue in these climates because for the same reason they cannot see them. and yet much lesse could the body of our Sauiour, either in the first institution or at any time after, be termed an inward grace according to Protestants: and yet we are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strained to acknowledge that there is not a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47142:151"/>
Sacrament, for it signifies that heauenly an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> diuine grace which by vertu of it is giuen to nourish our soules which is truly inward an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> spirituall: and that which sensibly appeares in it, and is called by diuines Sacramentum tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, is a sacramentall signe of our Sauiour sacred body inuisibly but truly existent vnder those shewes or species in this Sacrament, and nourishing our soules and bodyes (and so may be truly and properly called a spirituall grace or gift) and that inward also when it is sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally receiued. And noe lesse is it now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If here should be replyed that hence would follow that this Sacrament might also in the first institution haue been a signe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours death &amp; sufferings representing them as presently to follow: and so these words (<hi>This is my Body</hi>) might haue this sense: this bread is a representatiue signe of my body as instantly suffering and dying vppon the Crosse: which death and sufferings were then inuisible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not then existent.

                     <p>There were two couuenants or pacts made betweene God and Abraham in this chapter. the first ver. 1.2.4.6.7; 8. which was of the fauour of God promised to Abraham and his seed. The second v. 9.10.11. &amp;c. which was of Abrahams obedience and his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s towards God. whereto he obliged them in taking cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision: now this second couuenant was a confirmation, signe or seale of the first on Abrahams part: and so though being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered absolutely in it selfe, it was a true and reall couuenant, yet in regard of the former couuenant it was a signe or scale as S. Paul calls it:<note place="margin">Hebr. 4. v. 11.</note> and so it is called here both a couue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and a signe of the couuenant that is, of the first. as if one should make a couuenant with an other of inferiour note: first that he would fauour and patronize him in all things; and then that the other might shew his gratitude, and acceptation of this couue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47142:153"/>
on his part, he makes an other that once a yeare he should come and wayte on him at his table. This second couuenant would be as true reall a part of the couuenant or agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t between them, as the first; and yet would be a confirmation, ratification, signe or seale of the former. Now that this second was a true couuenant, is euident out of the words, for it is a true command, obligation, or iniunction of God accepted of by Abraham, which being done, God of his part obliged himselfe to stand to his former couuenant of shewing his grace and mercy vnto Abraham and his children. So that that which the objcctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saies that the word couuenant is here taken for <hi>the signe of the couuenant</hi>: if it meanes thereby that it signifies not a true couuenant in it felfe which was a signe of a former couuenant, is farre ftom the truth. And though this solution be cleare and cannot be questioned, yet if one would stand meerely in the words cited, one might easely answer that the obligation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision put here vppon Abraham and his children was a true couuenant, but the actuall performance and execution, that is, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in it selfe performed vppon the Israëlites was a signe of this obligatory couuenant. and so it is said. ver. 10. <hi>hoc est pactum meum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcidetur. this is my couuenant</hi> &amp;c. <hi>euery mal child shall be circumcised, that it may be a signe of the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47142:153"/>
couuenant between me and you,</hi> that is, that the actuall circumcision may be a signe of this couuenant. So that neither is here the <hi>obligation</hi> to be circumcised, called a signe of the couuenant, nor circumcision called the couuenant as the opponent affirmes, not out of Scripture, but from the Protestant glosse or addition to it. And these answers which I haue giuen are clearly confirmed by S. Paul Rom. 4. v. 11. where speaking of Abraham he said: <hi>he tooke the signe of circumcision,</hi> the seale of the iustice of faith &amp;c. <hi>that he might be the father of all beleeuers</hi>: where not the obligation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Allmighty God to be circumcised, but circumcision it selfe is called the signe, and chiefly the signe or seale of his being the father of all beleeuers, which was the first couuenant here made with him.</p>

                     <p>The Scripture in this place calls not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely the Lambe the Passeour. <hi>Ye shall gird your loines and put shooes on your feet, holding staues in your handes, and ye shall eate hastily for it is the Passeouer of our Lord.</hi> the hebrew hath it the Passeouer to our Lord. which whether it be meant of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47142:154"/>
the lambe it selfe, or of the whole compliment of the ceremonies required, or of thc lambe as eaten in that manner or order imports little, because it makes nothing at all against vs. for we must obserue that the word <hi>pascha</hi> hath a double sense: sometimes it is taken properly and primarily for the reall passing of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell from one house to another through Egypt: at other times and that commonly improperly or figuratiuely for the solemnity or feast ordained on that day when he passed, and so yearely vppon the same in insuing ages. Thus we take ordinarily the words Natiuity, Resurrection, Ascension of our Lord, either for his reall birth, rising from the dead, or his ascending into heauen; or for the solemnities of Christmas, Easter or Ascension: and to come to our purpose we take the word, <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> the body of Christ either for his reall and true body, or for the feast in honour of his body called amongst vs (<hi>Corpus Christi</hi>) so that vppon that day one might say: <hi>Hic dies est corpus Christi.</hi> this day is <hi>Corpus Christi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the same was amongst the Iewes, and instituted by Allmighty God in this place: so that by the word <hi>Pesach</hi> or Passeouer was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the reall passing ouer of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, but the feast or Passeouer in honour of it, and so it is not called in hebrew (as I haue noted) the passing ouer of out Lord, but, to our
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47142:154"/>
Lord; that is in his honour for the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit represented in the feast of the Pascha. Now if the Scripture had said: This is that very Passeouer wherein our Lord killed so many thousand Egyptians, and saued so many of our forefathers, as here is: <hi>This is my Body which is braken for you. This is my blood which shall be shed for many for the remission of sinnes,</hi> whereby the words body and blood are determined to his reall body and blood. for noe figure or type of them was brooken or shed for our finnes: it might haue had some shew of pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. for then must the paschall lambe needs haue been called the reall passage of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and not the festiuityes nominated by the same word. Thus vppon <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day one may say: This day is the body of our Lord; vnderstanding by <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> the solemnity so called as it is ordinarily vnderstood: it might well passe. hut if one should say vppon that day: <hi>Hic dies est Corpus Christi quod pro nobis datum est: this day is the body of Christ whieh so many hunderd yearcs a goe was giuen for our saluation.</hi> all the world would condemne him noe lesse of foolery then of falshood and impiety. Though therefore the thing it selfe, and the picture, memoriall and solemnity of it may be called by the same name in a large or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall acception (thus the picture of Caesar is called Caesar, the solemnity of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> is
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47142:155"/>
called <hi>Corpus Christi</hi>) yet when there be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other particles and words adioyned which tye it to a signification of the thing it selfe, and distinguish it from the picture or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of it, then the figure or memoriall can neuer be vnderstood by that word accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with such adiuncts: neither can the pourtraict or solemnity be euer ioyned with that word explicated with those said restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue particules. Thus though seeing the picture of the present King of Spaine, I can say: this is King Phillip the fourth: for that word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies as wel King Phillip painted as really existing, yet I cannot say with truth if the word, <hi>is,</hi> be taken in its proper and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall signification which for the present is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed I this is that King Phillip who liues now in Spaine, and whom this picture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents. neither can I say seeing the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selue: this is King Philip which stands in such a chamber painted in the low countryes: for that is not the reall, but painted King, seeing therefore in the words of the institution, that which our Sauiour gaue his. Apostles is not only called his body which happily alone were indisserent to fignifie his body painted or reall; substantiall or figuratiue naturall or mysticall: but addes this restrictiue (<hi>which is giuen for you</hi>) which particle can agree only with his reall body. the opponent will proue
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47142:155"/>
nothing at all against Roman Catholikes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there be produced out of Scripture some text where the word signifiing the thing it selfe, be applyed to the signe or figure with the same restrictiue and limiting particles, as proper to that thing it selfe; as here the word, <hi>my Body,</hi> is affirmed of the word, <hi>this,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be that body which was giuen for vs, so that the words, <hi>my Body which is broken or giuen for you,</hi> can neuer be taken for any signe or figure of his true body for then a mere signe of his body should be broken for vs.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47142:157"/>
some extraordinary case it signifies. but when the subiect in question is it selfe a signe, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, embleme or representation of some other thing, it is to be answered what it signifies, vnlesse it appeates euidently or very probably that the intention of the demand is to know not what it signifies, but what it is.</p>
                     <p>Thus when Pharao demanded what those eares weare, they being only conceiued by him to be certaine presages or tokens of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething else, noe man could in common sense answer him but by telling him what was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged or intended by them. that is, what they were in that sense in which he demanded, which answer could not be true in any other sense then a figuratiue. for when Ioseph gaue this answer that seauen eares were seauen yeares, had he vnderstood it properly and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially, it had concluded a formall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and implication in the termes. For it is impossible that the thoughts of ones head which passe in an houre should be truly and really one or many yeares. So the truth of holy Scripture and Iosephs answer necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers a figuratiue sense. and had our Sauiour said as expressely, <hi>this bread which you see is my body,</hi> as Ioseph said <hi>seauen eares are seauen yeares,</hi> he should haue beene vnderstood to haue spoken for the same reason only in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue sense. but seeing he neither sayd, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47142:158"/>
to say any such matter, but only, <hi>This is my Body</hi> &amp;c. that is, this which I am now to giue you, and you receaue is my body (as I have shewed) he must be supposed to affirme in a reall, proper and substantiall sense without all signes or figures, that that which he was then about to giue them was his true body. for the word <hi>this</hi> both in it selfe and in those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances signifying a thing absolute in it selfe and noe signe or figure, as the word <hi>eares</hi> doe in the place obiected, cannot be thought to haue any figuratiue signification: neither the word, <hi>my body</hi> (being expressed by that which followes, <hi>which is giuen for you</hi> to be his reall body) can be impropetly nor figuratiuely vnderstood to signifye a signe, figure, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance or commemoration of his body for it was not a signe, figure and remembrance of his body, but his reall and true body which was giuen for vs. neither can there be any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or impropriety in the word, <hi>is,</hi> as though it were nothing but <hi>signifies or commemorates:</hi> for seeing the subiect of the proposition <hi>this,</hi> that is, which I am to giue, and the predicate, <hi>my Body which is giuen for you</hi>: properly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, can be truly and really the one affirmed of the other thus: <hi>This which I am to giue you, is really and substantially my body which is giuen for you,</hi> according to the rules of all good interpreters it must be vnderstood so as the opponent also

Augustine obserues in this place, which naturall, and carnall discours our Sauiour affirmes to profit nothing, and not his own most pure and heauenly flesh vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood aright only by true faith, which he calls here the Spirit, or spirituall light. it will be said, that we affirming that our Sauiours flesh is truly eaten by vs though not in so grosse
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47142:161"/>
a maner, are no lesse condemned by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, for our carnall vnderstanding of this mistery, then were the Capernaites. I answer, that there is as much difference betwixt vs in this particular, as there was betwixt S. Iofeph and Herod, about our Sauiours natiuity, for though both of them vnderstood that he had true flesh, and was borne of a woeman, yet Herod imagined that he was conceiued and borne in the ordinary maner of other childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was a mere man, &amp;c. and was holy ignorant both of his mothers virginity, and that his humaine soul and body were vnited to the diuine person. Thus the Capernaites hauing no more knowledge of his diuinity then Herod had, thought that his flesh was to be eaten after the same ordinary maner that other meates vse to be eaten, merely to feed the body, and went noe sarther. But all true Catholiques beleeue, that his sacred flesh is liuing, and vnited to the diuine persone, and eaten by vs, though truly, and really as he was truly and really borne, yet after a most pure, heauenly, and in effable manner as he was brought into this world, wherby his blessed flesh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered absolutely in it selfe is neyther rent, nor torne, nor deuided, nor consumed, but remaines as whole, perfect and intire, after he is eaten by vs as it was before, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle S. Andrew sais. In this maner, though
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47142:161"/>
our Sauiour spoake of his reall flesh, yet were his words Spirit and Life, noe lesse then these words of S. Iohn, <hi>the word was made flesh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> and a thousand such like are, though they speake of the true flesh of our Sauiour: because his very flesh it selfe by reason of its vnion to the diuine person, and glorious proprieties wholy deifyed, and spiritualizd, in such sort that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it we receiue a <hi>Spirituall body,</hi> though true and reall; Here the earnest Reformer will tell mee that I speake contradictions, for it is as vnpossible that a body should be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, as a Spirit corporall, I answer. If I speake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions, I haue learned them out of the Protestant Bible, and common prayer booke; where S. Paul sayes of a body after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, it is sown a naturall body it rises a <hi>Spirituall body.</hi> And yet this wonder full body of Christ, exists in the Sacrament much more like a spirit, then doth any other glorious body according to ordinary prouidence; viz, whole in the whole host, and whole in euery part of it, as the soul exists in the body, an Angel in the place he possesses, and God in the world. And as this admirable body, hath the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Spirit, so hath it the properties of life, being liuing bread, and giuing life eternall to those who worthily receiue it, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour pronounces of it, and according to S.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47142:165"/>
shewed, that they themselues must answer as great or greater difficultyes, which may be opposed by heathens, and Infidells against other articles of our faith which they beleeue, let them therefore eyther desist to moue any such heathnish objections as these, against the reall presence, or acknowledge that whilst they presse these against it, they giue iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to an Infidell to presse the like against themselues: which when they haue solued in other mysteries, they will haue solu'd theyr own, against this.</p>
                     <p>Before I end this controuersie, I will summe vp briefly what I haue said at large in this treatis, that the Reader may haue a full sight of it at one Vew. first, I haue (according to my former methode) cited the doctrine of the Concil of Trent. whence clearly appeares that it conteynes nothing, grosse and Capernaiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call (as Protestants commonly are made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) but a most heauenly, pure, mysticall, liuing, and ineffable presence. Secondly I haue cited the words of the Euangelists and S. Paul touching the Institution, which are not only most clere in themselues (as I haue proued) but are iudged soe to be both by Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in his first Tome printed at Iena, an. 1589. Concione 3. de Confessione, &amp; Sacramento Eucharistiae, parte 2. pag. 329. where after he had cited the words of the Euangelists, he
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47142:165"/>
saith thus: Haec sunt verba quae neque ipsi, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que etiam Sathan negare poterit, in quae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendus pes est, vt firmiter in iis consistamus. Sunt autem nuda &amp; planissima, quae nullis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretationibus eludi possunt. Quòd &amp; panis sit Christi corpus. pro nobis traditum, &amp; calix Christi sanguis, pro nobis effusus, &amp; iubemur illa facere in commemoratione ipsius.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>These are words, which neyther they</hi> (he meanes Romane Catholicques) nor Sathan can denie, vppon which wee are to fix our foote, that we may stand immouuable in them. For they are naked and most plaine which cannot be shifted of by any Interpretations. That bread is the body of Christ, which is giuen for vs, and the cup the blood of Christ, which is shed for vs, and that we are commanded to doe them in remembrance of him. Thus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. which though he here affirmes, to proue his errours, of Consubstantiation, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kindes against vs, yet withall he clearely, confesses that the words are most plaine for the reall presence of Christs true body, and blood in this holy Sacrament, which he allwayes held.</p>
                     <p>These texts also are so vndeniably clere, for the reall Presence, that Zuinglius the first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Sacramentaries changed the word in all the Euangelists, and S. Paul <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, I haue discouered clerely the sundry grosse mistakes of Scripture, in the words, <hi>it, take, eate this, doe this in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. Fourtly, I haue shewed the mistakes, in the parities brought, of I am a dore, a vine, a way, &amp;c. Fiftly, I haue layd open the mistakes, in the instances, of other Sacraments, and figuratiue speeches alleadged by the opponent in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many such like misapplications.</p>
                     <p>The maine things where in I stand are, that the words of S.

                     <p>And secondly, that seeing these words, <hi>This is my Body which is giuen for you,</hi> may most easily and connaturally be vnderstood in a most proper sense, without violating any other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our faith, or plaine place of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they must be soe vnderstood, onlesse wee will take away all force from Scripture to proue any thing, and destroy the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall rule not only of Interpretation of Scripture, but of all humaine conuersation, which is, that euery one is, so be vnderstood to speake properly, when nothing constraynes to the

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:47142:169"/>
when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ordayning some things concerning the vse of this Sacrament, he said, I will dispose the rest when I come. wherefore our holy mother the church taking notice of this her power in the administration of Sacraments, though in the beginning of the church the vse os both kindes was frequent. yet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of time that custome being now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably changed, being induced by iust, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant reasons, she hath approuued this custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of communicating vnder one kinde, and hath decreed that it be held for a law, which it is not lawfull to change, or reproue at ones pleasure without the authority of the church. The like doctrine is deliuered, in the first chap. of this session.</p>
                     <p>From these texts it is manifest, that the Council, was induced to command this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, first because whol Christ is vnder both kindes, 2. because in each kinde is the whole essence, and substance of this Sacrament, 3. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause noe sacramentall grace necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is lost by communicating vnder one kinde. 4. because many important reasons toutching the honour and respect dew to soe diuine a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, mouued her to it. 5. becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se there is noe diuine command to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as appearrs sess. 21. cap. 1. 6 because the church hath power to dispence the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as she finds most eo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, soe long, as

                        <p>The bare institution of a Sacrament drawes with it noe necessitie of frequenting it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in Priesthood and mariage instituted
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47142:171"/>
by our Sauiour. which not withstanding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose noe necessitie or command to receaue them, so that standing precisely in the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, noe man wil be obliged to receaue either both, or either of rhem.</p>

                        <p>Secondly though the bare institution of a Sacrament impose noe command to receaue it, yet it imports a precept that when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued or administted, it be done in that manner it was instituted, as it appeares in baptisme, Priesthood and other Sacraments. Seeing therefore our Sauiour instituted this Sacrament both in the consecration and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds, at least whensoeuer it is receaued, it must be receaued vnder both.</p>

                     <div type="answer">
                        <head>Answer.</head>
                        <p>This objection inuolues many difficulties and is first to he vndeestood that Sacraments are to be receaued and administred as they were first instituted in such matters as belong to the substance and essence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not in other accidentary circumstances of time, place, personnes, precedences, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, &amp;c. as was the institution of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after supper, sitting vppon the ground, giuen to priests only, in a priuate se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular house &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="325" facs="tcp:47142:171"/>Secondly there is something particular in this Sacrament which is in noe other, euen concerning the substance of it: for the very same entire substance being here put vnder each kind makes that woesoeuer receaues either of them, receaues the whole substance of this Sacrament and consequently receaues a true Sacrament instituted by our Sauiour; and so that which is able to sanctifie him who worthily receaues either of them.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly concerning the substance of this Sacrament all that can be gathered from the bare words of the institution, is that it is to be consecrated and receiued by Priests such as were the Apostles who were Priests, then made when it was first instituted vnder both kinds, but here is noe president giuen about the lay people, because none then receaued it. That the whole substance of our Sauiour is here receaued I suppose for the present, neither is it much questioned by such as grant the reall presence, nor can be possibly doubted of by any who beleeues that our Saoiour dies not more, and soe both flesh and blood, and life, and soule, and diuinitie are all vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather weresoeuer he is: hence therefore followes that lay people receiue as much of our Sauiour (seeing they receaue him wholy and interily) as Priests doe.</p>
                        <p>That he who receaues our Sauiour thus
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47142:172"/>
vnder one only kind receaues a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as cleare as the former for who can without absurditie denye that vnder one kind is exhibited <hi>an outward visible signe of an inward spirituall grace,</hi> which is the compleat definition of a Sacrament according to our aduersaries: for here the formes of bread only containing vnder them our Sauiour by way of meat, signifie that he confers a spirituall grace nourishing and feeding our soules to eternall life and thus much is signified by the English ministers when they distribute the bread to the people saying: <hi>the Body of our Lord Iesus Christ preserue thy body and soul to eternall life,</hi> &amp;c. and containing his body represented as separated from his blood, and so as dead by force of the words of consecration are an outward visible commemoratiue signe of his sacred death and passion. and seeing that both bread is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of many graines, and wine of many grapes vnited togeather, the mystical vnity of Christians receauing this Sacrament is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently signified hy the species of either of them. if then here he <hi>an outward visible signe of an inward spirituall grace</hi> both exhibitiue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratiue and significatiue, here must needs be a true Sacrament euen according to the pttnciples of our aduersaries. and what I haue said of the forme of bread, is by the same reason verified of the forme of wine. but not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:47142:172"/>
only in their principlcs, but in all good Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie there must be a true Sacrament vnder each kind: for certainly seeing that a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace is conferred by each of them, the one of spirituall meate, the other of spirituall drinke (which how it is to be vnderstood, I will hereafter examine) each will be sufficient to sanctifie and helpe the soul to eternall life. If it should be replyed that in neither of these kinds alone is exhihited a compleate signe either of our spirituall refection, or the death of our Sauiour but only a partiall or imparfect signe of them, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing are compleatly significd vnder both togeather. I answer that if by a compleat signe be vnderstood a most full and expresse repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of these two particulars, I grant that there is not vnder one only kind so full and expresse a representation (and in this sense not so compleat a signe of them) as vnder both togeather. but then it must be prouued (this most full and expresse representation vnder both being exhibited to lay Christians by the consecration and communion of the Priest in the dread full sacrifice of the masse) that the substance of this sacrifice requirs that they should be allways so fully and expressely represented in each particular communion of the people. but if by a compleat signe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood a signe sufficient to signifie both our
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47142:173"/>
spirituall food and vnion, and the death of our Sauiour, I denie that there is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat signe of both exhibited vnder each kind. This distinction may be much illustrated by an instance from baptisme, certainly the mystery of the trinity was more expressely, fully and compleatly signified by that ancient coustome of a threefold dipping the child in the water, and the words of baptisme then by the same words and putting water once vppon the child, and yet this latter is iudged suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient euen by Protestants. for who can doubt that the formes of bread sufficiently giue vs to vnderstand that our Sauiours is the food of our soules noe lesse then the bread of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in the old, and the bread multiplied by our Sauiour in the new Testament; and his calling himselfe the bread of life in the sixt of S. Iohn prefigured and signified suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently that our Sauiour was to be the bread of our soules: and who seeing a bodyly before him void of soul and blood as our Sauiour is here represented by force of the words, gathers not presently that it is dead though he see not the blood which issued from it: and the same is of the blood of our Sauiour vnder the forme of wine, for this alone is noe lesse sufficient to represent the death of our Sauiour then was tbe blood alone of the paschall lambe sprinkled vppon the posts of

                        <p>Some may happily obiect that this answer subsists not, for according to this doctrine the Priest also receaues a true Sacrament and the spirituall graces and fruits of it when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues the host only, and yet euen after he hath receaued the host; he is obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the chalice according to Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, therefore though it should be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that lay people by receauing vnder the species of bread only, receaue a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the sauing grace signified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by it, yet they may be obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the other kind as Priests are.</p>

                        <p>There is first a great difference betwixt the Apostles and lay Christians, for they were directly and expressely obliged by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in time of the institution to receaue the chalice euen after they had receaued the true Sacrament and the grace of it vnder the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of bread. whence may probably be gathered that all Priests consecrating haue the same obligation of receauing both: but noe such command was directly and expesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47142:174"/>
giuen to lay people none hauing been there. Secondly Priests consecrating and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing are obliged to receaue of each part of theyr sacrifice, and so though precisely stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the essence of a Sacrament, there be no diuine obligation, yet in regard of consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating and participating of theyr own sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice they are bound to receaue both as the Apostles did, wich hath noe place in lay people. The answer only concluds that stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precisely in the institution, seeing lay people receaue vnder one kind a true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with sauing grace, it cannot be thence conuinced that they are bound to receaue more; so that if there be any obligation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing both it must rise from some other head and not from the bare institution, whereof we treate in answer to this objection now taken from it alone.</p>

                        <p>Our Sauiour instituted this celestiall ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet in so ineffable a manner that the very same substantiall thing was to be both our meat and drinke, to wit, himselfe and that so abundantly that either both to geather, or each a part are so suffizing a repast, that they communicate strengh and life to all such as worthily receaue them: and though both being receaued make but one compleat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by reason they are both taken at once by way of meate and drinke, as it happens in other ordinary refections, yet each of them receaued apart, or at different times, is also a full and compleat refection of the soul by reason that each communicates sauing grace sufficient to saluation, and this euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in common feasts and banquets, for when many dishes are eaten and different sortes of wine drunke at the same time or meeting, they are esteemed but one meal or banquet, and yet if at different times one should feed now vppon one, then vppon an other of these dishes apart, or dranke but one sorte of wine one day, and an other of them an other, then such eating and drinking by reason of the diuersitie of times would be counted diuers sufficient refections: and if it were possible to find in other meates and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47142:175"/>
drinke what is found in this Sacrament, that as well the one the other alone could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and conferre life, and that one could liue with drinking without eating, or eating without drinking, then either of these a part would become a full refection all therefore that can be gathered from this objection is only that our Sauiour in the first institution gaue a most plentifull and abundant banquet, whereof each part in it selfe was sufficient to conferre life and satieté to his Apostles, which in succeeding ages being receaued either ioyntly, or apart, was to be a sufficient refec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Christians. But from the institution vnder both kindes followed not (which is cheesty pressed in this objection) that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours intention was that these two kindes should be such parts of this heauenly feast that both of them are essentially required to it, for then he would not haue giuen each of them force to conferre grace sufficient for saluation, but would haue had that grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily dependant vppon the receauing of both togeather. Now that the receauing of our Sauiour vnder the forme of bread only conferres life and saluation is out of all question Ioan. 6. <hi>He who eateth this bread shall liue for euer,</hi> and that perfectly and entirely as appeareth by these words: <hi>As I liue by my father so he who eateth me shall liue by me.</hi> for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:47142:177"/>
celebrating and communicating two or three times a day, then by once, yet because this inuolues a want of reuerence to the body and bloud of Christ, it is but once a yeare gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally amongst Catholikes permittrd to Priests, and neuer to lay people, neither by Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques nor Protestants, the same would follow if all lay men were licenced promiscuously to communicate euery day, and noe lesse, were they permitted to receaue vnder both kindes as I shall shew here after: whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that as out of the respect which they are bound to bere to this heauenly mystery they are obliged to refraine from communicating euery day, and vppon noe day to receaue more then once: so are they to abstaine (the Church so commanding) from receauing the chalice. Secondly concerning actuall auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry graces, which are supernaturall pious thoughts and inspirations to good, conferred by vertu of this Sacrament and proper to it, some doctours hold that there is a different actuall grace corresponding to the chalice from that of the host, the one of strenghning proper to meate, the other of exhilaration proper only to drinke. yet the common tenet of doctours is contrary, and so it will only come to a schoole Question not necessary to be treated here, wherein the more common and negatiue opinion seemes to me more
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47142:177"/>
pious and honorable to this Sacrament, for it wil be sufficient to saue the proper effects of these two kindes that there be actuall graces corresponding to meate and drinke, the one of corroborating, the other of exhilerating, as the primary, not as the only actuall fruits of this spirituall food and drinke, so that by the host by reason of its inestimable 'and illimitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vertu be communicated to the receauer certaine actuall graces strenghtning him in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of tentation as the primary effect of that kinde, and yet the other of exhilerating in time of sorow also, as the secondary and lesse principall of the sacred host. and the same discours holds proportionably of the chalice, so that each kinde conferres these different graces, but in a different order and manner. and by consequence he who receaues either hath the very same actuall graces communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him noe lesse then he who receaues both, and lay people are not depriued of any species of actuall grace due to this Sacrament, which Priests haue. Now that this doctrine much conducing to the honour and glory and grounded in the boundlesse perfection of this Sacrament, is cleere tough to such as only consider that this spirituall banquet vnder each species containes noe lesse then Christ himselfe. who is not only the food, but also the drinke of our soules, and so the holy

                        <p>Our Sauiour saith Iohn 13. <hi>If I haue washed your feet your Lord and maister, you must also wash one anothers feet,</hi> therefore all Christians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by our Sauiour to wash one an others feet: or thus our Sauiour Marc. 16. <hi>Goenig into the whol world preach the Gospel to all creatures.</hi> and Matt. 28. <hi>Goe and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father,</hi> &amp;c. therefore he commands all Christians to teach the Gospel and baptize all nations: or thus to come so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mthing nearer to this matter in the drinking of a cupp. Luc. 22. our Sauiour saith before the Sacrament was instituted: and he tooke the cupp and said: take and diuide amongst you, &amp;c. therefore all Christians are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take and drinke wine which is noe sacrament, yea before they receaue the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as our Sauiour commanded the Apostles to doe here. or lastly thus to instance in the institution it selfe Matth. 26. our Sauiour saith: <hi>Take and eate this is my Body</hi>: therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all Christians to take the host into theyr hands, and then eate it, as he did the Apostles. many such like instances might be giuen whence (if we stand to the sole and bare word of scripture it will be as easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that all Christians are commanded many things which Protestants say they are
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47142:180"/>
not bound to doe, as from this command: <hi>drinke yee all of this:</hi> giuen to the Apostles, can be drawn that all Christians are commanded to dtinke of the chalice because the Apostles were then commanded to doe it.</p>
                        <p>If it should be replyed that in the other commands alleaged is not found the word (all) <hi>drinke ye all of this</hi> as we finde here, and therefore are not so generall to comprehend all Christians. I answer that the word (all) as appeares hy S. Marke: <hi>and they all drunke of it:</hi> only signifies all the Apostles there present, none excepted, for our Sauiour said not: let all Christians drinke of this, <hi>but drinke ye all of this.</hi> If it should be demanded why should our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour say: drinke yee all of this more then eate. yee all of this; adding the word (all) only to the chalice and not to the host, but only to shew the vniuersall necessitie of drinking. I answer first that (all) cannot possibly be added. for that reason, for Protestants confesse that there is as vniuersall necessitie for all Christians to eate the bread comprehended in these words: <hi>take eate this is my Body,</hi> without the word (all) as of drinking the cup in these: <hi>drinke yee all of this.</hi> Secondly I answer that the reason of adding the word (all) more to the chalice then to the host, was because our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hauing broken the host into differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gaue to each Apostle one and so there was
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47142:180"/>
noe necessitie to command them all to eate of the same particle, but hauing giuen but one cup amongst them, it was more necessary for the full declaration of his minde (which was that all the Apostles there prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t should drinke of that cupp,) to expresse himselfe in these termes: drinke ye all of this.</p>
                        <p>Secondly I answer to the maine objection that if we stand ptecisely in these words of Scripture, it can neuer be conuinced that any precept is contained either in these <hi>take eate</hi>: or in these: <hi>drinke yee all of this</hi>; for they are capable to signifie a meere inuitation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty as great persons ordinarily are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coustomed when they haue other inferiours at theyr table to say, eate or drinke of this or that, not commanding but inuiting: and it belongs to Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts who stand so strictly to the bare expresse words of Scripture to conuince by the sole expresse words the contrary.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly if wee either by vniuersall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians, or by some other expresse commands in scripture of communicating, grant that euen in these words, eate, drinke &amp;c. a strickt command was giuen, seeing some commands, oblige all Christians, others all Bishops &amp; Priests, and others the Apostles only, we can notwithstanding giue a reason why these words: drinke yee all of this, binde the

Apostles only, and extend not themselues to all Christians. for the declaration of this. when the circumstances are such that the command can haue noe place but for that present time when it is giuen, it is cleare that what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour spake to the Apostles is giuen to the Apostles only; as when our Sauiour said to S. Peeter: <hi>putt vp thy swod into the scabbard</hi>; or to the three Apostles: <hi>rise let vs goe</hi> &amp;c. and a thou sand such like.</p>
                        <p>Secondly: when the common tradition of Christendome tells vs that such commands as were giuen to the Apostles were neuer esteemed to oblige theyr successours.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly: when the matter commanded is common to the Apostles and all other Priests and not limited by any circumstance men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned or insinuated in Scripture, to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles only (if the generall and continnuall practise of Christendome be not contrarie) it is to be vnderstood to oblige not only the persons of the Apostles but all Bishops and Priests in succeeding ages, such as are the preceptes of teaching the Gospell,, Baptizing absoluing from sinnes &amp;c. and of consecrating sacrifising and receauing this blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly: when the matter of the precept in it selfe may be common to all Christians as was the washing of one an others feet, the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:47142:181"/>
abstinence from blond, and the receauing of both kindes, and hath noe limitation to the Apostles or Priests only prescribed in the Scripture there can be noe other rule to know which precept obliges all Christians, which not, saue the constant and generall tradition of the Christian Church. For by this only me know (as well Protestants as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes) that the precept of washing of feet bindes not though it be vniuersally &amp; strictly inioineyd in Scripture without any limitation of time or persons, and noe lesse though all Christians are of themselues capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue both kindes, and the command be giuen to the Apostles to teceaue them, yet this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by the churches perpetuall tradition, or permitting many lay Christians to teceaue in one only kinde, &amp; by the Protestants cousto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of not communicating little infants, shew cleerly that this precept is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all Christians without exception. and if Protestants notwitstanding the word, <hi>all,</hi> limitate it only to such as are arriued to the yeares of discretion, without any ground in the bare words of the text, to exclude little children, only because their own practise approues it; why may not Roman Catholikes limit it to the Apostles then present hauing both a ground in the text, because the words were spoken to them only, and the vniuersall
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47142:182"/>
tradition of the Christian Church permitting many lay persons to communicate in one only kinde, and little children eyther in one, or neyther, as I shall here after demonstrate.</p>

                        <p>The second precept alleaged by reformists for communion vnder both kindes, is in these words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> which being to be vnderstood of something com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done not then, but for insuing times, as I haue already shewed, are not to be limited as spoken to the Apostles only, then present, and so seeme to be extended to all Christians. especially if they be limited to Priests only, there will be noe command at-all in the institution obliging all Christians to receaue either both, or either kind of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

                        <p>These words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> according to all that which is commanded in them, cannot be extended to any more then, Priests, for here is euidently commanded the blessing, consecrating, offering, sacrificing and administring of this Sacrament, for it is to doe what our Sauiour then did, which according to Catholiques comprehends all these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and according to Protestants some of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:47142:182"/>
them, and if the consecrating and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament were not commanded in these words there would be noe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at all for them in the whol institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor very probabily in the whol new Testament.</p>
                        <p>Secondly if we stick closely to the bare words, noe man can conuince from them only that all Christians are obliged to receaue this Sacrament vnder both, or either kinde, for the cleargy men might haue been obliged to consecrate and administer this Sacrament, though the layity were not obliged to receaue it, as they are bound to administer Priesthood and mariage when they are iustly required: though noe man haue any absolute command either to be a Priest, or to mary, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are not bound to receaue those two Sacraments.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly all that those words import as they stand, may be satisfied probably if we say that not euery Priest or lay man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is obliged to consecrate or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by force of them, but that they conteyne a precept giuen to the church in generall that what our Sauiour here commands, be done as certainly there is a command giuen to the church to conferre Priesthood, absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and extreme Vnction &amp;c. and yet noe Bishop or Priest hath in particular any such
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:47142:183"/>
absolute obligation by reason of his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood only neither is any in particular bound to administer them by a positiue diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, giuen directly to them, though acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally they may haue a strickt obligation according to different circumstances to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the said Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>Fourtly: though it should be granted that these words: <hi>doe this</hi> &amp;c. containe a precept obliging all Christians arriued to yeares of discretion to communicate sometimes, yet this toucheth only the receauing vnder the forme of bread, if we stand to the expresse words of the institution being said after the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the host and before the chalice. And the precept recorded by S. Paul after the chalice is not absolute to consecrate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue that, but so often as it is drunke, to doe it in remembrance of our Sauiour: <hi>doe this as often as you shall drinke in remembrance of me,</hi> said our Sauiour.</p>
                        <p>Lastly: though from the sole force of these words: <hi>doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> considered as they stand in Scripture, noe forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be drawn to proue a positiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in particular binding euery Christian, to receaue sometimes this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnder either or both kindes, and though the generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the church be that there is noe diuine precept obliging more to receaue the host
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47142:183"/>
then the chalice, and the coustome of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue church was to giue to some the chalicc noe lesse without the host, then to others the host without the chalice. and that some late Learned Writers affirme that there is noe such precept conteyned in holy Scripture; yet because S. Thomas and the common streame of doctours after him grant a generall precept of receauing this Sacrament to be conteyned in them, and that S. Paul seemes to giue sufficient ground to thinke that this command: <hi>doe this</hi> &amp;c. was to be extended to the actuall receauing of this Sacrament by the laity, by mentioning drinking in the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall command of the consecrated chalice, and deducing from the institution what prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all Christians should make to receaue worthily this Sacrament, as appeares v. 27. to the end of the chapter: and mouued by this authority I grant that all Christians are here commanded sometimes in there liues to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent this Sacrament, yet so that lay people satisfie this precept by receauing one only kind, or both, according to the order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the holy Church, as shee is mouued by different times or circumstances now to ordaine the receauing of both, now of one alone, to some the sole host, and to others the chalice only; for seeing this precept was giuen before the consecration of the chalice,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47142:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though it induce noe more neccssity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the host then the chalice, yet it shewes euidently that if the host alone be receaued, this precepte is satisfied and by a manifest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and equalitie betwixt the two kindes that if it be sufficient to satisfie this precept to receaue the sole host, it will also be sufficient to receaue the chalice without the host, the one containing nos lesse the whole essence of this Sacrament, then the other, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared.</p>
                        <p>So that in this command: <hi>doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> the word, this, seemes to signifie (according to S. Thomas now cited) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer our Sauiour then did, as necessarily appertaining to the essence &amp; substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this Sacrament; and though this absolute preecpt was giuen before the chalice, yet the ground of it being the very same in the host and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, it is equally to be applyed to the receauing either of them; yet disiunctiuely only that is, that this Sacrament is to be receaued by euery one either vnder each or both kindes, as the church shall determine,</p>

                        <p>I am not ignorant that Catholique doctours giue different answers to this text which I leaue to be perused in theyr particular treatises of this point. I answer breefly and clearely that in this text is comprehended a necessity both of eating and drinking that is, there is a generall command giuen to the whol genc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Christians to receaue the body of Christ by way of eating, and his blood by way of drinking, and consequently of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing vnder both kindes, which must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be performed by the generall body of Christians, that they may haue life in them, and that this may be performed there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular necessitie put vppon euery particular Christian to concurre to the execution of this generall command, not that euery one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is obliged both to eate and drinke really this Sacrament, but that some eating, others drinking, others doing both, each particular conferres to the performance of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:47142:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this command of eating, and drinking the body and blood of Christ: wherevnto the generallity is absolutly obliged: so that this whol command is to be performed by all as ioyntly and vnitedly considered and that it may be thus ioyntly done by all, each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is obliged to some part of it, thereby concurring partially to the whol performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.<note place="margin">Matth. 28. v. 19. Marc. 16. v. 13.</note> Thus when our Sauiour commanded his Apostles to teach and baptize all nations, he gaue a generall and vniuersall command to them and theyr successours to performe this worke ioyntly amongst them, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding each one in particular to preach and baptize the whol world, for that neither was nor could, morally speaking, haue been done, but that this might be done by all, each one in particular was obliged to performe his part, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre to the conuersion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all nations, so that though noe one was bound by vertu of this command either to conuert all nations, or any one in particular: each one was obliged to labour towards the conuersion of some part or other of the world, so that by the labours of each, at last the whol worke might be accomplished. Thus our Sauiour sent his disciples saying: goe and cure all diseases &amp;c. that is each one curing some,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.9.</note> all might be cured amongst them. thus after his resurrection he foretold
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47142:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what cures and miracles should be done by his disciples, not that each should doe all these miracles, but that amongst them such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles should be done: and thus the holy Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist affirmes that the Apostles of Christ preached euery where, not that each preached euery where, but that all of them togeather were spread ouer the whol world. and in the same manner may it now be said that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians eate the flesh and drinke the blood of Christ, not that each doth both, but that it is done amongst them, by reason that each in particular is obliged either to both, or either of them: and so the whol precept will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed amongst them. Neither seemes the context of S. Iohn to exact more then this; for in what goes immediately before, the doubt which the Iewes had there, to which our Sauiour answers in this text; was not whether it was necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for euery one both to eate the flesh, and drinke the blood of Christ, for he had as then made noe mention at all of drinking his blood, but they only doubted how his flesh could be really eaten. <hi>how can this man, say they, giue vs his stesh to eate</hi>?<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> so that our Sauiours answer to this doubt of theirs, was fully sufficient by telling them that it was not only possible, but necessary to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the sone of man, that is, that those two actions should be really and truly done amongst such as were to haue eternall life. but seeing their doubt was not (supposing the reality of this eating and drinking the body and blood of Christ, amongst such as were to haue eternall life.) whether it were necessary that euery one in particular were both to eate and drinke (for they neuer so much as dreamed of this question) it is noe way necessary to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me (by vertu of this context) that our Sauiour defined there that it was necessary for euery one in particular to performe both: but it was sufficient that both these actions were truly and really so to be accomplished in his church, that the generalitie was to doe both, and each Christian in particular to concurre either by performing one, or both to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this iniunction. for if each in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar had not been obliged to concurre to the performance of this command, the whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

more obliged to doe it, then an other.</p>
                        <p>And though there be many other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands giuen by our Sauiour to the church in generall which oblige not each particular Christian to the performance of any part of them, but only the gouuernours of the church to see that by some or other they be put in execution, yet this precept is of an other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture binding the whol community of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to the whol and each particular to some part of this command. For seeing there is noe more reason why one Christian should be more exempted from it then an other, the concurring to it falls equally vppon all; for though Priests when they consecrate and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice haue each in particular an obligation to communicate, yet according to a probable opinion, they haue noe obligation in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proceeding from any diuine precept to consectate, or sacrifize, but all their absolute obligation to communicate is taken from this and other like commands, which we haue treated; so that though noe particular Priest were bound by diuine precept to say masse, yet they are bound to communicate by reason of these precepts, which could not be vnlesse euery Christian were obliged in perticular to concurre to the performance of this generall command with an equall obligation.</p>

                        <p>Secondly as it was not in the power of the Apostels to exempt any of the twelf from concurring to the conuersion of all nation commanded by our Sauiour and to haue i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>I Answer secondly that there is as great a necessity to vnderstand this precept in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resaid manner drawn from the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>That more is vnderstood then is expressed in any place of Scripture, is not vppon light coniectures to be supposed, but to be prouued by solide and conuincing arguments, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise each light headed nouelist might at his pleasure frame to himselfe certain apparent congruities to extend the words of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and to make them import more then they signifie in themselues, and so multiplie Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdoches wheresoeuer it comes to his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se. Seeing therefore I haue shewed that there is noe necessity to strech these textes beyond the common and vsuall stgnification of the words, by giuing at least a probable satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to whatsoeuer they alleadge to proue the contrary, let our aduerfaries make good that there it a necessity of the drawing these words beyond their naturall signification, or that more words are supposed then are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the text, and we will yeeld to this explication.</p>
                        <p>But this discours of our Sauiour: is so farre from giuing the least ground to any such like, improprieties (the common refuge of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries when they eannot auoyd the sorce of the expresse words, and proper sense of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47142:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Scripture) that it rather confirmes the proper and natiue signification of these words: <hi>he who eateth this bread shall liue for euer</hi>: when he saith: <hi>as I liue by my father, so he who eateth me shall liue by me.</hi> whence is (at the least more probabily then Protestants can proue the contrary) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that as our Sauiour liues totally and compleately by his father without the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing else, so Christians liue by worthily eating this heauenly bread without the addition of drinking, or any other action necessary to giue life as a part of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>But that I may make the exposition which I haue giuen of these words, yet more plaine and forcible, I will propose an instance of a command of this kind giuen to the Israelites euen in matter of a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> where they are in generall commanded by families to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the passeouer by taking killing and shedding the blood and sprinkling it vppon the posts of their dores, rosting and eating the paschall lambe &amp;c. not that euery one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was obliged to performe all these actions, but some to one, and others to others with decency and proportion, though abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly speaking, euery one in particular must haue concurred with the rest to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them all, and yet the whol familly by concurring partially were obliged to the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47142:190"/>
performance of all. and happily this mystery beeing a figure of the Eucharist, the only command of eating without any mention of drinking may giue some aduantage to the coustome of eating alone amongst Roman Catholiques, but this only by the way as a congruence. And yet to come nerer to our present Question, when our Sauiour in the command giuen in the institution: <hi>doe this</hi> &amp;c. commanded that what he had done, as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially belonging to this Sacrament, should be done in his church, that is, that this mystery should be celebrated, the host and chalice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, the body and blood of our Sauiour vndloodily be sacrifized and receaued, yet noe Christian dare affirme that all these actions here commanded were to be performed by euery Christian in particular, for then all Christian men, weomen and children were to performe the office of Priests, but that euery one was to concurre to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this precept by doing what belongs to his degree and calling: and seeing all these actions now mentioned were not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by each Christian, how can it be euer prouued that each was both to eate &amp; drinke, seeing that by performance of either of these actions separately, each might partially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to the accomplishment of that precept, as they may also to this: <hi>nisi manducaueritis:
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47142:190"/>
vnlesse you eate the flesh of the sone of man and drinke his blood, you shall not haue life in you:</hi> that is vnlesse you concurre each in particular to the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this command either by eating alone or drinking alone, or performing both togeather, each respectiuely to his calling, office and order prescribed by the church, you shall not haue life amongst you, that is these actions are necessary that life may be found in the Church of Christ, or amongst Christians. for this is à command which must be fulfilled amongst them, and all are bound in particular to concurre, one way or other, to the fulfilling of it, seeing there is noe reason that one should be more obliged then an other, and so if any one were not obliged, none in particular would be bound to fulfill it, and then euery one in particular might lawfully abstaine and consequently there would be noe performance of this command amongst Christians, which would make the command to be void and of noe effect, quite contrary to the expresse words and intention of our Sauiour.</p>
                        <p>From this whol discours may appeare what an vnworthy and base esteeme our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries frame of the most sacred body and blood of our Sauiour, not thinking that either of them (as they are in this Sacrament) is fit and capable to conferre sauing grace to such

But our aduersaries eyther not beleeuing it is his precious blood, or little regarding what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of it, if they beleeue it, will and must haue the vse of the chalice, though it be affected with a thosand irreuerences, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie theyr willfull, and vngrounded impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.

                        <p>Some there are who being conuinced of the reall presence, and that there is neither necessity nor command in Scripture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing allwayes both, notwithstanding for the precedent places objected, say that euery particular Christian is obliged sometimes in his life to communicate vnder both at the same time, and thus they esteeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues both to agree with those places of Scripture now cited which affirme that by eating alone eternall life is acquired, and auoid those inconueniences which happen to the blood of our Sauiour amongst such multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Christians so frequently communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by granting that this Sacrament ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily may be receaued vnder the formes of bread only: and agree with the practise of the primitiue Christians who though they
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:47142:193"/>
often receiued vnder one priuately, or when the other could not conueniently be had: yet at other times they receiued publickly vnder both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the other side conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues both to the institution of our Sauiour and those other precepts of receiuing both by doing it sometimes in their liues when the precept obliges. This opinion though it seeme fairely to compose all difficulties, yet the newnesse and vnhardnesse of it, where there nothig else, render it suspect of superficiality and falshood, for how is it possible that each Christian should haue so weighty an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and neither any doctour in the moderne Roman Church, so much as dreame of it, nor any amongst her present aduersaries once presse it against vs, or thinke of it themselues. or if we looke to the late fiue hundred yeares before vs where in it hath been the coustome in many particular churches to communicate publickly vnder the formes of bread only without the least reflection or practise of any such precept,<note place="margin">3. parte qu. 150. ar. 2. cor.</note> as S. Thomas wittnesses, those churches always communicating the laity vnder one kinde only, or if we ascend to the primitiue times, there is noe step nor impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be found of any such precept, for then they not sometimes only or euer by way of diuine precept, for so much as can be gathered from the authours of those times, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47142:193"/>
in publick celebrations of those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries communicated vnder both. and those childeren which communicated vnder one only kinde, we neuer read to haue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vnder both, though they died in their childhood, which not withstanding they should haue done, had the Christians of the primitiue times beleeued any such need, as is here conceiued of sometimes communicating vnder both. how, I say, is it possible that this opinion should be true &amp; solide seeing neither moderne nor ancient, nor primitiue times, nor friends nor aduersaries of the Roman Church so much as once mention it? but beside the newnesse it hath other reasons enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince it of falshood, for first when the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Christians communicated little infants presently after baptisme vnder the formes of wine, only they neuer are read to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it vnder both if they came to be in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of death when, they had acquired strength enough to receaue both; which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had been obliged to doe had there been any diuine precept obliging all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to receaue both sometimes or at least once in their liues.</p>
                        <p>Secondly the same difficulty may be pressed against this new hatched opinion, of children arriued to the age of six or seauen yeares who being accoustumed in the primitiue Church
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47142:194"/>
to consumate the particles or reliques of the sacred hosts, raceaued vnder the formes of bread only, for there is not a step imprinted in antiquity of conferring both kindes to them when they came to dy about that age. The like is of hermites who liued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in the deserts and had the coustome of taking with them the most blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder the formes of bread only.</p>
                        <p>But that which discouuers most cleerely the non existency of this new fangled opinion, is that it hath noe ground in holy Scripture. for when our Sauiour saith Ioh. 6. <hi>he who eateth this bread shall liue for euer,</hi> whosoeuer holds this opinion must say that he who receaues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly vnder the forme of bread only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues grace and spirituall life in his soul; suppose therefore that still perseuering in that grace receaued he come to die before he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vnder both kindes, certainly he will be saued; which shewes euidently that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of both kindes before death is not necessaty to saluation <hi>necessitate medij</hi> (as the schoole speakes) that is, so necessary that sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation can noe more be acquired without it, then it can be without faith, or the grace of God. neither can communion vnder both kindes be said to be necessary to saluation <hi>necessitate praecepti,</hi> or by diuine precept: for these words of S. Ioh. c. 6. <hi>nisi ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducaueritis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem

                        <p>What I answer to this opinion will easily preuent the forging of an other of the like nature that might happily occurre to some quaint nouelist, that though there should be noe necessity of euer receauing both kindes at the same time, yet these words of S. Iohn: <hi>Vnlesse you eate the flesh of the sone of man and drinke his blood, you shall not haue life in you,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a necessity of both eating and drinking at the least at seuerall times, now doing the one and then the other, which being done, each Christian may be truly said both to <hi>haue eaten the flesh and drunke the blood of the sone of man,</hi> and soe sufficiently to haue fullfilled this declaration of our Sauiour. This imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I say, is wholy cut of by what I haue answered to the former opinion, (to omit the nouelty of this inuention) for the community of Christians, comply sufficiently with this
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47142:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
command, if some receiue vnder the forme of bread, and others of wine, this being amongst themselues to haue <hi>both eaten the flesh, and drunke the blood of the sone of man,</hi> though each in particular doe not both of them, the command being giuen not in the singular but in the plurall number.</p>
                        <p>Now that I may conuince euen from the confession of our Aduersaries, that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vnder both kindes is not necessary to saluation.</p>
