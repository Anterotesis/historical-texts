            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </figure>THE CASE OF THE CITY OF LONDON.</head>
            <p>In Reference to the DEBT to The ORPHANS, and Others.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the Cuſtom of <hi>LONDON,</hi> Confirmed by divers Acts of Parliament, The <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> are Guardians of the ORPHANS of all Freemen of the ſaid City, and have the Care and Government of Them and their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>By that Cuſtom, the Executors of every the ſaid Citizens are Bound, either to find ſufficient Sureties to the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> for the ORPHANS Portions; or otherwiſe, To Pay the ſame unto the <hi>Chamberlain</hi> of <hi>London</hi> as a Depoſit, to be kept for Them until Security be found, or their reſpective Portions become Due.</p>
            <p>In regard the Eſtates of the Citizens were moſtly Perſonal, and liable to be Waſted by <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Executors;</hi> That Cuſtom has been very neceſſary, for the Protection and Preſervation of the Perſons, Eſtates and Marriages of many Thouſands of <hi>Orphans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The CHAMBER of <hi>London,</hi> for many Ages, had an Unqueſtionable Credit, and was clear from all Debts until about the Beginning of the Troubles between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By occaſion of the Troubles then ariſing, Debts of a great Value (Owing to the City) became Deſperate, a Neceſſity was put upon Them of very great Charges and Expences to the Then Government: And the Troubles continuing and increaſing till the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> broke out, They were conſtrained by the Powers to whom They were ſubject, to lay out many other great Sums of <hi>Mony,</hi> whereby They then became much Indebted.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the <hi>Credit</hi> of the City continuing, many <hi>Executors</hi> (unwilling or unable to find Security) beſought the <hi>Court of Aldermen</hi> to take the <hi>Orphans Mony</hi> upon Intereſt, which ought to have been only a Depoſit; Who were thereby induc'd to take the ſame at Intereſt, which has amounted to the greateſt part of the Debt now Owing.</p>
            <p>Not only this Burthen of <hi>Intereſt</hi> for <hi>Orphans Portions</hi> was unduly brought upon the <hi>Chamber;</hi> but the <hi>Cities Revenues,</hi> by the long continued Troubles, were greatly Leſſened; And the dreadful Fire of <hi>London</hi> hapning: By the concurrence of ſo many Publick Miſeries, They were rendred almoſt Deſperate to Anſwer ſo great Demands.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Court of Aldermen</hi> ceaſed not their continual Endeavours, to find the beſt Ways and Methods (by Retrenching their <hi>Charges,</hi> and Improving their <hi>Revenue</hi>) towards ſatisfying the ſaid Debt; And did continue Paying both <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> till after the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> brought againſt the City, to deſtroy their Being: Which not only put them to great Charge; but ruin'd their Credit, and rendred them for ever uncapable to anſwer thoſe Demands, unleſs by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that Reaſon, The <hi>City of London</hi> have ſince that Time made Their Application to every <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in the <hi>Firſt Parliament</hi> of Their <hi>MAJESTIES,</hi> a Bill for that purpoſe was Twice Read in the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> And the City having laid before Them their <hi>Revenue,</hi> the Particulars for the Relief were Agreed upon in a <hi>Grand Committee</hi> of that Whole Houſe: To which the <hi>Houſe</hi> Concurred, and (as we believe) the <hi>Bill</hi> had paſſed there, if it had not been prevented by a <hi>Prorogation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>City</hi> have Endeavoured, That the ſame <hi>Bill</hi> might be Received by this <hi>Preſent Houſe of Commons;</hi> Who did the <hi>Laſt Seſſion</hi> ſeveral times Appoint a Day for the Conſideration of that Matter.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding the <hi>City</hi> has not Received any <hi>Mony</hi> of ORPHANS (or Others) at Intereſt, or by way of Depoſit, ſince <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> 1683; Yet ſince that Time (by getting in Debts formerly Owing to rhe City, Retrenching <hi>Expences,</hi> and Improvement of their <hi>Revenue</hi>) They have Paid to <hi>All Orphans</hi> (whoſe Portions in the <hi>Chamber of London</hi> exceeded not <hi>Five and Fifty Pounds</hi>) Their Whole Debt, Amounting to</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ten Thouſand Six Hundred Seventy Three Pounds, Two Shillings and Eight Pence;</hi> And have further Paid to the ORPHANS, and Others, for Intereſt, <hi>Ninety Seven Thouſand, Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Preſent Court of Aldermen</hi> do humbly Inſiſt, That they have done, and do ſtill uſe Their utmoſt Endeavours, to find out all Concealments of the <hi>Cities Rights,</hi> and believe Themſelves ſufficiently Inſtructed in All the Intereſts and Concerns of the City, from whence any Profit can poſſibly ariſe to the ORPHANS; And that there can neither be juſtly Objected againſt them any Failure of their Duties therein, or the leaſt Waſt or Miſemployment of any part of Their Incom; or that there has been any Defect in giving Reaſonable Encouragement to any Perſons, who can do any further Service for the <hi>Orphans.</hi>
