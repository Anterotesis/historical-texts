            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE HOVSE OF Lords Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He differences and <hi>Diviſions</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at this day are ſo many, ſo great, and ſo <hi>deſtructive</hi> to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be accounted a <hi>tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> act of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charitie</hi> for any man to endevour according to his place to compoſe the one, and remove the other. But though this worke be very excellent, yet it is alſo very dangerous to him that ſhall undertake it. For it is often found, that he that will ſtep into reconcile two parties that are a <hi>fighting,</hi> doth prove the party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which both of them will <hi>fight.</hi> Or if not both, yet alwaies the party that doth the wrong will be a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie to him that would make up the breach. And therefore it is expreſſely ſaid, <hi>Act. 7. 26, 27.</hi> That when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw two of his brethren ſtriving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt
<pb facs="tcp:123903:3"/>
the other, and ſtept in to ſet them at one, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sirs, ye are brethren, why wrong ye one another? <hi>He that did his neighbour the wrong thruſt him away, ſaying, Who made thee a Ruler and a Judge over us?</hi> But yet notwithſtanding, happy is that man whom God ſhall make any wayes inſtrumentall to the bringing in of a holy and bleſſed Peace into this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Iland, though with the loſſe of his owne life. Famous is the example of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who was <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> eminent for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety: And yet when he ſaw a prevailing Faction endevouring to chooſe another into his place, and that it would much diſturbe the peace of the Citie <note place="margin">Ruffini hiſtor. Eccleſiaſt. lib. 2. cap. 9.</note>if he did not yeeld it up; he brake out into this ſpeech: <hi>Abſit, inquit, ut mei causâ aliqua ſimultas oriatur in Dei Sacerdotibus. Si propter me eſt iſta tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtas, tollite, &amp; mittite me in mare, &amp; deſinet à vobis quaſſatio. God forbid that for my cauſe any difference ſhould ariſe amongſt the Miniſters of God: If this tempeſt be raiſed for my cauſe, take me, &amp; throw me into the Sea that ſo the tempeſt may ceaſe.</hi> A ſentence worthy to be written in <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold,</hi> and to be put in practiſe by every true hearted <hi>Engliſhman.</hi> The like we read of <hi>Codrus</hi> a <hi>Heathen King,</hi> who for the love of his people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe to death. And of <hi>Curtius,</hi> and of three <hi>Decii</hi> that devoted themſelves to ruine for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their Countrey. The Booke of God tels us of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> that was willing to have his name blotted out of the Booke of life: and of <hi>Paul</hi> that was willing to be an <hi>Anathema,</hi> that ſo God might be reconciled to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with whom he was diſpleaſed. But the greateſt example of all is of our <hi>Lord and bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:123903:3"/>
Saviour,</hi> who emptied himſelfe of his Divinitie, and became a ſervant, and a curſe, that he might become our <hi>Peace-maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much to this purpoſe is ſaid in the inſuing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is now made publique by your Commands. Something alſo is ſaid to keep up your ſpirits from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-diſmaied at the conſideration of theſe Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroying Diviſions. Great are the <hi>ſearchings</hi> and <hi>tremblings</hi> of heart, becauſe of theſe Diviſions. But be not over-diſcouraged: It is <hi>Gods Prerogative</hi> to bring <hi>light out of darkneſſe, good out of evill, unitie out of diviſion.</hi> He worketh by <hi>contrarie</hi> meanes as well as by <hi>unlikely</hi> meanes. He delivered <hi>Jonah</hi> by a <hi>Whale,</hi> and kept him (as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith) <hi>vivus in ſepulchro.</hi> He raiſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> by caſting him into <hi>priſon;</hi> he cured the blind man by <hi>clay and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> And I doubt not but he will bring a great deale of good at laſt out of our Diviſions. It is obſervable that <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> that at firſt were <hi>brethren in iniquitie,</hi> joyning together to deſtroy the <hi>Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and for this cruel act, as a ſutable puniſhment, were <hi>divided in Jacob, and ſcattered in Iſrael, Gen. 49. 7.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding becauſe afterwards <hi>Levi</hi> was zealous for God againſt the worſhippers of the golden Calfe, and did appeare valiantly on Gods ſide, <hi>Exod. 32. 26.</hi> God did turne this <hi>curſe</hi> into a <hi>bleſſing, Deut. 33. 10.</hi> For <hi>Levi</hi> was conſecrated to <hi>teach Jacob Gods judgement, and Iſrael his law,</hi> &amp;c. And the <hi>Simeonites,</hi> as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> obſerves, <note place="margin">Ainſw. xi Gen. 4<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:123903:4"/>
unity, but then we combined againſt God and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and for this cauſe as a juſt curſe, God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided us one from another, to the utter ruine one of another. But yet notwithſtanding, if you (Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable) will goe on to ſhew your ſelves zealous for God and his Cauſe, and to appeare vigorouſly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on his ſide; God will turne our great <hi>curſe</hi> into a great <hi>bleſſing.</hi> And as the dividing of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> was made by God a way and meanes to lead the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> over into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to deſtroy the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> So God will make our Diviſions in this Red Sea of bloud, into which we are plunged, a way and meanes to a happy <hi>Canaan</hi> of unitie and peace; and to the utter ruine of our implacable Adverſaries. Thus he did with the diviſions of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as this Sermon relates unto you. Onely be couragious for God, and in nothing be terrified at our differences, but make your peace with him, and he at laſtwill make us at peace one with another: which is the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer of</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are a <hi>iuſt Apology of Ieſus Chriſt, againſt the uniuſt accuſations and blaſphemies of the Scribes and Phariſees.</hi> There was a man brought unto Chriſt that was <hi>poſſeſſed with a Devil that made him dumbe and blind; and Chriſt healed him, inſomuch that the blind and dumbe, both ſpake and ſaw;</hi> Verſ. 22. This great miracle had three different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The common people were aſtoniſhed and ſaid; <hi>Is this the ſonne of David?</hi> Verſ. 23. His own kindred thought him mad, and ſought to lay hold on him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 21. But the Phariſees when they heard of it, they blaſphemouſly ſaid; <hi>This fellow</hi> doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils. Now Chriſt to cleare himſelfe from this curſed aſperſion brings foure <hi>Arguments,</hi> whereof this in my Text is the firſt. Interpreters take much paines to make out the ſtrength of the Argument. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123903:5"/>
ſumme of what they ſay is this. It is an Argument drawn from the policy and ſubtiltie of the Devill. For if Satan caſt out Satan (ſaith <hi>Chriſt)</hi> then Satan ſhould be divided againſt himſelfe. And if Satan ſhould be divided againſt himſelfe, then Satan ſhould ſeek his own ruine. <hi>For every kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe, is brought to deſolation, and every citie or houſe divided againſt it ſelfe ſhall not ſtand.</hi> But it is incredible to thinke that Satan ſhould ſeeke the ruine of his own kingdome, which he indeavoureth by all means to promote and propagate. And therefore it is certaine, that I do not caſt out Devils by the power of Beelzebub the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. This is Chriſts firſt Argument.</p>
            <p>But my purpoſe is to handle theſe words, only as they are an <hi>intire propoſition</hi> in themſelves; as they are a <hi>generall Maxime,</hi> written in great Characters, not only in the <hi>Booke of God,</hi> but in the <hi>Booke of Nature:</hi> and as they are a <hi>cleare Looking-glaſſe,</hi> in which with ſad countenances we may behold the woefull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>England</hi> is in at this preſent. For theſe words are the words of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who is truth it ſelfe. <hi>Every kingdome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelfe is brought to deſolation, and every houſe or citie divided againſt it ſelfe cannot ſtand.</hi> And if every Kingdome, then the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> divided againſt it ſelfe is brought to deſolation, and if every Citie, then the Citie of <hi>London</hi> divided againſt it ſelfe ſhall not ſtand. In the words themſelves, we have two parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt doth here ſet down <hi>one great Cauſe of the ruine of Kingdomes, Cities, and Families:</hi> and that is <hi>diviſion againſt it ſelf.</hi> Every Kingdome <hi>divided againſt it ſelfe:</hi> The word in the Greeke is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which doth not ſignifie every little, ſmall diviſion, but ſuch a diviſion, that doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that doth cut a Citie in pieces, ſuch a diviſion, when it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when it is <hi>intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> to a Kingdome, when it is got within the bowels of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it is like unto the winde, which when it gets into the bowels of the Earth, makes an Earth-quake, and blows up Towns, and Houſes, and Kingdoms. So doe theſe diviſions, whether Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, or Politicall, whether about matters of Religion, or of Civill Government, when they get within a Kingdome, they blow up a Kingdome, a Citie, and a Family.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Saviour Chriſt here ſets out the <hi>greatneſſe of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123903:5"/>
ruine that is cauſed by theſe diviſions;</hi> and that both <hi>Intenſively,</hi> and <hi>Extenſively.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Intenſively,</hi> and that by two expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt here ſayes, ſuch a divided Kingdome <hi>is brought to deſolation:</hi> the word in the Greeke is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it is made a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> Though a Kingdome in time of Peace be as happy as a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> diviſion will turne a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> into a <hi>deſolate wilderneſſe:</hi> And the words are in the Preſent tenſe, to ſhow the certaintie of it: <hi>It is brought,</hi> not <hi>it will be brought;</hi> Every Kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe <hi>is brought,</hi> and it is brought to <hi>deſolation.</hi> Diviſions doe not onely <hi>diſtemper</hi> a Kingdome, and make a Kingdome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, but they are <hi>deadly,</hi> and <hi>fatall</hi> to a Kingdome, they are like unto a great and wide breach made in the Banks to let in the Sea, to ſwallow up a whole Kingdome: they are like a breach made in the walles of a Citie beſieged, that lets in the Enemy to take the Citie. And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſayes, ſuch a divided Citie <hi>ſhall not ſtand.</hi> Chriſt doth not onely ſay, it ſhall reele, and totter; but he ſaith expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it ſhall not ſtand:</hi> or as it is in the 3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 24. <hi>It cannot ſtand;</hi> it muſt tumble and fall. Diviſions in a Houſe, are not only like unto the <hi>breaking of the Windows,</hi> or the <hi>pulling down of the Tyles,</hi> which may be done, and yet the Houſe may be ſafe: but they are like unto a <hi>Houſe all on fire,</hi> which muſt neceſſarily be burnt down if it be not quenched. Or like unto a Houſe, when the Pillars of it are pull'd down, and the Houſe it ſelfe falles with it. So is a Kingdome, Citie, or Family, divided againſt it ſelfe, <hi>it cannot ſtand,</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Saviour ſets out the <hi>greatneſſe of this ruine</hi> by the <hi>Extenſion</hi> of it; It is here ſaid, <hi>Every</hi> Kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe. Diviſions in a Kingdome, are like a <hi>ſweeping plague,</hi> that devoures whole Kingdoms, without any diſtinction. Though a Kingdome be never ſo well provided with Men, Armes, and Ammunition, Ships, Walles, and Bulwarks: yet notwithſtanding, if diviſions get into that Citie, and Kingdom, they are as a ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>gangrene,</hi> that will quickly infect the whole Kingdome, and deſtroy it utterly, be it never ſo well fortified by Sea or Land. Nay, though there ſhould be a <hi>Kingdome of Saints;</hi> yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if Differences and Diſtractions get within that Kingdome, they will prove like the <hi>worme that did eate up</hi> Ionah's <hi>gourd in one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123903:6"/>
night;</hi> Diviſions in a very little ſpace will ſwallow up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure all the outward happineſſe, even of a <hi>Kingdome of Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not only ſo, but <hi>every Citie,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) and <hi>every Houſe,</hi> though it be never ſo Religious, ſo Honourable, ſo rich a Family; yet notwithſtanding if diviſions get into that Family, <hi>it cannot ſtand.</hi> Theſe diviſions, they are like unto the <hi>Mors in olla,</hi> like unto the Coloquintida, that ſpoiled all the pottage; They are as a <hi>poyſonfull herbe,</hi> that ſpoiles all the riches and goodneſſe of a Family: like unto Eagles feathers, which (as ſome ſay) when they are mingled with other feathers, ſpoile all the feathers they are mingled withall. So doe Diviſions, Contentions, and Factions, when they get into a Citie, or Family, they ſpoile all the wealth, riches, and honours of that Family: for ſo ſayes our Saviour Chriſt; <hi>Every kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe is brought to deſolation, and every Citie, or Houſe divided againſt it ſelfe ſhall not ſtand.</hi> The words thus explained, will afford us this Doctrin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That Diviſions, whether they be Eccleſiaſticall, or Politicall, in Kingdomes, Cities, and Families, are infallible cauſes of ruine to Kingdomes, Cities, and Families.</p>
            <p>This Doctrin is proved, not only by the Hiſtory of the Bible; but by the Hiſtory of all Ages. The Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient alone to prove the Truth of this Doctrin. Hiſtorians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that there was never any great miſchiefe fell upon <hi>England,</hi> but the Cauſe of it was, the Diviſions that were among them. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> firſt made inrode into <hi>Britaino,</hi> he was called in by the Faction of <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Mandubratius.</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſayes, that all the Victories that the <hi>Romanes</hi> got, it was by the Factions and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that were among the <hi>Britaines.</hi> And afterwards, when the <hi>Saxons</hi> made a Conqueſt of <hi>Britaine; Vortigern</hi> that had got the Kingdome by a Faction, to maintaine his Party, ſent for the <hi>Saxons</hi> in, as ſome ſay, or at leſt imployed them, when, in, to take his part, as others write. But all write, that by this meanes he deſtroyed himſelfe, and the whole Kingdome. And ſo likewiſe, when the <hi>Normans</hi> made a Conqueſt upon <hi>England;</hi> they were invited hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Factions that were in <hi>England.</hi> Eſpecially, by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that the <hi>Earle Goodwin</hi> made, and his ſonne <hi>Touſtaine,</hi> as our Hiſtorians doe relate.

               <hi>England,</hi> all the time of the <hi>Barons warres:</hi> And of the miſerable condition of <hi>England, when the Houſe of Yorke and the Houſe of Lancaſter</hi> roſe up one againſt another. And what ſhal we ſay to the deſolate and bleeding condition of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> at this preſent? Doth not our forlorne, and miſerable eſtate ſufficiently make good this Doctrin: <hi>That Diviſions in Church and State, are deſtructive to Church and State?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> I might ſhew you, how the <hi>Empire of Grecia</hi> as long as <hi>Alexander</hi> kept it in unitie flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in great proſperitie, but after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> it was divided into foure parts, and theſe <hi>foure Governours</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another by diviſions. I might alſo inſtance in the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> aſſoone as ever it was divided by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> into two parts, from that very time (as <hi>Sigonius</hi> relates) the Romane Empire, which before that was very ſtrong and potent, began firſt ſecretly to grow weake, and afterwards to decay, till at laſt it came to utter deſtruction.</p>
            <p>I might inſtance alſo in the people of the Iewes, as long as they were <hi>as a Citie united within it ſelfe</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> time, ſo long they did exceedingly flouriſh; but as ſoone as ever they were divided into ten Tribes, and two Tribes, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began to warre one againſt another, and to open the doore to foraine Invaſions; till at laſt they were all of them utterly ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Famous is the ſtory of the Citie of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> when it was beſieged by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian, Ioſephus</hi> tels us it had three mightie Factions in the very bowels of it: The chiefe of which Factions were <hi>Iehochanan, Eleazar, Schimeon.</hi> And that theſe three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions did kill more then the enemie himſelfe; and were the cauſe of the taking of that famous Citie.

                  <p>Reaſon 1. Why Diviſions are ſo fatall to Kingdomes, becauſe they take away all the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They take away Peace from a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               </note> the famous Citie of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when it was taken by the Turks, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But let us a little conſider the Reaſons why Diviſions are ſo fatall and deſtructive to Kingdomes, Cities, and Families.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt Reaſon is, becauſe that theſe</hi> inteſtine diviſions they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all thoſe things that are as walls, and bulwarks to preſerve a Nation from ruine. <hi>As for example:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Diviſions deſtroy the peace of a Kingdome:</hi> Now there is nothing that preſerves a Kingdome more then <hi>peace:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:123903:7"/>
And therefore the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> comprehended all bleſſings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Peace. Heaven</hi> it ſelfe, it is nothing but <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillit as pacis;</hi> what is <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>God of peace?</hi> and what is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the <hi>Prince of Peace?</hi> And therefore, as <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stoughton</hi> Sermons.</note>that Cardinall made his Embleme, <hi>A Beach tree,</hi> with this Motto: <hi>Take off the top and it is the ruine of all the reſt:</hi> for ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Beach tree, that if you cut the top off, the tree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently withers: ſuch may be the <hi>Motto</hi> of every Kingdome: <hi>Take off the top, and it is the ruine of all the reſt:</hi> Take away <hi>Peace,</hi> and you <hi>deſtroy</hi> a <hi>Kingdome.</hi> The truth is, there is no outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is a reall bleſſing where peace is wanting: your Eſtates, your Honors, are no bleſſings, if you have not peace to enjoy them. And therefore, as the Artificer carved his owne name into the <hi>Buckler of Minerva</hi> ſo exactly, that whoſoever ſhould undertake to pick out his name, muſt neceſſarily ſpoile the Buckler: ſo it is with <hi>Peace,</hi> peace is ſo <hi>woven</hi> into the proſperitie of a Kingdome, that whatſoever deſtroyes peace, muſt needs deſtroy a Kingdome. Now Diviſion takes away peace, and therefore Diviſion ruines a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. They take away unitie, love, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> And then ſecondly, <hi>Diviſion takes away the Vnitie of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi> now <hi>Vnitie</hi> is the great <hi>preſerver of Church and State:</hi> it is the great preſerver of all bodies, both <hi>Naturall, Politicall, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall,</hi> and <hi>Theologicall.</hi> What is that, that keeps the fabrick of Heaven from diſſolving into pieces, but the Vnitie and the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſcordant Elements? What keeps this great fabrick here from falling, but the Vnion and conjunction of the parts of it? <hi>ſtones ioyned together make a building, but ſtones uncemented, deſtroy and overthrow a building: boards ioyned together make a Ship, disioytned make a ſhip-wrack.</hi> What keeps the body of a man in health, but the juſt proportion and harmonie of every part? the members of the body divided from the head are preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: the branches divided from the Vine receive no joyce, no ſap, no vertue: Every thing is preſerved by unitie and concord. <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> united ſave a <hi>Kingdome:</hi> divided make <hi>ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack</hi>

               </note>of a <hi>Kingdome.</hi> The <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> at firſt, when the <hi>bloud of Chriſt was yet warme,</hi> was at unitie within it ſelfe, and all <hi>with one accord prayſing and ſerving God,</hi> and then it flouriſhed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. The Church was then like a pure <hi>Virgin</hi> attended
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:123903:7"/>
with all the graces of Gods Spirit as with ſo many <hi>Hand-maides.</hi> But afterwards when it fell into diviſions it loſt her <hi>Virginity,</hi> and <note place="margin">Hegeſip. ex Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb.</note>all her hand-maids forſook her. For this is true both in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and in Divinitie, <hi>Omne diviſible eſt corruptibile:</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is diviſible, is corruptible. And the like I ſay of concord, love and friendſhip, which are nothing elſe but <hi>unitie in affection:</hi> Theſe are the glew that ſoders; theſe are the nerves and ſinewes that joyne a Kingdome together. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Above all things put on love which is the bond of perfection:</hi> it is a <note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>bond to joyne Kingdomes, and Cities, and Families together. And therefore, whatſoever breakes this bond of Kingdomes in pieces, muſt needs devoure and deſtroy Kingdomes. But diviſions doe this. For they are like a Caterpiller to devoure all peace, unitie, love, friendſhip, and concord, which are the great ſupporters of Kingdomes. They are like unto the great Plague of the Locuſts that devoured all the greene things in the land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> There <note place="margin">Exod. 9.</note>is nothing that is good in a Nation, nothing that is greene and flouriſhing in a Nation, but diviſion and contention will deſtroy it. And therefore diviſions muſt needs be deſtructive to Kingdomes. This is the firſt Reaſon: and then</p>

                  <p>Reaſon 2. Why Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Kingdomes, becauſe they open a doore to all miſery.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They let in confuſion.</p>
               </note> Secondly: As diviſions take away all thoſe things that are the Buttreſſes to uphold a Nation: So on the other ſide, they open a doore to all kinds of miſery; they bring in myriads of evils into a Kingdome: They are like unto <hi>Pandora's box,</hi> which when it was once opened, out flied all kind of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes: As for example:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Where inteſtine diviſions dwell, <hi>there dwels ſtrife and envie;</hi> and where envie and ſtrife is, there is <hi>confuſion and every evill worke,</hi> I am. 3. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. They let in a foraine enemie.</note> Secondly, Diviſions open a doore to let in a <hi>foraine enemie:</hi> and it is a free and miraculous mercy that God hath kept out the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> from invading <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in theſe times of our diviſions.</p>

Let five men joyne together to beare a burden, and they will beare it with eaſe: but if three of

Diviſions make us to ſheath our ſwords in our owne bowels.</hi> As God cauſed the <hi>Midianites</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another: ſo theſe Diviſions ſet a Kingdome againſt it ſelfe; they ſet a man againſt himſelfe; a Citie againſt it ſelfe, to deſtroy it ſelfe,: In a word, that I may expreſſe all miſery in one <note place="margin">They bring in Civill warres.</note>phraſe: <hi>Diviſions bring in Civill warres,</hi> which of all warres are moſt <hi>uncivill.</hi> There are three Iron whips with which God doth whip man-kind, when it grows monſtrous in iniquitie; the <hi>Plague, Sword</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> cals <hi>Tonſur as inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentis humani generis, The loppings and prunings of Man-kind when they grow ranke in iniquitie.</hi> Of thoſe three plagues Warre is the greateſt.

But of all warres no warre ſo miſchievous as Civill warre, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Civill warres are the worſt of warres, for foure Reaſons.</note> Firſt, Becauſe there is <hi>no warre ſo unnatur all as Civill warre:</hi> for in Civill warre, the father fights againſt the child, and the friend againſt the friend, and the brother againſt the brother.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>There is no warre ſo cruell as Civill warre:</hi> and therefore you ſhall obſerve, that the <hi>Hagarens,</hi> and the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Edomites,</hi> were the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had: Now theſe were of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Odia proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum ſunt cerrima.</note>of the people of <hi>Iſrael; The hatred of brethren is moſt bitter when they fall out:</hi> You have an example of this in the 20. of <hi>Iudg.</hi> 48.

every man they met withall, but they kild every <hi>beaſt that they met withall, and they kild every thing that came to hand:</hi> It is a ſtrange expreſſion, to ſhew the crueltie of Civill warre: and you know how the bloud-thirſtie Cavalieres, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> doe hunger and thirſt to drinke <hi>Cups full</hi> of the bloud of the Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads (as they call us).</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Theſe warres, they are moſt treacherous; no warre ſo treacherous as Civill warre, for there will alwaies be falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that will labour to betray their brethren into the hands of the enemie, for it is a warre amongſt Brethren; and theſe are the times wherein we may take up the complaint of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Ier. 9. 2, 3, 4, 5. and wherein we had need follow the example of <hi>Mica.</hi> 7. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, theſe wars of all wars are moſt <hi>uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> And therefore you ſhall read that when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had overcome the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> in ſtead of rejoycing for the victory, they all fell a weeping becauſe of their brethren that were ſlaine, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 21. 2.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons why Civill warres are the worſt of wars. But of all Civill wars that ever were, none ſo wicked, none ſo miſchievous as the Civill warres of <hi>England.</hi> Of all the <hi>arrowes</hi> that are in the <hi>quiver of Gods iudgements,</hi> there is no <hi>arrow</hi> ſo <hi>ſharpe,</hi> ſo <hi>keene,</hi> as this <hi>arrow</hi> that <hi>God</hi> now ſhoots out againſt <hi>England.</hi> For there is a <hi>Generation</hi> of men riſen up amongſt us that fight againſt the Parliament whom they themſelves did chooſe, and intruſt with their lawes, liberties, and religion. Men that fight againſt a Reformation: That fight themſelves into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Slavery,</hi> and <hi>Beggery.</hi> That joyne with the <hi>Papiſts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Rebels of Ireland</hi> to fight (as they ſay) for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi> That fight for their <hi>Liberties</hi> againſt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>onely Conſervator of their Liberties.</hi> That call God to record that they intend nothing but the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the liberties of the people, and yet endeavour by all treachery and bloudy ways to ſubvert Religion and Liberties. That God ſhould ſuffer ſuch multitudes of men to be ſo farre drunke with error, and to be ſo farre blinded with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, this is a judgement of all judgements moſt ſuperlative.</p>

Now all theſe are the fruits of our diviſions, and therefore certainely, Ieſus Chriſt might well ſay, or if Chriſt had not ſaid it, our owne experience would have taught us the truth of this Text: <hi>Every Kingdome divided againſt it ſelfe is brought to deſolation, and every houſe, and every citie divided againſt it ſelfe ſhall not ſtand.</hi> This is all that I ſhall ſay for the explication of the Doctrine.</p>

There was a time when the <hi>Parliament of England</hi> made a <hi>whip with ſix ſtrings</hi> to whip many godly people to death. This was in <hi>H. the eighths dayes.</hi> There was a time when the <hi>Parliament of England did ſolemnly upon their knees abiure the Goſpell, and deſire reconciliation with Antichriſt.</hi> This was done in <hi>Q.

And though theſe Lawes were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet how often have we Apoſtatized from God ſince that time? And even at this very day, though there be much <hi>talke of Reformation;</hi> yet (alas) there was never leſſe <hi>practiſe of Reformation.</hi> Our <hi>Churches indeed are Reformed, but our hearts and lives are no whit Reformed. Our high altars are taken down, but our high mindes are not taken down. The worſhip of God is purer, but the worſhippers are as impure as ever. We have no bowing to the name of Jeſus, no bowing to Altars, Images, and Crucifixes. There is leſſe knee-Idolatry; but I feare me, we have as much heart-Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as ever, as much Covetouſneſſe, as much truſting to an Arme of fleſh as ever.</hi> And though our <hi>Idolatry</hi> be leſſe, yet <hi>Adulteries,</hi> and <hi>Fornications,</hi> were never more, I cannot ſay <hi>puniſhed,</hi> but I muſt rather ſay, <hi>Never more committed, and never leſſe puniſhed.</hi> Doe not men boaſt of their adulteries, and yet eſcape unpuniſhed?

It is a mercy, that we are freed from the <hi>tyranny and crueltie of the High Commiſſion, and Star-chamber.</hi> But I am ſure, there is as <hi>much complaint;</hi> I doe not ſay, <hi>as iuſt complaint;</hi> but as <hi>much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, of oppreſſion and iniuſtice</hi> in the <hi>Parliament-Committees in

            <p>We live in times wherein there was never more <hi>iudging of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and never leſſe iudging of our ſelves.</hi> We live in the <hi>ſadeſt dayes</hi> that ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw, and yet what aboundance of <hi>pride</hi> is there in <hi>apparell?</hi> what <hi>luſtfull faſhions,</hi> even in theſe <hi>bloody dayes?</hi> what <hi>ſecuritie</hi> in ſinne, even whileſt the <hi>Ship</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> is <hi>ſinking?</hi> What deadneſſe of heart? What coldneſſe and formality in Gods worſhip? What unthankfulneſſe? what unfruitfulneſſe, &amp;c. Indeed here is much faſting, but little weeping. Never more murmuring, more cenſuring, &amp; never leſſe reforming, then in <hi>theſe dayes,</hi> even <hi>in theſe dayes</hi> of <hi>Reformation.</hi> And ſhall we not weep bitterly before the Lord this day for theſe ſinnes? Theſe are the ſinnes that divide a Nation from <hi>God.</hi> And if <hi>God</hi> once forſake a Nation, it is left in a deſperate condition. For as the Trojans when they loſt their <hi>Palladium,</hi> were preſently vanquiſhed: ſo when a Nation hath loſt Gods favour, it ſinks into ruine irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and preſently.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby Gods Name is exceedingly diſhonoured, and the true Religion ill ſpoken of. Iulian</hi> that curſed Apoſtate, railes againſt the Chriſtians in his dayes, and ſaith of them, <hi>That they lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as ſo many Dogs and Beares, rending and tearing one another:</hi> and addes, Who then would be ſo ſimple as to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?

And I wiſh this might not alſo be verified of our dayes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Hereby the happy Reformation that all good people expect and long for, is much hindered.</hi> For as the building of <hi>Babel</hi> was hindered by the confuſion of Tongues, ſo is the building of <hi>Sion</hi> alſo. For every man drives his owne p ivate way of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> and ſtrives to hinder all other wayes that are oppoſite to his way. It is with us in <hi>England,</hi> as it was with the Suiters in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who becauſe they could not all of them obtaine the <hi>Virgin</hi> they ſued for, agreed to cut her in pieces, and every one to take a <hi>bit</hi> of her.

Iuſt ſo is our condition: For we are here in <hi>London,</hi> and in the Aſſociated Counties, ſhut up as in a Priſon, (for we dare not travell beyond our line) and whileſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123903:11"/>
we are in priſon we draw <hi>partitions</hi> one from another, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from one another, whileſt we are all ſuffering for the ſame cauſe. And this hinders <hi>Reformation</hi> more then all that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie can doe to obſtruct it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hereby the good cauſe we fight for is exceedingly diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</hi> For doe we not heare the enemie boaſting and ſaying, Theſe are the men that cry downe <hi>Prelacy:</hi> you ſee they can agree in nothing but in <hi>Anarchie</hi> and <hi>confuſion!</hi> Are there not many that beginne to grow weary of theſe warres, and cold in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Parliaments moſt juſt cauſe, even for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they know not amongſt ſo many Religions (as they call them) for what Religion they fight?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hereby the enemie is much encouraged.</hi> His hope of conquering is built upon our Diviſions. And therefore he doth as <hi>Medea</hi> did, who when ſhe fled a way with <hi>Iaſon,</hi> and was purſued by her father, tooke her brother <hi>Abſyrtus,</hi> and cut him in pieces, and ſcattered him in the way that ſhe fled in, that ſo her father might be buſied in taking up the ſcattered pieces of his ſonne, and ſhe in the meane time flie ſecurely a way. Even ſo doe our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies labour to cut us in pieces by our diviſions, (for the enemie hath a chiefe ſtroke in our diviſions) that they in the meane time may ſecurely ſtudy our ruine, while we are gathering up our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parties.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Hereby the hearts of people are mightily diſtracted, many are hindered from converſion, and even the godly themſelves have loſt much of the power of godlineſſe in their lives.</hi> I ſay, The hearts of people mightily diſturbed, while one Miniſter preacheth one thing as a truth of the Goſpel, and another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preacheth the quite contrary with as much confidence as the former. And thus, as <hi>Optatus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Inter licet tuum &amp; non licet meum nutant &amp; remigant animae Chriſtianorum.</hi> While one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſaith I, and another ſaith No, the common peoples minds are mightily diſtracted. <hi>And many alſo are hindred from converſion. For who will venture into a ſhip that is toſſed with contrary waves, and ready to ſinke?</hi> And even the godly themſelves are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in the ſtudie and practiſe of faith and repentance, and of the power of godlineſſe. For all their time is ſo much taken up with unneceſſary diſputations, as that they have little leaſure to repent,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123903:12"/>
and to ſtudy to increaſe in holineſſe. <hi>Inter diſputandum religio a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur.</hi> The truth is, <hi>Here is ſo much diſpute about the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in our Churches, as that there is little of Chriſts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in our hearts or houſes. So much diſpute about the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches, as that there were never fewer gathered really to the Church then in theſe our dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>By theſe diviſions godly Miniſters are mightily diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged:</hi> in ſo much as there are many that grow weary of their ſtandings in Gods Church, and beginne to thinke of leaving their places, and of going to live in private, and to ſhut themſelves up in their Studies, (as <hi>Luther</hi> was once counſelled) and to cry, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine miſerere noſtri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Hereby a doore is opened to all kind of Atheiſme:</hi> For doe not our profane men begin to ſay, We know not of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be, and therefore we will be of no Religion. If we hold of ſuch, others will condemne us, and if we hold of them, others alſo will condemne us; and therefore we will rather ſtand Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and profeſſe no Religion at all?</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Hereby God is neceſſitated to prolong our warres:</hi> For all the bloud-thirſtie Cavaliers are but as ſo many Shepherds dogs ſent out by God to gather his ſheep together. Gods people are now as ſheepe ſcattered one from the other to the reproach of Religion, and diſhonour of God; and God hath ſent the enemy as his dog to call them all together, and till this be fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed theſe dogs will not be taken off.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Theſe diviſions open a wide doore to the utter ruine and deſtruction of the Kingdome.</hi> For they bring in <hi>deadly hatred</hi> above the hatred that is cauſed by <hi>Civill diſſentions;</hi> even ſuch a hatred that burſteth aſunder the very bonds of nature it ſelfe, as Chriſt foretels, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>They ſhall kill you, and thinke they doe therein God good ſervice.</hi> What abominable hatred was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Iew</hi> and the <hi>Samaritane;</hi> in ſo much as that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria</hi> wondered that Chriſt would aske a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her that was a <hi>Samaritane?</hi> From this hatred followeth, <hi>Excommunications, Anathematizations,</hi> &amp;c.

This is a worke of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. where it is obſervable that the Apoſtle reckons up ſeven <hi>ſynonymicall</hi> expreſſions to ſet out the greatneſſe of this ſin. The works of the fleſh are <hi>hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, ſedition, envyings; of the which I told you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt, that they which doe ſuch things ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</hi> This ſin alone unrepented on will ſhut a man out of heaven. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>without are dogs. This ſinne alone makes thee unſit to come to the Sacrament,</hi> Mat. 5. 23. <hi>This ſinne alone makes God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre our Faſting-dayes,</hi> Iſa. 58. 4. <hi>Behold, ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, &amp;c. This ſinne alone turnes our prayers into curſes:</hi> For when thou prayeſt unto God, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them that treſpas againſt us,</hi> if thou beeſt in malice and hatred
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:123903:16"/>
with thy brother, thou prayeſt unto God not to forgive thee thy treſpaſſes. Notable is the ſpeech of <hi>Cyprian, Peius eſt ſeindere Eccleſiam quam ſacrificare Idolo, Schiſme</hi> in the Church is a greater ſinne then <hi>Idolatry. Auſtin</hi> ſaith, it is a greater ſinne then <hi>hereſie.</hi> And this (ſaith he) God himſelfe declared when he puniſhed <hi>Corah</hi> and his company that were Schiſmatiques with a greater puniſhment then ever he puniſhed Idolaters or Heretiques: <hi>Quis iam dubitaverit hoc eſſe ſcelaratius commiſſum, quod eſt gravius vindicatum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Conſider the <hi>wofull miſchiefes that are brought into Church and State by theſe our diviſions.</hi> If all the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in the Chriſtian world; If all the <hi>Devils</hi> in hell ſhould joyne together, to deviſe a way to undoe the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the good Cauſe they manage, they could not invent a readier way then by dividing you one from another at this time. This makes you to fight againſt your ſelves, to murder your ſelves; your Cauſe, your Religion, and to murder all that adhere unto you. Hereby God is diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Reformation hindered, Religion diſcredited, the good Cauſe diſliked, the Enemie ſtrengthened; You are weakened, your Counſels diſturbed, the Warre prolonged, the Power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe abated, &amp;c. as hath beene formerly mentioned. Hereby we are all <hi>tantum non,</hi> deſtroyed, and deſtroyed we muſt be if our breaches be not made up. <hi>For if we bite and devoure one another, we ſhall be conſumed one of another,</hi> Gal. 5. 15. Famous is the Story <note place="margin">Liv. Decad. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> who, when the people of Rome had divided themſelver from the <hi>Senate of Rome,</hi> came to the people and told them an Apologue of the members of the body, how they did once conſpire together againſt the <hi>belly,</hi> becauſe that the belly did live idlely, &amp; devoure all the meat that the hands did work forand feet walke for, &amp;c. And therefore they agreed together to ſtarve the belly. The hands refuſed to work for to feed it; the mouth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take in meat; the feet refuſed to goe to fetch it, &amp;c. But within a very little while the members of the body ſaw their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for the feet began to grow feeble and unable to walke; the hands grew weake; the whole man ſick: and then they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the belly was not idle; but that it conveyed the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it received to every part of the body: and hereupon they all agreed to joyne together to provide for the belly as well as for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123903:16"/>
themſelves. This Fable reconciled the people, and Senators of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Fable teacheth us, <hi>That diviſions in the body naturall, and ſo alſo in the body politique, are ruinating and deſtructive to the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is, All the hope the <hi>enemy</hi> hath, is in our <hi>diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> herein he boaſteth, and glorieth: There is nothing that ſtrengthens their deſignes at <hi>Oxford</hi> ſo much: nothing that puts ſo much courage and reſolution into the hearts of our Adverſaries, as the Diviſions that are amongſt us.</p>
            <p>This is the argument <hi>Melancton</hi> uſed to perſwade the divided <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of his time to peace and unity; and he illuſtrateth his argument by a notable parable of the <hi>Wolves</hi> and the <hi>Dogs,</hi> who were marching on-ward to fight one againſt another. The <hi>Wolves</hi> that they might know the ſtrength of their adverſary, ſent forth a <hi>Maſter-Wolfe</hi> as their <hi>Scout:</hi> The <hi>Scout</hi> returnes and tels the <hi>Wolves,</hi> That indeed the <hi>Dogs</hi> were more in number, but yet they ſhould not be diſcouraged: For he obſerved, That the <hi>Dogs</hi> were not one like another; a few <hi>maſtives</hi> there were; but the moſt were little <hi>curres,</hi> which could onely barke but not bite, and would be afraid of their owne ſhadow. Another thing alſo he obſerved which ſhould much encourage them, and that was, That the <hi>Dogs</hi> did march as if they were more <hi>offended with themſelves then with us;</hi> not keeping their ranks, but grinning, and ſnarling, and biting; and <hi>ſometimes tearing each other, as if they would ſave us a labour.</hi> And therefore let us march on reſolutely, for <hi>our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> are their <hi>owne enemies;</hi> enemies to themſelves, and their owne peace; they bite and devoure each other, and therefore we ſhall certainly devoure them. I need not make any Application of this Parable. There is nothing that more <hi>heartens our enemies, and diſheartens our friends, then our Diviſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Conſider the great happineſſe that would accrue to Church and State, if we were united together againſt the Common Enemy.</hi> If all the <hi>Saints upon earth,</hi> and <hi>Angels in heaven</hi> ſhould ſtudy to find out a way to ſave <hi>England</hi> from ruine, they could not find out a readier way, then by uniting us together at this time. <hi>England</hi> is an Iland divided from all the world; and if it were not divided within it ſelfe, it need not feare all the world. If <hi>London</hi> were as a City at unity within it ſelfe, what could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:123903:17"/>
it? Did we all doe as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>They all aroſe as one man,</hi> &amp;c. and as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 23. 12. how quickly would theſe wars (through Gods bleſſing) be at end? What an honour would it be to the Cauſe we fight for; to the Reformation we pray for; the Religion we profeſſe; to the God we worſhip, if we did with united ſtrength purſue theſe things? How ſhould we ſupport and helpe one another, <hi>et portantem portare,</hi> as the <hi>Cranes</hi> do one another in the manner of their flying. I muſt not here forget to mind you of that known ſtory of <hi>Scillurus</hi> that had eighty ſonnes, and when he was dying he called them all before him, and preſented them with a bundle of ſpeares, and bad them try whether they could breake that bundle; and they tryed, but were not able. Afterwards he puls out one javelin out of the bundle, and bade them break that, which they eaſily did; and ſo a ſecond, and a third, till they had broken them all. Intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that unity in Families, and compacted ſtrength is the bond that preſerves the whole Family; and whereſoever this bond is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that Family is quickly deſtroyed. The like ſtory doth <hi>Saluſt</hi> tell of one <hi>Micypſa,</hi> who when he was dying called his ſonnes and cauſed them to write this ſentence in <hi>Golden</hi> letters: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ parvae res creſcunt, diſcordiâ magnae dilabuntur.</hi> Oh that God would give us hearts to ſpiritualize theſe ſtories!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider the late <hi>Nationall Covenant</hi> you have taken, wherein you have lifted up your hands to the moſt <hi>High God,</hi> and have ſworne to ſtudy unitie and conformitie in Religion, &amp;c. And to endeavour according to your places, to extirpate Hereſie, Schiſme, &amp;c. I know not how it is come to paſſe, but ſure I am, our diviſions are greater ſince we took this Covenant then before. And ſure I am that God will call us to a ſtrict account for this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinne of <hi>Periurie.</hi> And if ever <hi>England</hi> periſh by theſe wars, this ſhall be <hi>Englands Motto: Here lyeth a Nation that hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Covenant with God, and therefore is this great evill come upon her.</hi> And therefore I beſeech you, be mindfull of your Covenant; and remember it is not the taking, but the keeping of Covenant that prevailes with God. And if he ſhall be ſhut out of heaven that <hi>keepes not his promiſe, though it be to his hurt,</hi> Pſal. 15. 4. much more he that keeps not <hi>his oath, when it is for his good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conſider further, That our <hi>enemies that fight againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123903:17"/>
us agree together: Herod and Pilate</hi> are made friends, and joyne together to put Chriſt to death. The <hi>Herodians and the Phariſees,</hi> though diſſenting one from another, yet both agree againſt Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 13. The <hi>Herodians</hi> were <hi>Courtiers,</hi> and ſought to bring in <hi>Tyranny;</hi> the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were <hi>popular,</hi> and ſought to maintaine the peoples <hi>liberties;</hi> and yet they both joyned together againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> thus did the <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> alſo. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 18. The <hi>Epicures</hi> and <hi>Stoiques</hi> combine againſt <hi>Paul.</hi> Shall <hi>Iudas</hi> conſpire with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> to betray Chriſt? and ſhall the Diſciples of Chriſt fall out amongſt themſelves? Shall <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> divide one from another? God forbid! Shall the <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> the <hi>Oxford Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops:</hi> The Proteſtants at large, and the ſeduced people all agree together like <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes with fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands at their tayles to burne three Kingdomes? And ſhall not we agree together to ſave three Kingdomes? Shall the Lions, Bearee, Tygers, Wolves, Lambes and Sheepe, &amp;c. that were ſhut up in the Arke, agree together while they were in the Arke? (for we doe not read that they did hurt one another all that while) And ſhall not we that are ſhut up here, in <hi>London,</hi> and in a few aſſociated Counties as in an <hi>Arke,</hi> agree together to preſerve one another from a Deluge of Waters that is drowning us all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we ſhould differ in ſome few things one from another?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Conſider the very <hi>Heathen how carefull they have beene to maintaine unitie and peace in times of publique danger,</hi> and how carefull to lay aſide all private quarrels. I will inſtance onely in the ſpeech of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> to <hi>Themiſtocles. Plutarch</hi> tels us, that from their very childhoods they did differ one from the other, and never could agree. But when a common enemy came againſt them, then <hi>Ariſtides</hi> comes by night to <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and ſaith unto him, <hi>Si ſapimus, omiſſâ tandem iuvenili et inani concertatione, contentionem de ſervanda Graecia ſalubrem honeſtam<expan>
                     <am>

                  </expan> ſuſcipiamus, &amp;c. Let us leave all youthly contentions, and tend unanimouſly to the publique good.</hi> Oh that this counſell might take impreſſion in the hearts of us Chriſtians at this time.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Conſider further, how that the very <hi>Devils in hell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to promote their owne kingdome.</hi> If <hi>Satan</hi> be divided againſt <hi>Satan</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) how can his Kngdome ſtand? And my Text
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123903:18"/>
is brought (as I have ſaid) as an argument to prove that Chriſt did not caſt out Devils by the power of <hi>Belzebub,</hi> becauſe then Satan ſhould be divided againſt himſelfe, and ſeeke his own ruine which he will never doe. There is peace amongſt the Devils in hell. And certainly there cannot be better Muſicke to the Divels in hell, then to ſee the <hi>Parliament</hi> divided againſt it ſelfe; and the <hi>City</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt it ſelfe; and the <hi>Godly Miniſters</hi> divided againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at ſuch a time as this is.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, and eſpecially, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt</hi> who is the <hi>Great Peacemaker,</hi> who came into the world when all the world was at <hi>peace;</hi> at whoſe birth the <hi>Angels</hi> ſang, <hi>Glory to God on high, and in earth peace:</hi> who when he was dying left a <hi>Legaſie</hi> of peace to his people, and gave his Diſciples a <hi>New Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to <hi>love one another:</hi> (which was therefore called a <hi>New Commandement,</hi> becauſe it was inforced with a new example; even the example of Chriſts love to us) Who when he made that admirable Prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. the chiefe part of it was, that <hi>God would make his children one, as he and the Father were one.</hi> And he gives the reaſon of it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>That the world may beleeve that then haſt ſent me.</hi> The world will not beleeve in <hi>Chriſt</hi> when they ſee <hi>Chriſtians</hi> diſagree. <hi>Nothing hinders men from beleeving in Chriſt more then the differences and diviſions of thoſe that doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt.</hi> It is an excellent obſervation of <hi>Athanaſius:</hi> That the very manner of Chriſts death doth preach the Doctrine of Vnitie and love to Chriſtians. For <hi>Chriſt was not ſawen aſunder as the Prophet Iſaiah was.</hi> He was not <hi>beheaded as Iohn Baptiſt was.</hi> There was not a <hi>bone of his broken,</hi> nor any whit of his <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rent or torne.</hi> And all this to teach Chriſtians (ſaith he) to be at unitie within themſelves. Was not a <hi>bone of Chriſt broken upon the Croſſe, and ſhall all his members breake in pieces now he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Was his garment kept whole, and ſhall his body be rent and torne in pieces?</hi> This is <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument to perſwade the divided <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Peace and Vnitie, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Is Chriſt divided? And why are Chriſtians divided if Chriſt were not divided?</hi> Why doth one ſay, <hi>I am of Paul;</hi> another, <hi>I am of Apollo;</hi> another, <hi>I am of Cephas,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore if you be Chriſtians live in love and unitie, as the Diſciples of Ieſus Chriſt, that ſo the world may beleeve in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:123903:18"/>
Oh that theſe <hi>Motives</hi> might take deepe rooting in your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: And that every one in his place would labour after Peace and Vnitie. That you that are Magiſtrates and Iuſtices, would <hi>bind your ſelves to the peace!</hi> It is no diſcredit in this ſenſe to be <hi>bound to the peace.</hi> You are called <hi>Iuſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> not becauſe you ſhould hold your peace when God would have you to ſpeake; but becauſe it is your dutie to make peace, and to keep peace. Let all <hi>godly Miniſters</hi> preach up the duty of <hi>brotherly love,</hi> which is quite forgotten amongſt moſt Chriſtians. It is a dutie quite <hi>dead and buried;</hi> let us labour that it may have a ſpeedy <hi>reſurrection.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>As touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you</hi> &amp;c. But we Miniſters, now a dayes, need to write and preach of no duty more then this. And then let all Miniſters and people, <hi>Pray for the peace of Ieruſalem,</hi> and give the Lord no reſt untill he make <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland, a praiſe in the earth.</hi> Let us pray for peace, and fight for peace, and contribute our money willingly for a peace. For indeed, all our fighting, and all our vaſt expences, are but as wayes and meanes to a ſafe and well grounded peace. <hi>Let us fight for peace, with peace one towards another.</hi> And let us not complaine and murmur at the greatneſſe of our contributions; but remember the ſtory of the old covetous Miſer that hung himſelfe to ſave charges; and his man comming in unawares and ſeeing his Maſter a hanging, cut the rope in pieces and thereby ſaved his Maſters life. The Maſter being recovered, inſtead of thanking his man, fell a chiding of him becauſe he cut the rope in pieces, and ſo did put him to the charges of a new rope: whereas he ſhould rather have untied it, then cut it. This man, you will ſay, did little deſerve to have his life ſaved. Iuſt ſuch is our condition. Our cruell enemies are ready to devoure and deſtroy us. All that the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth, is to cut the rope in pieces with which they would hang us. And if we be put to more then ordinary charge, let us not grumble at thoſe expences which are <hi>the preſervation of our lives. That man is unworthy to live, that murmurs to lay out a little money to ſave his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I muſt put in three Caveats, &amp; beſeech you <hi>in the firſt place,</hi> to remember that when I ſpeake ſo much for unity, I would alſo have you to remember that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num &amp; verum convertuntur.</hi> That <hi>unity</hi> without <hi>veriy,</hi> is not a <hi>true peace,</hi> but a <hi>conſpiracy. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:123903:19"/>
concordia in veritate. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity ioyned with falſhood is execrable adulterie,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian.</hi> When unitie and falſhood are married together, it is no <hi>lawfull marriage,</hi> but <hi>execrable adultery.</hi> If I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have peace with men, but I muſt loſe my peace with God; farewell peace with men that I may keep my peace with God. One great reaſon why we have ſo little peace upon earth, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſeek after it more then after the glory of God in heaven.</p>
            <p>You will muſt remember <hi>in the ſecond place,</hi> that this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> that we muſt labour after, muſt be in a <hi>Scripture way.</hi> The <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for Vnity ſake, and to prevent Schiſmes, ſet up one <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> as a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to rule over the reſt with <hi>Maiority</hi> of power in Iuriſdiction and Ordination. But this at beſt was but a <hi>humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> and it proved an increaſer of Schiſme and Diviſion. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſet up the <hi>Pope</hi> to preſerve unitie: But he is the <hi>greateſt Apple</hi> of ſtrife the Chriſtian world hath. It will be our care to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to promote a <hi>unitie</hi> in ſuch a <hi>way</hi> which the Scriptures hold forth, and this will proſper.</p>
            <p>You muſt alſo remember <hi>in the third place,</hi> that our <hi>unitie, peace, and love,</hi> as it muſt be <hi>in the truth,</hi> ſo it muſt be <hi>in truth.</hi> It muſt be cordiall and reall. Oh, that I could once ſee all Gods people <hi>of one lip,</hi> as it was before the confuſion of Tongues, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 1. That this might be the Motto of Gods people in <hi>England: Cor unum, via una,</hi> One heart, and one way. That they that ſhall ſing one and the ſame Song in heaven, may agree in the ſame way of worſhip here upon earth. Excellent was that ſpeech of <hi>Grynaeus,</hi> when he was dying: I am now going (ſaid he) to a place (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heaven) <hi>ubi Lutherus Calvino bene convenit:</hi> where <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> agree well together. Shall we agree well in heaven, and ſhall we not agree together upon earth? God forbid. Let us alwaies remember that ſpeech of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his brethren when they were going home to their Father, <hi>Gen</hi> 45. 29. <hi>See that you fall not out by the way.</hi> We are all <hi>pilgrims,</hi> travelling towards our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> to one and the ſame <hi>God and Father.</hi> Oh let us not fall out by the way. And let the two Arguments that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> uſed to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13. 7, 8. mightily prevaile with us, to make us more ambitious of unitie, peace, and concord, then ever yet we have beene. <hi>Let there be no ſtrife betweene me and thee, &amp;c. for we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123903:19"/>
are brethren, and the Canaanite is in the Land.</hi> Theſe are two gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den allurements: the Lord make them effectuall! I had almoſt forgotten <hi>Davids</hi> Arguments in the 133. <hi>Pſalme. Behold, how good and how pleaſant it is, for brethren to live together in unitie.</hi> The word <hi>Behold,</hi> is prefixt that ſo the commendation might take the deeper impreſſion. Many things are <hi>good</hi> which are not <hi>pleaſant,</hi> and many things <hi>pleaſant,</hi> which are not <hi>good;</hi> but it is both good and pleaſant for brethren to dwell together in unitie. It is like <hi>Aarons</hi> precious oyntment <hi>that went downe to the skirts of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c. It is a communicative mercy that perfumeth whole Kingdomes with bleſſings. It is like the <hi>dew of Hermon,</hi> &amp;c. It makes barren Lands fruitfull. <hi>It is like the dew upon the mountaines of Sion, where the Lord commanded the bleſsing, even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

            <p>It is with us in <hi>England,</hi> as it was with the women that went early in the morning to the Sepulchre, and there they found a great ſtone, and they ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall roll away this ſtone? for it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great.</hi> Mar. 16. 3, 4. <hi>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled backe the ſtone from the doore, and ſate upon it.</hi> This is our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Let us goe to God by prayer, and ſay. <hi>Oh our God, we have no might againſt this great company that cometh againſt us. We have no ſtrength to heale our Diviſions in the Church, and in the State, they are ſo great and ſo many. We know not what to doe, but our eyes are upon thee. Thou that didſt find out a way hid from ages and generations,</hi> Col. 1. 26. <hi>A way hid from Angels and Archangels, hid within thy ſelfe,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 9. <hi>To ſave poore undone, fallen, loſt man, even by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Oh find out a way to reconcile <hi>King and Parliament, to unite thy divided people in the truth!</hi> Oh bleſſed <hi>Ieſu that cameſt into the world to breake downe the middle wall of partition betweene Iew and Gentile;</hi> that art the great Peace-maker, <hi>make up our wide and great breaches, and take away the many wals of partition that divide us one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> After this manner we muſt wraſtle with God in prayer, and watch thereunto with all perſeverance.</p>
            <p>But beſides this generall helpe by Prayer; give me leave to name a few other which are more particular.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Helpe.</note> Firſt, <hi>Let us labour to make our peace with God, and God will make us at peace one with another. Tranquillus Deus tranquillut omnia.</hi> If God be at peace with thee, he will make the very ſtones in the ſtreet to be at peace with thee; he will make peace flow downe like a river, and like a mighty ſtreame. <hi>When a mans wayes pleaſe God, he will even make his enemies to be at peace with him, Prov.</hi> 16. 7. You ſhall finde in Scripture, that when <hi>a Church, State, or perſon divided it ſelfe from God by ſinne, God ſuffered it as a puniſhment to be divided from it ſelfe by faction.</hi> Aſſoone as ever <hi>Solomon</hi> had forſaken God by Idolatry, God preſently divided his Kingdome from him. And God threateneth <hi>Ierem.</hi> 13. 13. That becauſe his people had forſaken him, that therefore he would <hi>fill the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem with drunkenneſſe, and he would daſh them one againſt another, even the fathers and the ſonnes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would not pity,</hi> &amp;c. You ſhall find alſo that <hi>when a King and Kingdome returned to God, then they had peace, and flouriſhed in all outward happineſſe,</hi> 2 Chron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 19. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 3, 5, 6. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore if ever you would cure <hi>Englands</hi> diſtractions to purpoſe; ſtrike at the root and cauſe of our diviſions. Let us labour to find out all thoſe ſinnes that ſeparate between us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:123903:20"/>
and God; And when you have found them out, you muſt not deale with them as the <hi>Parliament</hi> doth with their priſoners which they take, uſing them more kindly and courteouſly then they were uſed before they were priſoners: nor as <hi>David</hi> would have his ſonne <hi>Abſolom,</hi> concerning whom he gave a ſtrict charge, that they ſhould uſe him kindly for his ſake: but you muſt doe as the <hi>Oxford</hi> men doe with our priſoners, uſe them cruelly. Doe as <hi>Ioſhua</hi> did with the five Kings whom firſt he kept up cloſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in a Cave, and afterwards ſent for them, and trod upon their necks, and hung them up before the Lord. Thus muſt we deale with our ſinnes, and then we ſhall have peace. <hi>For as the lines in a circumference that are drawne to the Center, the neerer they are to the Center, the neerer they are one to another: So the neerer any men come to God in ſimilitude and likeneſſe, the neerer they will be ioyned one to another in unitie and love.</hi> For if any may ſay he loveth God and hateth his brother, he is a lier. For he that loveth not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom he hath ſeene, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeene? And this Commandement have we from him, that he that loveth God, love his brother alſo, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed of the Land-deſtroying Opinion of thoſe that plead for an <hi>illimited toleration of all Religions, even of Turkiſme, Iudaiſme,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord keepe us from being poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch an Error! This Text riſeth up againſt it. For it will <hi>divide a Kingdome againſt it ſelfe.</hi> It will rend it into a thouſand pieces. It it a <hi>Doctrine directly contrary to your late Oath and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. A Doctrine that overthroweth all Church-Government, bringeth in confuſion,</hi> and openeth a wide doore unto all <hi>irreligion and Atheiſms. For at the ſame doore tha all falſe religious come in, the true Religion will quickly get out.</hi> And if it be as good for a man to live where <hi>nothing is lawfull,</hi> as where <hi>all things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> ſurely it is every way as uncomfortable to live where there are all <hi>Religions,</hi> as where there is <hi>no Religion</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To heale our Diviſions, we muſt labour to be <hi>cloathed</hi> with the <hi>garment of humility:</hi> For <hi>onely by pride</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) <hi>cometh contention,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. Now there is a double hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie we muſt be cloathed withall; <hi>humilitie of iudgement,</hi> and <hi>humilitie of heart.</hi> Firſt, <hi>humilitie of iudgement,</hi> to thinke that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may know the truth as well as our ſelves; to have a low
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:123903:21"/>
eſteeme of our owne underſtanding: <hi>For he that thinketh he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 2. <hi>And if any man teach otherwiſe,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. 9. <hi>He is proud knowing nothing,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore let us not be <hi>wiſe in our owne eyes, nor leane to our owne underſtandings, Prov.</hi> 3. 5. 4. Secondly, humilitie of heart. An humble heart is a peaceable quiet heart. An humble heart will be ſenſible of the leaſt ſinne, much more of this great ſinne to diſtract and deſtroy the peace of three Kingdomes by unneceſſary diſputations.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Labour for <hi>grace to contemne the world and all worldly things.</hi> For many times diviſions ariſe out of baſe Covetouſneſſe. It was the love of the world that divided <hi>Demas</hi> from <hi>Paul.</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. That a Miniſter muſt not be <hi>gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of filthy lucre;</hi> and as if that were not ſufficient; he addes <hi>nor covetous.</hi> And therefore if you would live in unitie and peace; <hi>Take heed and beware of covetouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Pray for the <hi>ſpirit of meekneſſe, patience, long-ſufferance; and for mortified affections.</hi> It is one of the Ingredients required in a Miniſter, that he ſhould be one <hi>That is not ſoone angry,</hi> Titus 1. 7. and one that is <hi>patient, no ſtriker, no brawler,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 3 Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Patience, and Mortification, are neceſſary Ingredients into that <hi>Medicine</hi> that muſt cure our <hi>divided Kingdome. For an angry man ſtirreth up ſtrife, and a furious man aboundeth in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions.</hi> Prov. 29. 22. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmortified affections</hi> are the cauſe of much diſturbance in Families and Cities. And therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 50. <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and have peace one with another.</hi> This <hi>ſalt</hi> is the <hi>ſalt of Mortification.</hi> We muſt labour to have our anger mortified; our love of the world mortified; our pride mortified; and this will be a notable meanes to make us at peace one with another. As in the <hi>Old Law,</hi> every ſacrifice was to be ſeaſoned with <hi>ſalt:</hi> So let every man pray for This <hi>ſalt</hi> within himſelfe to ſeaſon his unmortified affections, and this will keepe him from <hi>putrifying</hi> in malice, envie, hatred, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Let all thy private aimes be ſwallowed up in the publique good.</hi> Let the Cauſe of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> be dearer to thee then thine owne life; and this frame of ſpirit will exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline thee to all lawfull waies of peace and unitie. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Old Ely,</hi> and <hi>how his heart</hi> trembled for <hi>the Arke of God,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:123903:21"/>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 13. 18. He trembled not for the thought of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but for the Arke; and aſſoone as ever mention was made of the taking of the Arke, he fell downe and brake his necke: he was not troubled at the mention of the death of his two ſonnes, &amp;c. The like we read of his daughter in law, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 19, 10, 21, 22. The like of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> who was in great proſperitie himſelfe, and yet how was he diſtreſſed in ſpirit for the miſeries of <hi>Ieruſalem, Nehem.</hi> 1. 4. The like we read of <hi>Daniel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>We muſt nip Diviſions in the bud,</hi> and quench the fire of Contention at the beginning. That fire is eaſily quenched at firſt, which when it hath once taken poſſeſſion is not to be quenched. The Lord grant it be not laid to our charge, that we have ſuffered <hi>Englands</hi> diſtractions to grow to ſuch a height, and have not laboured in our ſeverall places to compoſe and quiet them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> Let us yeeld one to another for peace ſake. <hi>Famous is the example of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and worthy of all imitation, who yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his right up to</hi> Lot, <hi>who was his younger and inferiour, for peace ſake,</hi> Gen. <hi>13. 9.</hi> If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will goe to the right; or if thou departeſt to the right hand, then I will goe to the left.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Take heed of groundleſſe iealouſies and ſuſpicious one of another.</hi> This is <hi>Englands</hi> great ſinne, and the chiefe cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtempers amongſt us. We are like unto the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> who when they came firſt out of <hi>Egypt</hi> did almoſt deifie <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> But afterward, aſſoone as ever they began to meete with ſtraights and difficulties, they began preſently to murmur againſt them, and to call their fidelitie into queſtion; and to accuſe them, as if they had a deſigne to bring them into the Wilderneſſe to deſtroy them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 2, 3. Iuſt ſo doe we. When our Armies for our ſinnes are juſtly puniſhed with ill ſucceſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reflecting upon our ſinnes, to be troubled for them; we fall a murmuring againſt our Chiefe Commanders, and queſtion their fidelitie; as if they had a deſigne to betray us into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hand. I doe not ſpeake this as if I would countenance any Commander that is guilty; or hinder juſt complaints of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after thoſe that are guilty; or the uſe of juſt meanes to be rid of ſuch. But all that I ſay is: That to faſten <hi>uniuſt ſuſpitions,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:123903:22"/>
and <hi>groundleſſe iealouſies,</hi> upon thoſe that venture their lives and eſtates in the common cauſe, is to be guilty of Robbery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: it is to ſteale away and murder their <hi>good names,</hi> which is as precious as life it ſelfe: and it is a ſinne that God will not pardon unleſſe the party that is guilty endeavour to make <hi>reſtitution</hi> of his good name, which is a worke not eaſie to be done. <hi>For a mans good name is like a white piece of paper, which if once blotted it will be hard to wipe out that blot ſo as to leave no print of it behind. A mans good name is like a Merchants eſtate which is long in getting, but is loſt in a minute:</hi> and when it is loſt in the bottome of the Sea, how ſhall it ever be recovered againe? So is a mans good name. But yet God will accept of our endevours to make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution if faithfull and induſtrious.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, To heale our Diviſions, we muſt make conſcience to <hi>ſilence all our private Opinions, and differences. Haſt thou faith?</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22.) <hi>have it to thy ſelfe before God.</hi> Doe not diſturbe the Church of God at this time with thy private faith. Indeed if it be a matter abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, it is charitie to acquaint the Church of God with it: but if we can be ſaved without it, this is not a fit time to broach any new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gehezi,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Is this a time to receive money?</hi> &amp;c. So ſay I: Is this a time to trouble <hi>England</hi> with New Opinions? <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> tels us of certaine men that were in a Ship ready to periſh by reaſon of a great Tempeſt, &amp; one of them being a Philoſopher, fell a asking of many trifling Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: to whom they anſwered: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; We are periſhing, and doſt thou trifle? So ſay I; <hi>Is England a periſhing, and is this a time to trouble it with unneceſſary diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> I doubt not but there will a time come wherein every mans owne opinion ſhall be heard: but this is a time wherein we ſhould all unite againſt the Common Enemy that ſeekes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure us all. For my part, I doe here openly profeſſe, That if I had an opinion diſagreeing from that way of Reformation which is likely to be ſet up, and did ſee that the publiſhing of it would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the peace of the Kingdome, I would doe with it as the Mariners did with <hi>Ionah, I would caſt it into the ſea rather then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Tempeſt by my opinion; eſpecially at ſuch a time as this is.</hi> And I doubt not but every honeſt man will do the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:123903:22"/>
Laſtly, It is your <hi>dutie (Right Honourable)</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath betruſted with great power, to ſuppreſſe theſe diviſions and differences in <hi>Religion</hi> by your <hi>Civill Authoritie,</hi> as farre as you are able, leſt you be <hi>acceſſary</hi> unto them. For God hath made you <hi>Cuſtodes utriuſque tabulae,</hi> Keepers not of the ſecond Table one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as ſome fondly imagine) but of the firſt Table alſo, and not onely Keepers, but <hi>Vindices utriuſ<expan>

                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Tabulae,</hi> Puniſhers alſo of thoſe that tranſgreſſe againſt either of them. For you are the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God for good,</hi> and <hi>Revengers to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi> Rom. 13. 4. And God hath deputed you for the <hi>puniſhment of evill doers, and for the praiſe of them that doe well.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 19. There are ſome that would <hi>blot out halfe your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> and reſtraine this <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>evill</hi> to civill good and to evils onely againſt men. But this is againſt that generall Rule, <hi>Non eſt diſtinguendum ubi lex non diſtinguit.</hi> Where the Law doth not diſtinguiſh, there muſt not we diſtinguiſh. Tell me I beſeech you, <hi>Shall it be lawfull for Magiſtrates to puniſh thoſe that deſtroy mens bodies, but not thoſe that deſtroy mens ſoules?</hi> Shall they be blamed for <hi>ſuffering</hi> men to draw people away from <hi>obedience</hi> to the Laws of the Land and to themſelves, and not alſo for <hi>ſuffering men to draw away people from the truth of the Goſpel,</hi> and from the wayes of God, ſuch as <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who <hi>overthrow the faith of ſome, and their words eate as a Canker?</hi> Shall Chriſtian Magiſtrates take up the Maxime of <hi>Tiberius, Deorum iniurias Diis curae eſſe?</hi> Let God himſelfe take care to vindicate himſelfe from injuries committed againſt God? As for me, I will (juſt like <hi>Gallio)</hi> take care of none of theſe things. Can Chriſtian eares endure ſuch language? Doth not God prophecy, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49. 23. That in the New Teſtament <hi>Kings ſhall be our nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Queenes our nurſing Mothers?</hi> And how can a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate diſcharge that dutie aright if he hath not power from God to puniſh thoſe that would poyſon the ſoules of his <hi>weake children</hi> with hereſies, and ſoul-deſtroying opinions? I do not deny, but that there is great wiſdome to be obſerved by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in diſtinguiſhing between <hi>perſons and perſons,</hi> betweene <hi>errors and errors.</hi> Some <hi>perſons</hi> are pious and peaceable, others turbulent and furious. Some errors are ſuch, as <hi>ſubvert the faith, and deſtroy the power of Godlineſſe:</hi> others are of a leſſer nature,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:123903:23"/>
which may conſiſt with the power of Godlineſſe, and with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the faith. But that which I now ſpeake againſt, is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded <note place="margin">Bloody Tenent. The Good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan. John Baptiſt.</note>libertie that is pleaded for in divers books lately written, which hold forth this prodigious Tenent. <hi>That every man is to be ſuffered to have the libertie of his conſcience, be it never ſo Hereticall or Idolatricall.</hi> This overthroweth all the power of the Magiſtrate in puniſhing hereſie, blaſphemy, Idolatry, and is contrary to many plaine Texts of the <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 13. 2 Chro. 34. 32. Ezra 10. 8. Deut. 13. 5, 6. 2 King. 23. 1.</note>Old Teſtament, and to thoſe of the New Teſtament above mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Will you allow the Magiſtrate to Tyrannize over mens conſciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By no meanes. But I beleeve it is the Dutie of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to keepe men from infecting their Subjects with ſoule-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying errors. If thou haſt an Hereticall opinion, have it to thy ſelfe, and the Magiſtrate will not; nay, cannot meddle with thy private conſcience. But if thou laboureſt to infect others with thy grace-deſtroying opinions. I doubt not but the Magiſtrate is bound to keepe thee from ſpreading thy infection to the undoing of the ſouls of his Subjects. If he may lawfully ſhut up a man that hath the plague upon his body, that he may not infect others, why not a man that hath the plague of Hereſie upon his ſoule, that ſo he may not deſtroy the ſoules of thouſands? Shall a <hi>Maſter</hi> in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily have power to put away a <hi>ſervant</hi> that is tainted with a groſſe opinion, and yet not be called a <hi>Tyrant</hi> over that <hi>ſervants conſcience?</hi> And ſhall not the <hi>Chiefe Magiſtrate</hi> of a <hi>Kingdome</hi> have power to <hi>put out of his Kingdome</hi> (at leaſt to ſhut up from doing hurt) one that is his <hi>ſubiect</hi> and polluted with blaſphemous hereticall Idololatricall opinions? <hi>Is not the Kingdome the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Houſe and Family?</hi> But enough of this.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the meanes that are to be uſed to cure the miſerable diſtractions of <hi>England.</hi> The Lord give us grace to put them in practiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 4.</note> There is one Vſe more yet behind, and that is an <hi>Vſe of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to the people of God. Notwithſtanding, all the Diviſions and Diſtractions that are in the Kingdome. This is an Alablaſter boxe full of precious oyntment, and it conſiſts of foure particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Remember for your Comfort that there was never any great Reformation brought in by Godinto a Kingdome, but it hath alwaies
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:123903:23"/>
been attended with diviſions and differences in Religion.</hi> In <hi>Luthers Reformation,</hi> How great were the differences between him and <hi>Calvin;</hi> Inſomuch, as the <hi>Reformation</hi> was more hindred by their Diviſions, then by the power and policy of the Enemy, and yet notwithſtanding, God carryed on the Worke of Reformation maugre theſe diviſions. In the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> many and great were the Diviſions of the Church and of the Miniſters thereof; Inſomuch, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, that in his time there were <hi>ſixe hundred errors</hi> in the Church; and in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſo many, that they brought <hi>bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi> of <hi>petitions</hi> one againſt another, which the <hi>Emperour</hi> out of his wonderfull deſire of Peace would not ſo much as read, but burnt them all before their faces. How ſad was the diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and yet God turned it to a good effect. For by that meanes the Goſpel was the more ſpread throughout the world! And therefore let us not be over-diſcouraged. For theſe Diviſions are no new things, and therefore no ſtrange things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider for your comfort, <hi>Magna veritas et praevalebit.</hi> Truth is a beame of God, the purchaſe of Ieſus Chriſt, and it ſhall prevaile at laſt. Though our diviſions and diſtractions do much weaken us and prorogue our ſettlement, yet notwithſtanding the Cauſe we manage is Gods Cauſe, and it ſhall prevaile at laſt. As Chriſt Ieſus roſe from the grave in ſpight of the <hi>Iewes</hi> that rolled a great ſtone before the doore of the Sepulchre to hinder him. So the Cauſe of Chriſt, and the worſhip and government of Chriſt ſhall riſe and flouriſh: and there will come a time wherein the Church of God ſhall be glorious here upon earth; and the Motto of it ſhall be <hi>Cor unum, via una.</hi> One heart, one way. This will come to paſſe in ſpight of our Diviſions. For God hath promiſed it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 39. <hi>Zeph</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>The third Comfort is: That <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall downe though he be never ſo firmely united. The <hi>Kingdome</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed though <hi>Satan</hi> joyne with <hi>Satan.</hi> And though <hi>Satan</hi> will not caſt out Satan, but is ſtrongly compacted, and as a Citie at unitie within it ſelfe, yet God will caſt out <hi>Satan</hi> at <hi>laſt,</hi> and his kingdome ſhall periſh. Though Turke and Pope; though French and Spaniard; though the Iriſh Rebels, and Engliſh Papiſts and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:123903:24"/>
Proteſtants at large ſhould joyn hand in hand &amp; conſpire together to overthrow the little flock of Ieſus Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding they doe but <hi>kick againſt pricks.</hi> Antichriſt is fallen, and the poore flock of Chriſt ſhall be as a <hi>burdenſome ſtone unto all people; all that burden themſelves with it ſhall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together againſt it,</hi> Zach. 12. 3. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes <hi>unitie</hi> a ſigne of a true <hi>Church.</hi> But then there ſhould be a true Church amongſt the Devils; for where he dwels there is peace. And yet the Papiſts cannot boaſt much of their <hi>unitie.</hi> For they have their different Sects oppoſite one to another, and the Ieſuite to them all. Vnitie without verity is a ſigne of the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Church, but not of the Church of Chriſt. And unitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out veritie, ſhall not uphold a State. <hi>For though hand ioyne in hand the wicked ſhall not be unpuniſhed,</hi> Prov. 11. 21.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Remember in what ſtate and condition the people of the Iewes were in when Chriſt came into the world.</hi> It was when the <hi>government</hi> was departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome</hi> given to a <hi>ſtranger;</hi> when the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> (which was their Parliament) was deſtroyed; and they themſelves brought into perfect ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Their condition was never ſo bad as at that time. And alſo they never had more Sects and Diviſions then when Chriſt was borne: There were in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the <hi>Herodians,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> There were alſo the <hi>Eſſeni,</hi> (though the Goſpel makes no mention of them.) In this ſad juncture of time <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> was borne. Oh what abundance of conſolation may be ſuckt out of the breaſts of this truth! Chriſt came into the world when his Church was in the greateſt extremitie. And are not we at this time in great extremity? Are we not brought very low by our ſinnes, and by our diviſions the fruit of our ſinnes? We have divided our ſelves from God by our ſinnes, and God hath divided us one from another. Let us beſeech the Lord Ieſus Chriſt to come once more into the world by his Spirit of power! Let us not deſpaire of his coming. For he is <hi>Deus in monte.</hi> He is our peace now the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> is in the Land, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 5. And when he comes he will come as a Conquerour to ſubdue his enemies under his feet.</p>
            <p>This day is the day which is commonly called <hi>The Feaſt of Chriſts Nativitie,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtmas day:</hi> A day that hath been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:123903:24"/>
much abuſed to <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> and <hi>prophaneneſſe.</hi> It is not eaſie to reckon whether the ſuperſtition hath beene greater, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe. I have knowne ſome that have preferred <hi>Chriſtmas day</hi> before the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and have cryed downe the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and cried up <hi>Chriſtmas day.</hi> I have knowne thoſe that would be ſure to receive the Sacrament upon Chriſtmas day, though they did not receive it all the yeare after. This and much more was the ſuperſtition of the day. And the prophaneneſſe was as great. Old Father <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaith in one of his Sermons, That the Devil had more ſervice in the twelve Chriſtmas holy dayes (as they were called) then God had all the yeare after. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith of his time, <hi>Olim December menſis erat, nunc annus eſt.</hi> There are ſome that though they did not play at Cards all the yeare long, yet they muſt play at Chriſtmas; thereby, it ſeemes, to keepe in memory the birth of Chriſt. This and much more hath beene the profanation of this Feaſt. And truely I thinke that the ſuperſtition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of this day is ſo rooted into it, as that there is no way to reforme it but by dealing with it as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did with the brazen Serpent. This yeare God by a <hi>Providence</hi> hath buried this <hi>Feaſt</hi> in a <hi>Faſt,</hi> and I hope it will never riſe againe. You have ſet out (Right Honourable) a ſtrict Order for the keeping of it, and you are here this day to obſerve your owne Order, and I hope you will doe it ſtrictly. The neceſſitie of the times are great. Never more need of Prayer and faſting. The Lord give us grace to be humbled in this day of Humiliation for all our owne, and <hi>Englands</hi> ſinnes; and eſpecially for the old ſuperſtition, and profanation of this Feaſt: alwaies remembring upon ſuch dayes as theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12, 13, 14.</p>
