            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to insist at the triall vpon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of inference or presumption, but
chiefly vpon matter of plaine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

thought fit to publish to the world a

treasons attempted and committed by
<hi>Robert</hi> late Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> and his

complices against her Maiestie and her
Kingdomes, and of the proceedings at
the conuictions of the said late Earle
and his adhaerents vpon the same trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and not so onely, but therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
for the better warranting and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the narration, to set downe in
the end, the very Confessions and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
themselues, word for word ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Originals, whereby it wil
be most manifest, that nothing is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or disguised, though it doe appeare
by diuers most wicked and seditious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
throwen abroad, that the dregs of
these treasons, which the late Earl of
<hi>Essex</hi> himselfe a litle before his death,
did terme a <hi>Leprosie,</hi> that had infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
farre and neere, do yet remaine in
the hearts and tongues of some misaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:446:4"/>THE most partiall will not denie, but that
<hi>Robert</hi> late Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> was by her Maiesties
manifold benefits and graces, besides oath and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,
as much tied to her Maiestie, as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
could be to the souereigne, her Maiesty hauing
heaped vpon him both dignities, offices, and gifts
in such measure, as within the circle of twelue yeres
or more, there was scarcely a yeere of rest, in which
he did not obteine at her Maiesties hands some
notable addition either of honour or profit.</p>
            <p>But he on the other side, making these her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
fauours nothing els but wings for his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and looking vpon them, not as her benefits,
but as his aduauntages, supposing that to be his
owne mettall which was but her marke and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
was so giuen ouer by God (who often pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
ingratitude by ambition, and ambition by
treason, and treason by finall ruine) as he had long
agoe plotted it in his heart to become a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
supplanter of that seat, whereof he ought to
haue beene a principall supporter: In such sort as
nowe euerie man of common sense may discerne
not onely his last actuall and open treasons, but
also his former more secret practises and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
towardes those his treasons, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any glosse or interpreter, but himselfe and his
owne doings.</p>
            <p>For first of all, the world can nowe expound,
why it was that hee did aspire, and had almost at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
vnto a greatnesse, like vnto the auncient
greatnesse of the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb facs="tcp:446:4"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> to haue all men of warre to make
their sole and particular dependance vpon him:
That with such iealousie and watchfulnesse hee
sought to discountenance any one that might be a
Competitor to him in any part of that greatnesse:
That with great violence and bitternesse he sought
to suppresse and keep downe all the worthiest Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
men, which did not appropriate their respects
and acknowledgements onely towardes himselfe.
All which did manifestly detect and distinguish,
That it was not the reputation of a famous Leader
in the warres which hee sought (as it was constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great while) but onely power and greatnesse
to serue his owne ends, considering he neuer loued
vertue nor valor in another, but where he thought
he should bee Proprietarie and Commander of it,
as referred to himselfe.</p>
            <p>So likewise those points of popularitie which
euery man tooke notice and note of, as his affable
gestures, open doores, making his table and his bed
so popularly places of audience to futers, denying
nothing when he did nothing, feeding many men
in their discontentments against the Queene and
the State, and the like, as they were euer since <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salons</hi>
time, the forerunners of treasons following,
so in him were they either the qualities of a nature
disposed to disloyaltie, or the beginnings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of that which afterwards grewe to shape
and forme.</p>
            <p>But as it were a vaine thing to thinke to search
the rootes and first motions of treasons, which are
<pb facs="tcp:446:5"/>
knowen to none but God that discernes the heart,
and the Diuell that giues the instigation: so it is
more then to be presumed (being made apparant
by the euidence of all the euents following) that
he caried into <hi>Ireland</hi> a heart corrupted in his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
and pregnant of those or the like treasons
which afterwards came to light.</p>
            <p>For being a man by nature of an high imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a great promiser to himselfe aswell as to
others, he was confident that if he were once the
first person in a kingdome, and a sea betweene the
Queenes seat and his, and <hi>Wales</hi> the neerest land
from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he had got the flower of the
English forces into his hands (which hee thought
so to intermixe with his owne followers, as the
whole body should mooue by his spirit) and if he
might haue also absolutely into his hands <hi>potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
vitae &amp; necis,</hi> &amp; <hi>arbitrium belli &amp; pacis,</hi> ouer the
Rebels of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby he might entise, &amp; make
them his owne, first by pardons and conditions,
and after by hopes to bring them in place where
they should serue for hope of better booties then
Cowes, he should be able to make that place of
Lieutenancie of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a rise or step to ascend
to his desired greatnesse in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although many of these conceites were
windie, yet neither were they the lesse like to his,
neither are they now onely probable coniectures
or comments vpon these his last treasons, but the
very preludes of actions almost immediatly subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
as shalbe touched in due place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:446:5"/>But first it was strange with what appetite and
thirst he did affect and compasse the gouernment
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he did obteine. For although he
made some formall shewes to put it from him: yet
in this, as in most things else, his desires being too
strong for his dissimulations, he did so farre passe
the bounds of <hi>Decorum,</hi> as he did in effect name him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the Queene by such description and such
particularities as could not be applyed to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but himselfe: neither did he so onely, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee was still at hand to offer and vrge vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
and peremptorily exceptions to any other
that was named.</p>
            <p>Then after hee once found that there was no
man but himselfe (who had other matters in his
head) so farre in loue with that charge, as to make
any competition or opposition to his pursute,
whereby he saw it would fall vpon him, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after himselfe was resolued vpon, he began
to make propositions to her Maiestie by way of
taxation of the former course held in mannaging
the actions of <hi>Ireland,</hi> especially vpon three points:
The first, that the proportions of forces which had
bene there mainteined and continued by supplies,
were not sufficient to bring the prosecutions there
to period. The second, that the axe had not bene
put to the roote of the tree, in regard there had not
bin made a maine prosecution vpon the Archtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<hi>Tyrone,</hi> in his owne strength, within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
of <hi>Vlster.</hi> The third, that the prosecutions
before time had bene intermixed and interrupted
<pb facs="tcp:446:6"/>
with too many temporising treaties, whereby the
Rebell did euer gather strength and reputation to
renew the warre with aduantage. All which good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and well sounding discourses, together with the
great vaunts that he would make the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before him, tended but to this, that the Queene
should encrease the list of her Armie and all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of treasure and other furniture, to the end
his commandement might be the greater. For that
he neuer intended any such prosecution, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by this, that euen at the time before his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Ireland</hi> hee did open himselfe so farre in
speech to <hi>Blunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blunt. 3.</note> his inwardest counsellour, <hi>That he
did assure himselfe that many of the Rebels in</hi> Ireland
<hi>would be aduised by him:</hi> so far was he fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> intending
any prosecution towards those in whom he tooke
himselfe to haue interest. But his ends were two:
The one, to get great forces into his hands: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to oblige the heads of the rebellion vnto him,
and to make them of his partie. These two endes
had in themselues a repugnancie: for the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
prosecution, and the other treaty: But hee
that meant to be too strong to bee called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for any thing, and meant besides, when he
was once in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ingage himselfe in other
iourneys that should hinder the prosecution in
the North, tooke things in order as they made for
him. And so first did nothing as was sayd, but
trumpet a finall and vtter prosecution against <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
in the North, to the ende to haue his forces
augmented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:446:6"/>But yet he forgat not his other purpose of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himselfe strong by a partie amongst the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
when it came to the scanning of the clauses
of his commission. For then he did insist, and that
with a kind of contestation, that the pardoning, no
not of <hi>Tyrone</hi> himselfe, the capitall Rebell, should
be excepted and reserued to her Maiesties imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
grace, being infinitely desirous that <hi>Tyrone</hi>
should not looke beyond him for his life or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
but should hold his fortune as of him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
for it to him onely.</p>
            <p>So againe, whereas in the commission of the
Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and of all other Lieutenants or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
there was euer in that clause which giueth
vnto the Lieutenant or deputie, that high or regall
point of authority to pardon Treasons and I rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
an exception contained of such cases of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as are committed against the person of the
King: It was strange, and suspiciously strange, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at that time, with what importunitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
he did labour, and in the end preuailed to
haue that exception also omitted, glosing then,
that because he had heard, that by strict exposition
of law (a point in law that he would needes forget
at his arraignment, but could take knowledge of
it before, when it was to serue his owne ambition)
all treasons of rebellion did tend to the destruction
of the Kings person, it might breede a buzze in
the Rebels heads, and so discourage them from
comming in, whereas he knew well that in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
passed, there was neuer Rebel made any
<pb facs="tcp:446:7"/>
doubt or scruple vpon that point to accept of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
from all former gouernours, who had their
Commissions penned with that limitation (their
Commissions being things not kept secretly in a
boxe, but published &amp; recorded) so as it appeared
manifestly that it was a meere deuise of his owne
out of the secret reaches of his heart then not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed:
but it may be shrewdly expounded since,
what his drift was by those pardons which he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Blunt</hi> the Marshall, and <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that his care was no lesse to secure his owne
instruments then the Rebels of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet was there another point for which he did
contend &amp; contest, which was, that he might not
be tied to any opinion of the Counsell of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
all others in certain points (as pardoning traitors,
concluding warre and peace, and some other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
articles) had bene before him, to the end he
might be absolute of himselfe, and be fully Master
of opportunities and occasions for the performing
and executing of his owne treasonable ends.</p>
            <p>But after he had once by her Maiesties singular
trust and fauour toward him obtained his Patent
of Commission as large, and his List of forces as
full as hee desired, there was an end in his course
of the prosecution in the North. For being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the whole cariage of his actions
there, was nothing els but a cunning defeating of
that iourney, with an intent (as appeared) in the
ende of the yeere to pleasure and gratifie the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
with a dishonourable peace, and to contract
<pb facs="tcp:446:7"/>
with him for his owne greatnesse.</p>
            <p>Therefore not long after hee had receiued the
sword, he did voluntarily ingage himselfe in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
and fruitlesse iourney into <hi>Munster,</hi> a
iourney neuer propounded in the Counsell there,
neuer aduertized ouer hither while it was past:
By which iourney her Maiesties forces which
were to be preserued intire both in vigor and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for the great prosecution, were harased and
tyred with long marches together, and the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
prosecution was indeede quite dashed and
made impossible.</p>
            <p>But yet still doubting he might receiue from her
Maiestie some quicke &amp; expresse commandement
to proceede: to be sure, he pursued his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
of wrapping himselfe in other actions, and so
set himselfe on worke anewe in the Countie of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaley,</hi>
being resolued, as is manifest, to dallie out
the season, and neuer to haue gone that iourney at
all: That setting forward which he made in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ende of August being but a meere plaie and a
mockerie, and for the purposes which now shall be
declared.</p>
            <p>After he perceiued that foure moneths of the
Summer, and three parts of the army were wasted,
hee thought nowe was a time to set on foot such a
peace as might be for the Rebels aduantage, and so
to worke a mutuall obligation betweene <hi>Tyrone</hi>
and himselfe, for which purpose he did but seeke a
commodity. He had there with him in his armie
one <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi> a man of a seditious and working
<pb facs="tcp:446:8"/>
spirit, and one that had bene priuately familiar and
intirely beloued of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and one that afterwards
immediatly vpon <hi>Essex</hi> open rebellion, was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
for a desperate attempt of violence against
her Maiesties person; which he plainly confessed,
and for which hee suffered. Wherefore iudging
him to be a fit instrument, he made some significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Lee</hi> of such an imploiment, which was no
sooner signified then apprehended by <hi>Lee.</hi> Hee
gaue order also to sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> Marshall of
his army, to licence <hi>Lee</hi> to goe to <hi>Tyrone</hi> when hee
should require it. But <hi>Lee</hi> thought good to let slip
first vnto <hi>Tyrone</hi> (which was neuerthelesse by the
Marshals warrant) one <hi>Iames Knowd,</hi> a person of
wit and sufficiencie, to sound in what termes and
humours <hi>Tyrone</hi> then was. This <hi>Knowd</hi> returned a
message from <hi>Tyrone</hi> to <hi>Lee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Th. Lee.</note> which was, That <hi>if the
Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>would followe</hi> Tyrones <hi>plot, hee would
make the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>the greatest man that euer was
in</hi> England: <hi>and further, that if the Earle would haue
conference with him,</hi> Tyrone <hi>would deliuer his eldest
sonne in pledge for his assurance.</hi> This message was
deliuered by <hi>Knowd</hi> to <hi>Lee,</hi> and by <hi>Lee</hi> was impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> who after this message,
imployed <hi>Lee</hi> himselfe to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and by his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
(whatsoeuer passed els) prepared and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Tyrone</hi> to the parley.</p>
            <p>And this imploiment of <hi>Lee</hi> was a matter of
that guiltinesse in my Lord, as being charged with
it at my Lord Keepers onely in this nature (for the
message of <hi>Knowd</hi> was not then knowen) that
<pb facs="tcp:446:8"/>
when he pretended to assaile <hi>Tyrone,</hi> he had before
vnder hand agreed vpon a pariey,<note place="margin">In the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Blunt at the barre, he did there declare that he had Essex his particular warrant to send Lee, and afterwardes was desired by Essex to take it vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and that they both had pardons.</note> my Lord vtterly
denied it that he euer imploied <hi>Lee</hi> to <hi>Tyrone</hi> at all,
and turned it vpon <hi>Blunt</hi> whom he afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to take it vpon him, hauing before suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
prouided for the security of all parts, for he
had granted both to <hi>Blunt</hi> &amp; <hi>Lee</hi> pardons of al trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
vnder the great seale of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and so himselfe
disclaiming it, &amp; they being pardoned, all was safe.</p>
            <p>But when that <hi>Tyrone</hi> was by these meanes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what others God knowes) prepared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a parley, nowe was the time for <hi>Essex</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
himselfe of al the Queenes commandements
and his owne promises and vndertakings for the
Northern iourney, and not so alone, but to haue
the glory at the disaduantage of the yere, being but
2500. strong of foote, and 300. of horse, after the
fresh disaster of sir <hi>Coniers Clifford,</hi> in the height of
the Rebels pride, to set foorth to assaile, and then
that the very terror and reputation of my Lord of
<hi>Essex</hi> person was such as did daunt him and make
him stoope to seeke a parley, and this was the end
he shot at in that September iourney, being a mere
abuse and br<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ry, and but inducements onely to
the Treaty, which was the onely matter he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For <hi>Essex</hi> drawing now towards the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe,</hi>
or last part of that Tragedy, for which he
came vpon the Stage in <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Treasons
grew to a further ripenesse. For knowing how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
it was for him to communicate with any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
euen of those whom hee trusted most, and
<pb facs="tcp:446:9"/>
meant to vse in other Treasons: That he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to growe to an agreement with <hi>Tyrone</hi> to
haue succors from him for the vsurping vpon the
State here, (not because it was more dangerous
then the rest of his treasons, but because it was
more odious, and in a kind monstrous, that hee
should conspire with such a Rebell, against whom
he was sent: and therfore might aduenture to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
mens affections from him) he draue it to this,
that there might bee, and so there was, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of treaty, an interuiew &amp; priuate conference
betweene <hi>Tyrone</hi> and himselfe onely, no third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
admitted. A strange course, considering with
whom he dealt, and especially considering what
message <hi>Knowde</hi> had brought, which should haue
made him rather call witnesses to him, then auoid
witnesses. But he being only true to his own ends,
easily dispensed with all such considerations. Nay,
there was such carefull order taken, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should ouerheare one worde that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them two: as because the place appointed
and vsed for the parley was such, as there was the
depth of a brooke betweene them, which made
them speake some lowdnesse: therewere certaine
horsemen appointed by order from <hi>Essex,</hi> to keepe
all men off, a great distance from the place.</p>
            <p>It is true, that the secrecie of that parley, as it
gaue to him the more liberty of Treason, so it may
giue any man the more libertie of surmize, what
was then handled between them, inasmuch as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can bee knowen, but by report from one of
<pb facs="tcp:446:9"/>
them two, either <hi>Essex</hi> or <hi>Tyrone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, although there were no proceeding against
<hi>Essex</hi> vpon these treasons, and that it were a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
thing to load more treasons vpon him then,
whose burthen was so great after: yet for trueths
sake, it is fit the world know, what is testified tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the speaches, letters and reports of <hi>Tyrone,</hi>
immediatly following this conference, &amp; obserue
also what ensued likewise in the desseignes of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>
himselfe.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tyrones</hi> part it fell out, that the very day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>Essex</hi> came to the court of <hi>England, Tyrone</hi>
hauing conference with Sir <hi>William Warren</hi> at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
by way of discourse told him, and bound it
with an oath, and iterated it two or three seuerall
times:<note place="margin">The relation of sir Wi. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren certified vnder his hand fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Ireland to the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell here.</note> 
               <hi>That within two or three moneths, he should see
the greatest alterations and strangest that euer hee sawe
in his life, or could imagine: and that bee the said</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone
<hi>hoped ere long to haue a good share in</hi> England.
With this concurred fully the report of <hi>Richard
Bremingham</hi> a gentleman of the <hi>Pale,</hi> hauing made
his repaire about the same time to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> to right
him in a cause of land: sauing that <hi>Bremingham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers
the like speach of <hi>Tyrone</hi> to himselfe:<note place="margin">The report of Ri. Breming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to the Councell of Estate in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> but, not
what <hi>Tyrone</hi> hoped, but what <hi>Tyrone</hi> had promised
in these words, <hi>That hee had promised</hi> (it may bee
thought to whom) <hi>ere long to shew his face in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>little to the good of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>These generalities comming immediatly from
the report of <hi>Tyrone</hi> himselfe, are drawen to more
particularitie in a conference had betweene the
<pb facs="tcp:446:10"/>
Lord <hi>Fitz Morrice</hi> Baron of <hi>Liksnawe</hi> in <hi>Munster,</hi>
and one <hi>Thomas Wood</hi> a person wel reputed of, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

               <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tho. Wood.</note> In

which</hi> Tyrone <hi>should bring or send to</hi> Essex, <hi>were 8000
Irish.</hi> With which concurreth fully the testimony
of the said <hi>Iames Knowde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iames Knowde.</note> who being in credit with

was vsed as a Secretarie for him, in the writing of
a letter to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> immediatly after <hi>Essex</hi> comming
into <hi>England.</hi> The effect of which letter was: <hi>To
vnderstand some light of the secret agreement betweene
the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>and</hi> Tyrone, <hi>that he the said</hi> Owny
<hi>might frame his course accordingly.</hi> Which letter,
with further instructions to the same effect, was in
the presence of <hi>Knowde</hi> deliuered to <hi>Turlagh Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauy,</hi>
a man of trust with <hi>Owny,</hi> who brought an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from <hi>Tyrone.</hi> The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents whereof were: <hi>That
the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>had agreed to take his part, and that
they should ayd him towards the conquest of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Besides, very certaine it is, &amp; testified by diuers
credible persons, that immediatly vpon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
there did flie abroad as sparckles of this fire,
(which it did not concern <hi>Tyrone</hi> so much to keep
secret, as it did <hi>Essex</hi>) a generall and receiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb facs="tcp:446:10"/>
that went vp and down in the mouthes both
of the better and meaner sort of Rebels:<note place="margin">The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Da. Hethrington, Iames Knowd and others.</note> 
               <hi>That the

would neuer leaue the one sword, meaning that of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
till he had gotten the other in</hi> England: <hi>and that
he would bring them to serue, where they should haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
maner of booties then cowes:</hi> and the like spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
And <hi>Thomas Lee</hi> himselfe,<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Th. Lee.</note> (who had bene,
as was before declared, with <hi>Tyrone</hi> two or three
dayes, vpon my Lords sending, and had sounded
him) hath left it confessed vnder his hand: <hi>That
he knew the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>and</hi> Tyrone <hi>to be one, and
to runne the same courses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certaine it is also, that immediatly vpon
that parley, <hi>Tyrone</hi> grewe into a strange and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woonted
pride, and appointed his progresses and
visitations to receiue congratulations and homa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
from his confederates, and behaued himselfe
in all things as one that had some new spirite of
hope and courage put into him.</p>
            <p>But on the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his part insued imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
after this parley a strange motion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
which though no doubt hee had harbored in
his brest before: yet for any thing yet appeareth,
he did not vtter and breake with any in it, before he
had bene confirmed and fortified in his purpose, by
the combination and correspondence, which hee
found in <hi>Tyrone</hi> vpon their conference. Neither is
this a matter gathered out of reports,<note place="margin">The Earle of Southampton and sir Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Blunt.</note> but confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
directly by two of his principall friendes and
associats, being witnesses vpon their owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:446:11"/>
&amp; of that which was spoken to themselues:<note place="margin">The substance of that which is confessed by Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Blunt touching Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex purpose to haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into England the armie of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the changing of that dessein into the other dessein of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising the Queene and the Court.</note>
The substance of which confessions is this: <hi>That a
litle before my Lords comming ouer into</hi> England, <hi>at
the castle of</hi> Dublin <hi>where Sir</hi> Christopher Blunt <hi>lay
hurt, hauing bene lately remooued thither from</hi> Reban,
<hi>a castle of</hi> Thomas Lees, <hi>and placed in a lodging that
had bene my Lord of</hi> Southamptons: <hi>the Earle of</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex
<hi>tooke the Earle of</hi> Southampton <hi>with him, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit</hi>
Blunt, <hi>and there being none present but they three,
my Lord of</hi> Essex <hi>told them, he found it now necessary
for him to go into</hi> England, <hi>and would aduise with them
of the manner of his going, since to goe he was resolued.
And thereupon propounded vnto them, that he thought
it fit a cary with him of the army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as much
as hee could conueniently transport, at least the choise
of it, to the number of two or three thousand, to secure
and make good his first deseent on shore, purposing to land
them at</hi> Milford hauen <hi>in</hi> Wales, <hi>or thereabouts: not
doubting, but that his army would so increase within a
small time, by such as would come in to him as hee should
be able to march with his power to</hi> London, <hi>and make
his own conditions as he thought good. But, both</hi> South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton
<hi>and</hi> Blunt <hi>disswaded him from this enterprise:</hi>
Blunt <hi>alledging the hazard of it, &amp; that it would make
him odious, and</hi> Southampt on <hi>vtterly disliking of that
course vpon the same and many other reasons. Howbe it
thereupon</hi> Blunt <hi>aduised him rather to another course,
which was to draw forth of the Army some 200. resolute
gentlemen, &amp; with those to come ouer, &amp; so to make sure
of the Court, and so to make his owne conditions.</hi> Which
Confessions it is not amisse to deliuer, by what a
<pb facs="tcp:446:11"/>
good prouidence of God they came to light: for,
they could not bee vsed at <hi>Essex</hi> arraignement to
charge him, because they were vttered after his
death.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> at his arraignment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charged that the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had set it downe
vnder his hand,<note place="margin">The speach of Sir Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Blunt at his arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the occasion of the falling into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</note> that he had bene a principall Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator
of him, to his treasons, in passion brake forth
into these speeches: <hi>That then he must be forced to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
what further matters he had held my Lord from, and
desired for that purpose (because the present proceeding
should not be interrupted) to speake with the Lord</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
<hi>and M.</hi> Secretarie, <hi>after his arraignment,</hi> and
so fell most naturally and most voluntarily into this
his confession, which if it had beene thought fit to
haue required of him at that time publikely, he had
deliuered before his conuiction. And the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
he did after (at the time of his executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
and fully confirme, discourse particularly,
and take vppon his death, where neuer any man
shewed lesse feare, nor a greater resolution to die.</p>
            <p>And the same mattter so by him confessed, was
likewise confessed with the same circumstances of
time and place by <hi>Southampton,</hi> being seuerally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
thereupon.</p>
            <p>So as nowe the worlde may see how long since
my Lord put off his vizard, and disclosed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of his heart to two of his most confident
friends, falling vpon that vnnaturall and detestable
treason, whereunto all his former Actions in his
gouernement in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (and God knowes howe
<pb facs="tcp:446:12"/>
long before) were but Introductions.</p>
            <p>But, finding that these two persons, which of all
the rest hee thought to haue found forwardest,<note place="margin">The place of Generall of the horse in the armie of Ireland was conferred by Essex vpon Southampton contrary to her Maiesties expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note>
               <hi>Southampton,</hi> whose displacing hee had made his
owne discontentment (hauing placed him, no
question to that ende, to find cause of discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
and <hi>Blunt,</hi> a man so enterprizing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of his owne life, (as himselfe termed himselfe
at the Barre) did not applaud to this his purpose,
and thereby doubting how coldly he should find
others minded, that were not so neere to him. And
therefore condescending to <hi>Blunts</hi> aduise to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
the Court, hee did pursue that plot accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
and came ouer with a selected companie
of Captaines and voluntaries, and such as hee
thought were most affectionate vnto himselfe, and
most resolute, though not knowing of his purpose.
So as euen at that time, euery man noted and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
what the matter should be, that my Lord
tooke his most particular friends and followers
from their companies, which were countenance
and meanes vnto them, to bring them ouer. But
his purpose (as in part was touched before) was
this: that if he held his greatnesse in Court, and
were not committed (which in regard of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and deplored estate he left <hi>Ireland</hi> in, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he thought the opinion here would be that his
seruice could not be spared, he made full account
he should not be) then, at the first opportunitie, he
would execute the surprize of her Maiesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And if he were committed to the Tower, or
<pb facs="tcp:446:12"/>
to prison for his contempts, (for besides his other
contempts, hee came ouer expresly against the
Queenes prohibition vnder her Signet) it might
be the care of some of his principall friends, by the
helpe of that choise and resolute company which
he brought ouer, to rescue him.</p>
            <p>But the pretext of his comming ouer was, by
the efficacie of his owne presence and perswasion,
to haue moued and drawen her Maiestie to accept
of such conditions of peace, as hee had treated of
with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> in his priuate conference: which was
indeed somwhat needfull, the principall Article of
them being, <hi>That there should be a generall restitution
of Rebels in</hi> Ireland <hi>to all their lands &amp; possessions, that
they could pretend any right to, before their going out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Rebellion:</hi> without reseruation of such lands as
were by Act of Parliament passed to the Crowne,
and so planted with English both in the time of Q.
<hi>Mary,</hi> and since: and without difference either of
time of their going forth, or nature of their offence,
or other circumstance, tending in effect to this:
That all the Queenes good subiects, in most of the
Prouinces, should haue beene displanted, and the
Countrey abandoned to the Rebels.</p>
            <p>When this man was come ouer, his heart thus
fraughted with Treasons, and presented himselfe
to her Maiestie: it pleased God, in his singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
ouer her Maiestie, to guide and hem in
her proceeding towards him, in a narrow way of
safetie betweene two perils. For neither did her
Maiestie leaue him at libertie, whereby he might
<pb facs="tcp:446:13"/>
haue commodity to execute his purpose: nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
him in any such nature, as might signifie or
betoken matter of despaire of his returne to Court
and fauour. And so the meanes of present mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
being taken away, and the humours not stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
this matter fell asleepe, and the threed of his
purposes was cut off. For, comming ouer about
the end of September, and not denied accesse and
conference with her Maiesty, and then being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to his chamber at Court for some dayes,
and from thence to the Lord Keepers house; it
was conceiued, that these were no ill signes. At my
Lord Keepers house he remained, till some fewe
dayes before <hi>Easter,</hi> and then was remooued to his
owne house, vnder the custody of Sir <hi>Richard Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
and in that sort continued till the end of <hi>Trinity</hi>
Terme following.</p>
            <p>For, her Maiestie all this while looking into his
faults, with the eye of her princely fauour, and loth
to take aduantage of his great offences, in other
nature then as contempts, resolued so to proceed
against him, as might (to vse her Maiesties owne
words) tend, <hi>ad correctionem, &amp; non ad ruinam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse afterwards, about the ende of
<hi>Trinitie</hi> Terme following, for the better satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the world, and to represse seditious bruits
and libels, which were dispersed in his iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to obserue a forme of iustice, before hee
should be set at full libertie: her Maiestie was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to direct, that there should be associate vnto
her Priuie Councell, some chosen persons of her
<pb facs="tcp:446:13"/>
Nobility, and of her Iudges of the law: and before
them his cause, (concerning the breaking of his
instructions for the Northerne prosecution, and
the manner of his treating with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and his
comming ouer, and leauing the kingdome of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
contrary to her Maiesties commandement,
expressed as wel by signification thereof made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her Royall hand and Signet, as by a most bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and effectual letter, written priuately to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe)
to receiue a hearing: with limitation neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles,
that hee should not bee charged with any
point of disloialty; and with like fauour directed,
that he should not be called in question in the open
and ordinary place of offendours in the Starre
Chamber, from which hee had likewise by a most
penitent and humble letter desired to be spared, as
that which would haue wounded him for euer, as
he affirmed, but in a more priuate manner at my
Lord Keepers house. Neither was the effect of the
sentence, that there passed against him, any more
then a suspension of the exercise of some of his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
At which time also, <hi>Essex</hi> that could varie
himselfe into all shapes for a time, infinitely desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
(as by the sequele now appeareth) to be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to practise &amp; reuiue his former purposes, and
hoping to set into them with better strength then
euer, bicause he conceiued the peoples hearts were
kindled to him by his troubles, and that they had
made great demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strations of asmuch: he did trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
himselfe into such a strange &amp; deiected hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
as if he had bene no man of this world, with
<pb facs="tcp:446:14"/>
passionate protestations, that he called God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<hi>that he had made an vtter diuorce with the world:
and he desired her Maiesties fauour, not for any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
respect, but for a preparatiue for a</hi> Nunc dimittis:
<hi>And that the teares of his heart had quenched in him
all humors of ambition.</hi> All this to make her Maiesty
secure, and to lull the world asleepe, that hee was
not a man to be held any wayes dangerous.</p>
            <p>Not many dayes after, Sir <hi>Richard Barkley</hi> his
keeper was remoued from him, and he set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
with this admonition only: <hi>That hee should not
take himselfe to be altogether discharged, though he were
left to the guard of none, but his owne discretion.</hi> But he
felt himselfe no sooner vpon the wings of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but (notwithstanding his former shewes of a
mortified estate of minde) he began to practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
as busily as euer reuiuing his former resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which was the surprizing and possessing the
Queenes person, and the Court. And that it may
appeare how early after his libertie he set his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
on worke, hauing long before entertained
into his seruice, and during his gouernment in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
drawne neere vnto him in the place of his
chiefe Secretary, one <hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> a base fellow by
birth, but a great scholler, and indeede a notable
Traytor by the booke, being otherwise of a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and mutinous spirit against all superiours:</p>
            <p>This fellow, in the beginning of August, which
was not a moneth after <hi>Essex</hi> libertie granted, fell of
practising with Sir <hi>Henry Neuill,</hi> that serued her
Maiestie as Ligier Ambassadour with the French
<pb facs="tcp:446:14"/>
King,<note place="margin">The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sir He. Neuell.</note> and then newly come ouer into <hi>England</hi>
from <hi>Bulleyn,</hi> abusing him with a false lie, and
meere inuention, that his seruice was blamed and
misliked, and that the imputation of the breach of
the treaty of Peace held at <hi>Bulleyn,</hi> was like to light
vpon him, (when there was no colour of any such
matter) onely to distaste him of others, and fasten
him to my Lord, though he did not acquaint him
with any particulars of my Lords deseignes, till a
good while after.</p>
            <p>But my Lorde hauing spent the ende of the
Summer (being a priuate time, when euery body
was out of towne and dispersed) in digesting his
owne thoughts, with the helpe and conference of
Master <hi>Cuffe,</hi> they had soone set downe betweene
them the ancient principle of Traitors and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
which was: <hi>To prepare many, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
few;</hi> and after the maner of Mynes, to make
ready their powder, and place it, and then giue fire
but in the instant. Therefore, the first considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was of such persons as my Lord thought fit to
draw to be of his party; singling out both of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and Martiall men, and others, such as were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
or turbulent, and such as were weake of
iudgement, and easie to be abused, or such as were
wholy dependants and followers (for meanes or
countenance) of himselfe, <hi>Southampton</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his greatest associates.</p>
            <p>And knowing there were no such strong and
drawing cordes of popularitie, as religion: he had
not neglected, both at this time, and long before,
<pb facs="tcp:446:15"/>
in a profane pollicy to serue his turne (for his own
greatnesse,) of both sorts &amp; factions, both of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
and <hi>Puritanes,</hi> as they terme them, turning his
out side to the one, and his inside to the other, and
making himselfe pleasing and gracious to the one
sort by professing zeale, and frequenting sermons,
and making much of Preachers, and secretly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand giuing assurance to <hi>Blunt, Dauies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blunt and Dauis.</note> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
others, that (if hee might preuaile in his desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
greatnesse,) hee would bring in a toleration of
the <hi>Catholike</hi> religion.</p>
            <p>Then hauing passed the whole <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
Terme in making himselfe plausible, and in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concourse about him, and in affecting &amp; allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men by kinde prouocations and vsage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(because his libertie was qualified) hee neither
forgot exercise of minde nor body, neither Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nor Tenis Court, to giue the occasion and
freedome of accesse and concourse vnto him) and
much other practise and deuise: About the end of
that terme, towards <hi>Christmas,</hi> hee grew to a more
framed resolution of the time and maner, when
and how hee would put his purpose in execution.
And first about the ende of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, it
passed as a kind of cipher and watchword amongst
his friends and followers,<note place="margin">The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir Henry Neuil, and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sir Ferdinando Gorge.</note> 
               <hi>That'my Lord would stand
vpon his guard:</hi> which might receiue construction,
in a good sense, as well guard of circumspection,
as guard of force: but to the more priuate and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
persons hee was content it should be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he would be couped vp no more, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb facs="tcp:446:15"/>
any more restraints or commandements.</p>
            <p>But the next care was, how to bring such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as he thought fit for his purpose, into Towne
together, without vent of suspicion, to be ready at
the time, when he should put his deseigne in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
which he had concluded should be some
time in Hillarie Terme: wherein hee found many
deuices to draw them vp,<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blunt.</note> some for sutes in Lawe,
and some for sutes in Court, &amp; some for assurance
of land: and one friend to draw vp another, it not
being perceiued, that all mooued from one head.
And it may be truely noted, that in the Catalogue
of those persons, that were the eight of February in
the action of open Rebellion, a man may finde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
out of euery County of <hi>England</hi> some, which
could not be by chance or constellation: and in the
particularity of Examinations (too long to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed)
it was easie to trace in what sort many of
them were brought vp to Towne, &amp; held in Town
vpon seueral pretences. But in Candlemas Terme,
when the time drew neere, then was hee content
consultation should be had by certaine choise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
vpon the whole matter and course which he
should hold. And because hee thought himselfe
and his own house more obserued, it was thought
fit, that the meeting and conference should bee at
<hi>Drury house,</hi> where S. <hi>Charles Dauers</hi> lodged. There
mette at this Councell, the Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi>
with whom in former times hee had bene at some
emulations and differences in Court. But after,
<hi>Southampton</hi> hauing married his kinswoman, and
<pb facs="tcp:446:16"/>
plunged himselfe wholly into his fortune, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his continuall Associat in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of him as most assured vnto him, and had long
agoe in <hi>Ireland</hi> acquainted him with his purpose,
as was declared before. Sir <hi>Charles Dauers,</hi> one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
deuoted to the Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi>
vpon affection begun first vpon the deseruing of
the same Earle towards him, when he was in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
about the murther of one <hi>Long.</hi> Sir <hi>Ferdinando
Gorge,</hi> one that the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had of purpose
sent for vp from his gouernment at <hi>Plymmouth</hi> by
his letter, with particular assignation to be here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the 2. of <hi>February.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Dauies,</hi> one that
had bene his seruant, and raised by him, and that
bare Office in the Tower, being Surueyour of the
Ordinance, &amp; one that he greatly trusted: and <hi>Iohn
Littleton,</hi> one they respected for his wit and valour.</p>
            <p>The consultation and conference rested vpon
three parts:<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessions of sir Charles Dauers. 1. 2. Sir Io. Dauis 2. Sir Ferdin. Gorge 2. Sir Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Blunt 2. Southampton at the barre.</note> The perusall of a list of those persons,
whom they tooke to be of their party: The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Action it selfe, which they should set
a foot, and how they should proceed in it: And the
distribution of the persons, according to the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concluded on, to their seuerall imploiments.</p>
            <p>The list contained the number of sixe score per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Noblemen and Knights, and principall Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and was (for the more credits sake) of the
Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> owne hand writing.</p>
            <p>For the Action it selfe, there was proposition
made of two principall Articles: The one, of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
the Tower of <hi>London:</hi> the other of surprising
<pb facs="tcp:446:16"/>
her Maiesties person and the Court, in which also
deliberation was had, what course to hold with the
Citie, either towards the effecting of the surprize,
or after it was effected.</p>
            <p>For the Tower was alleadged, the giuing a
reputation to the Action, by getting into their
hand the principall Fort of the Realme, with the
stores and prouisions thereunto appertaining, the
bridling of the Citie by that piece, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
of entrance in and possessing it, by the meanes
of Sir <hi>Iohn Dauis.</hi> But this was by opinion of all
reiected, as that which would distract their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
from the more principall, which was the
Court, and as that which they made a iudgement
would follow incidently, if the Court were once
possessed.</p>
            <p>But the later, which was the ancient plot, (as
was well knowen to <hi>Southampton)</hi> was in the ende,
by the generall opinion of them all, insisted and
rested vpon.</p>
            <p>And the maner howe it should bee ordered
and disposed was this: That certaine selected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of their number, such as were well knowen
in Court, and might haue accesse without checke
or suspicion, into the seuerall roumes in Court,
according to the seuerall qualities of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the differences of the roumes, should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
themselues into the Presence, the Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
the Hall, and the vtter Court and gate,
and some one principall man vndertaking euery
<pb facs="tcp:446:17"/>
seuerall roume with the strength of some fewe to
be ioyned with him, euery man to make good his
charge, according to the occasion. In which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution,
sir <hi>Charles Dauers</hi> was then named to the
Presence, and to the great chamber, where he was
appointed, when time should bee, to seaze vpon
the Halberds of the Gard: sir <hi>Iohn Dauies</hi> to the
Hall: and sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> to the vtter Gate:
these seeming to them, the three principall wards
of consideration. And that things being within
the Court in a readinesse, a signall should be giuen
and sent to <hi>Essex,</hi> to set forward from <hi>Essex house,</hi>
being no great distance off. Whereupon <hi>Essex,</hi>
accompanied with the noble men of his party, and
such as should bee prepared and assembled at his
house for that purpose, should march towards the
Court: And that the former conspirators alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
entered should giue correspondence to them
without, as well by making themselues Masters of
the gates to giue them entrance, as by attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to get into their hand vpon the suddaine the
Halberds of the Guard, thereby hoping to preuent
any great resistance within, and by filling all full of
tumult and confusion.</p>
            <p>This being the platforme of their enterprise,
the second act of this Tragedy was also resolued,
which was, that my Lord should present himselfe
to her Maiestie as prostrating himselfe at her feete,
and desire the remoue of such persons, as he called
his enemies, from about her. And after that my
<pb facs="tcp:446:17"/>
Lord had obtained possession of the Queene, and
the State: hee should call his pretended enemies
to a triall vpon their liues, and summon a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and alter the gouernement, and obtaine to
himselfe, and his associates, such conditions as
seemed to him and them good.</p>
            <p>There passed speech also in this conspiracie,
of possessing the Citie of <hi>London,</hi> which <hi>Essex</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in his owne particular and secret in clination,
had euer a speciall mind vnto: not as a departure
or going from his purpose of possessing the Court,
but as an inducement and preparatiue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it vpon a surer ground. An opinion bred
in him, (as may bee imagined) partly by the great
ouerweening he had of the loue of the Citizens:
but chiefly, in all likelihood, by a feare, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
hee should haue preuailed in getting her
Maiesties person into his hands for a time, with his
two or three hundred Gentlemen, yet, the very
beames and graces of her Maiesties magnanimitie
and prudent cariage in such disaster working, with
the naturall instinct of loyaltie, which of course
(when fury is ouer) doth euer reuiue in the hearts
of subiects of any good blood or mind (such as his
troope for the more part was compounded of,
though by him seduced and bewitched) would
quickly breake the knot, and cause some disunion
and separation amongst them, whereby hee might
haue bene left destitute, except he should builde
vpon some more popular number, according to
<pb facs="tcp:446:18"/>
the nature of all vsurping Rebels, which doe euer
trust more in the common people, then in persons
of sort or qualitie. And this may well appeare by
his owne plot in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was to haue come
with the choise of the Armie, from which hee was
diuerted, as before is shewed. So as his owne
courses inclined euer to rest vpon the maine
strength of the multitude, and not vpon surprises,
or the combinations of a fewe.</p>
            <p>But to returne: These were the resolutions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at that consultation, held by these fiue at <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
house,</hi> some fiue or sixe dayes before the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
to be reported to <hi>Essex,</hi> who euer kept in
himselfe the binding and directing voice: which
he did to preuent all differences that might grow
by dissent or contradiction. And besides he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons, (which were <hi>Cuffe</hi> and <hi>Blunt</hi>) of more
inwardnesse and confidence with him then these,
(<hi>Southampton</hi> only excepted) which managed that
Consultation. And, for the day of the Enterprise,
which is that must rise out of the knowledge of all
the opportunities and difficulties, it was referred
to <hi>Essex</hi> his owne choise and appointment: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neuerthelesse resolued, that it should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before the end of <hi>Candlemas Terme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Councell and the resolutions thereof,
were in some points refined by <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Cuffe,</hi> and
<hi>Blunt:</hi> for,<note place="margin">Sir Henry Neuels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</note> first it was thought good, for the better
making sure of the vtter gate of the Court, and the
greater celeritie and suddennesse, to haue a troupe
<pb facs="tcp:446:18"/>
at receipt to a competent number, to haue come
from the <hi>Mewes,</hi> where they should haue bene as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
without suspicion in seuerall companies,
and from thence cast themselues in a moment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Court gate, and ioyne with them which
were within, while <hi>Essex</hi> with the maine of his
company were making forward.</p>
            <p>It was also thought fit, that because they would
be Common wealths-men, and foresee, that the
businesse and seruice of the publique State should
not stand still: they should haue ready at Court,
and at hand, certaine other persons to be offered,
to supplie the offices and places of such her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Counsellors and seruants, as they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to be remoued and displaced.</p>
            <p>But chiefly it was thought good, that the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
of their companies together, should bee
vpon some plausible pretext; both to make diuers
of their company, that vnderstood not the depth
of the practises, the more willing to follow them:
and to ingage themselues, and to gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the better without perill of detecting or
interrupting: and againe, to take the Court the
more vnprouided, without any Alarme giuen. So
as now there wanted nothing, but the Assignation
of the day: which neuerthelesse was resolued inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
to be before the end of the Terme, as was
sayd before,<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blunt. 3.</note> for the putting in execution of this
most dangerous and execrable Treason. But God
who had in his diuine prouidence long agoe
<pb facs="tcp:446:19"/>
cursed this action, with the Curse that the Psalme
speaketh of, <hi>That it should be like the vntimely fruit of
a woman, brought foorth before it came to perfection,</hi>
so disposed aboue, that her Maiesty vnderstanding
by a generall charme and muttering of the great
and vniuersall resort to <hi>Essex house,</hi> contrary to her
Princely admonition, and somwhat differing from
his former maner (as there could not be so great
fire without some smoke) vpon the seuenth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,
the afternoone before this Rebellion, sent
to <hi>Essex house</hi> M. Secretary <hi>Harbert,</hi> to require him
to come before the Lords of her Maiesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
then sitting in Counsell at <hi>Salisbury Court,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord Treasurers house: where it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended, that he should haue receiued some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
for exceeding the limitations of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
granted to him in a qualified maner, without
any intention towardes him of restraint, which
hee, vnder colour of not being well, excused to
doe: but his owne guiltie conscience applying
it, that his Traynes were discouered, doubting
perill in any further delay, determined to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
his enterprise, and to set it on foote the next
day.</p>
            <p>But then againe, hauing some aduertisement
in the euening, that the guards were doubled at
Court, and laying that to the message hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
ouernight: and so concluding that <hi>Allarme</hi>
was taken at Court, hee thought it to bee in
vaine, to thinke of the enterprise of the Court,
<pb facs="tcp:446:19"/>
by way of surprize: but that nowe his onely way
was, to come thither in strength, and to that ende
first to attempt the Citie. Wherein hee did but fall
backe to his owne former opinion, which hee had
in no sort neglected, but had formerly made some
ouertures to prepare the Citie to take his part: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
himselfe, (besides his generall conceipt, that
himselfe was the darling and mynion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and specially of the Citie) more particularly
vpon assurance giuen of <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> then Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe
of <hi>London,</hi> a man well beloued amongst the
Citizens, and one that had some particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of some of the trayned forces of the Citie,
to ioyne with him. Hauing therefore concluded
vpon this determination, now was the time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
in fact, all that he had before in purpose
digested.</p>
            <p>First therefore hee concluded of a pretext
which was euer part of the plot, and which hee
had meditated vpon, and studied long before.
For finding himselfe (thankes bee to God) to
seeke, in her Maiesties gouernement, of any iust
pretext in matter of state, either of innouation,
oppression, or any vnworthinesse: As in all his
former discontentments, hee had gone the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
path of Traytours, turning their imputation
vpon Counsellours, and persons of credit with
their Soueraigne: so nowe hee was forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the pretext of a priuate quarrell, giuing
out this speach, howe that euening, when hee
<pb facs="tcp:446:20"/>
should haue bene called before the Lordes of the
Councell, there was an Ambuscado of Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
placed vpon the water, by the deuise of my
Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> to haue
murdered him by the way as hee passed. A mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of no probability, those persons hauing no such
desperate estates or mindes, as to ruine themselues
and their posteritie, by committing so odious a
crime.</p>
            <p>But contrariwise, certaine it is, Sir <hi>Ferdinando
Gorge</hi> accused <hi>Blunt,</hi> to haue perswaded him to
kill,<note place="margin">Confession of sir Ferdinando Gorge.</note> or at least apprehend <hi>Sir Walter Raleigh,</hi> the
latter whereof <hi>Blunt</hi> denieth not, and asked <hi>Sir
Walter Raleigh</hi> forgiuenesse at the time of his
death.</p>
            <p>But this pretext being the best hee had, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and then did messages and warnings fly thicke
vp and downe to euery particular Nobleman, and
gentleman, both that euening and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to draw them together in the forenoone to
<hi>Essex house,</hi> dispersing the foresaid fable, That hee
should haue bene murdered, saue that it was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
on the water, somtime in his bed, varying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of a lye. Hee sent likewise
the same night, certaine of his instruments, as
namely, one <hi>William Temple</hi> his <hi>Secretary</hi> into the
Citie, to disperse the same tale, hauing increased
it some fewe daies before by an addition, That he
should haue bene likewise murdered by some Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its
to the number of foure: and to fortifie this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
<pb facs="tcp:446:20"/>
and to make the more buzze of the danger
hee stood in, hee caused that night a watch to bee
kept all night long towards the street, in his house:
the next morning, which was Sunday, they came
vnto him of all handes, according to his messages
and warnings. Of the Nobilitie, the Earles of
<hi>Rutland, Southampton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sands,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Henry Parker,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Lord Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egle,</hi>
besides diuers Knights and principall Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and their followers, to the number of some
three hundreth. And also it being Sunday, and
the houre when hee had vsed to haue a Sermon at
his house, it gaue cause to some, and colour to
others to come vpon that occasion. As they
came, my Lord saluted and imbraced, and to the
generalitie of them gaue to vnderstand, in as plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
termes as hee could, <hi>That his life had bene
sought, and that hee meant to goe to the Court, and
declare his griefes to the Queene, because his enemies
were mightie, and vsed her Maiesties name and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,</hi>
and desired their helpe to take his
part:<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Erle of Rutland.</note> But vnto the more speciall persons hee spake
high and in other termes, telling them <hi>That hee
was sure of the Citie, and would put himselfe into that
strength, that her Maiestie shoulde not bee able to
stand against him, and that he would take reuenge of his
enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the while after eight of the clocke in the
morning, the gates to the Streete and water were
strongly guarded, and men taken in and let foorth
by discretion of those that helde the charge, but
<pb facs="tcp:446:21"/>
with speciall caution of receiuing in such as came
from Court, but not suffering them to goe backe
without my Lords speciall direction, to the end no
particularitie of that which passed there might be
knowen to her Maiestie.</p>
            <p>About 10. of the clocke, her Maiestie hauing
vnderstanding of this strange and tumultuous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
at <hi>Essex house,</hi> yet in her Princely wisedome
and moderation thought to cast water vpon this
fire before it brake forth to further inconuenience:
and therefore vsing authoritie before she would vse
force, sent vnto him foure persons of great Honour
and place, and such as hee euer pretended to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and loue, to offer him iustice for any griefs of
his, but yet to lay her Royal commandement vpon
him to disperse his company, and vpon them to
withdraw themselues.</p>
            <p>These foure Honourable persons, being the
Lord Keeper of the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> the
Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the L. Keeper, the Earle of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester, the L. chiefe Iustice vnder their hands.</note> the Controller of her Maiesties
houshold, and the Lord chiefe Iustice of <hi>England,</hi>
came to the house, and found the gates shut vpon
them. But after a little stay, they were let in at the
wicket, and assoone as they were within, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
was shut,<note place="margin">The othe of the L. chiefe Iustice <hi>Viua voce.</hi>
               </note> and all their seruants kept out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Bearer of the Seale. In the court they
found the Earles with the rest of the company, the
court in a maner full,<note place="margin">The declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earle of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester <hi>Viua voce.</hi>
               </note> and vpon their comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Essex,</hi> they all flocked and thronged about
them: whereupon the Lord Keeper in an audible
voice deliuered to the Earle the Queenes message,
<pb facs="tcp:446:21"/>
               <hi>That they were sent by her Maiestie to vnderstand
the cause of this their assembly, and to let them knowe
that if they had any particular cause of griefes against
any persons whatsoeuer, they should haue hearing and
iustice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> in a very lowd
and furious voyce declared, <hi>That his life was sought,</hi>
And <hi>that hee should haue bene murdered in his bed,</hi>
And <hi>that he had bene perfidiously dealt withall,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speeches to the like effect. To which the Lord
Chiefe Iustice saide, If any such matter were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
or intended against him, it was fit for him
to declare it, assuring him both a faithfull relation
on their part, and that they coulde not faile of a
princely indifferencie and iustice on her Maiesties
part.</p>
            <p>To which the Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi> tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to obiect the assault made vpon him by
the Lord <hi>Gray:</hi> which my Lord Chiefe Iustice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
vpon him, and saide, That in that case iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
had bene done, and the partie was in prison
for it.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord Keeper required the Earle of
<hi>Essex,</hi> that if he would not declare his griefes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet that then hee would impart them priuately,
and then they doubted not to giue him or procure
him satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Vpon this there arose a great clamor among
the multitude, <hi>Away my Lord: they abuse you, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
you: they vndoe you: you lose time.</hi> Whereupon
my L. Keeper put on his hat, and said with a louder
<pb facs="tcp:446:22"/>
voyce then before: <hi>My Lord, let vs speake with you
priuately, and vnderstand your griefes: and, I doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
you all vpon your allegiance, to lay downe your
weapons, and to depart.</hi> Vppon which wordes the
Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> and all the rest, as disdaining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
put on their hats: and <hi>Essex</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abruptly went from him into the house,
and the Counsellors followed him, thinking hee
would haue priuate conference with them, as was
required.</p>
            <p>And as they passed through the seuerall
roomes, they might heare many of the disordered
companie crie, <hi>Kill them, kill them:</hi> and others cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Nay, but shoppe them vp, keepe them as pledges,
cast the great Seale out at the windowe,</hi> and other
such audacious and traiterous speeches. But
<hi>Essex</hi> tooke holde of the occasion and aduantage,
to keepe in deed such pledges if he were distressed,
and to haue the countenance to leade them with
him to the Court, especially the two great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
of Iustice, and the great Seale of <hi>England</hi> if
he preuailed, and to depriue her Maiestie of the
vse of their counsell in such a strait, and to ingage
his followers in the very beginning by such a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
act, as the imprisonment of Counsellors cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Maiesties royall commaundement for the
suppressing of a rebellious force.</p>
            <p>And after that they were come vp into his
booke chamber, hee gaue order they should bee
kept fast, giuing the charge of their custodie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to Sir <hi>Iohn Dauis,</hi> but adioyned vnto him
<pb facs="tcp:446:22"/>
a warder, one <hi>Owen Salisburie,</hi> one of the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
and wicked persons of the number, hauing
beene a notorious robber, and one that serued the
enemie vnder Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and that bare a
speciall spleene vnto my Lord Chiefe Iustice, who
garded these honourable persons with Muskets
charged, and Matches ready fiered at the chamber
doore.</p>
            <p>This done, the Earle (notwithstanding my Lord
Keeper still required to speake with him) left the
charge of his house with Sir <hi>Gilly Mericke,</hi> and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these words to my Lord Keeper, <hi>Haue patience
for a while, I will goe take order with the Maior and
Sherifes for the Citie, and be with you againe within
halfe an houre,</hi> issued with his troupe into <hi>London,</hi>
to the number of two hundreth, besides those
that remained in the house, choise men for har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
and valour, vnto whom some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and one Noble man did after ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
            <p>But from the time he went forth, it seemes God
did strike him with the spirit of Amazement, and
brought him round againe to the place whence he
first moued.</p>
            <p>For after he had once by <hi>Ludgate</hi> entred into
the Citie, he neuer had as much as the heart or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
to speake any set or confident speech to the
people (but repeated onely ouer and ouer his tale
as he passed by, <hi>That he should haue bene murthered)</hi>
nor to doe any act of foresight or courage: but he
that had vowed hee would neuer bee cooped vp
<pb facs="tcp:446:23"/>
more, cooped himselfe first within the wals of the
Citie, and after within the wals of an house, as arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by Gods Iustice as an example of disloyaltie.
For passing through <hi>Cheapeside,</hi> and so towards
<hi>Smiths</hi> house, and finding, though some came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, yet none ioyned or armed with him, he
prouoked them by speeches as he passed,<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earle of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The L. Sandis.</note> to arme,
telling them, <hi>They did him hurt and no good, to come
about him with no weapons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there was not in so populous a Citie, where
he thought himselfe held so deare, one man, from
the chiefest Citizen, to the meanest Artificer or
Prentise, that armed with him: so as being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
appalled, as diuers that happened to see
him then, might visibly perceiue in his face and
countenance, and almost moulten with sweate,
though without any cause of bodily labour but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the perplexitie and horror of his minde, hee
came to <hi>Smiths</hi> house the Sherife, where he refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
himselfe a little, and shifted him.</p>
            <p>But the meane while it pleased God, that her
Maiesties directions at Court, though in a case so
strange and sudden, were iudiciall and sound. For
first there was commaundement in the morning
giuen vnto the Citie, that euery man should be in
a readinesse both in person and armor, but yet to
keepe within his owne doore, and to expect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
vpon a reasonable &amp; politique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that had they armed suddenly in the
streetes, if there were any ill disposed persons, they
might arme on the one side and turn on the other,
<pb facs="tcp:446:23"/>
or at least if armed men had bene seene to and fro,
it would haue bred a greater tumult, and more
bloodshed: and the nakednesse of <hi>Essex</hi> troupe
would not haue so well appeared.</p>
            <p>And soone after direction was giuen, that the
Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> taking with him the King of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
should proclaime him Traitour in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
parts of the Citie: which was perfourmed
with good expedition and resolution, and the
losse and hurt of some of his Companie. Besides
that, the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi>
Knight Marshall, rode into the Citie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and notified to the people that hee was a
Traitour: from which time diuers of his troupe
withdrawing from him, and none other comming
in to him, there was nothing but despaire. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
stayed a while, as is sayd, at Shirife <hi>Smiths</hi>
house, and there changing his pretext of a priuate
quarell, and publishing, <hi>That the Realme should haue
bene solde to the Infanta,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Erle of Rutl.</note> the better to spurre on the
people to rise,<note place="margin">Essex confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at the Barre.</note> and called, and giuen commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to haue brought armes and weapons of all
sorts, and being soone after aduertised of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
he came forth in a hurry.</p>
            <p>So hauing made some stay in <hi>Gracious street,</hi> and
being dismaid vpon knowledge giuen to him that
forces were comming forwards against him vnder
the conduct of the L. Admirall the Lieutenant of
her Maiesties forces, and not knowing what course
to take, he determined in the end to goe backe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="tcp:446:24"/>
his own house, aswel in hope to haue found
the Counsellers there, and by them to haue serued
someturne, as vpon trust that towardes night his
friends in the City would gather their spirits toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and rescue him, as himselfe declared after to
M. Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the Counsellers, it had pleased God to
make one of the principall offenders his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their deliuery: who seeing my Lords case
desperate, &amp; contriuing how to redeeme his fault,
and saue himselfe, came to sir <hi>Iohn Dauis</hi> and sir <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Mericke,</hi> as sent from my Lord: and so procured
them to be released.</p>
            <p>But the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> with his companie that
was left, thinking to recouer his house, made on
by land towards <hi>Ludgate,</hi> where being resisted by
a company of Pikemen and other forces, gathered
together by the wise and diligent care of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>London,</hi> and commanded by sir <hi>Iohn Luson,</hi>
and yet attempting to cleere the passage, he was
with no great difficultie repulsed. At which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> was fore wounded,
and yong <hi>Tracie</hi> slaine on his part: and one <hi>Waits</hi>
on the Queenes part, and some other. Vpon which
repulse he went backe and fled towards the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terside,
&amp; tooke boat at <hi>Queene hiue,</hi> and so was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
into <hi>Essex house</hi> at the Watergate, which he
fortified and baricado'd: but instantly the Lord
Lieutenant so disposed his Companies, as all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
and issue foorth was cut off from him both by
<pb facs="tcp:446:24"/>
land and by water, and all succours that hee might
hope for, were discouraged: and leauing the Earle
of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Howard,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> and
the Lord <hi>Compton,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Gerrard,</hi> with diuers others, before the house to
landward, my Lord Lieutenant himselfe thought
good, taking with him the Lord of <hi>Effingham,</hi> Lord
<hi>Cobham,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Stanhope,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Sidney,</hi> M.
<hi>Foulk Greuill,</hi> with diuers others, to assaile the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and Banketting house on the Water side, and
presently forced the Garden, and woon to the wals
of the house, and was ready to haue assailed the
house: but out of a Christian and honorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
vnderstanding that there were in the
house the Countesse of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Ladie <hi>Rich,</hi>
with their Gentlewomen, let the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi>
know by Sir <hi>Robert Sidney,</hi> that hee was content to
suffer the Ladies and gentlewomen to come forth.
Whereupon <hi>Essex</hi> returning the Lord Lieutenant
thanks for the compassion and care he had of the
Ladies, desired onely to haue an houres respit to
make way for their going out, and an houre after
to barricado the place againe. Which because it
could make no alteration to the hinderance of the
seruice, the L. Lieutenant thought good to grant.
But <hi>Essex</hi> hauing had some talke within of a sallie,
and despairing of the successe, and thinking better
to yeeld himselfe, sent word, that vpon some condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he would yeeld.</p>
            <p>But the L. Lieutenant vtterly refusing to heare
<pb facs="tcp:446:25"/>
of capitulations, <hi>Essex</hi> desired to speake with my
Lord; who thereupon went vp close to the house:
and the late Earles of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi> with
diuers other Lords and Gentlemen their partakers,
presented themselues vpon the leades: and <hi>Essex</hi>
sayd, hee would not capitulate, but intreat, and
made three petitions. The first, <hi>That they might be
ciuilly vsed:</hi> Whereof the Lord Lieutenant assured
them. The second, <hi>That they might haue an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
triall:</hi> Whereof the Lord Lieutenant answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they needed not to doubt. The third, <hi>That he
might haue</hi> Ashton <hi>a Preacher with him in prison for
the comfort of his soule:</hi> Which the Lord Lieutenant
said he would mooue to her Maiesty, not doubting
of the matter of his request, though he could not
absolutely promise him that person. Whereupon
they all with the ceremony amongst marshall men
accustomed, came downe &amp; submitted themselues
and yeelded vp their swords, which was about ten
of the clocke at night, there hauing beene slaine in
holding of the house, by musket shot, <hi>Owen Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie,</hi>
and some few more on the part of my Lord,
and some fewe likewise slaine and hurt on the
Queenes part, and presently, aswell the Lordes as
the rest of their confederates of quality were seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
taken into the charge of diuers particular
Lords and Gentlemen, and by them conueyed to
the <hi>Tower</hi> and other prisons.</p>
            <p>So as this action, so dangerous in respect of
the person of the Leader, the maner of the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the intent of the plot, brake forth and
<pb facs="tcp:446:25"/>
ended within the compasse of twelue houres, and
with the losse of little blood, and in such sort as the
next day all Courts of Iustice were open, and did
sit in their accustomed maner, giuing good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and all reasonable men iust cause to thinke,
not the lesse of the offenders treason, but the more
of her Maiesties princely magnanimitie and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
foresight in so great a perill, and chiefly
of Gods goodnesse, that hath blessed her
Maiesty in this, as in many things
else, with so rare and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

which trial there passed vpon them
25. Peeres, a greater number then hath bene called
in any former president. Amongst whom her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
did not forbeare to vse many that were of
neere alliance and blood to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and
some others, that had their sonnes and heires ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
that were of his Company, and followed
<pb facs="tcp:446:27"/>
him in the open Action of Rebellion. The Lord
Steward then in Commission, (according to the
solemnitie in such Trials receiued) was the Lord
<hi>Buckhurst,</hi> L. high Treasurer, who with grauity and
temperance directed the Euidence, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and gaue the Iudgement. There was also an
Assistance of eight Iudges, the three chiefe, &amp; fiue
others. The hearing was with great patience and
libertie: the ordinary course not being held, to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the Prisoners, till the whole state of the Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was giuen in: but they being suffered to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
articulatly, to euery branch of the Euidence,
and sometimes to euery particular deposition,
whensoeuer they offered to speake. And not so
onely, but they were often spared to bee interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te'd,
euen in their digressions, and speeches not
much pertinent to their cause. And alwayes when
any doubt in Law was moued, or when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
either by the Prisoners or the Peeres, the
Lord Steward required the Iudges to deliuer the
Law; who gaue their opinions seuerally, not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

            <p>In the Endictment were not layed or charged

<pb facs="tcp:446:27"/>
it was not vnlikely, that in his case, to whom many
were so partiall, some (who would not consider
how things came to light by degrees) might haue
reported, that hee was twife called in Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

of his Rebellion and conspiracie, were onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the Enditement, with the vsuall clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and consequents in Lawe, of compassing the
Queenes death, destruction, and depriuation, and
leuying warre, and the like.</p>
            <p>The Euidence consisted of two parts:
<hi>The plot of surprising her</hi> MAIESTIES
<hi>Person in Court, and, The open Rebellion in
the Citie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The plot was opened according to the former
narration, and proued by the seuerall confessions
of foure witnesses, fully and directly concurring in
the point: Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Dauers,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Dauies,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge.</hi> Of which
number, though Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> were not
at the Councell helde at <hi>Drury house,</hi> no more
then <hi>Essex</hi> himselfe was: yet, hee was priuie to
that which passed. Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge</hi> being
prisoner in the <hi>Gatehouse,</hi> neere the place of triall,
was (at the request of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi>) brought
thither, and auouched <hi>Viua voce</hi> his confession in
all things.</p>
            <p>And these foure prooued all particularities of
surprizing the Court, and the maner of putting
<pb facs="tcp:446:28"/>
the same in execution, and the distributing and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the principall persons and actors, to their
seuerall charges: and the calling of my Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
enemies to trial for their liues, and the fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
of a Parliament, and the altering of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.
And Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn
Dauies,</hi> from Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> did speake to the
point of bringing in a toleration of the Catholike
religion.</p>
            <p>For the ouert Rebellion in the Citie it selfe, it
was likewise opened, according to the former nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and diuided it selfe naturally into 3. parts.</p>
            <p>First, the imprisonment of the Counsellours,
bringing her Maiesties Royall commaundement
to them, vpon their allegeance, to disperse their
Forces. Secondly, the entring the Citie, and the
stirring of the people to rise, as well by prouoking
them to arme, as by giuing forth the slanders, that
the Realme was solde to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the QVEENES Forces at <hi>Ludgate.</hi> And
thirdly, the resistance and keeping of the house a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her MAIESTIES Forces, vnder the charge
and conduct of the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>And albeit these parts were matters notorious,
and within almost euery mans viewe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
yet, for the better satisfaction of the Peeres,
they were fully prooued by the oath of the Lord
Chiefe Iustice of England, being there present,
<hi>Viua voce,</hi> and the Declaration of the Earle of
<pb facs="tcp:446:28"/>
               <hi>Worcester,</hi> being one of the Peeres likewise, <hi>Viua vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi>
touching so much as passed about the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of themselues and the rest: and by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> the Lorde <hi>Sands,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The defence of the late Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> touching
the plot &amp; consultation at <hi>Drury house,</hi> was: <hi>That it
was not proued, that he was at it: And that they could
shew nothing prouing his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent or priuity, vnder his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the action in the Citie,</hi> hee iustified the
pretext of the danger of his life to be a trueth. He
said, that his speech that the Realme should haue
bene sold to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a report he had heard, that Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> should
say priuately, <hi>That the</hi> Infantaes <hi>title to the Crowne
(after her Maiestie) was as good as any other.</hi> He excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the imprisonment of the Counsellors, to haue
bene against his mind, forced vpon him by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
company. He protested he neuer intended in
his heart, any hurt to her Maiesties person: That he
did desire to secure his accesse to her, for which
purpose he thought to pray the helpe of the Citie,
and that he did not arme his men in warlike sort,
nor strooke vp no Drumme, nor the like.</p>
            <p>The defence of the late Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi> to
his part in the plot, and consultation at <hi>Drury house,</hi>
was: <hi>That it was a matter debated, but not resolued nor
concluded; and that the action which was executed, was
not the action which was consulted vpon.</hi> And for the
open action in the citie, hee concurred with <hi>Essex,</hi>
with protestation <hi>of the cleerenesse of his minde for
<pb facs="tcp:446:29"/>
any hurt to the Queenes person: And that it was but
his affection to my Lord of</hi> Essex, <hi>that had drawen him
into the cause.</hi> This was the substance &amp; best of both
their defences. Vnto which the Reply was.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>To the point that the late Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> was
not at the consultation at <hi>Drury-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REPLY.</p>
            <p>It was replied, that it was proued by all the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
that that consultation was held by his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
appointment and direction, and that both the
list of the names, and the principall Articles, were
of his owne hand writing. And whereas he saide,
they could not be shewed extant vnder his hand:
it was prooued by the confession of my Lorde of
<hi>Rutland,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Sands,</hi> that he had prouided
for that himselfe. For, after he returned out of the
Citie to his owne house, he burned diuers papers
which he had in a Cabanet, because (as himselfe
said) they should tell no tales.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>To the point which <hi>Southampton</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<hi>That the Consultation at Drury house, vpon
the list and articles in writing, was not executed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REPLY.</p>
            <p>It was replied, that both that Consultation in
that manner held, if none other act had followed,
was treason: And that the Rebellion following in
the citie, was not a desisting from the other plot,
<pb facs="tcp:446:29"/>
but an inducement and pursuance of it: their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
being plaine on all parts, that, after they had
gotten the aide of the citie, they would haue gone
and possessed the Court.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>To the point, that it was a truth, that <hi>Essex</hi>
should haue bene assailed by his priuate enemies.</p>
            <p>REPLY.</p>
            <p>First, he was required to deliuer, who it was
that gaue him the aduertisement of it, because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
it must light vpon himselfe, &amp; be thought
his owne inuention: whereunto he sayd, that hee
would name no man that day.</p>
            <p>Then it was shewed how improbable it was,
considering that my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> were men, whose estates were better setled
and established, then to ouerthrow their fortunes
by such a crime.</p>
            <p>Besides, it was shewed howe the tale did not
hang together, but varied in it selfe, as the tale of
the two Iudges did, when one said, Vnder the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery-tree,
and another said, Vnder the Figge-tree.
So, sometimes it was, That he should haue beene
murdered in his bed, and sometimes vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and sometimes it should haue bene performed
by Iesuits, some dayes before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was asked what reference the going
into the citie for succour against any his priuate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
had to the imprisoning of the L. Keeper,
and the L. Chiefe Iustice, persons that he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:446:30"/>
to loue and respect; and the Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi>
his kinsman, and Master Controller his Vncle, and
the publishing to the people, that the Realme
should haue bene solde to the Spaniard.</p>
            <p>And lastly, it was sayd, that these were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
footsteps of former Traitours, to make their
quarrell as against their priuate enemies: because,
God vnto lawful kings did euer impart such beams
of his owne glory, as Traytours could not looke
straight vpon them, but euer turned their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against some about them. And that this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his, resembled the Action of <hi>Pisistratus</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
that proceeded so farre in this kinde of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and dissimulation, as he launced his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and came hurt and wounded before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as hauing bene assailed by his priuate enemies,
and by colour thereof obteined a guard about his
person, by helpe of whom, he after vsurped vpon
the State.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>To the point that he heard it reported,
M. Secretary should say: <hi>That the</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes
<hi>title to the Crowne (after her Maiesty) was
as good as any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REPLY.</p>
            <p>Vpon this his allegation, M. Secretary stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out of sight in a priuate place, onely to heare,
(being much moued with so false and foule an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation)
came suddenly forth, and made humble
request to the Lord Steward, that hee might haue
<pb facs="tcp:446:30"/>
the fauour to answere for himselfe. Which being
granted him, in respect of the place he carieth, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a bitter contestation on his part with the Earle,
and a serious protestation of his alienation of heart
from the Spanish nation, in any such condition) he
still vrged the Earle to name the reporter, that all
the circumstances might be knowen. But the Earle
still warily auoiding it, M. Secretary replied, that
seeing he would alledge no Author, it ought to be
reputed his owne fiction. Whereupon the Earle
of <hi>Essex</hi> said, though his owne conscience was a
sufficient testimony to himselfe, that he had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
any vntruth, yet hee would affirme thus
much for the worlds farther satisfaction in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe:
that the Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi> also, had heard
so much reported of M. Secretary: but sayd still,
that he (for his part) would name no body. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
M. Secretary adiured the Earle of <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
by all former friendship, (which had beene in
deed very great betweene them) that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the person: which he did presently, and sayd
it was M. Comptroller. At which speech M. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
straight tooke holde, and said, That he was
glad to heare him named of all others: for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
some malicious person, might peraduenture
haue bene content, to giue credit to so iniurious a
conceit of him, (especially such as were against the
peace wherein hee was imployed, and for which
the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had euer hated him, being euer
desirous to keepe an army on his owne dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
yet he did thinke no man of any vnderstanding
<pb facs="tcp:446:31"/>
would beleeue that he could be so sencelesse, as to
picke out the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his vncle, to lay open to
him his affection to that nation, in a matter of so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
&amp; pernicious consequence: And so did very
humbly craue it at the hands of the Lord Steward,
and all the Peeres, that M. Comptroller might bee
sent for, to make good his accusation.</p>
            <p>Thereupon the Lord Steward sent a Seriant at
Armes for M. Comptroller, who presently came
thither, and did freely and sincerely deliuer, that he
had only said (though hee knew not wel to whom)
that M. Secretary and he, walking in the garden at
Court one morning about two yeeres since, and
talking casually of forreine things, M. Secretary
told him, that one <hi>Doleman</hi> had mainteined in a
booke (not long since printed) that the <hi>Infanta</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> had a good title to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi>
which was all, as M. Comptroller said, that euer he
heard M. Secretary speake of that matter. And so
the weake foundation of that scandall being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned, that matter ended: all that could bee
proued, being no other, then that M. Comptroller
had told an other, who had after told the Earle of
<hi>Essex,</hi> that M. Secretary sayde to him, that such a
booke saide so, which euery man could say, that
hath read it, and no man better knewe then the
Earle himselfe, to whom it was dedicated.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>To the point of both their protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>That they intended no hurt to her Maiesties
person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:446:31"/>REPLY.</p>
            <p>First, the Iudges deliuered their opinions for
matter in Law vpon two points: The one, <hi>That in
case where a subiect attempteth to put himselfe into such
strength as the King shall not be able to resist him, and to
force and compell the King to gouerne otherwise then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne Royall authoritie and direction, it is
manifest Rebellion:</hi> The other, <hi>That in euery Rebellion
the lawe intendeth as a consequent, the compassing the
death and depriuation of the King, as foreseeing that the
Rebell wil neuer suffer that King to liue or raigne, which
might punish or take reuenge of his Treason and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And it was inforced by the Queenes Councell,
that this is not onely the wisedome of the lawes of
the Realme which so defineth of it, but it is also the
censure of forein lawes, the conclusion of common
reason which is the ground of all lawes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue
assertion of experience, which is the
warranty of all reason. For first the Ciuile law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this iudgement, That Treason is nothing els
but <hi>Crimen laesae maiestatis,</hi> or <hi>Diminutae maiestatis,</hi>
making euery offence which abridgeth or hurteth
the power and authoritie of the Prince, as an insult
or inuading of the Crowne, and extorting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
Scepter. And for common reason, it is not
possible that a subiect should once come to that
height as to giue law to his Soueraigne, but what
with insolency of the change, and what with terror
of his owne guiltinesse, he will neuer permit the
King, if he can chuse, to recouer authoritie, nor for
<pb facs="tcp:446:32"/>
doubt of that, to continue aliue. And lastly for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
it is confirmed by all stories and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
That the subiect neuer obteined a superioritie
and command ouer the King, but there followed
soone after, the deposing and putting of the King
to death, as appeareth in our owne Chronicles in
two notable particulars of two vnfortunate Kings:
the one of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, who when he kept
himselfe close for danger, was summoned by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
to come and take vpon him the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Realme: but as soone as he presented
himselfe, was made prisoner, and soone after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to resigne, and in the ende tragically murdered
in <hi>Barkley Castle.</hi> And the other of King <hi>Richard</hi> the
second, who though the Duke of <hi>Hertford,</hi> after,
King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, presented himselfe before
him with three humble reuerences, yet in the ende
was deposed and put to death.</p>
            <p>DEFENCE.</p>
            <p>To the point of not arming his men otherwise,
then with Pistols, Rapiers and Daggers, it was
replied.</p>
            <p>REPLY.</p>
            <p>That that course was held vpon cunning, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to insinuate himselfe into the fauour of the city,
as comming like a friend with an <hi>All haile,</hi> or kisse,
and not as an enemie, making full reckoning that
the City would arme him, and arme with him, and
that he tooke the paterne of his Action, from the
<pb facs="tcp:446:32"/>
day of the <hi>Barricadoes at Paris,</hi> where the Duke of
<hi>Gwyse</hi> entring the citie but with eight Gentlemen,
preuailing with the citie of <hi>Paris</hi> to take his part, as
my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> (thankes be to God) failed of the
Citie of <hi>London,</hi> made the King (whom he thought
likewise to haue surprized) to forsake the towne,
and withdraw himselfe into other places, for his
further safety. And it was also vrged against him
out of the confession of the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that he cried out to the citizens, <hi>That they
did him hurt and no good, to come without weapons,</hi> and
prouoked them to arme: and finding they would
not be mooued to arme with him, sought to arme
his owne troupes.</p>
            <p>This, point by point, was the effect of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
Vpon all which Euidence both the Earles
were found guiltie of Treason by all the seuerall
voyces of euery one of the Peeres, and so receiued
iudgement.</p>

of that which passed after the arreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the late Earles, and at the time
of the suffering of the Earle
of Essex.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> finding that the
consultation at <hi>Drurie house,</hi> and the
secret plots of his premeditated and
prepenced treasons were come to
light, contrary to his expectation,
was touched euen at his parting from the Barre
with a kinde of remorse: especially because he had
caried the maner of his answere, rather in a spirit of
ostentation and glory, then with humilitie and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence:
and brake out in the Hall, while the Lords
were in conference, into these wordes: <hi>That seeing
things were thus caried, he would ere it be long say more
then yet was knowen.</hi> Which good motion of his
minde being after his comming backe to the <hi>Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
first cherished by M. D. of <hi>Norwich,</hi> but after
wrought on by the religious and effectuall perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and exhortations of M. <hi>Abdie Ashton</hi> his
Chaplaine, the man whom he made sute by name
to haue with him for his soules health, as one that
of late time he had bene most vsed vnto, and found
most comfort of, comparing it, when he made the
request, to the case of a Patient, that in his extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
would be desirous to haue that Physician that
was best acquainted with his body: He sent word
the next day to desire to speake with some of the
<pb facs="tcp:446:34"/>
principall Councellours, with whom he desired
also that particularly M. Secretary might come for
one. Vpon which his request, first the L. Admirall,
and M. Secretary, and afterward at two seuerall
times the Lord Keeper of the great Seale, the Lord
high Treasurer, the L. high Admirall, and Master
Secretary repaired vnto him: before whom, after
he had asked the Lord Keeper forgiuenesse for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
him in his house, and M. Secretary, for
hauing wronged him at the Barre, concerning the
matter of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> with signification of his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire to be reconciled to them, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
with all Christian charitie and humanitie,
he proceeded to accuse heauily most of his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
for carying malicious mindes to the State,
and vehemently charged <hi>Cuffe</hi> his man to his own
face, to haue bene a principall instigator of him in
his Treasons, and then disclosed how farre sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Neuill</hi> her Maiesties late Ambassador was priuy
to all the Conspiracie: of whose name till then,
there had bene not so much as any suspition. And
further, at the Lords first comming to him, (not
sticking to confesse that hee knewe her Maiestie
could not be safe while he liued) did very earnestly
desire this fauour of the Queene, that he might die
as priuately as might be.</p>
            <p>And the Morning before his execution, there
being sent vnto him for his better preparation,<note place="margin">The testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the 3. Diuines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hands.</note>
Master Doctor <hi>Mountford,</hi> and Master Doctor <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe</hi>
to ioyne with Master <hi>Abdie Ashton</hi> his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleine,
he did in many words thanke God that hee
<pb facs="tcp:446:34"/>
had giuen him a deeper insight into his offence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sorie he had so stood vpon his iustification at
his Arraignement: since which time, he sayd he
was become a new man, and heartily thanked God
also that his Course was by Gods prouidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.
For, if his proiect had taken effect, God
knoweth (sayd he) what harme it had wrought in
the Realme.</p>
            <p>He did also humbly thanke her Maiestie, that he
should die in so priuate maner (for hee suffered in
the Towre yard, and not vpon the Hill by his owne
special sute) lest the acclamation of the people (for
those were his own words) might be a temptation
to him: adding, That al popularitie &amp; trust in man
was vaine, the experience whereof himselfe had
felt: and acknowledged further vnto them, that he
was iustly and worthily spewed out (for that was
also his owne word) of the Realme, and that the
nature of his offence was like a leprosie that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
farre and neere. And so likewise at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
place of his suffering, he did vse vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of his offence, desiring God to forgiue
him his great, his bloody, his crying, and his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
sinne: and so died very penitently, but yet
with great conflict (as it should seeme for his sins.
For hee neuer mentioned nor remembred there,
wife, children or friend, nor tooke particular leaue
of any that were present, but wholy abstracted and
sequestred himselfe to the state of his conscience,
and prayer.</p>

            <head>THE EFFECT OF THAT
which passed at the Arraignements of
Sir Christopher Blunt, Sir Charles Dauers,
Sir Iohn Dauies, Sir Gillie Mericke,
and Henry Cuffe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE 5. of March by a very honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Commission of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner,</hi>
directed to the Lord high
Admiral, the Lord Chamberlaine,
Master Secretary, the Lord chiefe
Iustice of <hi>England,</hi> Master Chancellour of the
Exchequer, Master Secretary <hi>Herbert,</hi> with diuers
of the Iudges, the Commissioners sitting in the
Court of the Queenes Bench, there were arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and tried by a Iury both of Aldermen of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and other Gentlemen of good credit and sort,
Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Dauers,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn
Dauies,</hi> Sir <hi>Gillie Mericke</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry Cuffe.</hi> The three
first whereof, before they pleaded, asked this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Iudges, <hi>Whether they might not confesse the
Inditeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in part, &amp; plead Not guilty to it in the other
part.</hi> But being resolued by the Iudges, that their
pleading must be generall, they pleaded Not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as did likewise the other two, without any such
question asked. The reason of that question was,
as they confessed, in respect of the clause laid in the
Inditement: <hi>That they intended and compassed the
death and destruction of the Queenes Maiestie:</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose person (although they confessed at the
<pb facs="tcp:446:35"/>
barre, as they had done in their examinations, that
their meaning was to come to her in such strength,
as they should not be resisted, and to require of her
diuers conditions and alterations of gouernment,
such as in their confessions are expressed) neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
they protested, they intended no personall
harme to hirselfe. Whereupon (as at the arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the two Earles) so then againe the Iudges
deliuered the rule of the Law; that the wisedome
and foresight of the Lawes of this land maketh this
iudgement, <hi>That the Subiect that rebelleth or riseth
in forcible maner to ouerrule the Royall will and power
of the King, intendeth to depriue the King both of
crowne and life: and that the Law iudgeth not of the
fact by the intent, but of the intent by the fact.</hi> And the
Queenes Councell did againe inforce that point,
setting forth that it was no mystery or quidditie of
the common Law, but it was a conclusion infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of reason and experience: for that the Crowne
was not a Ceremony or Garland, but consisted of
preeminence and power.</p>
            <p>And therefore, when the subiect will take vpon
him to giue law to the King, and to make the power
Soueraigne and commanding, to become subiect
and commanded: such subiect layeth hold of the
Crowne, and taketh the sword out of the Kings
hands. And that the Crowne was fastened so close
vpon the Kings head, that it cannot be pulled off,
but that head and life, and all will follow, as all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
both in forreine stories and here at home
doe make manifest. And therefore, when their
<pb facs="tcp:446:36"/>
words did protest one thing, and their deedes did
testifie another; they were but like the president of
the protestation vsed by <hi>Manlius</hi> the Lieutenant of
<hi>Catiline,</hi> that conspired against the State of Rome,
who beganne his letter to the Senate with these
words, <hi>Deos homines<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> testor, Patres conscripti, nos ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil
aliud &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was sayde further, that admitting their
protestations were so farre true, that they had not
at that time in their mindes a formed and distinct
cogitation to haue destroyed the Queenes person:
yet nothing was more variable and mutable then
the mind of man, and specially <hi>Honores mutant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi>
when they were once aloft, &amp; had the Queene
in their handes, and were Peeres in my Lorde of
<hi>Essex</hi> his Parliament, who could promise of what
mind they would then be? especially, when my L.
of <hi>Essex</hi> at his Arraignment had made defence of
his first Action of imprisoning the priuie Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
by pretence that he was inforced to it by his
vnruly company. So that if themselues should not
haue had, or would not seeme to haue had that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
and diuelish wickednesse of minde, as to lay
violent handes vpon the Queenes sacred person:
yet, what must be done to satisfie the multitude,
and secure their partie, must be then the question.
Wherein the example was remembred of <hi>Richard</hi>
the third, who (though he were King in possession,
and the rightfull Inheritours but Infants) could
neuer sleepe quiet in his bed, till they were made
away. Much lesse would a Catilinary knot and
<pb facs="tcp:446:36"/>
combination of Rebels (that did rise without so
much as the fume of a Title) euer indure, that a
Queene that had bene their Soueraigne, and had
raigned so many yeeres in such renowne and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
should be longer aliue, then made for their own
turne. And much speech was vsed to the same end.
So that in the end, all those three at the barre said,
That now they were infourmed, and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into a deeper consideration of the matter,
they were sorie they had not confessed the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Blunt at his death, which is set downe in the ende.</note>
And Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> at the time of his
suffering, discharged his conscience in plain terms,
and sayd publiquely before all the people, that he
fawe plainely with himselfe, That if they could not
haue obtained all that they had would, they must
haue drawen blood, euen from the Queene her
selfe.</p>
            <p>The Euidence giuen in against them three,
was principally their owne confessions, charging
euery one himselfe, and the other, and the rest of
the euidence vsed at the Arraignement of the late
Earles, and mentioned before: saue that because it
was perceiued, that that part of the charge would
take no labour nor time, being plaine matter and
confessed, and because some touch had bene giuen
in the Proclamation of the Treasons of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
And chiefly because Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
of the Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and most inward with
my Lord in all his proceedings there: and not so
onely, but further in the confession of <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:446:37"/>
it was precisely contained, <hi>That hee knew the Earle
of</hi> Essex <hi>and</hi> Tyrone, <hi>and</hi> Blunt <hi>the Marshall, to be all
one, and to runne one course:</hi> it was thought fit to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
some part of the Treasons of <hi>Ireland,</hi> such as
were then knowen. Which very happily gaue the
occasion for <hi>Blunt,</hi> to make that discouery of the
purpose to haue inuaded the Realme with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of <hi>Ireland:</hi> which hee then offered, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vttered, and in the end sealed with his blood,
as is hereafter set downe.</p>
            <p>Against <hi>Cuffe</hi> was giuen in Euidence, both Sir
<hi>Charles Dauers</hi> confession, who charged him when
there was any debating of the seuerall enterprises
which they should vndertake, that he did euer bind
firmely, and resolutely for the Court: and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
vnder the Earles hand, auouched by him to
his face, that hee was a principall instigator of him
in his Treasons: but especially a full declaration of
Sir <hi>Henry Neuils,</hi> which describeth and planteth
forth the whole maner of his practising with him.</p>
            <p>The fellow, after he had made some introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by an artificiall and continued speech, and some
time spent in sophisticall arguments, descended to
these two answeres: the one, <hi>For his being within</hi>
Essex house <hi>that day, the day of the Rebellion, they
might as well charge a Lion within a grate with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as him: And for the consultation at</hi> Drury house, <hi>it
was no more Treason then the childe in the mothers
bellie is a childe.</hi> But it was replied, that for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the house, it was not compulsarie, and that
<pb facs="tcp:446:37"/>
there was a distribution in the action, of some to
make good the house, and some to enter the citie,
and the one part held correspondent to the other,
and that in Treasons there were no accessaries, but
all principals.</p>
            <p>And for the consultation at <hi>Drurie house,</hi> it
was a perfect Treason in it selfe, because the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
of the Kings destruction, which by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Law was concluded and implied in that
consultation, was Treason, in the very thought
and cogitation, so as that thought be prooued by
an ouert Acte: And that the same consultation
and debating thereupon, was an ouert Act, though
it had not bene vpon a list of names, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in writing, much more, being vpon matter
in writing.</p>
            <p>And againe, the going into the Citie was a
pursuance and inducement of the enterprize to
possesse the Court, and not a desisting, or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lastly, it was ruled by the Iudges for law,</hi>
That if many do conspire to execute Treason against the
Prince in one maner, and some of them doe execute it
in another maner, yet their Act (though differing in the
maner) is the Act of all them that conspire, by reason of
the generall malice of the intent.</p>
            <p>Against Sir <hi>Gilly Merrick,</hi> the Euidence that
was giuen, charged him chiefly with the matter of
the open Rebellion, that hee was as Captaine or
commander ouer the house, and tooke vpon him
<pb facs="tcp:446:38"/>
charge to keepe it, and make it good as a place of
Retraict for those which issued into the Citie, and
fortifying and barriccadoing the same house, and
making prouision of Muskets, Powder, Pellets and
other munition and weapons for the holding and
defending of it, and as a busie, forward, and noted
Actor in that defence and resistance, which was
made against the Queenes forces brought against
it, by her Maiesties Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>And further to prooue him priuie to the plot,
it was giuen in Euidence, that some fewe dayes
before the Rebellion, with great heat and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
hee had displaced certaine Gentlemen lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in an house fast by <hi>Essex house,</hi> and there plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
diuers of my Lords followers and Complices,
all such as went foorth with him in the Action of
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>That the afternoone before the Rebellion,
<hi>Merricke,</hi> with a great company of others, that
afterwards were all in the Action, had procured
to bee played before them, the Play of deposing
King <hi>Richard</hi> the second.</p>
            <p>Neither was it casuall, but a Play bespoken by
<hi>Merrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not so onely, but when it was told him
by one of the Players, that the Play was olde, and
they should haue losse in playing it, because fewe
would come to it: there was fourty shillings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
giuen to play it, and so thereupon
playd it was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:446:38"/>
So earnest hee was to satisfie his eyes with the
sight of that Tragedie, which hee thought soone
after his Lord should bring from the Stage to
the State, but that GOD turned it vpon their
owne heads.</p>

him thereof, whereby he might frame his course ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and not doe any thing contrary to their
agreement: which letter my selfe did write by <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi>
appointment (for then I was in credite with
him.) In which letter he also desired <hi>Tyrone</hi> to send
him some munition. The letter, with instructions
to that effect, was in my presence deliuered to one
<hi>Turlagh mac Dauie o Kelly,</hi> a man of secrecy, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,
and trust with <hi>Owney,</hi> and he caried it to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone.</hi>
Before whose returne, <hi>Owney</hi> grew suspicious
of me, because I sometimes belonged to <hi>M. Bowen,</hi>
and therfore they would not trust me, so as I could
not see the answere: but yet I heard by many of
their secret counsell, that the effect thereof was,
<hi>That the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>should be king of</hi> England, <hi>and</hi>
Tyrone <hi>of</hi> Ireland.</p>
               <p>Afterwards I met with <hi>Turlagh mac Dauie,</hi> the
messenger aforesayd, and asked him whether hee
brought an answere of the letter from <hi>Tyrone.</hi> He
<pb facs="tcp:446:42"/>
sayd he did, and deliuered it to <hi>Owney.</hi> And then I
asked him what he thought of the warres. He told
me he had good hope the last yeere, and had none
this yere: his reason was (as he said) that the Earle
of <hi>Essex</hi> was to take their part, and they should aid
him towards the conquest of <hi>England:</hi> and nowe
they were hindred thereof by meanes of his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
               <p>I dwelling with the Tanist of the Countrey (my
mothers cousin germain) heard him speake sundry
times, <hi>That nowe the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>had gotten one of
the swords, he would neuer forgoe his gouernement, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
hee became King of</hi> England: <hi>which was neere at
hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I saw a letter which the Earle of</hi> Essex <hi>writ to</hi>
Owney, <hi>to this effect,</hi> That if <hi>Owney</hi> came to him, he
would speake with him about that, which if hee would
follow, should be happie for him and his Countrey.</p>

letter to him in lanuarie, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his misfortune: that hee desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his company, and desired his
repaire vp to him, by the second of
Februarie, That he came to Towne on Saturday
seuen-night before the Earles insurrection: and
that the same night late he visited the Earle. Who
after complements, told him, that he stood on his
guard, and resolued not to hazard any more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
or restraints: that he desired him to
rest him that night, and to repaire vnto him againe,
but in such sort as it might not be noted.</p>
               <p>That he had bene with the Earle two or three
times that weeke; and on Saturday, being the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
of February, the Earle tolde him, that hee
had bene sent for by the Lordes, and refused to
come: deliuering further, that he resolued to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himselfe from any more restraint.</p>
               <p>He further saith, that it was in question, the
same Saturday night, to haue stirred in the night,
and to haue attempted the Court. But being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb facs="tcp:446:44"/>
whether the Earle could haue had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
company to haue done any thing in the night:
he answered, that all the Earles companie were
readie at one houres warning, and had bene so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in respect that he had meant long before to
stand vpon his guard.</p>
               <p>That it was resolued to haue the Court first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
that the Earle had three hundred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to doe it: but that he the saide <hi>Ferdinando
Gorge</hi> was a violent disswader of him from that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and the Earle most confident in the party of
<hi>London,</hi> which he meant (vpon a later dispute)
first to assure: and that hee was also assured of a
partie in <hi>Wales,</hi> but meant not to vse them, vntill
he had bene possessed of the Court.</p>
               <p>That the Earle, and sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> had sent to speake
with him in the morning, the saide sir <hi>Christopher
Blunt</hi> perswaded him, either to surprise sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh,</hi> or to kill him. Which when hee vtterly
refused, sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> sent foure shot after
him in a boat.</p>
               <p>That at the going out of <hi>Essex house</hi> gate, many
cried out: <hi>To the Court, to the Court.</hi> But my Lorde
of <hi>Essex</hi> turned him about towards <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he meant after possession of the Court, to

               <p>At that time of the Consultation on Saturday
night, my Lord was demanded what assurance he
had of those hee made account to bee his friends

in the Citie? Whereunto he replyed, that there
was no question to be made of that: for, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the rest, that was presently in one of the
greatest commaunds amongst them, held himselfe
to be interessed in the cause, (for so hee phrased it)
and was Coronell of a thousand men, which were
readie at all times, besides others that hee helde
himselfe as assured of, as of him, and able to make
as great numbers. Some of them had at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
(as he reported to vs) sent vnto him, taking

praying me to meete my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> Sir

at <hi>Drury house</hi> where I should see a schedule of

Whither I came accordingly, and found the
foresaid Earle, Sir <hi>Charles Dauers,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Dauies,</hi>
and one Master <hi>Litleton.</hi> The names were shewed,
and numbred to bee sixe score: Earles, Barons,
Knights, and Gentlemen. The proiects were these:
Whether to attempt the Court, or the Tower, or
to stirre his friends in <hi>London</hi> first, or whether both
the Court and Tower at an instant? I disliked that
counsel. My reasons were, that I alledged to them:
First, to attempt both with those numbers, was
not to bee thought on, because that was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
and therefore aduised them to thinke of
some thing else. Then they would needs resolue
<pb facs="tcp:446:45"/>
to attempt the Court, withall desired in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But I prayed them first to set downe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how it might be done. Then Sir <hi>Iohn Dauies</hi>
tooke inke and paper, and assigned to diuers prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

before, or thereabout.</p>
               <p>Being demaunded what he knew? then he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That my Lord consulted to possesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

he might finde least opposition. For executing of
which enterprises and of other affaires, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> sir <hi>Charles Dauers,</hi> sir
<hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> and himselfe, to meete at Drury
house, and there to confider of the same, and such
other proiects, as his Lordship deliuered them.
And principally, for surprising of the Court, and
for the taking of the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> About
which businesse they had two meetings: which
were fiue or sixe dayes before the insurrection.</p>
               <p>He further sayth, That Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi>

and aduised with my Lord himselfe about other

               <p>Being demanded what was resolued in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of these foure before named? He saith, that
sir <hi>Charles Dauers</hi> was appointed to the Presence
chamber, and himselfe to the Hall. And that my
Lord was to determine himselfe, who should haue
guarded the Court gate, and the Water gate. And
that Sir <hi>Charles Dauers</hi> vpon a signall or a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,
should haue come out of the Presence into
the Guard chamber. And then some out of the
Hall to haue met him, and so haue stept betweene

they hoped to haue found but a doozen, or some
such small number.</p>
               <p>Being asked, whether he heard that such as my
Lord misliked, should haue receiued any violence?
He saith, that my Lord auowed the contrary: And
that my Lorde said, He would call them to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
tryall, and not vse the sword.</p>
               <p>Being demanded whether my Lord thought his
enemies to be Spanish, <hi>bona fide,</hi> or no? He saith,
that hee neuer heard any such speech: and, if my

               <p>Being demaunded what party my Lord had in

<hi>Littleton</hi> came in towards the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:446:48"/>The points which the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> proiected
vnder his hand were these.</p>
               <p>First, whether it were fit to take the Tower of
<hi>London.</hi> The reason whereof was this: that after
the Court was possessed, it was necessary to giue
reputation to the Action, by hauing such a place,
to bridle the Citie, if there should be any mislike
of their possessing the Court.</p>
               <p>To the possessing of the Court, these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
were considered.</p>
               <p>First, the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> should haue assembled
all the Noblemen and Gentlemen of qualitie on
his party: out of which number, hee should haue
chosen so many as should haue possessed all the
places of the Court, where there might haue
beene any likelihood of resistance. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> with diuers No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
should haue presented himselfe to the
Queene.</p>
               <p>The maner how it should haue beene execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was in this sort. Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> should
haue had charge of the vtter gate, as hee thinketh.
Sir <hi>Charles Dauers</hi> this Examinate, with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
should haue made good the Presence, and
should haue seazed vpon the Halberds of the
Guard. Sir <hi>Iohn Dauies</hi> should haue taken charge
of the Hall. All this being set, vpon a signall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the Earle should haue come into the Court
with his company.</p>
               <p>Being asked what they would haue done after?
<pb facs="tcp:446:48"/>
Hee saith, they would haue sent to haue satisfied
the Citie, and haue called a Parliament.</p>
               <p>These were the resolutions set downe by the
Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> of his owne hand, after diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>Cuffe</hi> was euer of opinion, that the

the Lord Keeper of
the great Seale, the Earle of
<hi>VVorcester,</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Knollis</hi> Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of her Maiesties Householde, and the
Lord Chiefe Iustice of <hi>England,</hi> being
commaunded by direction from the
QVEENES MAIESTIE, did
repaire to the late earle of <hi>Essex</hi> his house,
and finding the gate shut against them,
after a little stay they were let in at the
<pb facs="tcp:446:52"/>
wicket. And assoone as they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the gate, the wicket was shutte vpon
them, and all their seruants kept out.</p>
               <p>At their comming thither, they
found the court full of men assembled
together in verie tumultuous sort: The
Earles of <hi>Essex, Rutland,</hi> and <hi>Southampton,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Sandys,</hi> Master <hi>Parker,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> Sir <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Blunt,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Dauers,</hi> and manie
other Knights and Gentlemen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons vnknowen, which flocked
together about the Lorde Keeper, &amp;c.
And thereupon the Lorde Keeper tolde
the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> that they were sent
from her MAIESTIE, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the cause of this their assembly, and
to let them know, That if they had any
particular cause of griefe against any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whatsoeuer, it should be heard, and
they should haue iustice.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> with a
very lowd voice declared, That his life
vvas sought, and that hee should haue
beene murthered in his bed; that he had
<pb facs="tcp:446:52"/>
beene perfidiously dealt vvith; that his
hand had beene counterfaited, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vvritten in his name; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they vvere assembled there together
to defend their liues: with much other
speech to like effect. Hereupon the Lord
Chiefe Iustice sayd vnto the Earle, That
if they had any such matter of griefe, or if
any such matter vvere attempted or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
against him, he vvilled the Earle to
declare it, assuring him that it should be
truely related to her MAIESTIE, and
that it should be indifferently heard, and
iustice should be done, vvhomsoeuer it
concerned.</p>
               <p>To this the Earle of <hi>Southampton</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
the assault made vpon him by the
Lord <hi>Gray.</hi> Whereunto the Lord Chiefe
Iustice sayd, That in his case, iustice had
beene done, and the partie imprisoned
for it. And hereupon the Lord Keeper
did eftsoones vvill the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> that
vvhatsoeuer priuate matter or offence
hee had against any person vvhatsoeuer,
if hee vvould deliuer it vnto them, they
<pb facs="tcp:446:53"/>
vvould faithfully and honestly deliuer it
to the QVEENES MAIESTY,
and doubted not to procure him honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and equall iustice, whomsoeuer it
concerned: requiring him, that if hee
would not declare it openly, that hee
woulde impart it vnto them priuatelie,
and doubted not but they would satisfie
him in it.</p>
               <p>Vpon this there was a great clamour
raised amongst the multitude, crying,
<hi>Away my Lorde, They abuse you,
They betray you, They vndoe you,
You lose time.</hi> Whereupon the Lord
Keeper put on his Hat, &amp; said with a loud
voice, My Lord, let vs speake with you
priuately, and vnderstand your griefes:
And I command you all vpon your alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
to lay downe your vveapons, and
to depart, vvhich you ought all to doe,
being thus commanded, if you be good
Subiects, and owe that duetie to the
QVEENES MAIESTY which
you professe. Whereupon they all brake
<pb facs="tcp:446:53"/>
out into an exceeding loud shout and cry,
crying, <hi>All, all, all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whilest the Lord Keeper was
speaking, and commanding them vpon
their allegiance, as is before declared, the
Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> and the most part of that
Company did put on their hats, and so
the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> went into the house,
and the Lord Keeper, &amp;c. followed him,
thinking that his purpose had beene to
speake with them priuately, as they had
required. And as they were going, some
of that disordered Companie cried, <hi>Kill
them.</hi> And as they were going into the
great Chamber, some cried, <hi>Cast the
great Seale out of the window.</hi> Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cried there, <hi>Kill them:</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sayd, <hi>Nay, let vs shop them vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lorde Keeper did often call to
the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> to speake with them
priuately, thinking still that his meaning
had beene so, vntill the Earle brought
them into his backe Chamber, and there
<pb facs="tcp:446:54"/>
gaue order to haue the further doore of
that Chamber shut fast. And at his going
foorth out of that Chamber, the Lorde
Keeper pressing againe to haue spoken
with the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Earle sayd,
<hi>My Lords, be patient a while, and
stay heere, and I will goe into</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<hi>and take order with the Maior
and Shiriffes for the Citie, and will be
heere againe within this halfe houre.</hi>
And so departed from the Lord Keeper,

that hee would make as many men to assist him as

               <p>SIr <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> being hurt, and lying in the

with him: where being none but we three, he told
vs, he found it necessarie for him to goe into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and thought it fit to carie with him as much
of the Armie, as he could conueniently transport,
to goe on shore with him to <hi>Wales,</hi> and there to
make good his landing with those, till hee could
send for more. Not doubting but his Army would
so increase in a small time, that hee should bee able
to march to <hi>London,</hi> and make his conditions, as he
desired.</p>

vnfit, aswell in respect of his conscience to
God, and his loue to his countrey, as his duetie to
his Souereigne, of which, he (of all men) ought to

               <head>¶The speaches of Sir Chr. Blunt, at
the time of his death, as neere
as they could be remembred
March 18. 1600.</head>
               <p>MY Lords, and you that be present, Although
I must confesse, that it were better fitting the
little time I haue to breath, to bestow the same in
asking God forgiuenes for my manifold and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
sinnes, then to vse any other discourse, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially,
hauing both an imperfection of speech,
and God knowes, a weake memorie, by reason of
my late grieuous wound: Yet to satisfie all those
that are present, what course hath bene held by me,
in this late enterprise, because I was sayd to be an
Instigator, and setter on of the late Earle, I will
truely, and vpon the perill of my soule, speake the
trueth.</p>
               <p>It is true, that the first time that euer I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
of any dangerous discontentment in my L.
of <hi>Essex,</hi> was about three yeeres agoe, at <hi>Wansted,</hi>
vpon his comming one day from <hi>Greenwich.</hi> At
that time he spake many things vnto mee, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
into no particulars, but in generall termes.</p>
               <p>After which time, he neuer brake with me in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
matter, tending to the alteration of the State, (I
protest before God) vntill he came into <hi>Ireland,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then I might conceiue, that he was of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
and discontented mind. But, when I lay at
the Castle of <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi> called <hi>Reban,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:446:61"/>
grieuously hurt, and doubted of my life: hee came
to visit mee, and then began to acquaint me with
his intent.</p>
               <p>As hee thus spake, the Sheriffe began to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
him, and told him the houre was past. But my
Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> Captaine of the
Guard, called to the Sheriffe, and required him not
to interrupt him, but to suffer him quietly to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his prayers and confessions. Sir <hi>Christopher
Blunt</hi> said, Is Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> there? Those on
the scaffold answered, Yea. To whom Sir <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Blunt</hi> spake on this maner.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> I thanke God that you are
present. I had an infinite desire to speake with you,
to aske you forgiuenes ere I died, both for the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
done you, and for my particular ill intent towards
you: I beseech you forgiue me. Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>
answered, that he most willingly forgaue him, and
besought God to forgiue him, and to giue him his
diuine comfort: protesting before the Lord, that
whatsoeuer Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt</hi> meant towards
him, for his part, he neuer had any ill intent towards
him: And further saide to Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> I
pray you without offence, let me put you in minde
that you haue bene esteemed, not only a principall
prouoker and perswader of the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> in all
his vndutifull courses, but especially an aduiser in
that which hath bene confessed of his purpose to
transport a great part of her Maiesties Armie out
of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to land at <hi>Milford,</hi> and
thence to turne it against her sacred person. You
<pb facs="tcp:446:61"/>
shall doe well to tell the trueth, and to satisfie the
world. To which he answered thus.</p>
               <p>Sir, if you will giue me patience, I will deliuer a
trueth, speaking now my last, in the presence of
God, in whose mercie I trust. And then hee dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
himselfe to my Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and the rest that sate on horsebacke neere the
scaffold.</p>
               <p>When I was brought from <hi>Reban</hi> to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
lodged in the Castle, his Lordship and the Earle of
<hi>Southampton</hi> came to visite me; and to be short, he
began thus plainely with me: <hi>That hee intended to
transport a choise part of the Armie of</hi> Ireland <hi>into</hi>
England, <hi>and land them in</hi> Wales, <hi>at</hi> Milford, <hi>or
thereabouts: and so securing his descent, thereby would
gather such other forces, as might inable him to march
to</hi> London. To which, I protest before the Lord
God, I made this, or the like answere: that I would
that night consider of it, which I did.</p>
               <p>And the next day the Earles came againe: I told
them, that such an enterprise, as it was most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
so would it cost much blood, as I could not
like of it: besides many hazzards, which at this time
I cannot remember vnto you, neither will the time
permit it. But I rather aduised him to goe ouer
himselfe with a good traine, and make sure of the
Court, and then make his owne conditions.</p>
               <p>And although it be true, that (as we all protested
in our examinations and arraignements) we neuer
resolued of doing hurt to her Maiesties person: (for
in none of our consultations was there set downe
<pb facs="tcp:446:62"/>
any such purpose) yet, <hi>I know, and must confesse, if we
had failed of our ends, we should (rather then haue bene
disapointed) euen haue drawne blood from her selfe.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
henceforward, he dealt no more with mee herein,
vntill he was discharged of his keeper, at <hi>Essex house.</hi>
And then, he againe asked mine aduise, and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the matter with me; but resolued not. I went
then into the Countrey, and before he sent for me
(which was some tenne daies before his Rebellion)
I neuer heard more of the matter. And then hee
wrote vnto mee, to come vp, vpon pretence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
some assurances of land, and the like I will
leaue the rest vnto my confessions, giuen to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Lord Admirall, and worthy M. Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
(to whom I beseech you sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
me) I can requite their fauourable &amp; charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
dealing with me, with nought els but my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for them. And I beseech God of his mercy, to
saue and preserue the Queene, who hath giuen
comfort to my soule, in that I heare shee hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
mee all, but the sentence of the Lawe, which I
most worthily deserued, and do most willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
and hope that GOD will haue mercy and
compassion on me, who haue offended him as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes, as euer sinfull wretch did. I haue lead a
life so farre from his precepts, as no sinner more.
God forgiue it mee, and forgiue mee my wicked
thoughts, my licentious life, and this right arme of
mine, which (I feare me) hath drawen blood in this
last Action. And I beseech you all beare witnesse,
that I die a Catholike, yet so, as I hope to be saued
<pb facs="tcp:446:62"/>
onely by the death and passion of <hi>Christ,</hi> and by his
merits, not ascribing any thing to mine owne
works. And I trust you are all good people, and
your prayers may profit me. Farewell my worthy
Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Compton,</hi> and to you all,
God send you both to liue long in honour. I will
desire to say a few prayers, and imbrace my death
most willingly. With that hee turned from the
rayle, towards the Executioner: and the Minister
offering to speake with him, he came againe to the
raile, and besought that his conscience might not
be troubled, for he was resolued; which he desired
for Gods sake. Whereupon commandement was
giuen, that the Minister should not interrupt him
any further. After which he prepared himselfe to
the blocke, and so died very manfully and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</p>

               <p>VPon Saturday the 21. of February, after the
late Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had desired vs to come to
him, as well to deliuer his knowledge of those trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which he had formerly denied at the Barre,
as also to recommend his humble and earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
that her Maiesty would bee pleased (out of
her grace and fauour) to suffer him to die priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Towre: He did marueilous earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb facs="tcp:446:63"/>
that we would suffer him to speake vnto <hi>Cuffe</hi>
his Secretary: Against whome hee vehemently
complained vnto vs, to haue bene a principall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigator
to these violent courses, which he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
Wherein he protested, that he chiefly
desired that he might make it appeare, that he was
not the onely perswader of these great offences,
which they had committed: but that <hi>Blunt, Cuffe,
Temple,</hi> besides those other persons, who were at
the priuate conspiracie at <hi>Drury house</hi> (to which
though these three were not called, yet they were
priuy) had most malicious and bloody purposes,
to subuert the State and Gouernment: Which
could not haue bene preuented, if his proiect had
gone forward.</p>
               <p>This request being graunted him, and <hi>Cuffe</hi>
brought before him, hee there directly and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
charged him. And amongst other spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
vsed these words: Henry Cuffe, <hi>call to God for
mercy, and to the Queene, and deserue it, by declaring
trueth. For I, that must now prepare for another world,
haue resolued to deale clearely with God, and the world:
and must needes say this to you; You haue bene one of the
chiefest instigators of me, to all these my disloyall courses,
into which I haue fallen.</hi>
