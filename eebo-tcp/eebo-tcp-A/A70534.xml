            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE ARCH-BISHOP of CANTERBURY HIS LETTER TO The King concerning the Plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and written with his own hand.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Majeſty,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS great as the Secret is which comes herewith, yet I chooſe rather to ſend it in this Silent Covert way, and I hope ſafe, then to come thither, and bring it my ſelf. Firſt, becauſe I am no way able to make haſt enough with it. Secondly, becauſe ſhould I come at this time, and antedate the meeting; There would be more Jealouſie, of the Buſineſs, and more Enquiry after it, eſpecially If I being once there, ſhould return again before that day, as I muſt if this be followed, as is moſt fit.</p>
            <p>The Danger it ſeems is imminent, and laid by God knows whom; but to be Executed by them, which are very near about your (for the great honour which I have to be in danger with you, or for you; I paſs not, ſo your Sacred Perſon, and the State may be ſafe.) Now may it pleaſe Your Majeſty, this Information is either true, or there is ſome miſtake in it: If it be true, the Perſons which make the diſcovery will deſerve thanks and reward; if there ſhould be any miſtake in it, your Majeſty can loſe nothing but a little ſilence.</p>
            <p>The Buſineſs (if it be) is extream foul, the Diſcovery thus by God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offered ſeems fair. I do hereby humbly Beg it upon my knees of Your Majeſty, that you will conceal this Buſineſs from every Creature and his name that ſends this to me. And I ſent his Letters to me to Your Majeſty, that You may ſee his ſence both of the buſineſs and of the Secreſy. And ſuch Inſtructions as You think fit to give him, I beſeech you let them be in your own hand for his Warrant without imparting them to any. And if Your Majeſty leave it to his diſcrection to ſollow it therein in the beſt way he can, that in your own hand will be inſtruction and warrant enough for him; and if You pleaſe to return it herewith preſently to me, I will ſend an Expreſs away with it preſently. In the mean time I have by this Expreſs return'd him this Anſwer, that I think he ſhall do well to hold on the Treaty with theſe Men, with all Care and Secreſy, and drive on to the diſcovery ſo ſoon as the Buſineſs is ripe for it, that he may aſſure himſelf and them, they ſhall not want reward, if they do the Service; That for my part he ſhall bee ſure of ſecreſy, and that I am moſt confident Your Majeſty will not impart it to any. That he have a ſpecial Eye to the 8 and 9 Propoſition. SIR, for God's ſake and your own ſafety, ſecreſy in this Buſineſs, and I beſeech you ſend me back this Letter, and all that comes with it ſpeedily and ſecretly, and truſt not your own Pockets with them. I ſhall not eat nor ſleep in quiet, till I receive them, and ſo ſoon as I have them again and Your Majeſty's Warrant to proceed, no diligence ſhall be wanting in me to help on the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>This is the greateſt Buſineſs that ever was put to me, and if I have herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd or don any thing amiſs, I moſt humbly crave your Majeſty's pardon, and I am willing to hope I have not he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>in err'd in judgment, and infidelity <hi>I</hi> never will.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters came to me September 10 at night, and <hi>I</hi> ſent theſe away accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the date hereof, being extreamly weary'd with writting this Letter, copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out theſe other which come with this, and diſpaching my Letters back to him that ſent theſe, all in my own hand; once again Secreſy for God's ſake, and your own: To his moſt bleſſed protection, <hi>I</hi> commend your Majeſty and all your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and <hi>I</hi> am.</p>
