         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PANEGYRIC
TO
CHARLES the II.
PRESENTED
TO HIS MAJESTY
On the Day of His INAUGURATION,
April 23. MDCLXI.</head>
            <p>I Have decreed with my self (O best and greatest of Kings!)
to publish the just resentiments of a heart, perfectly touch'd
with the Joy and Universal Acclamations of your People,
for your this dayes Exaltation and glorious investiture.
And truly, it was of custome us'd to good and gracious
Princes, upon lesser occasions, to pronounce and celebrate their merits
with Elogies and Panegyrics; but if ever they were due, it is to your
Majesty this Day; because as your Virtues are superiour to all that
pass<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d before you; so is the Conjuncture, and the steps by which you
are happily ascended to it, Miraculous, and alltogether stupendious:
So that what the former Ages might produce to deprecate their
fears, or flatter the Inclinations of a Tyrant, we offer spontaneously,
and by Instinct, without Artifice to your Serene Majesty, our just and
rightfull Soveraign. And if in these expressions of it, and the formes
we use, it were possible to exceed, and so offend your Modesty; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
only (great Sir) do we not fear to disobey you; since it is not in
your power to deny us our rejoycing, nor indeed in ours, to moderate.
Permit us therefore (O best of Kings) to follow our genius, and to
consecrate your Name, and this dayes exaltation to that posterity
which you alone have preserved, and which had certainly seen its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
but for your happy Restauration; so that your Majesty does not
so much accept a benefit from, as give it to your Subjects. For though
the fulness of this Dayes joy, be like the seven years of plenty; yet,
is that bread far more sweet, which is eaten with remembrance of
the past Famine (too bitter, alas! to be forgotten on the suddain) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially,
when it may serve to illustrate our present felicity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to your Majesties glory: For so the skillful Artist, studious of making
a surprising peice, or representing some irradiated Deity, deepens the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105324:3"/>
shadowes sometimes with the darkest touches, and approaching to hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
it self, thereby to render his lights the more refulgent, and striking
in the eyes of the Spectator.</p>
            <p>Let us then call to mind (and yet for ever cursed be the memory of it)
those dismal clouds, which lately orespread us, when we served the
lusts of those immane Usurpets, greedy of power, that themselves
might be under none; Cruel, that they might murther the Innocent
without cause; Rich, with the publick poverty; strong, by putting the
sword into the hands of furies, and prosperous by unheard of perfidie.
Armies, Battails, Impeaching, Imprisonment, Arraining, Condemning,
Proscribing, Plundring. Gibbets and Executions were the eloquent expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of our miseries: There was no language then heard but of Perjury,
Delusion, Hypocrsie, Heresie, Taxes, Excises, Sequestration, Decimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a thousand like barbarities: In summe, the solitudes were filled
with noble Exiles, the Cities with rapacious Theives, the Temples with
Sacrilegious Villains; They had the spoiles of Provinces, the robbing of
Churches, the goods of the slain, the Stock of Pupils, the plunder of
Loyal Subjects; no Testament, no State secure, and nothing escaped
their cruelty and insatiable avarice. For if it be sweet in prosperity, to
consider of the past adventures, if tempests commend the Haven; War,
Peace; and our last sharp sickness, our present Health and Vigour; why
should it not delight your Majesty to hear of the miseries we have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
since they re-inforce your own felicity, and the benefits which
we receive by it? where then should I begin but with thy Calamities,
O unfortunate <hi>England!</hi> who hadst only the priviledge of being misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when all the World were happy: But I will not go too far in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the sorrowes which are vanish't, or uncover the buried memory
of the evils past; least whilst we strive to represent the vices of others,
we seem to contaminate your Sacred purple, or alloy our present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing;
since that only is sign of a perfect and consummate felicity,
when even the very remembrance of evils past, is quite forgotten.</p>
            <p>Miraculous Reverse! O marvel greater then Mans Counsel! who
will believe that which his eyes do see? what before a twenty years
confusion had destroy'd; behold a few moneths have restor'd: But the
wonder does yet so much more astonish, that the grief was not
so universal for having suffer'd under such a Tyranny, as for having been
so long depriv'd of so excellent a Prince: No more then do we hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
accuse our past miseries; All things are by your presence repair'd,
and so reflourish; as if they even rejoyc'd they had once been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd,
<hi>Auctior tuis facta beneficiis.</hi> So as not only a Diadem binds your
sacred Temples this day; but you have even crown'd all your Subjects
too; so has your auspicious presence gilded all things; our Churches,
Tribunals, Theaters, Palaces, lift up their heads again; the very fields
do laugh and exalt. O happy, and blessed spring! not so glorious yet
with the pride and enamel of his flowers, the golden corn, and the
gemms of the pregnant Vine, as with those Lillies and Roses which
bloom and flourish in your Chaplet this day, to which not only these, but
even all the productions of nature seem to bend, and pay their homage.</p>
            <p>And let it be a new year, a new <hi>AEra,</hi> to all the future Generations,
as it is the beginning of this, and of that immense, <hi>Platonic</hi> Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105324:3"/>
for what could arrive more justly, more stupendious, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the eight sphear it self now hurled about? For no sooner came
our <hi>CHARLES</hi> on shore, but every Man was in the Haven where
he would be; the storm Universally ceas'd, and every one ran forth to
see our <hi>Palladium, tanquam coelo delapsum:</hi> Virgins, Children, Women,
trembling old Men, venerating the very ship that wafted our <hi>Iason</hi>
and his <hi>Heroes,</hi> ravish'd with the sight, yet hardly believing for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment;
the greatness of the miracle, oppressing our senses, and
endangering our very faith.
<q>
                  <l>Credetne hoc olim ventura posteritas?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I would prayse you Great Prince, but having begun; where shall I
make an end? since there remains not a Topic through all that kind,
but one might write Decads of it, without offending the truth, were it as
secure of your modesty; since I am as well to consider what your ears
can suffer, as what is owing to your Virtues: On what heads shall I
extend then my discourse? your Birth, Country, Form, Education,
Manners<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Studies, Friends, Honours and Fortune run through all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of the Demonstrative: An Orator could have nothing more to
wish for, nor your Majesty to render you more accomplish'd.</p>
            <p>Shall I consider then your Majesty as you were a Son to that glorious
Father before his <hi>Apotheosis?</hi> As you were your self a Confessor after
it; As you are now this day in your Zenith and exaltation; and as
we Augure you will by Gods blessing prove to your Subjects hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
For even through all these does our prospect lead us; Nor may
it be objected that what shall be spoken of your Majesty, can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to any other; since the Fortune and Events of the rest of Princes,
have been so differing from yours; as seeming to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by Men alone, and second Causes; yours only by God, and as it
were by Miracle.</p>
            <p>I begin then with your early Piety to that Kingly Martyr whose
Sacred dictates did institute your tender years, and whose sufferings
were so much alleviated by your Majesties early proficiency in all that
might presage a hopefull and glorious Successor: For so did you run
through all his Vicissitudes, during that implacable war, which
sought nothing more then to defeat you of all opportunities of a Princely
education, as fearing your future Virtues; because they knew the stock
from whence you sprung, was not to be destroy'd by wounding the
body, so long as such a Branch remained.
<q>
                  <l>Duris at ilex tonsa bipennibus</l>
                  <l>Nigrae feraci frondis in Algido,</l>
                  <l>Per damna, per caedes, ab ipso</l>
                  <l>Ducit opes, animumque ferro.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst he Reign'd and Govern'd, you learn'd only to obey; Living
your own Princely Impress;<note place="margin">ICHDIEN.</note> as knowing it would best instruct you one
day how to Command, and which we now see accomplish'd: These
then are the effects, when Princes are the Sons of Nobles; since on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such know best to support the weight, who use to bear betimes, and
by degrees; not those who rashly pull it on their shoulders; because
they take it with less violence, less ambition, less jealousie: None so
secure a Prince, as he that is so born.</p>
            <p>But no sooner did that blessed Martyr expire, then our redivive <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105324:4"/>
appear'd; rising from those Sacred Ashes Testator and Heir; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and yet Son; Another, and yet the same; introsuming as it were
his Spirit, as he breath'd it out, when singing his own Epicedium and
Genethliack together, he seem'd prodigal of his own life to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double'd
in your felicity: Thus, <hi>Rex nunquam moritur.</hi> O admirable
conduct of the Divine Providence, to immortalize the image of a just
Monatch: <hi>Ipsa quidem, sed non eadem, quia &amp; ipsa, nec ipsa est.</hi> Since
that may as truly be apply'd to your Majesty, which was once to the wisest
of Kings: <hi>Mortuus est Pater ejus, &amp; quasi non mortuus, similem enim reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
sibi post se.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But with how much prudence, is serenity attributed amongst the
titles of Princes, and the beams of the sun to irradiate their Crowns;
That the Scepter bears a Flower; since as that glorious planet produces,
so does it also wither them; and there is nothing lasting, save their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which are indeed their essential parts, and only immortal; For
even yet did the clouds intercept our day with the continuance of so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
a storm, as it obnubilated all those hopes of ours. It is an infinite
adventure, if in a Princes Family (once overcast) it ever grow fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
again, but by a singular and extraordinary providence. I mention
this to increase the wonder, and reinforce your felicity. Empires passe,
Kingdomes are translated, and dominions cease: The <hi>Cecropides</hi> of old,
the <hi>Arsacides,</hi> the <hi>Theban, Corinthian, Syracusian,</hi> and sundry more lasted not
to the fourth Age without strange and prodigious tragedies; but why go
we so far back, when a few Centuries present us with so many fresh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions?
How many nests has the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle changed? <hi>Bulgarian,
Saracen, Latine;</hi> In the <hi>Comneni, Isaaci, Paleologi,</hi> &amp;c. even till it dash'd
it self in pieces against the <hi>Oetoman</hi> rock. What mutations have been in
the house of <hi>Arragon?</hi> How many Riders has the <hi>Parthenopean</hi> horse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saddl'd
and flung? How many <hi>Sicily?</hi> What changes have been in <hi>Italy,</hi>
What in <hi>France,</hi> and indeed through all <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Vandals, Saxons, Danes,
Normans,</hi> by external invasion, internal Faction, Envy, Ambition,
treachery and violence? The <hi>Consulate</hi> degenerated into <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> which
occasion'd the <hi>Aventine</hi> sedition; Democraty into <hi>Ochlocraty</hi> under the
<hi>Tribunes</hi> and wicked <hi>Gracchi;</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self, (the very best of
Governments) into Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Indeed your sacred Majesty was cast out of your Kingdoms, but could
never be thrown out of our hearts; There, you had a secure seat; and
the Prince that is inthron'd there, is safe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> in all mutations: Keep there
Sir, and you are inexpugnable, immoveable. And how should it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be? A Prince of your virtue could not miscarry, that being truly
verified of Your Majesty, as well in your perfections, as your person,
<hi>Certe, videtis quem elegit Dominus in Regem, quoniam non sit similis illi in om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
populo.</hi> Nature design'd your Majesty a King, Fortune makes others;
nor are you more your peoples by birth, and a glorious <hi>series</hi> of Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
then by your merits: This appeared in all those digits of your dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
Eclipse; The defect was ours, not your Majesties. For the Sun
is alwaies shining, though men alwaies see him not; and since the too
great splendor, and prosperity did confound us, it pleased God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
those clouds, till we should be better able to behold you with
more reverence and security; For then it was that you prepar'd your self
for this weighty government, and gave us those presages of your Virtue,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105324:4"/>
by what you did, for your people, and what you suffered for them; signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
your Courage, your Fortitude, Constancy, Piety, Prudence and
Temperance upon all occasions. Your Travels and Adventures are as
far beyond those of <hi>Ulysses,</hi> as you exceed him in Dominions; <hi>Si quis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
velit percensere Caesaris res, totum profecto terrarum orbem enumeret:</hi> For
he must go very far that would sum up your perfections: Your skill in
the customes of Nations, the situations of Kingdomes, the Advantages
of places, the temper of the Climates; so as the Ages to come shall tell
with delight, where you fought valiantly, where you suffered gallantly,
<hi>Quis sudores tuos hauserit campus, quae refectiones tuas arbores, quae somnum
saxa praetexerint, quod denique tectum magnus hospes impleveris,</hi> and all those
sacred <hi>Vestigia</hi> of yours: Thus what was once applyed to <hi>Trajan,</hi> becomes
due to your Majesty, and I my self am witness both abroad, and at home,
of what I pronounce, having now beheld you in both fortunes with love
and admiration; But this is not halfe, and to stop at single perfections,
were to give jealousie to the rest yetuntouched, and should I but succinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
number them all, were not to weave a Panegyrick, but an Inventory.</p>
            <p>But amongst all your Vertues none was more eminent then your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
to your religion, which no shocks of Fortune, no assaults of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters,
events and successe of adversaries, or offers of specious Friends
could shake; so great a thing it was that you did persevere, so much
greater <hi>quod non timuisti ne perseverare non posses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whilst Armies on earth fought for the Usurper, the Hosts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

upon that Rock, which afforded your shelter, till that Tyranny was

dyed in one himself, <hi>&amp; post Nubila, Phoebus.</hi> Yet did not that
quite dissolve our fears, till that other head of <hi>Hydra</hi> was cut off, that
despicable Rump which succeeded, not by the sword, or any humane
addresse, least we should sacrifice to our own Nets; but by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
hand of heaven, without noise, without Armes, or stratageme,
the same of your vertues, more then the sense of our own misery, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
turning the hearts even of your very Enemies; and then that
Northern Star began the dawning of this day, till your nearer approach
did guild our Horizon, brighter then the rayes of the Eastern sun, from
whose spicy coast, like a true Phoenix you were to come; For so at the
sight of that Royal Bird was the memory of <hi>Sesostris,</hi> of <hi>Amasis</hi> and <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
ever fortunate, and so was yours to us;

the happy presages of our glorious Returne, stupendious indeed and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

themselves fled not swifter, then the report of your approach from ten
thousand mouthes of brasse, echoing from ship to ship, and shore to
shore, with their thundring voices, out done yet with the shouts and
acclamations of your glad people, when our shaken Republique rushed
at once into your princely Armes for safety and <hi>Asylum,</hi> not by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
power of Destiny, or blind revolution, but the extraordinary hand
<pb facs="tcp:105324:5"/>

write Annals, or Verses can ever forget that day? not dectepit age,
not the sick, not the tender Sex were kept back from resolving to behold
that miraculous entry of yours; The very little children pointed to you, the
striplings and young men exsulted, the Antient men stood amazed, and
those who were under the empire of a cruel disease, leaped out of their
beds, to have the sight of you, that were the safety of the People, returning
with cure and refreshment: Others protested, they had even now lived
long enough, and were ready to expire with joy, and the transports of
their spirits; as satisfied that this Ball could not present them with an
other object worthy their admiration; others wished now to live more
then ever, that they might still enjoy their desired object; and women
forgetting the pains of childbirth, brought forth with joy, because they
gave Citizens to their Prince, and Souldiers now to their lavvful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
            <p>Your Majesty must needs remember, nor is the found yet out of your
sacred ears, when the houses of this your August Metropolis were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with the loud and cheerful spectators, because the earth was too
narrow to contain them; the wayes and the trees were filled with the
shouting of your people, LONG LIVE KING <hi>CHARLES</hi> THE <hi>II.
tamque aequaliter ab omnibus ex adventu tuo laetitia percepta est, quam omnibus
venisti.</hi> For when the wise Arbiter of things began to look down upon
us, all things conspir'd to make us happy; our Deliverance by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
as by another <hi>Moses,</hi> leading us out of that <hi>AEgyptian</hi> bondage; or
by a nearer resemblance that of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, if not yet farr
greater; since God did there only turne the heart of a Prince to let a
nation go: Here, the hearts of a whole Nation, to invite a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
Prince to come, when no other visible power interpos'd. Let others
boast then of their miracles; we can produce such, as no age, no people
under heaven can shew; God moving the hearts of his most implacable
Enemies in a moment as it were, and those who had been before inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
thirsty after your blood, now ready to sacrifice their own for your
safety; <hi>Digna res memoratu! ibat sub ducibus vexillisque Regiis, hostis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando
Regius, &amp; signa contra quae steterat sequebatur.</hi> But I suffer with
too much Plenty, and what eloquence is able to expresse the triumph
of that your never to be forgotten Entry, unlesse it be the renewing of it
this day? For then were we as those who dream, and can yet hardly be
perswaded, that we are truly awake: <hi>Dies ille aeternis seculis monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisque
mandandus,</hi> A day never to be forgotten in all our Generations,
but to be consecrated to posterity, transmitted to future Ages, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
into Monuments more lasting then Brasse. Away then with
these Woodden and temporary Arches, to be taken down by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at pleasure; erect Marble ones, lasting as the Pyramids, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable

            </p>
            <p>And yet not this altogether, because we have received a Prince, but
such a Prince, whose state and fortune in all this blessed change, we so
much admire not, as his mind; For that is truly felicity, not to possesse
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105324:5"/>
great things, but to be thought worthy of them: And indeed Great Sir,
necessity constrains me, and the laws of <hi>Panegyric,</hi> to verifie it in your
Praises, by running over at least those other Appellations, which both
your vertue has given to your Majesty, and your Fortune acquir'd. For
he is really no King who possesses not (like you) a Kingly mind, be his
other advantages what they may: If the Republick belong then to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
Caesar</hi> belongs much more to the Republick; and of this you have
given proof.</p>
            <p>For no sooner were we possess'd of your sacred Majestie, but you sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
gave form to our confused <hi>Chaos:</hi> We presently saw when you
had taken the reigns into your sacred hands, and began to fit at Sterne,
our deviating and giddy course grow steady, and the fluctuating Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
at drist ready to put into a secure Port.</p>
            <p>You began your Entry with an act of general Clemency, and to make
good the advice of your Martyr'd Father, and the best Religion, forgave
you bitterest Enemies; and not only barely forgiving, but by an excesse
of charity, doing honour to some, <hi>ut nemo sibi victus te<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> victore videatur.</hi>
This was plainly Godlike: For so rare a thing we find it, that Princes
think themselves oblig'd; or if they think it, that they love it; that
your example will reproach all who went before you: As you promis'd,
so you perform'd it, punctually, and with advantage. Nor indeed do
you desire any thing should be permitted your Majesty, but what is
indulg'd your Vassals, subjecting even your self to those Lawes by which
you oblige your Subjects; For as it is a great felicity to be able to do
what one will; so is it much more glorious, to will only what is just
and honourable. All other Princes before your Majesty spake as much;
you only have performed it; nor is there a Tittle of your engagements,
which even your very enemies diffide of, much lesse your Friends suspect:
They enjoy, and these hope; because those were to be conciliated by
present effects, these are secure by past promises; and none that receives
them of your Majesty reckons from the time they injoy it, but the period
of your promise; because it proceeds (they know) from a Princely and
candid mind; and if it seem long in acquiring, it is not (I perswade my
self) be cause you are difficult, much less unmindful; but that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
may be more acceptable, and the sense of it more permanent; since
too suddain felicity astonishes, and sometimes renders the Recipient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
whilst your favours are not fugitive but certain. It was only for
Your Majestie to be compleatly happie, when you began to be so;
and yet your subjects had as much as they could well support; since you
have made it your only businesse to sublevate the needie, and give them
as it were a new Fate, your piety not more appearing in pardoning your
Enemies, and receiving the Penitent, then your justice in restoring the
Oppressed: For how many are since your returne, return'd to their own
Homes, to their Wives, Children, Offices, and Pattimonies? <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditque
Dominus omnia quae fuerant Iobi duplicia;</hi> some of them with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
advantages; and of this the languishing <hi>Church of England</hi> is a most
eminent instance; That she, which was first and most afflicted, should
be first and chiefly refreshed.</p>
            <p>You have taken away the affluence to the Committees, Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Conventicles, and unjust Slaughter-houses, and converted their

               </gap>al to the Temples, the Courts, and the just Tribunals: Magnanimity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105324:6"/>
is return'd again to the Nobility, Modesty to the People, Obedience to
Subjects, Charity to Neighbours, Pietie to Children, Fidelity to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and Reverence to Religion; In summe, You are the Restorer of Your
Countrie.</p>
            <p>The lawes that were lately quiescent, and even trampled under foot,
your Majesty has revived; and been yet so prudent in reforming, that
even those which your Enemies made upon good deliberation, you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to stand, shewing your self rather to have been displeased with the
Authours, then the Things.</p>
            <p>As to Discipline (after the sacrifice due for that innocent blood of your
glorious Father) you are not only careful to rejectvice your self; but are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
to discountenance it in others; and that yet so sweetly, as you seem
rather to perswade then compell; and to cure without a corrosive.</p>
            <p>The Army is disbanded, and the Navy paid off without Tumult; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are trusted without suspicion, and are more secure in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
love and affection of your people then in men of Iron, the locks and
Bars of Tyrants Palaces: And truely Sir, there is no protection to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
which is a fort inexpugnable: In vain therefore do Princes
confide in any other; for Armes invite Armes, Terrour, suspition. To
this only do you trust, and the few which you maintain about your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
is rather for state, then fear. <hi>Quid enim istis opus est, quum fir missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo fis
muro Civici amoris obtectus?</hi> Here is then the firm Keeper of our
Liberties indeed, whom the Armies love for his own sake, and whom
no servile flattery adores; but a simple, and sincere devotion; and
verily such a Prince as Your Majesty, deserves to have friends, Prompt,
steady and faithful; such as You have, and which Virtue rather
then Fortune procures. Of this I obtest the fidelity of Your own inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Party, distinguished formerly by the invidious name of <hi>Cavalier,</hi>
though significant and glorious; but I provoke the World to produce
me an example of parallel Loyaltie: What Prince under heaven, after
so many losses, and all imaginable calamities, can boast of such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
The <hi>Grecians</hi> forsook their Leaders upon every sleight disaster; the
very <hi>Romans</hi> were not steady of old, but followed the fortune of the
Common Victor. The <hi>German</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> will happily stick to their
Prince in distresse, as far as the Plate, the Tapistry, or some such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
moveable may abide the pawn; But where shall we find a Subject
that hath persisted like Your Majesties, to the losse of Libertie, Estate,
and life it self, when yet all seem'd to be determin'd against them; so as
even their enemies were at last vanquish'd with their constancy, and their
very Tormentors wearied with their insuperable Patience; nor can they in
all that tract of Time, hardly brag of having made one signal <hi>Proselyte</hi> in
twenty Years that this difference continu'd; and that because the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of your Majesties Subjects, is engraffed into their Religion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
as well as into the adoration of Your Virtues.</p>
            <p>I would not therefore that Your Name should be painted upon Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or Carved in stone, <hi>sed Monumentis aeternae laudis;</hi> and Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
did well foresee, and consult it, when you furnish<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d a Subject for
our <hi>Panegyrics,</hi> and our Histories, which should outlast those frail mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials.
The Statues of <hi>Caesar, Brutus</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> were set up indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they chased their enemies from the Walls of a proud Citie; You
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105324:6"/>
have done it from a whole Kingdom; not (as they) by blood and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but by your prudence and Counsels: Nor is it lightly to be passed
over, that your Majesty was preserved in that <hi>Royal Oak,</hi> to whom a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vical
Crown should so justly become due.</p>
            <p>But I now arrive to the <hi>Lawes</hi> you have made, and the excellent things
which your Majestie hath done since you came amongst Your people.
Truely, there is hardly an hour to be reckoned wherein your Majesty has
not done some signal benefit. I have already touch'd a few of them, as
what concern'd the most, I would I could say the rest; for you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
your very Enemies, You have bought them; since never was there,
till now, so prodigious a summe paid, a summe hardly in Nature, to verifie
a VVord only; and which the zeal of Your good Subjects (had you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the advantage of the fervour which I but now mentioned, at Your
wonderful Reception) might easily have absolv'd You of; had You paid
them in kind, and as they were wont to keep faith with your Majestie.
I provoke the VVorld again to furnish an instance of a like generositie,
unlesse he climb up to heaven for it. How black then must that ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
needs appear, which should after all this, dare to rebell; Or, for
the future once murmur at Your Government? Since it was no necessity
that compell'd You, but an excesle of your good nature, and your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>Your Majestie has abolished the <hi>Court of Wards;</hi> I cannot say we have
freed our selves in desiring it, if it were possible to hope for so indulgent
a Father as Your Majestie is to Your Countrie, in those that shall succeed
You.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Compositions</hi> You have likewise eased us of, if that could be esteem'd
a burthen, to serve so excellent a Prince, who receives nothing of his
Subjects but what he returnes again in the Noblest and worthiest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality,
that any Potentate in earth can produce; Thus what the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
pay to the Ocean, it returns again in showers to replenish them. But
You Majestie would dissipate even the very shadows, which give us um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage;
and rather part with your own just right, then those few of your
Subjects which it concern'd, should think themselves aggreiv'd, though
by a mistake even of their duty.</p>
            <p>But I should first have mention'd your settlement of the <hi>Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</note> and
Your bringing back the Ark of God: Your Majesties wife composure of our
Frailties, and tendernesse as well in the Religious as the Secular; whilst
yet You continue fervent to maintain what is decent, and what is setled
by Law. But what language is capable to expresse this Article? Let
those who wait at the Altar, and to which you have restor'd the daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
supply the defect of this period, and celebrate your piety.</p>
            <p>Nor has yet Your zeal to the Church, lessen'd that which is due to the
Common-wealth; witnesse your industry in erecting a <hi>Councel of Trade,</hi>
by which alone you have sufficiently verified that expression of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
in your Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> That You would propose some
useful things for the publick emolument of the Nation, which should
render it opulent, splendid and flourishing; making good your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to the universall Soveraignty by Your Princely care, as well as by
your birth and undoubted Title.</p>
            <p>You have Restor'd, Adorn'd, and Repair'd our Courts of Judicature,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105324:7"/>
turning the Shambles where your Subjects were lately butcher'd, into a

You had Poets indeed that sung the fate of an unfortunate Lady, the
theft of a simple fleece; what wouldst thou have done, had the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Actions of such a King been spread before thee, who has not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with Armies, depopulated Cities, or violated the Rights of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality;
but restor'd a broken Nation, repair'd a ruin'd Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and re-establish'd our ancient Laws; in summe, who has at
once render'd us perfectly happy? What then have we to do with
<hi>Augustus,</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> with <hi>Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus, Theodosius</hi> or
even <hi>Constantine</hi> himself? There is not in any, there is not in all these
Subjects more worthy of praise, and to which your Majesty; O best of
Princes, ought at all to render.</p>
            <p>We are told <hi>Periculosae rem aleae esse, de iis scribere quibus sis obstrictus;</hi>
because it is so difficult to observe a mediocrity, where our affections are
engaged: But your Majesty is as secure from flattery, as your Virtues
are above its reach; and to write thus of ill Princes, were both a
shame and a punishment: For this the <hi>Senate</hi> condemn'd the History
of <hi>Cremutius</hi> to the flames; and <hi>Spartianus</hi> told <hi>Dioclesian</hi> boldly, how
hard it would be to write their Commentaries, except it were to record
their Impudence, Murthers, Injustice, and the (for most part) fatal
periods of Tyrants; which if any esteem a glory, you envy not, whilst
your Majesty is resolv'd to secure your own by your virtue and your
Justice; so as no age to come shall possibly find an aemulator, or produce
an equall.
<q>
                  <l>â€”Fuerint aliis haec forte decora,</l>

But I shall never have done with your obligations of the publick; and
the measure which is assign'd me, would be too narrow but to mention
briefly those your private and interiour perfections which crown your
Majesties Person, and dazle our eyes more then the bright purple
which this day invests you. To give instance in some; you are an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Master to your Domesticks. Their Lives, Conversations and
Merits as well as Names, and Faces, are known to your Majesty
as the Companions of <hi>Caesar</hi> were: Honour is safe under your Banner,
and the Court so well regulated, that there is no need of <hi>Censors</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
Mens Manners; <hi>vita principis pro censura est.</hi> He who knowes that
every body eyes, speaks and writes of him, cannot in prudence, or think,
or act things unworthy and abject: You Sir direct all your objects and
motions so, as may recommend you to posterity; and even burn with desires
of immortality, so as Histories may relate the Truth without fear or
adulation.</p>
            <p>How happy then those Servants of yours, whose fidelity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
is known to your Majesty, not from the interpretation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of others, but your own experience! So as you Reward as well
with Judgment, as Bounry; and verily that is true Beneficence to
place your Recompence as well equally, as freely: Most other
Virtues are competent to the rest of Men; Beneficence only
to a Prince, as his most Essential property, and the noblest ingredient of
his <hi>Elogy.</hi> Hence that great Saint, as well as Courtier and Prelate has
directed, <hi>Si quis Principem laudare vellet, nihil illi adeo decorum adscribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
quam Magnificentiam;</hi> and <hi>Criticks</hi> observe,<note place="margin">S. Chrysost.</note> that where the wise
King <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Multi colunt personam Principis,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> version
reads it, <hi>personam Benefici,</hi> as importing both; and in that of his
Who was greater then <hi>Solomon, Qui dominantur eorum Benefici ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur,</hi>
the <hi>Chaldy</hi> turnes, <hi>Principes vocantur,</hi> as if by a convertible fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
He could not be a Prince who were not Beneficent; nor he
that is truly Beneficent, unworthy of that Title. I remember 'tis
somewhere said of <hi>Saul</hi> that he Reign'd but two years; because he was
so long it seems good to his people, and reigned in their hearts; For as
the Sun himself should not be the Sun, if he did not shine; no more
should a Prince be worthy of his dignity, if he unjustly Ecclips'd his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
or abused his Magnificency. But as we said, this virtue is
added to your Maje<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

with the rest.</p>
            <p>There is such a Majesty in your Countenance, such Lenity in your
Eyes, gravity in your speech, as that for your gracefull presence that
may be truly affirm'd of you what was once appli'd to a great Prince
resembling you, <hi>Iam firmitas, Iam proceritas corporis, jam honor Capitis

Nor has fortune chang'd you after all your Travels and Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

percolations through which you have been forc'd to run, like the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

waters. None having more constantly retained his vertue then
your Majesty, nor guarded it with more caution.</p>
            <p>And now in all this height of glory, you receive all Men with
so much humility, that the difference of your change seems to be
only this; that you are now beloved of more, and love more, treating
every man, as if every man were your proper care, and as becomes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of so great a Family; Sometimes you are pleased to lay more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the beams of Majesty, that you may descend to do mutual offices of
Friendship; as considering that these Virtues were not concredited
to you by God, for your self only, but for others also: In short,
you are so perfect a Prince, that those who come after you, will fear to
be compared to you, <hi>Experti quam sit oner<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

since to possess your Virtues, they must support your sufferings; nor
can every head know how to sustain the weight of such a Crown as
yours, where the thornes have so long perplext the Lillies and the
Roses of it.</p>
            <p>I might here mention Your Heroic and masculine Spirit in dangers,
and yet Your foresight of them; Your tenderness to compassionate,
Your Constancie in suffering, Your Modestie in Prosperitie, Equalitie in
Adversitie, and that sweetness of access which attracts both love and
veneration from all that converse with You; but these have already
adorn'd your Character by that excellent Hand who did lately describe it.<note place="margin">Col. Tuke.</note>
            </p>
            <p>You are frequent at Councels, Patient in hearing, pertinent in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,
judicious in Determining, and so skilfull in the several Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
that You many times transact by Your self, what others do by
Interpreters; affecting rather expedition in Your affairs, then insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
State, which these acquired parts of Your Majesties do yet aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so much the more.</p>
            <p>You are curious of brave and Laudable things; You love shipping,
Buildings, Gardens (having exceeded <hi>Cyrus</hi> already in Your Plantations)
Piscinas, Statues, Pictures, Intaglias, Music: You have already amass<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

great which can escape Your research.</p>
            <p>Nor must I here forget the honour You have done our <hi>Society</hi> at

butt hat so Magnanimous a Prince, will still proceed to encourage that
Illustrious Assembly; and which will celebrate and eternize Your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
to the future Ages, beyond Your Majesties Predecessors, and
indeed all the Monarchs on the Earth, when for You is reserv'd the
being Founder of some thing that may improve practical and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
knowledg, beyond all that has been hitherto attempted, for
the Augmentation of Science, and universal good of Man-kind, and
which alone will consummate Your Fame and render it immortal.</p>
            <p>What shall I superadd to all these? That You rise early, that You
are alwaies employ'd, that You love Hunting, Riding, swimming, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Robust and Princely Exercises, not so much for delight, as health and
relaxation. <hi>Et vitae pars nulla perit.</hi>

an enterprise; since he that would take the height of <hi>Olympus,</hi> must stand
below in the plain: Subjects can best describe their Princes Virtues;
Princes best know their Subjects, and therefore most fit to rule them.

Render him fortunate to us, to our Children, sueceeding Generations: give

into universal silence and solitude, behold now the change of this daies
