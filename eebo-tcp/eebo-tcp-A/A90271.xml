            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

people to whom they are ſent, and uſing all care and diligence by
all wayes and meanes to win ſoules unto Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>10. That it is deſired, that no perſous be required to receive the
Sacrament, further then their Light ſhall lead them unto.
Nor no perſon ſent forth to preach, and already placed, or which
ſhall be placed in any Pariſh within this Nation, be compelled
to adminiſter the Sacrament to any, but ſuch as he ſhall approve
of, as fit for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>11. That a Law may be provided, that all perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

as through ſcruple of Conſcience do abſtain from thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
                  <p>12. That whereas divers perſons are unſatisfied to come to the
publike places of hearing the Word, upon this Account, that
thoſe places were Dedicated and Conſecrated: That the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
will be pleaſed to declare, that ſuch places are made uſe

and to give notice to ſome Magiſtrate of ſuch their place of
ordinary meetings.</p>
                  <p>14. That this Honourable Committee be deſired to propoſe
to the Parliament, That ſuch who do not receive, but oppoſe
thoſe Principles of Chriſtian Religion, without acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof the Scriptures do clearly and plainly affirm that
Salvation is not to be obtained, as thoſe formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of by the Miniſters; may not be ſuffered to preach or
promulgate any thing in oppoſition unto ſuch Principles.</p>
                  <p>15. And further, That the Parliament be humbly deſired to
take ſome ſpeedy and effectuall courſe for the utter ſuppreſsing
of that abominable Cheat of Judiciall Aſtrology, whereby the
minds of multitudes are corrupted, and turned aſide from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon the Providence of God, to put their truſt in the
lyes of Men, and deluſions of Sathan.</p>

although they ſeem to agitate for peace; yet the preperations for

by Sea or Land; as was lately made evident by one of the

three ſtout Men of War belonging to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who
denying to lore their Topſales, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> immediatly gave
