            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The grounds of Unity
IN
RELIGION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>UNity and ſubmiſſion is deſired of all Princes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
as that which preſerves Peace and Happineſs in all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
for a Nation full of diſcontents and Factions, is next door
to Rebellion, and conſequently Ruine.</p>
            <p>One great foundation of Peace is the due ſubmiſſion of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil, to the temporal Prince, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Governour in all cauſes and ſubject to none but God.</p>
            <p>And this may be yielded, and yet not a compleat ſatisfaction in
the general; for by a tolleration in Religion, different Sects may
poſſible ſubmit for politick ends, though this unites not, but only
palliates, which yet is better than a worſe evil.</p>
            <p>But that which breeds the perfect concord and compleat union
is this, when the Eccleſiaſticks, and again the people agree to, and
embrace the publick eſtabliſh'd Church-Diſcipline, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
not out of force, but love and good opinion of it.</p>
            <p>To which end and purpoſe, it ought to be as rational and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Law of nature as poſſible, agreeing with the plain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of humanity and down-right ſincerity of the commons,
without ſpecious circumſtances or impertinencies, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
think are but amuzements and ſophiſtications in the worſhip of
God; but yet alſo compliant with the ends of prudence, and order
without affectation of Novelty on th'one hand, or ſuperſtition on
th'other, and this will infallibly be of force; for being founded in
reaſon, it will be applicable and comprehenſive to all reaſonable
men.</p>
            <p>For this is moſt certain, the Church was pure and plain at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
without ceremonies and circumſtances; and Chriſtians
met together humbly, decently, and Religiouſly, with hearty
Prayers to God, and hearing of the word fervently Preached with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48569:3"/>
ſuch apprehenſiveneſs and reaſon, that they made the people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to reſign their blind and ſuperſtitious opinions to ſuch real
and demonſtrated truths, preſſing them to ſearch the Scriptures,
and their own Conſciences, whether thoſe things they taught were
ſo or no; in this purity and ſincerity; were the Primitive times,
with which their innocency and holineſs of life ſo prevail'd, that
many Kings and Kingdomes in ſhort time embraced the Chriſtian
Religion, and ſtrongly upheld it; but after, it grew to ſo much
ſplendour and pomp, that Superſtition, Vanity and arrogance crept
alſo by degrees into the Clergy, that ſoon dimn'd the Luſter, and
abated the true glory of Religion, and was the cauſe of many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</p>
            <p>For this is a Rule in the Diſcipline of the Church and Worſhip
of God, that too much formality ſpoyls devotion, and makes men
cold in the ſearches after truth; the more plain and free from cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and circumſtantials it is, provided it be decent, the more
pure and ſubſtantial it will prove, and the more ground for a general
union; wherefore in all ſuch caſes, much care ſhould be taken that
the great ſtumbling-blocks of diſcontent be taken away, for
though they are of themſelves indifferent, yet when they bring
much and conſiderable diſturbance, they then ceaſe to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
as to peace and quietneſs, and ſo are better regulated or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Now doubtleſs though Epiſcopacy is the pureſt, as well as the
moſt antient Diſcipline of the Church, having obtained in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Churches of the world of what ſort or ſect ſoever, for 1500
years together after Chriſt, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is lookt upon to be the beſt regulated of all Epiſcopacy, and
yet if there can be any more advantages given to it for the farther
Improvement of Unity, from antient preſcription, right reaſon or
modern example; doubtleſs it might be good to be put in Practice,
for we ſhould ſtill aſcend to improvement and perfection, for the
more comprehenſive and generally acceptable it is, the more firm
and eſtabliſht it will be.</p>
            <p>For there is nothing conduceth more to Unity and Peace
than by taking off and reducing the general Factions of Religion,
which is done by enlarging the boſome of the Church, and taking
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48569:3"/>
off things that are cavild at, provided only they are Circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
as commonly they are, and not the materials and Eſſentials
of Religion; ſo would both the cavils ceaſe, and Sectaries alſo and
of courſe fall of themſelves to the ground without more ado, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
to the ſame Church with us unavoydably.</p>
            <p>For the true way of Unity, is ſuch a compoſed mean of Church-Diſcipline,
as may render the major part and generality of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
people ſatisfied, which may eaſily be done with us without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the frame of government, or taring things to pieces, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by joyning the two great Parties of this Nation together, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbiterian,</hi> which parties are at leaſt nine parts
in ten of the Nation, including all other Sects, which may be done
by a little regulation, abating only ſome things and reforming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>For Epiſcopacy and the ſame Diſcipline in general is well enough
approved by the moſt, but as in all times of civil Government,
Emendations and making Laws hath been for the better convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the publick according to the emergencies of things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
of times and occaſions, ſo alſo is it convenient in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Regiment, for ſome things will be alwayes proper at
ſome times, and ſome ages, that is not proper in the other; and ſo
accordingly they muſt be remedied, for in an age or ſome long
tract of time, mens manners and the conſtitutions of things alter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
and ſo muſt have corrections proportionably.</p>
            <p>And all people being now ſatisfied that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
by Epiſcopacy is to be the ſtanding Government, being eſtabliſht
by Parliament, and alwayes owned ſo by his Majeſty; if there be
once a further comprehenſion of the Presbiterians in and according
to that Government; all other parties will ſoon be quiet as too
ſmall to ſtand in computation on the one hand, and on th'other hand
the Church being thus regulated will bring in the reſt dayly alſo,
ſo that ſome ſmall regulation and abatement of the very ſame
Church-Diſcipline we have already, will work the deſired effect.
And as for the other Diſſenters they may have ſome connivance,
but no legal Liberty; for legal allowance will mak them impudent,
and endeavour to encreaſe, whereas otherwiſe they will be humble
and cautious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48569:4"/>
Wherefore unite thoſe two partyes, and the Church is eſtabliſht,
and much better, and ſtronger, than ever; this will not only oblige
our Friends at home, but all the Proteſtants beyond Seas; and
this may be done by the rule aboveſaid without altering the mode
of Government, for we differ but in a few things in Diſcipline and
none in Doctrine, they have left of themſelves the notion of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and, if it were in their own choice, would direct moderate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy,
and would concede yet very much more for the gaining
of our friendſhip, and being one with us, which will be a very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
period of that long and great conteſt now never to be heard of
any more.</p>
            <p>To effect this, a few things will be ſufficient, as diſpencing with
the Surplice, and part of an Oath in the Act of Uniformity, alſo
the Croſſing in Baptiſm, and kneeling at the Sacrament left indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and pluralities taken away; theſe things being abated, 'they
would agree with all things elſe very well, and be as much or more
for Epiſcopaſy than we our ſelves, and why ſhould not we deſire
this alſo that will unite us ſo invinceably, wherefore ſhould we
ſtick at ſuch little circumſtances to hinder ſo great a work; and as
for taking away pluralities, there are but few ſober men of either
party but heartily deſire it, it being that which makes ill thoſe
which have too many, and hinders abundance of Learned men from
preferment; it being prudence in Government, rather to provide
convenient and comfortable preferments for many, than great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
for few; and things thus remedyed and quallified will be
ſo far from weakning the Proteſtant Intereſt, that it will raiſe it
higher than ever, and make Epiſcopaſy ſtand upon a firm and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Baſis. I am confident theſe few things, laſt mentioned, will
do the work; however if there were any other hindrances of the
like nature, what matter were it to remove them for the
Churches ſecurity, the advantage will ſoon be perceived, this will
drown and take away the name of Presbytery as well as all nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names
of parties, and make them have no abettors nor underſtand
how to beget a quarrel if they would themſelves.</p>
            <p>Some may ſay it will be ill making alterations, but that is of
ſome Extraordinary thing which diſcontents the major part of the
Nation; but this is the contrary, for here the major part will not
only be well pleaſed at it, but will alſo be advantaged: where then
is the inconveniency of it? the Royal and Proteſtant party, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48569:4"/>
Ceremonies were abated, would not be diſoblig'd, or the leſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
for it, they referring all ſuch Matters to the King &amp; Parliament,
and would be as well pleaſed in his Majeſties farther Directions in
this, as they were with Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> before; for it is all one
to them if the Government be ſatisfied, they acquieſs as well in
taking of them away, as ſetting of them up, and more, becauſe they
ſee, it's for making many Friends; Again, <hi>the Presbiterians that
were diſpleaſed before, are by this reconciled, which will on all the
ſcores of Humanity and Chriſtianity, oblige them to be grateful to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;</hi>
and for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it will very much inlarge
the boſome of it, Exalting it above all Diſputes about Diſciplines,
making it ſo firm, that nothing can ſhake it.</p>
            <p>And others may object, that if theſe things be granted, the
Sectaries will deſire more and more ſtill, till they have pul'd down
all Decencie, good Order, and Eccleſiaſtical Government, but this
doth not follow, for by the ſame Rule, there can't be a motion to
reform any thing amiſs whatſoever, but they ſhall ſtraight prevent
it by a pretence of a deſtructive change, but this alters no ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
or ſubſtantials in Diſcipline, only pruning off ſome ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,
for according to the common Maxime, take away the Cauſe,
and the Effect ceaſeth; for Example, if a man putteth on Laces on
his Linnen, or Garment, ſome will ſay they are too broad, others too
narrow, others not fine enough, otherwiſe again no good pattern,
when he that wears none gives no opportunity to be talked of, or
for any body to be diſpleaſed with him. So its generally in all
other things, the more plain and ſubſtantial it is, the better its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and ſo in Diſcipline, if they ſhould quarrel at Foundations and
ſubſtantial things, they would render their party weak and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ridiculous, wherefore for their own Credit and Chriſtianity,
they would not unrip thoſe Sacred Tyes and Ligaments, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ceremonies and circumſtantials, common reaſon tels us, is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the cenſure of every common pretender under the notion of
ſuperſtition, whilſt plainneſs and ſeriouſneſs in Religion, fills up all
peoples hearts to applaude it, its no policy to uphold things to be
agued and diſputed at or cauſe differences, when taking of them
away cureth the troubles without any more to do, cutting off the
diſcontented Cavil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48569:5"/>
For the true ballance of the Church Government, is to have as
few unneceſſary obligations as poſſible, and to be free from all
Cloggs in oppreſſion of reaſon or conſcience, but giving lattitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
be comprehenſive of the generallity as much as may be, for all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
ought to be contrived for inlarging the boſome of the Church
to the utmoſt Extent, and in caſes of this nature private Annimoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
ought by every one to be laid aſide for the publick Concern.</p>
            <p>To be brief, all manner of inconvenient Church-rigour being
thus calmed, how ſtrong ſhould we be in our ſelves, it would keep
many ſtrickt ſort of people from going beyond Sea, blaſt all the
deſigns of the Enemies of the Church, and oblige all ſorts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
and home Proteſtants, making them flock to it, and cheriſh
ſo moderate a Government, &amp; would not ſcruple at Biſhops, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good Order, but would gladly joyn with them, as being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs
the beſt Government in the world, if truly regulated, and
when once the great Ones and heads of Parties are obliged by
ſtate Prudence, the reſt will ſoon crumble to nothing, by this all
Sectaries will diminiſh, when once the apparent grounds of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is taken away, ſo this would not only unite us for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but keep people from growing to be Schiſmaticks for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as well as increaſe the body of the Church; when they ſee it
is not Ceremonies are ſtood on, as ſome incendiaries pretend, but
inſtead thereof, ſo much willingneſs and plain-heartedneſs, to unite
all people in the Worſhip of God. Thus ſhall the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
be more firmly eſtabliſht than ever, the people pleaſed and
conformable, His Majeſty feared of his Enemies abroad, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſtrong in the affections of his Subjects at home; Trade alſo
would ſoon revive and flouriſh, and not only the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but other
