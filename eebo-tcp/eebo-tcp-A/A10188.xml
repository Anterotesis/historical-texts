         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Sexti Decretalia, lib: 2, Tit: 23, cap:</hi> 2: for <hi>Lib: 3: De Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitate
Ecclesiae, cap: Decet:</hi> 6. The perverting is in my

I have quoted the Booke right: For it is there, <hi>Sexti

my Quotation true. For the <hi>perverting of Pope Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
words,</hi> I must needes reply, that I have not falsified
Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> words, but <hi>Mr. Widdowes</hi> hath grossely
misrecited mine: For whereas I write, that Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
enjoynes men to bowe [especially] at the Masse; Mr.

in these and sundry other particulars of this nature,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which for brevity sake I here omit.</p>

Fathers, and other Authorities alledged by him in

they doe not at the recitall of the name of God.</p>
            <p>Page 21. Hee quotes <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for this
bowing: and what are his words? <hi>Adoramus Emanue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,

it to the Church, in bowing at the name of Iesus: A
grosse mistake.</p>
            <p>Page 22: He quotes <hi>St. Hierom on Esay c:</hi> 45. for bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the name of Iesus. What are his words? <hi>Moris

ridiculous then <hi>Ignoramus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Page 16, 17. He misquoteth <hi>Calvin, Marlorat,

of Iesus. <hi>Page</hi> 21, 22, 23. You absurdly misapply the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21371:7"/>
passages you quote out of the Councell of <hi>Ephesus, Cyril,
Athanasius, Hierom,</hi> and others, to bowing at the name
of Iesus, when as their words import not any such thing,
as you may see, if you will but peruse them once againe.
These few, together with an hundred such like over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights,
which I spare to mention, are sufficient to informe
you, how open you lie unto my lash, which you may
chance to feele, if you will needes make your selfe an
<hi>Ignoramus,</hi> or <hi>a Foole in print. Stripes are prepared for the
backe of Fooles, Prov:</hi> 19, 29: and I have some in store for
you, if you expunge not these your errors ere they come
to publicke light. Lo, I have forewarned you as a <hi>private
Friend,</hi> and if you take not this my warning; you must
excuse me if I fall foule upon these your <hi>Oversights</hi> as an
open <hi>Adversary.</hi> Thus much for your bowing.</p>
            <p>For your <hi>Schismaticall Puritan,</hi> which you strive to
justifie in your <hi>first and second pages.</hi> I must informe you
of 4 mistakes committed in it: The first is in the very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi>
of a Puritan, which most besides your selfe define
to be, not, <hi>A Protestant Non-conformist,</hi> as you; but,
<note n="*" place="margin">Est vir ftul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, inconsul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, expers rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, mente cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp; decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c.</note>

               <hi>wits:</hi> and how neare this
definition may concerne your selfe, and whether it makes
not you, at least a <hi>simple,</hi> if not a<note n="*" place="margin">See Iohn Whites Way to the true Church, sect. 4. num. 19, p. 141 who writes, that Papists are the Puritans.</note> 
               <hi>double Puritan,</hi> I leave
you to consider. The second is in the <hi>Genus</hi> of a Puritan;
which you make a <hi>Protestant,</hi> but falsly, yea absurdly;
since a Protestant is not the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Novatians, Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists,
Donatists, or Papists;</hi> (who were never yet repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Protestants, and were long before the name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
was knowne;) who yet are true and reall Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
both by your owne and others confession. The third
is in the <hi>Differentia Essentialis</hi> of a puritan; which, say
you, is a <hi>Nonconformist:</hi> which difference, as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all <hi>Papists</hi> from being <hi>Puritans,</hi> because they are
most conformable to any ceremonies, especially to this,
of bowing at the name of Iesus; (which contradicts your
first Species of a Puritan, in which you include the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist:)
so it makes all forraigne reformed <hi>Churches,</hi> Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21371:8"/>
(which I hope you dare not say) they being not
conformable to our Cerememonies: and withall it
thwarts <hi>Bishop Mountagues</hi> distinction, of <hi>Conformable

I hope you dare not controll this learned Bishop. The
fourth, is in the <hi>Species of a Puritan;</hi> which say you are

               <hi>Puritanities:</hi> But this is
onely <hi>Endymionis somnium.</hi> For the <hi>Perfectist,</hi> the <hi>first
Species;</hi> which say you is the <hi>Novatian Catherist and
Papist,</hi> are no <hi>Protestants;</hi> Ergo no <hi>Species of a Paritan,</hi>
whose <hi>Genus</hi> you make a <hi>Protestant.</hi> Moreover, the
<hi>Brownists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (to omit the other severall
<hi>Species of Puritans,</hi> which have no specificall difference
betweene them) are no <hi>Protestants,</hi> neither in doctrine,
nor in discipline: <hi>Protestants</hi> disclaime them, and they
<hi>Protestants,</hi> from whom they sever and divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
even altogether: therefore they are no <hi>Puritans,</hi>
because no <hi>Protestants.</hi> These severall Oversights I
thought good to recommend to your second &amp; more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
sober thoughts; which if you impudently publish
to the world without fear or wit, before some caftigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

all which it is prefixed; since <hi>at the name of Iesus,</hi>
may be as aptly applied to the eye, as to the eare; to the

            <p>Whether the not bowing at every recitall of the name <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
of Iesus in time of Divine service be a sinne or no? (as it
must needes be if it be a duty of the Text:) And why it
should be a duty in time of Divine service and Sermons
onely, (in which of all other times it is most needlesse to
expresse mens reverence, subjection, and high respect to

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:21371:14"/>
and puts a period to the present controversie, which hath
no other pillar to support it but this notorious errour;
and that other coupled with it, page 37. to wit, <hi>That Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
is the greatest name of God, proposed to us to worship,
&amp;c. because it was humbled most, and therefore most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
above all other names, yea above the name of God,

more evidently discerne, I shall here propound some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable
Arguments, to prove; That the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
is not more honourable, more worthy cap and knee;
yea<note n="l" place="margin">See Bp. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing tons Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Catholicke faith p. 196, 196, 197. where this point is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently proved.</note> 
               <hi>not so eminent, so glorious,</hi> and so <hi>not so venerable
among Christians,</hi> as the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>First, the name Iesus is onely a<note n="m" place="margin">Bp. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes p 475, &amp;c. Salmeron Tom. 3, Tract. 37</note>

               <hi>name of

               <hi>which he was anoynted:</hi> As therefore the
names of <hi>Emperour, King, Prince, Earle, Lord-Keeper,
&amp;c.</hi> are farre more honourable than the names of <hi>Henry,
Charles, Iohn, Thomas, &amp;c.</hi> which are common to the
meanest subjects; because the first are titles of honour
and office; the other onely ordinary proper names impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for distinction sake. Even so must the name of Christ,
a name of office, of unction, be far more honourable than
Iesus; a name though<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 1, 21.</note> 
               <hi>originally derived from the office of
a Saviour,</hi> yet imposed on him at his nativity as a proper
name, to difference him from other men.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That name which is peculiar to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
as a Saviour, is more honourable than that which is
common to him with other men. But the name Christ,
is a name<note n="q" place="margin">Mat 1, 16. Luke 2, 11 See Argument 4. Yea Christs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, enabled him to be a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, a Saviour, a King, &amp;c.</note>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That name, which doth difference our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
from all others who were called Iesus, and give him
an excellency, a precedency above them all, must needs
be more venerable and excellent than the name Iesus
only, which doth not simply of it selfe either distinguish
or advance our Saviour above all others of that name.
But this name Christ<note n="*" place="margin">See Bishop Babingtons Exposition of the Catholicke faith, p. 196, 197, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</note> doth distinguish our Saviour from
all others who were stiled Iesus, and gives him an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
a precedency above them all. Witnesse, <hi>Mat. 1.

them mightily, that Iesus was the Christ. 1 Iohn 2, 22 Who

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21371:15"/>
doe likewise imply, that Christ, is a title of office, more
honourable by farre than the bare name of Iesus: Ergo, it
must needes be more venerable and excellent than the
name Iesus is.</p>
            <p>

all confessed, acknowledged, and enquired after, and by
which his kingdome and power are most set forth in
Scripture, is his most honourable name. But our Saviour

this text of Phil. 2. 9, 10, and approve of this actuall
bowing at the name of Iesus, which we now dispute of; That
this bowing was the custome of St. Hieroms time: &amp; that it
was a most ancient custome, even in the beginning of the
Church: <hi>for proofe of which he hath vouched</hi> Bp. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,

1 Ceremony,</hi> (and as some write) a <hi>Duty,</hi> much pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

propugning of this upstarr Popish Ceremony by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
by printing: or what the suspension, silencing or
censuring of such as speake, as preach against it, meanes,
or whence it springs, I cannot well determine. If it be
only a misguided superstitious zeale, arising from meere
ignorance of the true originall Popish rise and progresse
of this Ceremony; I hope the ensuing pages will both
instruct them whence it sprung, &amp; whither it tends; and
so reforme them. But if it be a wilfull obstinate symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing

heads (not knees) to Iesus Christ the King of Kings,
who bowed his head for them: But this was not as I take
it, at every recitall of his name Iesus, but at the lifting up
