            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE BY A Friend of the Author's.</head>
            <p>SINCE the Fall of Man by his Rebellious Sin, he incurr'd the forfeiture of his Felicity, that principally conſiſted in Communion with God.</p>
            <p>The Divine Goodneſs is like a ſealed Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, all comforting Emanations are obſtructed: Divine Juſtice is a conſuming Fire to all guilty and polluted Creatures. The Son of God by his precious Merits and Interceſſion, is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of Reconciliation and Communion.</p>
            <p>All our Aſcents to God in ſpiritual Duties, and his Deſcents to us by communicating Graces and Comforts, are through Chriſt. He introduces our Perſons into the Divine Preſence, he purifies our Services from their Defilements and Defects, and preſents them with acceptance to his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49481:3"/>Our Communion with God is managed by the Influences of the Holy Spirit into the Soul, and the returns of the Soul to God by the Energy and Efficacy of the Spirit. In all the parts of Divine Worſhip, the Spirit compoſes the Mind, with the Reverence of God's invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and adorable Majeſty: He encourages our truſt in his Mercy, and raiſes our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from Earth to Heaven. This is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult heighth which the carnal Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arrive to. Prayer is a Duty of daily Revolution, but cannot be performed in an acceptable manner without the Spirit's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>The Holy Spirit is the Seal of God's Love to Believers, that can never be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd; that diſtinguiſhes them from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed World, and appropriates them to God. He firſt works thoſe Graces in the Soul, wherein the Image of God conſiſts, and by illuſtrating them in the view of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, witneſſes that they are God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: He is therefore ſtyled <hi>the Spirit of Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit ratifies the Truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to thoſe who have felt his ſanctifying and comſorting Operations. There are ſome Doctrines in the Goſpel of impoſſible diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the light of Reaſon, and when reveal'd, are incomprehenſible. Now there is ſuch Evidence, beyond all exception, That the Goſpel is a Divine Revelation; that any
<pb facs="tcp:49481:3"/>
Doctrine declared in it, though ſublime and ſupernatural, and contrary to our carnal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and Paſſions, juſtly requires our aſſent to it. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the evidence of the Object, and the evidence of the teſtimony. An Object is evident by its own Light, and the impreſſion it makes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on the Mind: Thus it diſcerns between Truth and Falſhood, between what is fair, and what is fraudulent; as the Eye ſees the difference between the day and night. The Evidence of the Teſtimony, is, when the proof of the Truth is reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veracity and Authority of God, who is Infallible; For he cannot be deceived nor deceive. Now of the Goſpel's Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, there are external Characters and Signs, and internal: Of the external Characters, Miracles are the moſt conſpicuous: Of the internal, the ſanctifying and comforting Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit in the Souls of Men are moſt ſenſible and convincing. For certainly humane Nature, tho' aſſiſted by Moral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Conſtancy, could never produce ſuch Divine Effects. The Holineſs and Comfort that the Spirit in Concomitancy with the Goſpel, works in ſincere Chriſtians, produces a more clear and ſtrong aſſurance of its Truth, than the ſight of Miracles. For Holineſs is an Attribute as truly Divine as Power, and has a nearer Affinity with the Nature of God, 'tis his peculiar Glory. The cleanſing
<pb facs="tcp:49481:4"/>
and changing the Heart of a Sinner, the calming of the afflicted Conſcience, are a more eminent effect of Power, than the turning of a Wilderneſs into a Paradiſe, or the laying Storms and Tempeſts. The ſanctifying and comforting Virtue of the Spirit by the Word, is a more inward and laſting proof than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. A Miracle, like a ſudden flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, aſtoniſhes Men at the preſent, and cauſes them to conſider what is propoſed; but when the ſurprize is over, they may neglect their Duty: But real Holineſs in the heart and life, like the Sun, irradiates the Mind with a conſtant light; <hi>He that believes has the witneſs within himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inward Experimental Religion is perceived by the Senſe of them that have it, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo clearly demonſtrated by Words. Who can ſee a Taſte? From hence many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and prophane Perſons expoſe the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit to ignominy and contempt, as the dotages of Enthuſiaſts. And Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſors, who owe their Religion to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Education, and are meerly Titular Chriſtians, cannot underſtand and believe what the Saints really enjoy. They are hardned in their Unbelief, becauſe many have father'd the baſtards of their deluded fancies upon the Spirit. But to ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of this pretence, conſider, It were ſtrange that the low life of Senſe has perceptive Faculties, that living Creatures feel that they live, and
<pb facs="tcp:49481:4"/>
the ſpiritual Life, more raiſed and excellent than the rational, ſhould not perceive it ſelf. Is it poſſible there ſhould be ſuch a Prodigy, that the Soul ſhould live the life of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Joy, like a Plant, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it? Or, Becauſe many are deceived with a falſe Light, and pleaſed with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, does it follow that thoſe who have vital Experience of Religion, are deceived? One may Dream that he is Awake, but a Man that is Awake knows himſelf to be ſo: The Deluſion of one doth not weaken the aſſurance of another. If it be enquir'd, How ſhall we diſtinguiſh between the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Operations of the Spirit, and the Spurious and Counterfeit? A clear anſwer may be given. 1. By the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we may diſcover and know his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is no vicious Circle. I know I have a reaſonable Soul, by the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For the Underſtanding that diſcovers other objects in the direct act, is the object of it ſelf in the reflective act. Thus I know that I have the Holy Spirit as a principle of Divine life acting in me by the light of the Spirit. 2. It is the peculiar Character of the Spirit's Operations, they are all in Conſent and Congruity with the Word of God, for he is the Inditer of the Word, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf: They make Men more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Heavenly; and as the Star directed the Wiſe-Men to Chriſt, the light of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:49481:5"/>
always directs us to him as the Fountain of Grace and Salvation.</p>
            <p>And for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know when the Bleſſings they receive are obtain'd by Prayer, and are not the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of God's general Providence; I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire them to conſider, whether their Prayers are by the Spirit's Influence, which is known by the frame of the Soul in that Duty. The Spirit knows the Mind of God, and is the Intelligencer of Heaven; he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to the moſt favourable Seaſons, and by ſoft Whiſpers and warm Impulſes, brings us in God's Preſence to pray for Mercies when God is ready to beſtow them. He does with ſenſible Enlargements open our Hearts in the Duty; And as under the Law, when Fire fell from Heaven upon the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, 'twas a ſign of God's Acceptance; ſo when a ſacred Fire kindles our Affections, 'tis a ſign our Requeſts are accepted. He mixes in our Prayers Reverence with filial Confidence; Reſignation to the Will and Wiſdom of God, with Reliance upon his Love and Power. And when a Mercy is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Spirit converts our Prayers into Praiſes, and by the Mercy, confirms our Faith, inflames our Love, and endears Obedience to us.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Perſon of whom the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers give an account, I ſhall only ſay, He is a Chriſtian inwardly, who has had
<pb facs="tcp:49481:5"/>
a ſtated Intercourſe with Heaven, and has recorded the gracious Paſſages of Providence, the rich Returns of Prayer to him. 'Tis true, there is a continual ſucceſſion of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies through all the minutes of our lives, which we cannot obſerve and remember; but as there is a different Glory in the lights of Heaven, <hi>One Glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, and another of the Stars;</hi> ſo ſome are eminent and illuſtrious above others, and ought to be remembred and acknowledg'd with Solemnity.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Mercies he has been deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and could not be ſilent, but opens the Treaſures of his Experiences, and with <hi>David,</hi> the great Pattern of Thankfulneſs, calls upon thoſe that Fear the Lord, to Read what he has done for his Soul. His end is, to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his Bleſſed Benefactors, and to invite others to partake of the ſame Mercy. May his Example excite us with diligence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to maintain Communion with God on Earth, the ſweet and ſure anticipation and earneſt of our Communion with him in his Temple above, where Light, and Love, and Joy, ſhine in their perfection for ever.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>WHO amongſt the adopted Sons of God, can behold the abounding Vice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, the profeſſion of Chriſtianity made a Cloak for Sin and Error, and the lazineſs of Chriſtians lives in our day, and not awaken our ſelves to hear God ſpeaking in the ſame language to us, as to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. <hi>43.10. You are my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> Is God's Divine Providence practically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd or retrench'd, when ſo much thereof is in the conſtant view of the ſons of men? Is the Word of Truth deni'd by a Sectary of Deiſts, when ſo much thereof is felt as real in the Souls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? Is the Godhead of Chriſt, with the Being of a Divine Spirit, ſo audaciouſly and prophanely deni'd, when thoſe who have experienced the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the ſatisfaction of the firſt, by the powerful application of the latter, witneſs the reality of both? I am reſolved therefore to make no other Apology for my Printing the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, than that it is in obedience to the Apoſtle's charge to all Believers in the 10th verſe of the 4th Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter, As eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter
<pb facs="tcp:49481:6"/>
the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> What I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, I have receiv'd, and in theſe gradual ſteps, and in the uſe of theſe means treated of in the firſt and latter part of the Diſcourſe; and therefore in the imparting of what God has done for my Soul, and by what means, I hope I ſtand his witneſs this day on the earth, and approve my ſelf a faithful Steward in miniſtring the ſame things to others, and that in the way wherein they were received. There ſeems to be a Confederacy between Satan and the men of this Age, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the Oracles of God, but his Word is a firm foundation of Faith; and ſincere Chriſtians clearly ſee the Characters of its Divinity, and feel the ſanctifying comforting efficacy of it, and many have ſeal'd its truth with their blood: Others in their dying hours, when men ſpeak with moſt feeling, and leaſt affectation, have declared their unſhaken belief of it; and others, in converſe with thoſe they moſt dearly love, and therefore would not deceive. Each Chriſtian therefore is under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to glorify God according to their meaſure of experience concerning God and his Divine Truths. All are not in the office of the Miniſtry; and there ſeems in our day but ſmall opportunity in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to witneſs for Chriſtianity. Converſe with the Prophane is of ſo dangerous conſequence, that diſcourſe of ſuch things occaſion God and his Truth to be mock'd, yea, to my certain knowledge blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Converſe with ſome under the character of greater Sobriety, draws forth ſuch open confidence
<pb facs="tcp:49481:7"/>
in Error, as to tell us God's Word, the Rule of our Faith, is to be laid aſide, and Debates in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity are to be left off, at the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis;</hi> they giving no credit to its Truths than ſo far as their natural Reaſon can comprehend; whereas the Soul was corrupted in all its faculties by the Fall. Although in the ſtructure of the world, and its preſervation, with the various turns of Providence, there are clear diſcoveries of the Divine Maker; yet how little advance did the wiſe Philoſopher make to that perfection of Soul which was in man before the Fall, or to that that is obtain'd under the influencing light of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Divine Spirit, or ſhall be in man plac'd in a ſtate of glory? And though God has added to us his bleſſed Scripture in conjunction with the works of Creation and Providence, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our thoughts upon, for the perfecting of our knowledge, yet to what little advancement do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attain in the underſtanding of God and Divine Myſteries! Therefore our compaſſionate Father in Chriſt, ſenſible of our weakneſs in the real and firm underſtanding of Divine Things, has given forth another help to our dark Soule in conjunction with the former, even his Divine Spirit, teaching us all truth, and helping us to a reſt and reliance upon his Word, working in us a ſenſe and feeling of thoſe great and marvellous myſteries for prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Souls towards the more full and glorious perception of them. The Revelation in the Old Teſtament was like the morning-light, mixt with the ſhades of the night; the Revelation in the

New Teſtament is clear day; but the Revelation of God and Chriſt in Heaven, is like the Sun at noon in its full luſtre. If this therefore has been God's gradual method to reſtore men, and we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſo bright a diſcovery of mercy to ſave us, thoſe who refuſe to accept it, cannot eſcape the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation due as the recompence of it, the dwelling in darkneſs with the children of darkneſs and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience for ever, <hi>Rom. 2.</hi> If thoſe who have had no other help in the underſtanding of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of God, beſides the beholding of created things, are left without excuſe for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving that light, and being obedient to it; How much more inexcuſable ſhall they be who have the light of Life ſhining upon them, do not believe the Supernatural Truths revealed by it, and will rather charge the Doctrines of the Goſpel with Impoſſibility, than acknowledge the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs of their underſtandings? Converſe with ſome real Chriſtians in a way of Experience is greatly laid aſide; feaſting, diſcourſing the common affairs of the Nation, the recommendation of Self-notions in Religion, and the diſparaging of others, are put in the room of ſuch Conference; that the ſerious Chriſtian putting in ſentences of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Religion is immediately repulſed, with the pleaſing, though lazy, Excuſe, of Experiences being too nice and dangerous to be talk'd of, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is found ſo, when either triflingly obſerved, or biaſſed with the vicious deſign of applauſe, and mutual inſtruction and comfort out of the Soul's aim.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:49481:8"/>Printing therefore I have made choice of. Its commonneſs and unſucccſsfulneſs in the hands of the moſt Learned and moſt Holy of God's Children had greatly diſcourag'd me, if God's ſpecial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of diſcovering Himſelf and his Word to my Soul, and that in ſo ſhort a while, had not put me under a greater obligation than ordinary to witneſs for him, when ſo many bear falſe witneſs againſt his Attributes and Revealed Will. And therein I deſign not to debate the Reality of Inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, (being come, bleſſed be his Name, to full eſtabliſhment and aſſurance thereof) but to tell you, That Chriſtianity is ſomewhat elſe than an outward Profeſſion, more powerful in its dominion than the by-ends of Applauſe, outward Intereſt, or the ſtrength of Education, and never to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by corrupt Reaſon alone, without the help of Divine Revelation, and a Divine Spirit; and to convince hereof, I deſign not ſenſible demonſtration, but firſt of all to give you a Narrative of ſome My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries experienc'd, I formerly was unacquainted with as Evidences of an inward change, and of the life of Religion to be between God and the Soul; my outward Converſation while under the power of Education, having been in great meaſure as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in appearance as now.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument to perſuade to the Duty of Obſervation, is, That it is introductory to greater matter of Obſervation. 'Tis known to all obſerving Chriſtians, That the more they have obſerved, the greater things have been brought to their view, and leſſer Providences remark'd, have led to greater; the ſmalleſt ſtep a Chriſtian makes toward God, it's greatly encouraged by him, and he will enable us to further Progreſs in his ways. How evident is this from Chriſt's words to <hi>Nathanael, Believeſt thou becauſe I ſaid, I ſaw thee under the fig-tree? thou ſhalt ſee greater things, heaven open, and the angels of God aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſcending upon the ſon of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the obſervation of outward Providences, you will ſee God in the Bleſſings he beſtows: <hi>Jacob</hi> when he met his Brother <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 33.10. ſays with a Rapture of Affection, <hi>I have ſeen thy face, as tho I
<pb facs="tcp:49481:9"/>
had ſeen the face of God:</hi> This at firſt view looks almoſt like Blaſphemy; but in <hi>Eſau</hi>'s reconciled face to him, he ſaw the Face, Preſence, and Favour of God; the principal Object was not ſo much <hi>Eſau</hi>'s reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, as the Favour and Hand of God in bringing it about; this raiſed his Spirit to ſuch an Exclamation: Such a ſight of God in the going forth of his Divine Providence, neceſſarily ſuppoſes its Obſervation. Is it therefore poſſible to obſerve means probable of bringing forth ſuch deſigns, but made unſucceſsful? The contrivances of the Wiſe brought to other ends than they purpoſed? The evil Craftineſs of others to their Diſhonour and Ruin, when deſign'd for their Honour and Preferment? Yea, means in appearance tending to hurt, bringing forth great good? Is it poſſible, I ſay, to obſerve theſe things, and not to diſcover another Power above Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Policy to contrive, or Human Strength to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuate? Even the Sovereign Power of an Infinite God, who many times determines Events contrary to mens deſigns, but ſtill for the bringing forth his own.</p>

            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49481:10"/>
            <p>Firſt, I begin with the Narrative, and take this Account of my ſelf under no other power of Chriſtianity than the effect of Religious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: One Born within the Pale of the Church, inſtructed in the knowledge of the True Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and enabled to diſcourſe of them; with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of knowing the Things of God, (tho' but Notionally then;) Trained up with the continued Example of performing all the Duties of Hearing, Reading, and Praying, with that powerful influence, that publick or private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion were ſeldom neglected, but not diligent and ſerious in the peruſal of the Scriptures; Beſides, all this under the advantage of Religious Converſation and Holy Practice, was ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully impreſſing, that in the courſe of my Life, never one ſingle act of the common Vices of Drinking, Swearing, or Uncleanneſs, tainted my Converſation: Yea, the impreſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo ſtrong, as after my departure from under this ſtrictneſs of inſtruction and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtill the ſame exactneſs in Duties and Converſation remain'd, tho' Youthful Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſurrounded me. God's reſtraining Grace was my preſervative; and my natural deſire to be in Buſineſs was a means of preventing the impreſſion of Temptations; yet ſtill I was in the dark as to the ſaving knowledge of True Chriſtianity, or the inward power of Grace ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly acting in the Soul; my natural diſpoſition
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49481:10"/>
inclining me more to Obſervation, than to much Talk in Converſation, led me not only to obſerve the Diſcourſe and Actions of others, but even to remark the Events attending my Life, with Reflections thereupon, without any regard to it as Duty, or productive of the knowledge of Divine Things, but purely as the effect of natural Curioſity, inducing me both to obſerve and to record them with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in reviewing them; and finding the more I obſerv'd, the greater and more numerous things were preſented to me, I became ſtricter in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving things of great and ſmaller moment. While I continued in this practice, a Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Providence occurr'd, that induced me not to truſt in my ſelf, or ſecond Cauſes, but by a ſiducial aſſent to the Being of a God in his full governing Power, as to Perſons and Things, with a full deſire of being intereſted in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of this Great and Omnipotent God, to live in an entire dependance upon Him.</p>
            <p>The Providence was as follows: Being call'd to attempt a matter of great concern, (that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny far excelling me in Age, rational Judgment, and natural Activity, had endeavour'd, though unſucceſsfully, to bring about) I brought the Buſineſs, and that in a very few days, to all ſeeming probability of ſucceſs; but being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by a Providential Occaſion to be abſent, and to appear where thoſe that had try'd their endeavour to no effect did uſually reſide, I found the progreſs I had already made, with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49481:11"/>
the proſpect of perfecting the matter, had ſo increaſed the eſteem of my ſelf, that diſparaging of thoſe, was the Game I then exerciſed my ſelf withal; but returning to the place where the Buſineſs was to be performed, matters were altogether chang'd for the worſt; and upon enquiry of the time this change happen'd, (my cuſtom of Obſervation having brought me to ſome more than ordinary curioſity in it) I found it exactly anſwering the time my Luſt of Pride put forth its Tyranny in my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and ſtepping from the Floor to my Bed, that very night, this Suggeſtion ſuddenly and ſtrongly darted into my Mind; That by my ill return to God's Kindneſs, affording ſuch hopes of ſucceſs, in detracting from Him the Praiſe that was entirely due for ſuch an eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and in not retaining an humble Senſe of my own Unworthineſs and Inſufficiency, I had provoked the Lord thus to turn the courſe of the Affair, immediately convincing me who it was that had made me to differ from others of more promiſing Abilities than I, and impreſſing my Mind with great ſeriouſneſs of Thought, and force to Prayer, begging Pardon from Him, and His further aſſiſtance in the matter, with a full reſolution of looking to God, extolling Him, and debaſing my ſelf in the ſucceſs. My Prayer was immediately return'd, evident by the great alteration that immediately happened, as a ſweet Condeſcention of God to train a poor Creature to the Knowledge of Himſelf, and to delight in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49481:11"/>
Him; but in a weeks time more, being call'd to the ſame place as before, I found the ſame Self-applauſe return: This was a full conviction to me of the great need of continued ſupplies of Heaven after the greateſt confirmations of God's Love to preſerve us from forgetting his Mercies, or repeating failures; and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this, the ſame unſucceſsful turn hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the affair, which was ſo powerfully bore home upon my Soul, that I could not but ſee God with favour in one hand and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another; marvellous Mercy in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to the ſenſe of my failure, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of my Addreſs to Heaven; Puniſhment in withholding his aſſiſtance, the juſt merit of my forgetfulneſs, and of my repeated failure: Upon Addreſs to God by ſerious and ſincere Prayer, with unfeign'd Confeſſion, the Buſineſs turn'd again with a favourable aſpect of ſucceſs; ſuitable to the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I confeſſed my Sin, and thou forgaveſt the Iniquity,</hi> or Puniſhment, <hi>of my Sin;</hi> And at laſt by his Divine Aſſiſtance, attain'd a final and perfect ſucceſs, though between my firſt undertaking and this final Iſſue, there was four turns of Providence exactly anſwering my Soul's poſture.</p>
            <p>From hence I date my firſt ſence of inward ſerious thoughtfulneſs of paſſages of Divine Providence; of minding God in all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, with an entire dependance upon him for conduct to the right uſe of means, and for a Divine Bleſſing to make them ſucceſsful, of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49481:12"/>
certainty of acceſs to him; for this very end, with a diſtruſt of ſelf-ſufficiency, all which met as it were in a moment in my Soul, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God's bearing home this paſſage upon me: But from the Obſervation of God's further me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of outward Providence and inward Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Spirit, I have found that theſe were but little glimmerings of light, an Eye begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be open'd after a ſound and ſecure ſleep. God having marvellouſly enlightn'd my Eyes ſince, and made me to ſee what before I knew only in the notion, enabling me to diſcourſe thereof; but what now, I hope, I may ſay I have felt, and am well aſſured of, even the truth of an inward change upon the Soul, putting it ſelf forth with ſuch power, as to hinder Thought, Words and Actions to run in the ſame courſe from the ſame principle, or towards the ſame end as before, but to tread according to a Rule, not of ſelf, but of God's Will.</p>
            <p>I could ſubjoin many circumſtances of this Providence here related, that might marvellouſly affect the Reader; yea, other Providences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lord's firſt exciting deſigns, as well as his method in bringing them ſucceſsfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, were it not that I am unwilling to be known to the World, and that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Mockers at, and Unbelievers of theſe great things experimental Religion has made known to my Soul, may not prejudice themſelves by imagining ſhow, ſelf-commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49481:12"/>
and applauſe at the bottom of this deſign, the faithful aim thereof being to bring men off their reliance upon notional Religion, and their truſting to their rational concluſions, as fitteſt means to inform them of Chriſtianity, or to their own ſtrength as ſufficient help to the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Goſpel Duties; and to lead them to the vital part of Chriſtianity, experiences therein, not to be maintain'd by notional know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or quarrelling Debates, but by a ſerious and ſtrict uſe of means God commonly imparts the experience of himſelf and his Word by; The Lord has given forth great Truths to be tryed and experienced in the Chriſtian Soul, but we are not at the pains either to obſerve them, or by mutual converſe to confirm one another in the truth of them.</p>
            <p>A Second Reaſon is, Leſt it prove Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to my ſelf, exciting a corrupt Principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to puffing up, whereas great Humility is the companion of ſuch Experiences when firſt felt in the Soul, and ought to be preſerv'd in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting them to others, leſt we our ſelves be exalted above meaſure, or ingage others to think of us above what we are.</p>
            <p>Again, this change wrought in my Soul, <hi>is the Lord's own doing;</hi> let it therefore in its declaration glorifie him by Confirming ſome, and Inſtructing others, without any knowledge of my ſelf therein, but with full diſcovery of the actings of a Divine Spirit.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49481:13"/>This Seriouſneſs brought forth by the means of ſo remarkable an outward Providence in the Hand of God, was ſoon accompanied with ſome ſenſible Changes never felt formerly, but then ſo viſible as forced me to commit them to a Diary; ſome whereof were as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> An Eye to God in all Things, a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning of Him for all Things, with ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Reſignation to his Will in all events. It was not as before, a truſting to nothing but what was ſenſible, a diſtraction of Thoughts to find out this or the other inſtrument to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch an event; but now I could hope in things unſeen; and inſtead of hurrying of Thoughts to find out means to bring about an event, I began the purſuit of a deſign with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous addreſs to Heaven, for conduct to my ſelf in the uſe of means, and for a Bleſſing to the event according to his Pleaſure; enlargement in Prayer was not at this time underſtood, only when an endeavour in the uſe of means and with addreſs to God, was made ſucceſsful, I could not but obſerve it, with ſome excitings to love this God that had given me my Heart's Deſire, and that in anſwer to Prayer; which brought me,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſome Truſt to God; Senſe begun to be out of favour, whereas formerly I could encourage my ſelf in nothing but what was either in poſſeſſion, or in all probability certain; now there were ſome ſparklings of Truſt to God, and Love to Him I had been ſo obliged
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49481:13"/>
to by his Bleſſings, Endeavours, and anſwering of Prayers, which would often raiſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in my Thoughts, how gratefully and dutifully I ought to endeavour the pleaſing of him, whoſe Strength was my Aſſiſtance, whoſe Ear was ſo open to my addreſs, which prov'd a ſenſible mean of bringing me,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To a diligent ſearch of the Scriptures, therein to know his Will, and by endeavouring conformity thereto, to pleaſe him who had made himſelf to be obſerv'd thus loving, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as formerly with Hiſtorical delight only the Scriptures were made uſe of by me; my Thoughts then run pleaſantly after the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical meaning, as well as the Notional Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; at which time the 15th <hi>Pſalm</hi> throughout greatly accompanied my Thoughts, and enclin'd me for ſome conſiderable time to breathe forth continual Petitions for practical Conformity to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Great exerciſe of Hatred to thoſe Sins that uſually did beſet me. While under the impreſſion of Education, and Religious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſober Society, my outward life was free from ſingle acts of common Vice; yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſenſe and feeling of an inward change, a long roll of inward Corruptions I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, that the World and I were not judges of, tho' then they offer'd themſelves fully to my view.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> An inward ſeriouſneſs of Thoughts, as well as outward gravity in performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49481:14"/>
aiming then at pleaſing God in the parts of his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A ſerious free affection towards Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians, the leaſt degree whereof I never had formerly any evidence, their Converſation in Chriſtianity having often prov'd confinement and burthenſome, unleſs where Relation and Friendſhip made it leſs tireſome: The firſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence whereof diſcover'd it ſelf in my Carriage towards ſome who had falſly reproach'd me with an Aſperſion baſe in its Nature, and likely to be injurious to one againſt whom I had determin'd Proſecution; but this inward change happening in the mean while, both my malice and reſolution of Revenge ceaſed at once, with ſome uneaſineſs of mind, till I had diſcourſed the thing with themſelves, and given them my own ſenſe of its ill management, they having been bound in conformity to God's Divine Word to have imparted the reproach firſt to my ſelf, by doing whereof its falſhood would have been known, and their ſpreading of a falſe reproach to the injury of others might have been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; a caution to all Religious Profeſſors giving too great heed to common Reproaches, and too great way to their ſpreading them in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. My Malice and reſolved Revenge were turn'd into affectionate Inclinations and good Actions; after which inſtant, a delight in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Chriſtians, though mean in outward circumſtances, was more pleaſing to me than all the hurrying joy of Companions abroad,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49481:14"/>
when at any time oblig'd to be witneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> A ſurpriſing compaſſion towards the Poor, with continual Ejaculatory Praiſe, that my Station was otherwiſe than theirs; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when going along the Streets or Roads, if objects of Charity preſented themſelves, this frame of praiſing God was immediately upon me, bleſſing him for my being in other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances than theirs, of want or bodily Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; with a watch over my ſelf, leſt in my Charity deſire of applauſe, or any degree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs had appear'd. Charity to be ſeen of men receives its reward when view'd by men; unwillingneſs therein ſpoils it in its nature, and takes off all expectation of a reward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> A clearer ſenſe of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and of Chriſt the Redeemer. Tho' I had the Notional Knowledge, and Hiſtorical Faith of both, yet in Prayer or Meditation, my admiring Thoughts of free Grace, and my words of Praiſe for its effects upon the Soul, would continually center upon God the Father; yea, in Prayer there always would appear a conſtraint from giving any diſtinct Worſhip to Chriſt, for his adorable love in the Work of Redemption, and that for ſome time after the ſenſible evidence of this inward Charge, which was an opportunity to Satan, to argue againſt the Deity of Chriſt, if God's reſtraining Power had not chain'd his Malice from tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon that tender Plant of Grace, beginning
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49481:15"/>
to bud forth; and tho' Satan was under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint as to any Aſſault or Victory of this kind; yet I found an uneaſineſs and diſſatisfaction in my ſelf for not being enabled to give Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prayers, centering upon God the Son, as well as upon God the Father, which made me impart my concern of Mind to ſeveral Miniſters of eminent Gifts, but had Inſtruction from none, ſave one, who thus anſwer'd me out.</p>
            <p>No wonder <hi>(ſays he)</hi> our Love and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, our Prayers and Praiſes run moſt towards God the Father, theſe being as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tribute, which in nature we allow to God as Creator and Preſerver of us. Whereas a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Eye to Chriſt as Redeemer, or as God, in Worſhip ſeems more the effect of the Bleſſed and Divine Spirit. Which anſwer was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied at the time with ſome ſatisfaction of Mind; but ſoon after this inward Change put forth ſuch ſtrong and numerous evidences with heart-ſervice in the parts of Divine Worſhip, as well as outward Gravity therein, that ſelf-ſufficiency was laid aſide, and hope entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon Chriſt's Satisfaction as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Goſpel Priviledges, was raiſed, with a clear apprehenſion of Chriſt's Satisfaction, and with a diſtinct Worſhip of him in Prayer; from whence I was eaſily confirm'd, that under the incapacity of Worſhipping Chriſt as God, I was not under the ſaving ſenſible power of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49481:15"/>
but that now under this ſaving change of Soul, producing, among other things, a clear view of Chriſt, the foundation of our rich Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, I could perform a diſtinct worſhip of Chriſt in Prayer, and do hope that I am under the inſtruction and inward power of that Divine Spirit, whom he has promiſed ſhould guide us unto all Truth in the uſe of his means; <hi>John</hi> 14.26. What is a guide otherwiſe in Nature and way of power upon the Soul, than that the product only of religious Education, and of the Notional Knowledge of Chriſtianity?</p>
            <p>As by the word of Truth, with a frequent uſe of the Sacrament, ſo by this very experience, I have been wonderfully eſtabliſhed in the truth of the Godhead of Chriſt, againſt all the <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> falſehoods of the men of this Age; in that Duty of the Holy Sacrament I have often been ſo raviſh'd with the Contemplation of Chriſt's Love in himſelf as God and Man, that at the very time I have been in great exerciſe of pity towards thoſe poor Creatures who deny his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; and have oft thought with my ſelf, that unacquaintance with themſelves on God's own word, experience in their Soul, was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their diſtruſt of Chriſt as God. How weak are the <hi>Socinian</hi> Arguments againſt our Bleſſed Redeemer as God? And tho they be prevalent upon ſome unacquainted with God's word, at leaſt not experimentally felt as truth upon their Souls, yet they are eaſily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the Scriptural diſcovery of Chriſt's

Two diſtinct Natures in One Perſon for ever. And how much more weak will they appear at that bleſſed day of Reſurrection, when they ſhall ſee him in his perfect Glory, as God-Man, Redeemer of loſt Man, and the Judge of them that would not comprehend him as a Glorious God.</p>
            <p>What is more plain than that Scriptural evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Godhead of Chriſt in the Firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 20? <hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us underſtanding that we might know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Chriſt Jeſus; this is the true God, and eternal life;</hi> if we are in him, ingraſted by the operation of his Divine Spirit, we ſhall draw forth ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him both as certainly come, againſt all the <hi>Jews</hi> on Earth; and as God, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, againſt all the <hi>Socinians</hi> at this day; from my own experience. I deſire to put my poor Seal to this Scripture-truth, diſcoverable in what I have already laid before you.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49481:17"/>
it is ſaid, <hi>If any deceivers come unto you and bring not this Doctrine, receive them not in your houſe, neither bid them ſpeed;</hi> both being an argument of Familliarity, but juſtly reproving thoſe who are ſo far from giving ſuch diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to Deceivers, that if by them can be diverted Splenetick Vapours by acuteneſs of their Wit and diverting Converſation, they ſhall have as great, if not greater room in their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Houſes, as thoſe whoſe delight is to communicate and diſcourſe the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Grace. By this means we hug the tools of ſpreading Errors in our Boſoms.</p>
            <p>To proceed in the Narrative of God's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method of carrying on this great inward change in the uſe of his uſual means, I ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> of all lay before you the Experiences of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Souls acceſs to God in Prayer, of the ſeriouſneſs of frame therein, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and meer Profeſſor, though never ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Religious, are altogether unacquainted with; the experiences of the certainty of Chriſt's Spirit interceding in us in Prayer, and of the correſpondency thereof to God's return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Experiences of God's method of working ſenſibly, and fructifying Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Experiences of the with-holding Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences in Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49481:18"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Experiences of God's method of training the Soul to right hearing of the Word, and participation of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>Experiences of the Firſt, take in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Order.</p>
            <p>My Firſt Experience leading me to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of what is expreſs'd above, was, That when providentially call'd to the undertaking of any matter of great concern and difficulty, that then, according to the fervency and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Soul carrying me forth to ſupplicate, ſo encouragement has accompanied the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of ſuch an Affair; and when endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour has been to be continued in, according to the continuance or intermiſſion of this frame, ſo encouragement or diſcouragement has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; ſome inſtances whereof I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the following method, where the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour has been of three days duration. The firſt day I have been Heavenlily carried out in Prayer; the next two days this frame has been remov'd, and the matter either neglected in Prayer, or ſuperficially given up to God; And upon the examination of the ſucceſs of Means throughout thoſe three days, I have ſound emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſucceſs the companion of the firſt days En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; but in the uſe of the two following days Endeavour, a perfect diſcouragement, and that exactly anſwering the two different po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Soul that Prayer in theſe different days was put up to Heaven in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49481:18"/>A Second Experience was, when in one Prayer I have Petition'd the Lord concerning two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent matters; and Pleading for the one, my Thoughts have been raviſhingly carried forth; but ſupplicating for the other, a damp has been upon my mind, and neither life or vigour in its frame, nor freedom of words in utterance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; Praying then no otherwiſe than while under the power of Education, and ignorant of any inward change of Soul by the power of a Divine Spirit; and in the enquiry have found, that the deſign and deſire Spiritually given up to God's Divine conduct, has been ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought about; but that the other was without imminent probability, or real and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>A Third Experience was, When my frame of Mind has been cold, liſtleſs and lazy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing thus throughout a Prayer, excepting one Petition that ſuddenly has ſeized my Thoughts, and has been in ſweet Heavenlineſs of frame put up, yea, ſo ſeriouſly and powerfully put up to God, unconceivable by any unacquainted with fellowſhip with God in Prayer, the Petitions before and after having been askt of God with great coldneſs of frame, and conſtraint of words; but this to which God was to return an anſwer, and for which ſtrength was conveyed to Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, correſponded a viſible and eminent return of Prayer, without the leaſt meaſure of anſwer to the other parts of Prayer thus coldly given up to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:49481:19"/>Many inſtances of theſe Experiences I could bring forth, and that fully diſcovering the nature of them more plainly; but fear of being known, confining me, I ſhall only lay before you one, which was marvellous in my eyes at the time, and has often been repeated in my Experience ſince.</p>
            <p>Having been for ſome days engaged in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to obtain a deſign of great moment, in the diligent uſe of all viſible means, that only excepted of giving it up to Heaven by Prayer; I reſolved one afternoon to go abroad on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to know the ſucceſs of means made uſe of; but after walking down one pair of Stairs, there ſuddenly ſeiz'd me an unexpreſſible force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that I might firſt Petition the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; and bowing my Knees, a ſweet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious frame ſeiz'd my Mind, and my Thoughts were carried forth with great warmth and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of utterance concerning the matter: After this Addreſs to God, and going forth, I found that the leaſt degree or ſhadow of ſucceſs had never appeared till that very time, in which I was under ſo undeſign'd and ſudden a force to Prayer, and with ſo Heavenly a frame therein; the times of both ſo exactly anſwer'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I was under a meaning Meditation of the thing, clearly evincing of a Power above ones ſelf.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances in this inſtance moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, were, firſt, ſudden and prevalent force to Prayer, undeſign'd by previous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49481:19"/>
and altogether different from that of a ſudden remembrance of any thing forgot, but very ſuitable to the exciting-methods of Chriſt's Spirit, and quickning Influences upon the Soul, raiſing it out of a dead frame, or exciting it to Duties omitted or careleſly performed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou cauſeſt to approach unto thee;</hi> and if this was not cauſing me to approach him, never any motion was; viſible by the ſudden and ſtrong excitement to that Duty formerly omitted, and by imparting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Strength to petition concerning it, in Prayer, and to reſiſt the corrupted reluctancy to it.</p>
            <p>A Second Thing remarkable in the inſtance, was, the ſtruggle in my ſelf at the firſt excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Prayer, between an inclination and averſion to returning, with the victorious ſtrength of Divine influence, bringing me to a willing performance of the Duty; which circumſtance prov'd amongſt the firſt, to confirm my Faith in the reality of there being <hi>a law in the Members warring againſt that law of the Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third Circumſtance in the inſtance, was, The exact correſpondency of the time of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, and Heavenlineſs in Prayer, to the time of the real, tho' unexpected ſucceſs; a circumſtance greatly diſcovering Self-inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in the uſe of means, without Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct therein, and Truſt to God for the Event.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49481:20"/>The Fourth Experience concerning Prayer, was, when any failure obſerv'd in Thought, Word or Action, and accompanied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of Mind, and great Spirituality in Prayer in acknowledging it to God; that then I have found, as its immediate concommitant, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs and concern perfectly gone off, with full quiet poſſeſſing my Thoughts, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of greater watch its conſequent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the truth of the 6th and 7th verſes of the 4th chapter of <hi>Philippians;</hi> never experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing either eaſe of Mind, as to events, giving up to Divine conduct, as to concern for ſinful failures, but when carried forth heavenlily in Prayer for either.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſubjoyn hereto an experienced cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, That according to the greatneſs of my fear as to any event, leading me the more frequently to Heaven by Prayer, and the leſs to confidence in outward means, the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly eminent the return has been, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the excellency of the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> method, <hi>What time we are afraid, we will truſt in the Lord;</hi> with the uſe of that Bleſſed means of ſerious Prayer, I have oft experienced, that Truſt to an outward inſtrument for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about any deſign, with a reſting therein without frequent and fervent Prayers for the ſame end, has made the mean that was ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the hands of others, or that is in its ſelf tending naturally to a ſucceſsful event, of none effect to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49481:20"/>A Fifth Experience, was in the Lord's afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me heavenlineſs of frame, and the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Divine Spirit for an event in Prayer, when all hopes from any thing elſe had been remov'd, and no ground of hope left but what was drawn from this frame of Soul in Prayer, and the full quiet of mind concerning the event, brought forth by the ſame Divine Hand: I could ſet down numerous inſtances of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of Death to Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, where nothing of probable hope was left, but what was draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from this experience of the Spirit of God interceding with me, by carrying me out to ask in a manner far above my ſelf, for their Recovery; and then againſt all probable expectation, the recovery has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: Yea, at this very time, I can inſtance, a Child, who for ſome time was laid out as Dead, but in my humble hope, Alive; and that purely from the ſenſible power given me to ask its life of the Lord, <hi>Who knows the things of God, but the Spirit of God?</hi> as the Spirit of Man alone knows the ſecret Thoughts and Will of Man; and if the Spirit of God know the Mind of God, and his deſign of beſtowing an event unknown to our ſelves, it is not ſo ſtrange that unexpectedly and ſuddenly, in the uſe of that bleſſed Duty of Prayer, Chriſt's Spirit ſhould breathe upon us ſtrength to ask, what we deſigned not, but what he knew would be, through that method diſcovering the reality of a Divine Spirit, who is to help our Infirmities,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49481:21"/>
who neither know what to ask, nor how to ask of our ſelves, only by keeping in the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God's Will to Prayer, and thereby lay our ſelves in God's road to receive Divine Direction, both to ask what we did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate, and in a manner above our own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corrupted capacity. If the Spirit of God know the Will of God againſt an event, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he draws his Divine influence from the Soul in Petitioning to obtain it, and no other warmth in Prayer appears than what is the product of ſelf, and the great deſire of obtaining it, far differing from that ſeriouſneſs that is the effect of a Divine Spirit, the right obſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of greatly helps the Chriſtian to diſtinguiſh the one and the other.</p>
            <p>I know that great care is here to be taken, not to entertain hopes of obtaining every Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God has not abſolutely promiſed; or by Petitioning without Reſignation to his Will; but from experience of God's condeſcending-way of training up Babes in Chriſtianity, I hope I may ſay, that the Spirit of God never intercedes with us in Prayer to God for any thing that is not to be obtain'd, or without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to his Bleſſed Will; and any miſtake herein muſt ſlow from either of theſe two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Firſt, From an ignorance when Chriſt's Spirit does intercede with us in Prayer: A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tender affectionate Conſtitution, and an ardent deſire after the thing pray'd for, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a likeneſs thereof in ſome, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49481:21"/>
thoughtfulneſs of Mind; or a ſweet Tone and way of Expreſſion brings ſometimes others to a likeneſs of this frame; Whereas the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Chriſtian, from care therein, finds this Prayer come ſuddenly upon him, and with full gale of Strength, far above his own, drawing himſelf forth with that filial Boldneſs, and near Familiarity and approach to God, and with that quiet of Mind concerning the matter, as if its anſwer was already return'd: The obſerv'd experience whereof helps the Soul to anſwer all ſuch cautionary Objections, and diſcovers to its experience, That Reſignation to God's Will goes along with the Heavenlineſs of Frame, to make up the evidence of Chriſt's Spirit, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to ask, without either of which, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſeems cloudy, dull, and uncertain.</p>
            <p>Or Secondly, Miſtakes may come by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying the return of Prayer, through too ſoon judging of the Prayers return'd, or by applying Prayer to ſomewhat elſe than is the real return of the Prayer; the effect whereof has been oft ſo evil, that even many gracious Children of God have been led into Darkneſs, kept from that ſenſe of intimacy that really they had, judging their Prayers unreturn'd, or at leaſt bringing them under great Thoughtfulneſs; though their Faith was fix'd upon God's Word, yet how to reconcile former experiences to this of a Divine Spirit's intercedings for them, and yet unreturn'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49481:22"/>My great help againſt ſuch miſtakes, has been an exact obſervation of my different Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, as well as my different Frames in Prayer, and to ſet down the very Word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd therein. If the Spirit of God give and help the Utterance of Miniſters, as well as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualize their Mind in Preaching, that being recommended by <hi>Paul</hi> as a fit Petition upon his account, and experienced as Truth by the worthieſt of his Miniſters; Why not to give and to help Utterance in Prayer, as well as a Heavenly Frame therein? Whatever others ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or ridicule concerning familiarity of Stile in Spiritual Prayer, I can truly ſay, That when my Frame of Soul has been thus ſuddenly chang'd from Lifeleſneſs to great Spirituality, I have then been in a maze to experience an unuſual freeneſs of expreſſion, wondring at the Words themſelves expreſs'd, and the nearneſs to God that I have thought my Soul approached to: And upon ſome patient waiting before judging the return of the Prayer, and comparing the parts and circumſtances of the event to the words I was enabled to utter, and had afterwards ſet down, I found ſo much correſpondency as is between a Seal and its impreſſion. I know thoſe far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling my ſelf in Grace and Experience with God, loſing the ſight of the return from God, by miſapplying the return not to the Words utter'd in Prayer, but to what they ſo mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired. I remember an inſtance in my ſelf, concerning a Servant's parting from me, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49481:22"/>
Petitioning Heaven for his conduct to the uſe of means for another, I found comfortable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Strength in Prayer; and in ſome hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happening in the company of one, who formerly had recommended a Servant in moſt things acceptable, he inform'd me of another, with a Character far exceeding the firſt; to which Providence I immediately implying Prayer, expreſs'd it at its return, but afterward found diſappointment as to them, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in finding any other ſeemingly evidence of Prayer without Divine Strength put up, and unaccepted by God; but ſoon after, by ſome ſpecial paſſages of Providence, this Servant begg'd leave to ſtay, tho' they had confidently deſpis'd my place, and given warning to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide another in their room, which prov'd bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than changing at that time, tho' a good one had fallen in my way, which was a return ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſuiting the Utterance in Prayer, confirm'd by the compariſon of the latter Event to the Utterance ſet down.</p>
            <p>As this was a plain inſtance of too haſty a judging the return of Prayer, taking one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential paſſage for return, begun only by it, and carried on by other paſſages adjoyn'd thereto; ſo I ſhall lay before you another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of miſapplying the return to the thing deſired, and not to the Utterance in the Prayer Spiritually perform'd, and that by as eminent a Saint as ever liv'd on Earth, tho' now gone off the ſtage of time, without the ſight of its
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49481:23"/>
return, yet died in the Faith of my ſeeing its return, but ſtill his Thoughts was upon what he ſo mightily preſt for, in his own deſire.</p>
            <p>Providentially happening to deſign a matter of great concern, and imparting the deſign, with ſome paſſages of Providence exciting me firſt thereto, to this Saint then on Earth; he deſired ſome time to think upon the matter ere he return'd his Advice, which I found was on purpoſe to lay the whole affair before the Throne of Grace, by repeated Addreſſes thereto; After which he advis'd my undertaking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign from his ſenſe of God's laying it in my way by ſpecial conduct of Providence, and from his ſenſe of his Petition accepted, for Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in it, and marvellous Effects from it, from which I engag'd in the endeavour, but all attempts prov'd unſucceſsful: In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim of which endeavour, my Thoughts in Prayer never fixt to any one Petition concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, beſides Divine conduct in the uſe of means, and Reſignation to his Divine Will; this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour between hopes from this Prayer accepted, and diſcouragement from the unſucceſsfulneſs of attempt, continued for many months, yet ſtill eaſie, and with amazing Reſignation to God's Will, till at laſt ſuch a circumſtance fell out as did unalterably obſtruct the matter, and the return that he applied his Prayer unto; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of which, amongſt his laſt words to me on Earth, long after this diſappointment, he utter'd this Sentence with great exerciſe of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49481:23"/>
Faith, That I ſhould meet with a full diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God's deſign therein, and that in anſwer to his Prayer. Prayer accepted, and the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof given, will never want its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, clearly verified from comparing his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Words to the Events that have atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my life ſince; tho' the diſappointment ſeemed an evidence of his Prayers loſt, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally has led into ſuch things as plainly appear his Prayer's return, his miſtake appearing to be fixing his Spirituality in Prayer, with his other evidences of its acceptation, to what he ſo much deſir'd, to wit, the ſucceſs of an outward endeavour, whereas if his Utterance had been recorded, reflected upon, and compared with Events, that even I begun to find from God in my ſelf, and did diſcover to him, the miſtake might have been prevented.</p>
            <p>In one of his Letters he expreſſes himſelf thus: It is becoming me with much humble ſobriety to ſpeak as to any impreſſion on my Spirit, with reſpect to your buſineſs, though often I dare ſay I have had ſome ſpecial aſſurance from the Lord of his Gracious reſpect to you, ſo as I could not queſtion, the evidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo full and clear, and of ſo great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; yet to you hereof in the way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and am at the furtheſt of perſuaſion, that ſuch a breaking up of Light ſhall occur, as ſhall be matter both of Joy and farther E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment; and if after ſuch unuſual and eminent Evidences he has given of his Reſpect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49481:24"/>
and Favour to you, beyond moſt in this day, would it be ſtrange or grievous, if in ſo great a concern, he ſhould take a new trial of your Love and Reſignation to him, by giving it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely up to his bleſſed diſpoſal? I know you have ſettled your Reliance on his Hand, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the preſent matter, who has been your God, and the God of your youth hitherto.</p>
            <p>In another Letter, his Words were: You ſhall ſee the deſign of the Lord in this affair, however dark it at preſent appear, with that evidence as ſhall tend to a higher eſtabliſhment of you in his Way and Truth, and clear all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dark ſteps; the greateſt experiments of Truſt has been moſt obtain'd in the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of his Peoples caſe.</p>
            <p>In another Letter his Words were: Tho' it is not eaſie to write at ſuch a diſtance, yet I have confidence to ſay, That one day rarely paſſes without ſome ſerious remembrance of you. My laſt acquaintance with you has been amongſt the moſt ſweet remarks of my being in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially as to the bleſſed way of God round you, therein you have been a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength to my Faith; I know not how that matter is with you, but I hope I may adventure to ſay, That if ever I knew converſe with Heaven here, I have often had, yea, in ſome ſpecial way, an anſwer of Peace and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance about the Lord's Gracious Deſign of Grace for you, and of his further teſtifying the ſame to your Soul: I hope you are gaining
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49481:24"/>
new ground of a nearer acquaintance with the way of the Lord, by which you will find, that by the greateſt tryals he takes of his followers here, he then deſigns the greater tryal of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Truth.</p>
            <p>Now comparing the Words of this Saint, expreſs'd, concerning the difficulty I was then under, to my own experience of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence round me, and to the Workings of Chriſt's Spirit in me, ſince that time; I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Senſe and Faith of Prayer accepted, and witneſs its return to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>By the very words of his Letters, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his Petitions, and ſeeming Aſſurance, run upon God's witneſſing his ſpecial favour to me in the way of Providence, and that ſuch breaking up of Light ſhould occur as might eſtabliſh my Faith in God, which bleſſed be his Name, has been the real effect of God's diſappointing my deſire and endeavour after this outward thing; yea, has been a mean in God's hand to diſcover his ſpecial Love to my ſelf, in affording me a better Mercy in its room, and eſtabliſhing me thereby in a Truſt to God as to all things elſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſince theſe outward attempts, ſince thoſe Letters receiv'd, ſuch marvellous occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Providence I have enjoyed, with ſuch inward ſenſible workings of a Divine Spirit, informing and comforting my Soul, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king progreſs in that rich Grace of Faith, and actual reliance upon God in all things, both as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49481:25"/>
to Soul and Body, for conduct in the uſe of means, and events following, which makes out his Prayer accepted, and that his aſſurance was firmly founded, his failure being the miſapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prayer thus ſweetly put up, to a return of what he deſired, and not to the return exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwering the Utterance of his Soul when Chriſt's Spirit breath'd upon his Petitions to God, concerning the Lord's Gracious deſign, and teſtimony thereof to my Soul, I have had wonderful eſtabliſhment, no more amazing; and aſſured to him in his actual ſtrength to Petition it, than to me in its enjoyment, by way of his Prayers return'd.</p>
            <p>It is conceivable by none but thoſe who are ſtrict obſervers of God's Ways, How freely Words fly out of the Mouth of a Soul under a Heavenly raviſhing in Prayer; How familiarly they are expreſs'd, and with what quiet of Mind as to the return, that if the Soul out of this frame would deſire and do all that his own ſtrength could afford, yet he ſhall not attain that height of free utterance, ſo Heavenly a Style, or ſo familiar and near an approach to God in Prayer, as ſometimes ſuddenly in the twinkling of an Eye he ſhall be brought to, and that by the blowings afreſh of Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences.</p>
            <p>I have my ſelf, while under no other power than that of Education, ſtood in a maze to hear Miniſters expreſs Communion with God in Duties, the Influences of Chriſt's Spirit, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49481:25"/>
the like, imagining theſe as words choſen to ſet off Religion, and to make it the more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Souls, till experience diſcover'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality thereof; and ſince the diſcovery thereof to my ſelf, I have often with great concern of Soul, heard Chriſt's Spirit mockt at, Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Influences from him ſo ridiculed, that I could not but exerciſe Compaſſion, comparing their Words to my own Thoughts while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame circumſtance of ignorance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Religion, and the inward power of Chriſtianity; no leſs inſtruction being capable of illuminating ſuch dark Minds, than what is an emanation and influence of that Spirit ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd and ſet at nought in their Thoughts; ſuch a one, and the Creature ſetting Chriſt in his Divine Nature at nought, I place in the ſame Categorical line.</p>
            <p>To this Fifth Experience, I ſubjoin the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtance of an Undertaking, where the Eyes, Hands, and Wiſhes of many were againſt me, and no probable hope of ſucceſs in a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal way, but what I had from the marvellous frame of Soul, and near acceſs to God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and like a Miracle, the uſe of means obtain'd, and the deſired end was brought forth.</p>
            <p>Here I ſubjoin the Experience of humble Awe and Fear, always attending the cleareſt Heavenly frame and moſt ſatisfied quiet of Mind I ever had concerning any one thing; confidence looking to me too much ominous
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49481:26"/>
of ſomewhat of Satan, and commonly proves a mean of ſecurity, and of leſs diligence in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning Heaven, and depending upon God, than when the Soul has an humble Awe, going along with its erperience of God's approach to its Soul.</p>
            <p>A Sixth Experience of God's Spirit carrying forth the Soul to Petition, according to what God was to beſtow, was not only by changing of the Souls frame concerning any one Event, but even by changing the verbal Petitions in the change of circumſtances in the ſame thing: As for inſtance; At the firſt diſcovery of my inward change, my words in Prayer for any undertaking would run upon its ſucceſs, and hardly upon the uſe of means, to which the condeſcention of my Heavenly Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by numerous and continual returns of ſucceſs, tho' my endeavours at my firſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with, and obſervation of God's Ways, were not ſo exact; but upon further knowledge of his ways, and greater progreſs and reliance upon God for conduct to the uſe and right uſe of means, then my words were chang'd, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out in Prayer after Divine Aſſiſtance in the performance of Duty, reſigning the iſſue to his Will; anſwerable to which, a more diligent watch over my ſelf in the uſe of means, and the leſs anxiety concerning the event, appeared; an experience greatly helping the Soul againſt miſtaking God or themſelves, when his Ways run not in the ſame ſtream towards them, their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49481:26"/>
advancement in ſtrength being gradual; and many times according to the different ſteps of growth in Grace, ſo God walks in different ſteps round them, requiring a conſtant obſervation of his ways, admiring their variety, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth ſuitable improvement of knowledge of God, love to him, and dependance upon him: How infinite therefore is the Wiſdom of our Bleſſed God, who knows the various Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the things their Thoughts are moſt fixt to, that his breathing Divine Influence thereupon may be his readier mean to bring them to a ſerious diſcovery of God and their ſelves thereby!</p>
            <p>How infinite is the Wiſdom, Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of our bleſſed Husband-man, in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual growth of all the young tender Branches in his Vineyard, and in training up his Babes in the firſt knowledge of him, feeding the one with Milk, and the other with Meat, knowing well what each ſtand in need of, and can bear, either of his Smiles, or correcting Stripes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering each by degrees to the perfecting of Grace in the Soul, and making it mete for Eternal Glory!</p>
            <p>The Experience whereof helps the Soul to anſwer the Objection of ſome ſerious Chriſtians, but not exact Obſervers, who will reply upon imparting a particular method of God with a Soul by way of caution; You muſt be careful not to depend upon that particular way God acts with you in, leſt Satan make it a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49481:27"/>
to unbelief and diſtruſt of God, and your ſelves, when he ſhall pleaſe to walk in another road with your Soul; but general and ſtrict Obſervers find God's Ways to be thus: That according to the infancy or manhood of the Soul in Chriſtianity, or according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſteps of advancing the Soul towards this Manhood, ſo God's Ways to be various; and according to his different ends, ſo his courſes leading thereto uſually to be different; marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous argument indeed of infinite Wiſdom, Love and Compaſſion in our great God! inſtruction enough to make us ſtand off from preſcribing methods according to our Inclinations or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, but inſtruction to keep our ſelves cloſe in the obſervation of his Ways, in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Prayer for a ſight of his deſign, and the obtaining the eſtabliſhment of Faith, tho' the method of God be never ſo various with us.</p>
            <p>Hereto relates my Experience of God with my own Soul, that according to the beginnings and progreſs of my Faith of Reliance, ſo God's Method has varied; for while in the beginning of this Truſt to God, I think I may ſay, That never a Prayer Spiritually perform'd, wanted its return immediately, and that exactly ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my words in Prayer; but upon further ſtrength of this Grace of Reliance upon God, I have found the return of my Prayer longer defer'd; yea, ſometimes to the laſt pinch of extremity, but ſtill anſwerable to the frame of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49481:27"/>
Soul and Words utter'd in Prayer, when this frame and utterance were above my own ſtrength thorough Divine Influence; argument enough of Divine Wiſdom adapting his various Ways to the various Circumſtances of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens weakneſs and ſtrength; of Divine Love, eſtabliſhing their Truſt to himſelf, and trying their Reliance upon him, as a comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that ſtrength of Grace, and thereby to lead them to the Sacrifice of continual Praiſe, Admiration and Love to him.</p>
            <p>How different was Chriſt's carriage to the Leper, from his acting with the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe Faith far exceeded the other? The Leper, much weaker in Faith, had the return of his Prayer immediately; but ſhe, much ſtronger in Faith, has the return greatly defer'd, with the intermixture of many trying paſſages of Chriſt, with his own ſilence to her own Petition, and with his calling her <hi>a Dog,</hi> as if ſhe were unworthy to be taken notice of, much leſs to receive of his Children's food, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in anſwer to Prayer: The Lord knew her ſtrength, and adapted his way of tryal thereto, which iſſued in Honour to him, and evidence to her ſelf of the greatneſs of her Faith.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt ſaw <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith as a Rock to build his Church upon, he then tells him of the Sufferings to attend him, and all that would follow after Chriſt, his Faith being gradually brought up to ſuch a ſtrength, enabled him to bear this report, which perhaps in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49481:28"/>
might have diſcouraged him to follow Chriſt or his Rules; when therefore we are as <hi>Moſes,</hi> we may be kept ſix days on the Mount before the anſwer of Prayer comes, <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 24. Let us therefore admire God's Wiſdom and Love, in firſt planting or further carrying on Grace in the Soul: Let us be inſtructed, not to limit God to any one way in converting or further perfecting a gracious Soul; but let us keep in the uſe of all God's means, with the obſervation of his various ways of Providence and Spirit, eſtabliſhed upon his Divine Word, and experience in our Souls, that ſo we may be confirm'd in the depth, the length, and height of the Love of God, not only by a Faith wrought and kept in the Soul, but by an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſenſe thereof, experimentally felt, not yielding to that lazy excuſe of the danger of fathoming him; tho' we cannot find God out to Perfection, yet we may comprehend much more of his ways than we do, to keep us in continual admiration and praiſe of his Love, making our life the nearer to reſemble the work of Saints above, not ſuffering his Ways to lie ſtill in the depth without Record thereof, or Reflection thereupon; a method which might greatly prevent the many Fears that many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls meet with in their way, and by which they diſhonour God before the Wicked, that by knowing their own Wants, and God's Method of ſupplying them, might be remedi'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49481:28"/>A Sixth Experience of the Spirit of God's breathing upon the Soul in Prayer, and of its correſpondency to the certain return thereof, was, That according to my Morning's frame in giving up my ſelf, ſo has my frame continued thorough the day, but moſt remarkably thus on a Sabbath-Day, wherein I have found that my frame in hearing a Sermon has greatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd to the frame of my Morning's private Addreſs to Heaven, with that exactneſs, that I could never obſerve or ſet it upon record with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great amazement: Herein miſtake me not, as if I paſſed my day without any other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, reſting upon the comfortable experience of good frame in my Morning's Prayer; but upon all occurrences throughout the day, my ſupplication has been repeated, my method being never to attempt any Service, Civil or Spiritual, without Addreſs to God for conduct therein; and when opportunity of ſet Prayer is deny'd, the ſame Spirituality in Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that correſpondent to return, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, confirming the truth of God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Spirit's helping the Soul to groans not to be utter'd, when the Soul in Meditation is under ſuch a Heavenly Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God as is impoſſible for it to utter.</p>
            <p>I could ſet down numerous inſtances of God's acceptance of Prayer put up before entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Company, with freedom from Quarrel or Diſquiet; and when Diſquiet of any kind has accompanied me, I have found it at ſuch a time
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49481:29"/>
when my Soul has been out of frame, or my Addreſſes to God before my entring the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety has been neglected: Who would not therefore adviſe me to reſt upon God, and to Petition him for all things, and to have all things conveyed to me, with a ſight of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence in it, and as a return to Prayer for it, that when my paſſage through this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs is at end, I may not enter unto an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God, who has been a Father by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conduct of Providence, a Husbandman by the workings of his Divine Spirit; my alone Friend to whom I have put up all my Requeſts, and from whom I have receiv'd all the ſupplies of wants, and that in a way of Communion with him; neither to an unknown work, but that of which I have had ſome foretaſte, in the uſe of Obſervation, Prayer ſolemn and ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory, and Meditation, admiring of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, and praiſing his Name for the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd diſcovery of himſelf.</p>
            <p>A Seventh Experience of Chriſt's Spirit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing to Prayer, and interceding with us in Prayer, with the certain correſpondency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by a return of that Prayer thus perform'd to God, has been by putting words in my Mouth, as well as Spirituality in the frame of my Mind, and that ſuddenly, unpremeditated, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contrary to matter and words deſign'd. To clear this Experience, I will give you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many inſtances, the following one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Friend's Diſtraction in a Fever, for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49481:29"/>
whom my deſign was to Petition God for his recovery, but was carried out in Prayer, and that powerfully too, altogether for the return of their Reaſon, without ever being able to ask one Petition for the abatement and removal of their Fever; upon inquiry I found their Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction gone off, but the Fever remaining the ſame, the return of their Reaſon exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the time of the Supplication for it.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of this Experience, was, Concerning another Friend, for whoſe H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alth I had deſign'd to Petition God, but found my Words in my Addreſs to God, ſtrongly diverted from Petition to Praiſe, bleſſing his Name for what he had done, and that without any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of amendment, or probable reaſon to expect it, but what I had from this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſudden, and undeſign'd utterance in Prayer. Another inſtance of the ſame kind I very lately had concerning a Friend's beloved and only Child, for whom I found in my ſelf great and amazing freedom of Utterance, and that by way of Praiſe, tho' my deſign was to Petition God concerning it, having all humane probability to expect its Death: After the Experience of this Utterance in Prayer, I was kept in the dark till at leaſt ten days, and then had the account of its recovery, yea, of its great amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwerable to the time of the Utterance of Praiſing, being ſtrictly curious in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the circumſtance of time, that none of theſe marvellous Experiences might afford the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49481:30"/>
leaſt doubting in their enjoyment, but obtain a clear reception thereof, and produce the greater eſtabliſhment therein in the Soul.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of the Seventh Experience, was, Concerning ſome with whom I have had to do in matters of concern, but at a diſtance from me, and without any other opportunity of hearing the proceedings or ſucceſs of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours than by Letter; I have found, that tho' I have deſign'd before the coming in of the Poſt, to ſupplicate for a good account; yet have not been able to ſay any thing at all concerning the matter, anſwerable to which no Letter has come, or other Petitions and Words concerning the matter has been Spiritually darted up to Heaven, than was deſign'd, correſpondent to which, the account receiv'd has exactly anſwer'd the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Utterance actually put forth, and not to them only deſign'd to be expreſs'd in Prayer.</p>
            <p>A Ninth Experience of certainty of acceſs to God, and of his Spirit's breathing power on the Soul to ask what he knew was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, has been concerning a deſign of three different endeavours at one time, and Prayer for guidance, a mean made uſe of; I have found all ſhadow of Spiritual enlargement in Prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, ſtrongly withheld, and ſo indeed has the leaſt degree of ſucceſsful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but for the ſecond, enlargement only once, ſuitable to which ſucceſsful endeavour in one circumſtance thereof, and at that very
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49481:30"/>
time did occur; and for the third, ſuch Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of frame in Petitioning not only once, but all along continued upon the Soul, and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful endeavour without one cloud, prov'd the iſſue: Plainer expreſſion I cannot well uſe, and inſtances I muſt forbear, left it occaſion the diſcovery of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>A Tenth Experience of the Lord's exciting and preparing to ask what he was in his good pleaſure to return, was, That of his exciting and powerfully ſtrengthening of my Soul for a continued time to Pray for ſelf-abaſement, when at the ſame time no outward Temptation has been my motive thereto, though ſoon after has appeared ſome outward advancement, and correſpondent to the Divine Wiſdom and loving care of Chriſt's Spirit, enabling me to ask the exerciſe of Humility, Self-loathing has always accompanied ſuch outward ſmiles; yea, from obſervation of this Experience, I have imagin'd a ſmiling Providence eminent, from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of this ſuit to the Lord undeſign'd, but greatly aſſiſted to Petition it.</p>
            <p>I have often experienced, That when my Soul has not been thus carried out to Petition lowneſs of Mind, either before or in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of outward advancement, that either ſecurity therein has fallen out afterward, imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering my Thoughts, or ſome circumſtances in the thing enjoy'd that has imbittered its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or remov'd its ſatisfaction, nothing being more ſatisfactory to a Chriſtian Soul, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49481:31"/>
of an outward favour by ſpecial ſteps of Providence; argument of Divine favour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch ſtrength of a Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as enables the Soul to improve it, with the exerciſe of Love, and Reliance upon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtower, and to keep the Souls ſatisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in its true Bounds, more upon the diſcovery of God's Love thereby, than upon the thing it ſelf enjoyed.</p>
            <p>As the Experiences already laid before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to outward Enjoyments, ſo now I ſhall give you ſome Experiences reſpecting Spiritual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, anſwerable to Chriſt's Spirit breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influencing-ſtrength to Petition them.</p>
            <p>A Firſt Experience thereof, was, When Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually carried out to ask for Humility, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to any Spiritual Improvement, as well as before any Temporal Enjoyment; and when ſecurity, accompanied with the intermiſſion of the means of Grace, has followed any inward advancement, then has a cloudying of what was an inward comforting evidence to the Soul, iſſued; but when the Soul has been carried forth to ask it before hand, or in the time, by way of return thereto, the Soul's poſture has been in the exerciſe of ſelf-debaſement, and exultation of, and dependance upon Chriſt's Spirit for producing ſuch a marvellous change in the Soul, without the leaſt exalting thought of ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49481:31"/>I remember that one day in Converſation with that Holy Saint mentioned before, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd my ſelf concern'd to know the reality of my Grace; to which he humbly reply'd, I have not had the leaſt Cloud as to my intereſt in Heaven, but ſhould rejoyce to experience that meaſure of confirming paſſages of God's ſpecial love, as I know you have enjoy'd, the effect whereof I found ſome quiet of Mind; but by the wiſe over-ruling hand of God, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with ſuch cloudy darkneſs of Mind, leſt Satan had excited ſelf-exultation or ſinful ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, till in the following Evening-Prayer, God carrying me forth to bleſs his Name for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of his Love, and to Petition Humillity in their enjoyment, the darkneſs diſappear'd, and his diſcourſe was bore home, with the alone effect of quiet of Mind, Love to, and Reliance upon God, and that with humble Thoughts of ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have found, that previous to any victory over ſome particular Sins, I have been help'd wonderfully to plead with God on this very account, in a moſt near and ſenſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him, for <hi>Conqueſt over Sin,</hi> that Scripture being at the time often and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in my Thoughts, <hi>Nay more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors through him that loved us;</hi> anſwerable to which Temptations to theſe, has occur'd Sins, but victory of them has been my Mercy, both as a return to the Prayer Chriſt's Spirit helpt me to ask, and as an evidence of ſuch, a change
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49481:32"/>
in my Soul, as beſpoke my intereſt in Chriſt, by the evident ſupplies of his ſtrength, enabling me to be victor of thoſe Sins that formerly I gave way to.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When God has been to afford me the evidence of great ſupply of ſtrength, to ſuppreſs wandering Thoughts in Duties ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and powerfully for ſome time; ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and great ſpirituality in Petitioning God has ſeiz'd me; anſwerable to which, marvellous free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from wandering Thoughts has occur'd, and that in all the Duties I have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in.</p>
            <p>A remarkable inſtance of this Experience, was, When at a certain time my Petitions run out for ſtrength to overcome wandring in Duty, with full aſſiſtance of God's Spirit to ſupplicate, and by a paſſage of Providence eſtabliſhing my comfort, though wandrings, prevail'd, and a mean of helping forward my victory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>The paſſage of Providence was thus; Being one Sabbath-morning hinder'd from my ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary place of Hearing, and having an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of hearing Sermon in the afternoon, I found my deſire with a conſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aining force to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another place and Miniſter, which was ſo ſtrong, without any rational Motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that I would not be hinder'd, though ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral difficulties occur'd in my way; in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which Sermon, my diſpoſition was ſo ſpiritual, that my Thoughts had full flight thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49481:32"/>
and I in the exerciſe of low eſteem of the Earth, with all its Allurements; but which was the Circumſtance moſt remarkable, is a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion a Miniſter was deſir'd to anſwer to, What ſhould be done to help wandring thoughts in Duties? Which was the very thing my mind was hurried withal then, the thing Chriſt's Spirit was helping me to petition ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and to which he was giving return with ſenſible Supplies; and with this paſſage of Providence quieting my mind, and as a help to forward my endeavour and victory over it; his word was, That it is a Complaint common to all Believers; ſo long as there is a ſenſe and concern for it, the Chriſtian is not overcome by it; go therefore on, not only ſtriving againſt it, but begging the Lord's aid to vanquiſh it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Previous to a ſenſible change in my ſelf as to watchfulneſs in Converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reproaching of others ſuddenly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſignedly; and for ſome continued time my Soul was carri'd powerfully to pray for ſtrength to reſiſt the temptations of reproaching others, either through the natural tendency thereto, the common example of others, or out of the tempting-deſign of ſelf-applauſe, in the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of others; and anſwerable hereto mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſtrength of Chriſt's Spirit was afforded me, with ſpecial Providences diſcovering this ſpiritual ſtrength, accompanied with the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home upon my thoughts that of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>All things whatſoever you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49481:33"/>
would that men ſhould do unto you, do you even ſo with them;</hi> That then I could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſelf, againſt my own corrupted incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and others example, preſerv'd from this too natural and common Vice even of lazy and profeſſing Chriſtians, who by the actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this very paſſage, might be an excellent means to preſerve them from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant infection of reproaching others.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I experienc'd a wonderful ſtrength to pray for a continued ſenſe of God's All-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye, as well in Converſation, as in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Religious Duties; ſuitable to which, not only awful thoughts of his Majeſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd in Duties, preventing Diſtraction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſeiz'd me, but even a powerful awe of God affected me in common and private Actions, always conſidering any Circumſtance in the Action as might deſtroy God's accepting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; eſpecially as to Acts of Charity, wherein I have found ſuch a watch over my ſelf, as I could not have been ſatisfied without ſtrict enquiry, Whether unwillinglineſs was not in the action? Whether ſome deſire of applauſe, or only pity and natural tenderneſs were not the Motives of this charitable action? and nothing then has been more pleaſing, than to find, that a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglineſs to obey God's Command, on purpoſe to pleaſe him, in the compaſſionate relief of others, a chearfulneſs without the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of reluctancy; a ſincerity without the leaſt deſire of its being known, were the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49481:33"/>
ingredients of the Duty. I deſire to witneſs the difficulty of thus performing actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great and actual influences of ſtrength from above, the reception whereof is often obtain'd by that bleſſed means of ſolemn or ejaculatory Prayer, wherein the Spirit of Chriſt intercedes for his People. The ſame Spirit of Prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt upon me a ſenſe of God's all-ſeeing Eye, and that Scripture was continually in my Thoughts, <hi>Of doing all things as unto the Lord;</hi> the conſtant remembrance whereof I have found greatly advancing that Goſpel-perfection of an unfeigned ſincerity, both in converſe with God in Holy Duties, and with one another in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Actions and Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I can tell you, that at another time I have been powerfully helpt to Petition for the exerciſe of love to God; and anſwerable to this, I have been helpt in Prayer, and in worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to draw forth kindlers of Love to God from all ſenſible circumſtances of my ſelf and others, even from the poor in the Streets, both as to their poverty and imperfections of Body, bleſſing the Lord, with ſweet exerciſe of Love to him; yea, this Grace of Love to God has been excited from the obſervation of fulneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in ſome, but with great emptineſs of the inward comfort of the experiencing Chriſtian's Soul; for ſenſual pleaſures divert their Thoughts from the obſervation and enjoyment of what is much more to be valued in their Nature, and laſting in their Duration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49481:34"/>At this very time happening to be alone in a Coach, remarking ſuch kindlers of Love, from circumſtances of others appearing in the ſtreets, ſuddenly and ſtrongly this ſuggeſtion forc'd it ſelf upon my mind: How was it, That God did ſhow ſuch ſpecial favour to me beyond others, yea, to make me differ ſo much from my ſelf in former times! with amazing Thoughts of the change upon my Soul; and immediately that Scripture over-awed me from corrupt rational arguing, or from Satan's darkening or deviate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me from right Conceptions of God and his Ways; <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion;</hi> from whence happened ſuch quiet of Mind, as has by the bleſſing of God ſtill'd my Thoughts perfectly as to that great point of Election, which is the great effect of free unmerited Mercy, and in the uſe of means brings the children of Mercy ſafely to ſalvation. This warmly excited my Love to God, having an evidence of my ſhare in his Electing Mercy, by the inſeparable effects of it, the work of Grace begun in me, and preparing me for the Heavenly Glory.</p>
            <p>A Seventh Experience was, When alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſenſible of the growth of Faith, and when the Lord by a marvellous method was to eſtabliſh it in my Soul, even then I obſerv'd for ſome conſiderable time, that I was carried out in Prayer and Meditation with zealous Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Lord would turn my Eye and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49481:34"/>
truſt from ſenſible things, to a truſt and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon God himſelf as to all outward things, and as to the inward advancement of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lineſs, as a mean tending to future Salvation; anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to which, God has diſcovered himſelf mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly in the ſteps of outward Providential Diſpenſations, and by the inward workings of his Spirit, as means of founding and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Grace of Reliance in my Soul, which I hope ſhall be increaſing in the uſe of means, till Faith obtain its perfect end, the Fruition of God in Glory. And tho' I hope I may ſay in Humility, that my Soul is raiſed above ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, to look to things unſeen, and to ſet my Eſteem and Reliance with comfort and ſatisfaction upon them, independently upon worldly things; yet I am aſham'd for the ſmall growth of Reliance in me, and that greater improvement therein has not been the fruit of the infinitely wiſe and condeſcending method of God's goodneſs in training me to live by Faith in his Promiſes and Perfections.</p>
            <div type="experiences">

               <head>Experience of God's Method in training me to the firſt ſenſe of Reliance, with its further eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment and growth, and that exactly, as they are ſet down in Record in my Diary.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Experience leading me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve God's following Method with me, was that of carrying me forth in Prayer, to petition eſtabliſhment of Faith in my Soul; which begun moſt remarkably after a Fit of Sickneſs, and has continued to be upon my Mind in all my Suits greater or leſſer ſince that, and I hope will continue to the end of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Warfare.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Experience leading me to Reliance upon God, was by removing all dependance from theſe outward fabulous Paſſages, reckoned as ominous of ſuch and ſuch certain Events, which undoubtedly were at firſt the effect of ignorance of the true God amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World, who notwithſtanding the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God in his Nature and Providence by viſible things, the Effects of his Power; yet natural things keep firſt in their view, and had the preheminency of God in their minds and hearts. And though we enjoy the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of God in his Word and Providence ſo plainly, yet how do we retain the example in reducing thoſe things to Natural Cauſes, that are to be appli'd to a Divine Agency, the true
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49481:35"/>
reaſon Chance is ſo much in our ears, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reliance upon God is ſo little powerful in many profeſſing Chriſtians in our day.</p>
               <p>To eſtabliſh this Experience, God made uſe of the following three Means, gradually each after other.</p>
               <p>The firſt was concerning one dangerouſly ill, whoſe Sickneſs, in its Nature, ſeem'd mortal, in the thoughts of Phyſicians, and other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants; and was accompanied with ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Dreams, and other things, that in the old time, (and too much now in our time) were reputed certain Preſages of Death. In the interim, I thought with my ſelf, that if a Recovery ſhould happen, nothing could be in thoſe things fit to be depended upon, and therefore ſhould no more regard them. And one day going thence in a Coach alone, I found my ſelf marvellouſly ſerious in my thoughts concerning it, and aſtoniſhing ſtrength to ask this Perſon's Recovery, and that God would make it a means to help forward for getting off ſuch things, and the placing a truſt on God in their room. Anſwerable to my Prayers, an unexpected Recovery appear'd, changing my thoughts from relying upon ſuch things, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God: But alas! it is ſo inherent in our corrupted Natures to look to, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt Self and natural things more than God or ſpiritual things, that there was a further need of God's powerful influence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49481:36"/>A ſecond Means in God's hand to deſtroy obſervation of, and dependance upon ſuch <hi>Omens,</hi> was the breaking ſome Meaſures ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in my common Undertakings, and reſted upon as preſaging of ſuch Events to it, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the numerouſneſs of Undertakings in the latter part of a week, to thoſe that fell out in the fore-part thereof, which was in obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unſuitable to example; and though the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of other <hi>Omens</hi> be ſuitable to the too-much example of others yet altogether unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Divine Scripture, yea, threaten'd to be accompanied with evil, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>They that obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mercy.</hi> Pſal. 31.6. <hi>I have hated them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard lying vanities, but I truſt in the Lord.</hi> How agreeable is it to the Infinite Wiſdom and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, to bring me from truſting any thing, as a bleſſed means of reliance upon God alone! and therefore I have obſerv'd, that according as the firſt has been gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cutting off, ſo the gradual growth of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God in all things, has ſenſibly ſprung up; and though the effect of this Divine Paſſage was a greater diſtruſt of thoſe vain things, yet God was not pleaſed to reſt here, but to take</p>
               <p>A third Means of advancing this bleſſed Grace of Reliance, and laying low this ſinful eſteem of Natural Cauſes, was a ſevere Fit of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ckneſs, accompanied from the firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, to its perfect removal, with ſuch
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49481:36"/>
providential Steps as beſpoke plainly a Divine Power without Means, drawing my Soul irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly to the obſervation of, and dependance upon him, at leaſt with the uſe of Means.</p>
               <p>One Step whereof was, A fixt apprehenſion of a Fit of Sickneſs imminent, and that as a juſt puniſhment for my truſt to <hi>Omens</hi> of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Events which God by his merciful Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention turn'd about as a ſpiritual Remedy to that reigning Illneſs then too much in my Soul.</p>
               <p>A Second Step was, An unexpreſſible near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God in fellowſhip with him, raviſhing my Soul at the time with that comfortable view, as it were, of Heaven, and deſpiſing things below, that I could not have bore up if it had continued long, and that immediately before the firſt aſſault of my Illneſs.</p>
               <p>A Third was, The ſenſible withdrawing of this Frame for ſome days, till near the danger of being delirious, and the uſe of ſuch Means as formerly had never been us'd towards me, on purpoſe for its prevention.</p>
               <p>A Fourth was, That my Soul was in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly Frame, and carri'd forth with that amazing ſtrength to pray for eaſe to my head, and preſervation from deliriouſneſs, with ſuch an immediate return, that I think I may ſay my head was eaſy, and my judgment clear in a moment after this Addreſs; and though without any reſt for ſome days, yet I was as free in my head as ever to my own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49481:37"/>
this amaz'd me at the time, and gave occaſion to lay aſide the Clyſter and Bliſters which my worthy Phyſicians had preſcrib'd, telling my Nurſe, a godly woman, <hi>That the Lord had done it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fifth Step of Divine Agency was, The powerful carrying forth of my Soul in Prayer after recovery, upon theſe two Petitions which have continued to be expreſſed in all my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to Heaven ever ſince that time, and have marvellouſly continued to be return'd ſince then. The Petitions were, That the Lord would advance a work of Faith, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in my Soul; and that I might diſcover Immediateneſs of him in Providences, and the inward working of his Spirit: which were Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions unpremeditated, and undeſign'd. And as it was Divine ſtrength exciting and enabling me to petition, ſo by influences of the ſame ſtrength he has enabled me to hold on petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by ſenſible Providences and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit, he has eminently diſcover'd his Divine Hand, and my being under his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conduct.</p>
               <p>A ſixth Step was, A more ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſible Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from truſting things commonly receiv'd ominous of future Events, to an intire reliance upon himſelf. The ſearching into Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with excluding a Divine Hand, is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our imagining our ſelves more knowing than we are, and of exalting Nature with its effects, in the room of the Creator, and his Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49481:37"/>A ſecond Experience of God's Method of eſtabliſhing and making to grow in this Grace of Reliance was, By removing Reliance upon ſpiritual Means made uſe of by others on my account, eſpecially when it leſſen'd my own diligence with God for the ſame thing. It is natural for us to overvalue Nature, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, and undervalue God and ſpiritual things; the confirmation whereof I had in my ſelf by an over-valuing of one who, I may ſay, was a great helper of my Faith, and in the making up of whoſe Crown I ſhall, I hope, be a Member in that day of Glory, to whom I would always run with any of my difficulties to acquaint him therewith, ſometimes before my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God therewith in Prayer, and would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain his Intereſt by his Addreſſes to Heaven concerning it, which when undertaken by him would faithfully be perform'd, and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizingly too, from perſonal Affections; and God's inclining me from my youth to obſerve him, which was a Duty greatly aſſiſtant and comfortable. By reaſon of all which, I have had leſs Anxiety concerning the matter, and probable hopes from his intereſt with God to obtain it, and have uſed leſs diligence my ſelf with God upon my own account; which dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from God, upon whom my entire Reliance ſhould have been plac'd, and not to have given him ſome degrees of truſt, that were the alone Prerogative of God. The Method of God to overcome this in my Soul was,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49481:38"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By the diſcovery of this holy Soul's miſapplying Prayer to what he deſir'd, and not to his utterance in Prayer, and that in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair on my account, of which you have already heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By removing him from me at that time when God made him ſo bleſſed a help to my Faith, I giving him more of affection and truſt, than what was his due as God's Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if theſe two had ſufficiently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this Failure, perhaps God had proceeded no farther; but having the opportunity of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to acquaint him with matters of difficulty, and to preſs his intereſt for me, I found this truſt to him, and leſs diligence of my ſelf hold on, and ſo God in his wiſe condeſcending care and love</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Removed him from the world, and that unexpectedly and ſurprizingly; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the end of God concerning himſelf or others, this was plainly diſcover'd to my ſelf by after-paſſages of God's outward Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and inward Spirit attending my life, That my regard was too high to this Inſtrument, and his prevalency with God, and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God; therefore to rectify my Error, the Lord was pleas'd by his death at the ſame time to recall me from truſting in Creatures, but only to rely upon himſelf in the uſe of his ordinary means preſcrib'd in his Word. This may be Caution to all Hearers to give the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters their due place, neither overvaluing ſome,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49481:38"/>
nor undervaluing others, but valuing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring God's Free-grace the more, that by any means is made effectual to eſtabliſh and increaſe Grace in the Soul.</p>
               <p>The departure of this bleſſed Saint, was made a powerful Means of Conviction of my Failure, and that as a leading-ſtep towards higher Truſt to God, with that ſweet Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, that at the time, and often ſince, to obtain ſuch an enjoyment, I could willingly accept of ſuch another ſtroke, though it was very afflicting to my Soul to be deprived of my alone ſpiritual Friend on earth, and the greateſt helper of my Soul; but I am now inſtructed to ſay of God, my choſen happineſs, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Third Experience of God's Method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Reliance upon any thing, to eſtabliſh and advance dependance upon himſelf, was, By turning Natural Cauſes out of their courſe of producing their natural and former experienced Effects, to the Production and Events ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unnatural, and formerly unexperienc'd. Thus eminently it has fallen out, when the intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſerious and heavenly Prayer has been neglected, from the certain expectation of a deſired effect, as the natural iſſue of ſuch a Cauſe made uſe of, and a Mean formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. Many Inſtances of this Experience
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49481:39"/>
I could produce, when in undertaking a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Concern, by reaſon of uſing as a Means to effectuate the Matter naturally tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, and often tried, as productive of it; I have had leſs Solicitude, and made ſeldom approach to God by Prayer for Conduct in the uſe of Means, and for a Divine Bleſſing upon the Iſſue; and inſtead of the natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon effect, unſucceſsfulneſs has follow'd endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; yet when God has chang'd this lazineſs, and ſecure frame of Soul, to a more ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing God by Prayer, in conjunction with Means, that then the next Attempt to uſe the ſame Means, has been accompanied with ſuch ſucceſs as was ſuitable to its natural and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd tendency. This clearly convinces of the uncertainty of the moſt probable Events in the uſe of the moſt promiſing Means, without a Divine Bleſſing accompanying; and therefore inſtructing the neceſſity and advantage of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God, in conjunction with other Means to make our endeavours ſucceſsful. An Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience fixing and advancing within my ſelf reſolution of addreſſing God concerning all things, and a dependance upon him for the iſſue of all things, whatever ſeeming certainty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without this in the uſe of Means; and though many great Events have been brought forth in the uſe of Natural Means, without ſo much perhaps as once petitioning Heaven, as many ſucceſsful undertakings of the wicked do witneſs; yet this is no oppoſition to the preſent
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49481:39"/>
Experience: The wicked enjoying all things in a common Line of Providence; the Children of God in a Line of ſpecial Conduct, Love and Favour, by ſpecial paſſages of Providence, and in a way of return to Prayers. This Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reproves truſting to any Natural Agent, but in ſubordination to a Divine Power, which is a Propoſition that in Converſation we find ſeldom oppoſed, though little verified in the Actions of ſome, who, with Lifted-up-eyes, and Outward ſeriouſneſs, will ſay, <hi>The Lord give a Bleſſing to Means;</hi> when, at the ſame time, they never put up a ſerious Prayer to God afterward concerning the ſame matter; or who, in pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings only of extremity, when natural things fail, or they are uncapable of ſmothering the Convictions of Conſcience, are forc'd to cry out, <hi>(Lord have mercy upon me.)</hi> This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo little verified in the Actions of ſome Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who looking ſo much to Natural Cauſes, or to Fortune or Fate, leſſen that truſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance they ought to have upon a Divine Over-ruling Power in all things, and hinder themſelves from addreſſing God for his Conduct in the right uſe of Means, or bringing about their deſired End; and eſpecially if they are under God's ſpecial and Divine Conduct, and enter'd into the number of his Children.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Method of God diſcovering his hand in all things, and leading me to a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him for all things, was, By diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49481:40"/>
expectations, when founded upon ſeeming, ſure, and probable grounds, eſpecially if truſted to with a pleaſedneſs and rejoicing in the expectation, but without ever ſupplicating the Lord's Conduct to bring it about. It is true the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Advice is, <hi>To be</hi> anxiouſly <hi>careful for nothing;</hi> not by Idleneſs, or by uſing Means diligently with a truſting thereto, but by making our Addreſſes known to God by Prayer When this is reſtrain'd, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der anxiety of Mind, and toil of Body meet God's Children's endeavours, yea, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments follow their moſt deſired and probable expectations. I hope I may faithfully witneſs it as truth, that I was never help'd in a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raviſhing frame of Mind, to petition God concerning any one Event, with reſignation to his Will, and full quiet of Mind, whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement ſeem'd in obtaining the matter, but a gracious return followed. Yea, the moſt hopeful deſign, without this means of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God concerning it, has ever been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani'd to me with a viſible diſappointment. Many Inſtances I could adduce, were it not that I am to be unkown. Sometimes for many months together, every day, in one Inſtance or another, this Experience has been brought to my obſervation; and if the obſervation of God's method in removing truſt from any thing, and planting a reliance upon himſelf, with the viſible and bleſſed effects brought forth thereby in my own Soul; if the reflection
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49481:40"/>
thereupon had not eſtabliſh'd my Faith, I ſhould have often been flying out with repinings at God's diſappointing my diligent uſe of Means, commonly leading to ſuch Ends: But diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's deſign, yea, infinite love, in my own diſappointments, and my Meditations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon were thus; Did the Lord ſtrengthen me eminently after my Fit of Sickneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in moſt, if not all my Addreſſes to Heaven ſince that time, to ask for advance of this Reliance? And has the Lord return'd this Petition by ſenſible Reliance upon himſelf, never formerly acquainted with, and that in a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conduct of outward Providence; ſhall I therefore bring forth this ill improvement, of not working with God, or of truſting God only in the enjoyments of ſmiling Favours, when difficulties ſenſibly have tended to the increaſing my dependance upon God; or truſt God only when other things are of no uſe, or when Means producing ſuch Events, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally or probably turn their courſe, and prove ineffectual? No, that ſhould be no leſs than height of Ingratitude; and what my loving God has prevented by his Spirit's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying his method of ſpecial outward Providence, and therefore have great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to walk in a Road of Conſtant Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, crying out; Oh, the height and depth of the Love of God, in firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſuch a mercy of Reliance, in bringing it about, and that in a method of outward
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49481:41"/>
Providence, evidencing it ſenſibly to my ſelf, as well as really working it in the Soul by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit going along with his outward Providences, and in preſerving this Reliance, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul's unwillingneſs, when Duty and Intereſt went hand in hand at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>This very Experience is enough to anſwer all the ignorant Cavils of the Irreligious, and the Doubtings of ſome Chriſtians, who with the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> are perplext how to underſtand right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inequality of Divine Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the prophane and the gracious Chriſtian; the firſt abounding in worldly Pleaſure, while the other appears under croſſing afflicting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences: The private Chriſtian's inward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd experience of God's method with himſelf, affords knowledge of God and his Ways, and ſtrength to reſiſt corrupt and Satanical Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and peace and comfort even in the enjoyment of outward diſappointments, when their Friends are in concern on their very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or others in their circumſtances ready to ſtagger as to God's favour to them; and that by reaſon of theſe things which appear to the obſerving Chriſtian, the greateſt tokens of Divine ſpecial Love: For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this, I would have you conſider;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a Chriſtian renewed from origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Corruption to Grace, is received under a ſpecial conduct of God's Providence without, as well as his Spirit within, and that greatly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49481:41"/>
different from the common Providence that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the wicked of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>But know that the Lord has ſet apart him that is Godly for himſelf; Exod.</hi> 11.7. The outward Providence of God was ſo ſpecial towards the Children of <hi>Iſrael, That the very Dogs were not to Bark at them;</hi> beſides, to be witneſs to three or four private Chriſtians imparting God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conduct remarkt round each one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, one would think that the Narrative of each argued ſo much of Speciality, as if each had been the alone beloved Child of God, about whom he had ſpent his ſpecial loving Care; whereas thoſe round whom is the alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of common Providence, they can reach no higher than the general power of a great and merciful God, as Creator and Preſerver of all Things, but not as their God and Father, or their Providences attending them as the Fruits of their peculiar Intereſt in him through Chriſt, and as Heirs of his Kingdom, enjoying the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thereof, in the ſpecial outward Providences and inward workings of a Divine Spirit attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their life. Great loſs therefore, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian incurs, who tho' under the ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of outward Providence, yet wants the ſenſe thereof, unleſs in remarkable inſtances of it; and that for want of a general obſervation of all the ſteps of God's Ways with himſelf, from his firſt Converſion to a full eſtabliſhment in all the Graces of God's Spirit. A Chriſtian that has been obſervant of God's outward and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49481:42"/>
inward conduct, not only witneſſes a ſpeciality of Providence regarding God's own children, but he will patiently bear afflicting Diſpenſations, that are deſigned to make him ſenſible of his neglect of God's dealings with him, and of his neglect or careleſs performance of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Duties, and may change his nature from ſecure, cold, and lazy, to ſpiritual, heavenly and zealous; and to make him more watchful and diligent in the reſiſting Temptations, and mortifying Corruptions, and in the exerciſe of every Grace that may preſerve him from the power of the Tempter. A Chriſtian under the ſame ſpecial conduct of God's care, but without the ſtrict obſervation of it in all the ſteps of God's Providence, has neither the knowledge nor the ſtrength that the obſerving Chriſtian has convey'd to his Soul, as the true effects of ſo deſirable a Duty; but is ready to droop in his Spirit when afflicted, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's deſign in particular, tho' relying on that bleſſed Word, <hi>That all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that love God;</hi> yet miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God's particular deſign in the preſent want of his Soul, the preſent Mercy thereby to be beſtowed, he becomes in danger of Satan's tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Deſpondency, of a Melancholly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in Religion, and of paſſing his Pilgrimage State under Clouds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſince God's own Children are under the ſpecial conduct of Providence, then they alone muſt beſt judge of God's Wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49481:42"/>
and witneſs for God, that what the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World is apt to charge againſt God upon the account of the preſent Afflictions of his Children, is from Ignorance: For Afflictions are the certain Evidences of his Wiſdom and Love, as a Father and a Phyſician, to purge them from Sin, to make them more holy and heavenly on Earth, and to make them more prepared to reign with him above. Tho' thoſe who are only led by ſenſe, ſee not Good in Afflictions, yet ſincere Believers, who from conſtant obſervation, and by the help of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, have improved Afflictions, they are ready to comply with God's End ſo ſoon as it appears, and earneſtly pray for, and rejoyce in the hope of a bleſſed Iſſue. If Chriſtians were ſerious in ſearching out their Sins before, or in the time of Afflictions, and how defective they are in the exerciſe of the Graces of the Spirit, they would be aſſured, not only from Divine Revelation, but from their happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of God's Mercy in all; that the peaceable Fruit of Righteouſneſs will outweigh all their Sufferings and Sorrows.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Method of God to advance Reliance upon himſelf, was, by immediate ſpecialty of a Divine Hand in paſſages of Providence, in laying matters of great ſucceſs in my way, and that in the following inſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By bringing them about, without the operation of ſecond cauſes commonly made
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49481:43"/>
uſe of, having in many inſtances experienced ſuch things laid in my way, wherein I have hardly been able to diſcover any thing elſe, beſides the Hand of God bringing them forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By ordering my real Enemies as inſtruments of Benefits to me in their Actings, though undeſignedly by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By ordering ſuch numerous ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſigns with freedom from outward toil, that I enjoyed a great opportunity to obſerve and meditate upon the Lord's Way thus with me, and to ſet it upon ſtrict record for after-reflection, and comparing it with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and following methods, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement thereby brought forth in my own Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By Divine Excitement of ſome to be aſſiſtant in ſuch providential matters laid in my way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By ordering ſucceſs to all ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, accompanied with ſuch immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Providence.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> Method to advance Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and to keep means (too much relied on) in the due place, was by ſuffering by one ſtep of Providence or other, Friends to my outward concerns (of whoſe Friendſhip and Service I had eminent experience) to be turn'd and fixt to the intereſt of others, which I muſt confeſs, ſeem'd at firſt appearance dark and cloudy, and continued thus to be, till by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49481:43"/>
of my Record, I came to know the ſtate of my Soul I was then under, the work of God he was ſenſibly advancing, the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God at the time, (from comparing his Ways, and the improvement brought forth thereby) and the ſuitableneſs of ſuch a method of Providence to bring it forth, even an entire Reliance upon himſelf for all Events.</p>
               <p>In which Experience I had this ſweet paſſage to obſerve, That as God in his returns to Prayer, ſuited their ſpeedineſs or greater delays to the weakneſs and ſtrength of Faith, ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did the Lord compaſſionately ſuit his Ways to the weakneſs of my reliance in him; for leaſt ſuch an Experience ſhould overwhelm my weak Faith, the Lord immediately gave ſucceſs to my endeavours, with the ſame eaſe of Mind, and freedom from toil of Body, as when under the advantage of the intereſt of ſuch Friends and viſible means, with that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence, that I have often ſtood in amazement, and have been raviſhed with the obſervation of what ſtrange paſſages of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has every day fallen out to continue ſuch ſucceſsful endeavours; yea, I may ſay, greater then when under the opportunity of ſuch inſtruments.</p>
               <p>A Seventh Experience, was, By permitting the loſs of ſome undertakings, that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be greatly advantageous, without the leaſt deficiency on my part as inſtrumental
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49481:44"/>
therein: This at firſt ſeem'd afflicting, till the diſcovery of the unſucceſsfulneſs of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, with great diſparagement of Character appeared, which then made me rejoyce in God's Divine conduct, and ſee great Love in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, with the feeling of inward Peace, that I had no ways contributed to the unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs of the affair, moving me to lay all my concerns at God's footſtool, leaving Events, pleaſing or ungrateful, to Divine diſpoſal, I keeping ſerious with God for the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Duty.</p>
               <p>The Eighth Experience of God's method to ſuppreſs Reliance on any thing beſides himſelf, was, by the Lord's Way of vindicating me from undeſerv'd reproach, either by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate clearing up of innocency and the falſhood of reproach, and ſo cutting it off at firſt; or by hindering it, tho' continued, from injuring my name, by making impreſſions upon others, or by giving me opportunity by ſome failure of theirs, to Aſperſe them truly, to their great loſs and diſcouragement, and ſo ſtopping of their Rage through Fear.</p>
               <p>One eminent inſtance of this Experience I'll give you, concerning one, who from no other foundation that I ever could judge of, but that of Malice, greatly diſparaged my Name, yea, continued therein, notwithſtanding of my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful imparting the thing to themſelves, with a true vindication of my ſelf, till by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous paſſage of Divine Providence, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49481:44"/>
opportunity of reproaching them was laid in my way, and that by the knowledge of her failure in a great and weighty concern, capable of ruining them, and freeing my ſelf from their further rage; but tho' there was a ſtruggle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween revenge and forbearance to Aſperſe them, yet bleſſed be the Lord his Grace was victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over corrupt Nature, and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, I only endeavoured the making of themſelves ſenſible of their faults, truſting God, who had laid ſuch an occaſion in my way, to ſtop the current of their Malice, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd me from the guilt of purſuing Revenge: That their reproaching, at leaſt, with impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon others, ſhould ceaſe; which was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verified by after experience, wherein I have fully ſeen their incapacity of injuring me that way; and therefore one inſtance I hope of the exerciſe of Grace in my ſelf, and of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience being an excellent mean to advance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon God in all ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>Another ſpecial Inſtance of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, concerning a Reproach againſt me, with ſome great probability of Guilt when rehears'd by the Reproacher: I muſt own my not meriting the Reproach, was from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Grace of God, I being at the time of the occaſion of the Reproach, under no other power ſenſible to my ſelf than that of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but if at the time of being reproached, I am helpt in a Heavenly poſture of Soul to lay it before God, and find carefulneſs and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49481:45"/>
laid aſide, in correſpondency to this frame, appears a Divine Providence reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemies from Reproaching, or if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued its inſufficiency of injuring me, though it be greatly their deſign, and that with a un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence. In this inſtance I have two Circumſtances to lay before you, greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and marvellous, diſcovering the ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Heavenlineſs in Prayer to its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and of the Providential Method of God to train me higher in the exerciſe of Reliance upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>One of which Circumſtances is, That at the time when God was building this Faith, then a violent aſſault was made uſe of as a mean of ſtrengthning and enlarging the degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, and truſt in God, with Prayer for all my concerns; and that in the following method, the aſſault of reproaching continuing as furious as falſe in all its reported Circumſtances, did ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tend not only to diſparagement of Name, but to danger of Law-Suits, the hindrance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could by no other means be procur'd, than the preſence of one who had been for ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time out of the Kingdom, and in no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of returning without great Intreaty, Pains, and Charge: But at the time when this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacher was at the height of their purſuit by Reproach, and deſign of Law againſt me, the inward poſture of my Soul was ſpiritual in Prayer concerning it, and in Meditation upon it; and at that very time I had an account by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49481:45"/>
Letter, that the Perſon whoſe preſence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for my Vindication, was ſurpriſingly call'd to this place upon a Providential occaſion, he knowing nothing thereof till ſome hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and altogether ignorant of my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or of the deſire I had to have him here. By this only Circumſtance I had opportunity of allaying the Reproach, and of perfectly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting any Law-Suit againſt me. Tho' I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fully ſtop the fury of a malicious Tongue, yet I cannot expreſs my ſelf concerning its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, without praiſing the infinite love of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being in it, and the great improvement by it; finding that often a cold, lazy frame of Soul, and the renewing of this reproach meet together, and that the immediate effect of the latter, is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a change from this lazy frame, to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual heavenly poſture of Soul with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſweet Fellowſhip with God in Prayer concerning it, greatly helping me from anxiety and diſquiet under it, with a deſign and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to comply with the Bleſſed end of God in it.</p>
               <p>Another Circumſtance greatly remarkable in this inſtance, has been, That without any other mean of endeavour to defend my ſelf by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching again, or the like, but purely by the laying it before the Throne of God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Reproach has either been ſtill, or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; which at firſt occaſion'd ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in my Thoughts, whether I ſhould not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49481:46"/>
by going to this or the other, clear my ſelf, and not preſumptuouſly expect deliverance without Means; but finding my Vindication to themſelves of no effect, and my Vindication of my ſelf to others would occaſion Aſperſions upon them, I was ſtill, and uſed the means of Prayer, and was careful of not giving them further occaſion to Reproach, and found greateſt ſucceſs, and dare recommend it to the practice of others; not only from my own experience, but from the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s, who in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 13. expreſſes himſelf thus, <hi>I as a deaf man, heard not; and as a dumb man, opened not my mouth:</hi> No doubt but he could have us'd reaſonable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove his Innocency, but in <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>He hoped in the Lord:</hi> In like manner when I have been enabled by Prayer with great exerciſe of Faith therein, to lay the Caſe at God's foot; and truſtingly to hope in him; I have found all power of the Reproach gone off. I deſire therefore <hi>what time I am afraid, to truſt in the Lord;</hi> And this very Experience has been a bleſſed Mean to bring forth this deſire in my Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>When I cry to thee,</hi> in a believing heavenly poſture, <hi>then my Enemies ſhall draw back:</hi> When God ſtrengthens a Soul by his Divine Spirit under Reproaches, to cry unto him; either the Reproachers will ceaſe, or their Reproaches will be without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or Recoil upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49481:46"/>To this Experience I ſubjoin the following Obſervation, That upon hearing a Reproach, and ſeriouſly reflecting upon my ſelf, I have often found it as a juſt puniſhment, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate return to Sin of my own, either of Reproaching the ſame Perſon with the ſame or another ſort of Reproach, or ſome body elſe, by ſuch a kind of Reproach; and ſo a ſenſe of my own fault, with a diſcovery of love from God therein, and a watch over my ſelf unto Prayer, and againſt reproaching, by this very reflection has been brought forth, accepting the reproach, as <hi>Shimei's</hi> was taken, <hi>God bad him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Ninth Experience of advancing Faith was, By the great, ſudden, and unexpected Supplies that have come in ſuitable to Wants, and to my firm dependance upon God, through former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his ways. I have found that though Supplies has been deferr'd for ſome conſiderable time, yea, even to the very laſt moment, yet they have come in ſo ſeaſonably to my need, that God in his method of beſtowing them, has taken trial of the ſtrength of my dependance upon him, and ſo has afforded me a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evidence of that Grace, and given a diſcovery of the immediateneſs of his hand in bringing them about, as well as producing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a truſt on himſelf; ſometimes I have found Supplies deferr'd for a long time, that if former experience of God's way of trying my Faith,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49481:47"/>
and further eſtabliſhing it thereby, had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in me a divine ſtrength, I ſhould have been ready to droop; but even then ſuch a true Reliance upon God, in the time of long delay, I have followed always with ſuch numerous ſucceſsful paſſages, as afforded more than if Providence had walk'd in its uſual courſe; when therefore by ſuch ſteps and ſupplies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a true Reliance under thoſe delays has occurred afterward, how ungrateful had it been not to regard God in the thing, or not obſerv'd his ways, with the improvement of a Reliance upon him?</p>
               <p>I have obſerv'd, that ſo ſoon as obſervation of God's way, and ſettlement of Faith in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereby was brought forth, that then the Lord's method has varied with me both as to time and things; appearing in a time, and in a matter and way unexpected, and all on purpoſe to advance my dependance upon God at all times, and in all ſorts of concerns.</p>
               <p>A Tenth Experience of advancing Reliance upon God was, By his making outward, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, lawful, and commendable endeavours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unſucceſsful, till he had founded it, and gradually advanced this dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; the obtaining undertakings and ſucceſs therein, having been kept in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtream of ſpecial Providence, ſo that when any undertaking thorough my own intereſt has been near, it either has not occurred, or moſt commonly proved unſucceſsful; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49481:47"/>
have been never more frequently ſucceſsful, than when moſt remote from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Methods of obtaining them, and I have been moſt near to God in Prayer concerning them. I think I may ſay, I never found my ſelf without this encouragement of ſucceſsful undertakings, but my frame of Soul has been dead, cold and lifeleſs, and my intermiſſions from heavenlineſs of frame viſible; and I have never found my ſelf in continued fellowſhip with God in Prayer and Meditation, but numerous undertakings have fallen in my way, and that with marvellous ſucceſs, unleſs unſucceſsfulneſs was neceſſary for one good end or other, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearing in the Circumſtances of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Conduct therein, ſometimes for the diſcovery or puniſhment of one failure or other in my ſelf, all which have abundantly laid open to my view the immediateneſs of God's hand in all things here below, the great advantage of intereſt in his ſpecial Conduct, and by the help of Chriſt's Spirit rais'd an ardent deſire of truſting God in all my deſigns, even when moſt diligent in the uſe of Means.</p>
               <p>An Eleventh Experience of God's deſign and method to advance Faith of Reliance was, By the viſible Effects of theſe very Experiences, eſtabliſhing my eye and thoughts upon God, either in reſpect of ſtrength to act Duty as pleaſing to himſelf, or in reſpect of ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence bringing all things unto my hand, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49481:48"/>
nothing has made the Mercy reliſh more with me, than that Circumſtance of Specialneſs of a Divine Hand in bringing it about; yea, I may ſay, that the moſt comfortable Favour on this earth has nothing of ſolid ſweetneſs in it, without a diſcovery of Favour from Heaven therein: And that the moſt afflicting diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and diſturbing evil wherein the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God's love has appear'd in his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial order of it, has been more acceptable to my Soul than an outward Bleſſing, wherein ſpecial Love has not been ſo clearly diſcoverable. The Method of God's advancing Reliance, has been by ſometimes delaying the anſwer of Prayer, and with-holding its return longer than uſual, (though there has been evidence of its accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Heaven) and that ſometimes to the laſt extremity of a matter concern'd.</p>
               <p>An eminent Inſtance whereof was, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Affair, where acting or not acting in it, carri'd along the danger of great diſgrace and diſadvantage; and determining with my ſelf not to act, was by an irreſiſtible paſſage of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence conſtrain'd to move in the matter, which at firſt ſeem'd to damp my hopes that my Prayer concerning it was accepted; but the return exactly ſuited my frame and deſires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in Prayer, though its diſcovery was ſo long defer'd, even till upon the very brink of acting, and then providentially effected other ways; a paſſage which at the time raviſh'd me with aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49481:48"/>An Inſtance inſtructive not to limit God to time or deſire, but to commend our caſe to God as our Father, intirely to depend on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Event in his own method and time, with a diligent acting Duty on our part, and then the bleſſing will be the ſweeter and more remarkable; yea, with great honour to God, by ſuch an actual exerciſe of Reliance upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>A Twelfth Experience of God's Method to eſtabliſh my dependance upon him, has been by laying in my way outward Vexations, for the bringing of me in to a ſerious ſpiritual frame of Soul, the experience whereof ſeems as it were naturally to prevent murmuring at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, and to keep me often upon my knees with heavenlineſs of thought, and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of truſt to God, who diſcovers in afflicting Providences great love in their effects, of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul's poſture, and making them a mean of preſerving dependance brought forth in the Soul.</p>
               <p>A Thirteenth Experience of God's Method to continue and heighten dependance upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was, By giving great raiſedneſs of frame of Mind, and high exerciſe thereof in Prayer, as a Forerunner of ſome Diſquiet, that from this Experience, Anxiety and Deſpondency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it might be prevented; and I, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, kept on in Reliance upon God,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49481:49"/>
who, in condeſcending Favour, gave ſuch ſweet ſtrengthning allowance as might hold out in the enſuing Providence, and that againſt the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Sin within, and the force of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without.</p>
               <p>And here I ſubjoin an Inſtance of the ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the latter, when one day I in ſweet communion with God in Prayer, and at the time of Enjoyment, under the actual ſenſe of ſome Diſquiet, (having obſerv'd in the Method of God, that a ſenſe of Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and Fellowſhip with God at the ſame time, have met together, as a Forerunner of ſome Affliction that would happen;) ſo ſoon as I was off my knees, to walk up and down in my Chamber, as ſoon, like Lightning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Satan threw this Suggeſtion upon me, That I had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without theſe Enjoyments, than have the Diſquiets that follow them. My Fellowſhip with God in Prayer, was too ſtrong at that time to receive any impreſſion of that kind, and, bleſſed be his Name, the Suggeſtion was ſo bare faced, and clearly diabolical, that I was immediately ſtrengthened to repel it as a Trifle.</p>
               <p>The Effects of which Experience were,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A further eſtabliſhment in the truth of that Scripture, <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A continued hope in his mercy, which ſince that time has been greatly eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by the enjoyment of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s words as certain truth, <hi>The Lord delights in them that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49481:49"/>
fear him, and in them that hope in his mercy:</hi> That, methinks, all my Arguments with God are bound up in this one, of the greatneſs of his mercy in Chriſt, the obſervation of ſpecial favour in all ſmiling and frowning paſſages of Providence, the advancement of Reliance upon God in all things, brought forth by God's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, in the uſe of that mean of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, has further eſtabliſh'd and fix'd my hope upon his mercy in Chriſt, and that for other changes within, and future happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>A Fourteenth experience of God's Method of training me into dependance upon himſelf, was from the obſervation of God's way of freeing my Thoughts from concern under Diſquiets, and carrying my concern off from the thing diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting, to a ſearch and deſire after Enjoyment of God in Prayer put up for the diſquiets, which is the alone Gift of Chriſt's Spirit; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Divine Scripture, and my alone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort under diſquiet. This is to me the evidence of my Petitions being accepted, and the Token of ſpecial Guidance from Heaven throughout the diſquiet; In confirming the truth of which experience the Scripture is plain, charging us to <hi>be careful for nothing, but</hi> by <hi>ſupplication to make our requeſt to God;</hi> and when by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a Divine Spirit we are enabled to make our requeſt, the experiencing Chriſtian can truly ſay, that anxiety is taken off, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49481:50"/>
full exerciſe of reliance upon God is in its room, both for conduct to the Soul throughout the diſquiet, and for the removing of it in his own time and way; if God's Method herein was more obſerv'd, there would be leſs truſt on out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helps, and more reliance upon God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, join'd with the due uſe of means, and would by a bleſſing attending them, be convincing to the men of this World, who are led by ſenſe, and disbelieve the Prerogative-Power of God's Providence in all things.</p>
               <p>A Fifteenth experience of God's Method of advancing my reliance, has been by fixing my deſire, delight and longing after ſpirituality of frame, with all, and every one of the moſt comforting outward mercies of the preſent Life, in the deſires of the beſt of outward bleſſings, I find an unexpreſſible fixedneſs of thought upon theſe two things: One is, That it may be convey'd by Providences, arguing ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of love; another is, that this conveyance may be a means of heightning reliance upon God, and raiſing me to more ſweet and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Communion with him: And I hope, I may with ſome humble awe ſay, that my Eye is ſo much upon God's hand in bringing about, and upon Communion with God, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all things on Earth, that the more I ſee, and enjoy of the outward pleaſures of this Life, the more they are undervalued by me, and the more I am afraid of them, by reaſon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49481:50"/>
of the temptations attending them to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of Heavenlineſs of frame, which is the true inward comfort of the Soul of an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſtian: This very Experience has made me ſenſible of the following things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the beſt of them (of which I have not wanted ſome taſte) afford not that ſolid abounding ſweet ſatisfaction, as I do really experience in Heavenlineſs of frame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do exerciſe great pity towards them who know nothing of fellowſhip with God in the frame of their minds, or in the performance of duties; I don't much wonder at their prizing the comforts of this Earth, counting all things elſe as nothing or imaginary, never having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the reality of ſpiritual things; and no wonder therefore they dip themſelves as much as poſſible in theſe things that afford pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſenſual, and vaniſhing comfort, rather than by a ſerious application of themſelves to God in the uſe of Divine Ordinances, which while they are unregenerate, can afford no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid raviſhing comfort; they being as I was while only under the power of Education, <hi>Nicodemus</hi>-like, amazed at the litteral meaning, how Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians could talk with God, and enjoy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with an inviſible God, it being impoſſible by the greateſt reach of the moſt ingenious fancy, to apprehend the ſtate of the Soul with its raviſhing ſweetneſs, when in fellowſhip with God; and though I have made uſe of theſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49481:51"/>
words of Spirituality, and Heavenlineſs of frame, to explicate fellowſhip with God, my deſign is not thereby to ſet it forth with words, that may make it ſenſible to unexperiencing Souls, theſe words being underſtood and felt only by real Believers; it is enough that to you of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate rank, I can ſeal and give teſtimony to the truth and reality thereof, from my certain experience; and can lay before you the means God was pleaſed to make uſe of to bring me to the ſenſible enjoyment thereof: And if your longing deſire to experience it, prompt you not to the uſe of theſe means, by which you may obtain it, then in the Day of Judgment you cannot but expect your accuſation to run thus: <hi>Light came into the world,</hi> but you <hi>chus'd rather to walk in darkneſs,</hi> according to your carnal Conceits of Divine things, and not in the uſe of Sacred means, as others have done to attain a clear comfortable experimental knowledge thereof; which you may eaſily do, conſidering the great condeſcending encouragement God gives to the ſmalleſt ſparks of ſincere deſires, and ſerious endeavours; he will by the Spirit of Grace aſſiſt you, and reveal the ſecret of his love to your Souls, and bring you into his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Light. And as the caſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and of theſe only under the power of Education, fills me with pity, ſo Lazy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are greatly to be threatned, who know the reality of fellowſhip with Heaven, but inſtead of keeping themſelves in the comfortable and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49481:51"/>
continual enjoyment thereof, and thereby to witneſs its truth, in Converſation with others, by their involving themſelves in the full ſtream of the pleaſures of this Earth, they hinder their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful and conſtant enjoyment of God, and give occaſion to others, to believe that raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort of fellowſhip with God, is meerly a Notion, and make their own Lives upon the aſſault of afflictions, yea their Dyings too, leſs comfortable, and thereby diſparage the Truth of the Goſpel: it may afford you an awful reflection; O Lazy Chriſtians! who by your great outward enjoyments ſhould be more excited to maintain Communion with God, who is the fountain of felicity, and to teſtify that his favour is better than Life and all the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it; but you content your ſelves with haſty or drowſy performance of Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Morning and Evening, without the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of thoſe Graces and Affections which are the Life of them: And by a careleſs Converſation in the World, the impreſſion of Divine things are ſoon worn out, and dye in the diverſion of the Soul from God, by the free fruition of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, which are to be ſo temperately uſed, that we may enjoy God. When the World is the Idol of Mens Heads and Hearts, it De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrones God, and deprives them of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his Love and Preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> My Fifteenth experience has made me ſenſible, that the comfort of outward things,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49481:52"/>
is more in the expectation than in the poſſeſſion; whereas ſpiritual comfort is much ſweeter in the enjoyment, than it is for any Humane Creature poſſible to imagine, unleſs experienc'd in the Soul. My own apprehenſion, and account of a ſpiritual frame is this; That when I am in it, my mind is clear, free of Clouds, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of any kind, though in the midſt of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs it be leſt I ſhould not continue in a holy frame. While under the alone power of Education, I have often ſuggeſted to my ſelf, O that I were in ſuch a Circumſtance, my ſtate ſhould be happy! but when by the Providence of God I had arriv'd to that Circumſtance, I found no addition of comfort by it; and to ſpeak more plainly, my great expectation was confuted by Experience; for either I taſted no Happineſs in what was ſo earneſtly deſir'd, or the pleaſure was imbitter'd to me by unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted troubles mixed with it; I now am well contented in a State without abounding or wanting, relying intirely upon God for all things neceſſary for my wants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Experience has made me ſenſible of this certain frame in my ſelf; That the more of outward comforts I enjoy, the more I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them, and in the greater eſteem I find fellowſhip with God, and that the evidence of ſpecial love from God by the enjoyments, is in my eſteem far more valuable than the moſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49481:52"/>
precious or moſt deſireable things that can be obtain'd in this life. In the Enjoyments of the world, I neither find preſent ſatisfaction, nor the ſweetneſs in the after-reflection that is in ſpiritual Enjoyments; but what brings Honey, has a Sting that vexes more than there is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it: This ſerious Chriſtians know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. But Carnaliſts, whoſe Conſciences are Sear'd, and whoſe Experience never reach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than outward Comforts, nothing can Sting them but ſenſible things; as Illneſs after Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rottenneſs after Whoring, and the like, affecting their Body. It is otherwiſe in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fellowſhip with God; it reliſhes ſweetly at the preſent, and in the reflection upon it an evidence to the Soul of Union to Chriſt; for altho' the degree of Joy does not continue, yet the reality of Union abides, and the new Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt's Spirit in his Ordinances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the Joy. Friendſhip, that rational and moſt comfortable Bleſſing in humane Society, is not now ſo common on the Earth; when Sin abounds, the love of many waxeth cold; and where it is, it affords one of the moſt ſolid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions on Earth; but it is not compleat, wanting much at the ſame time it is enjoyed; neither is it durable, but upon a trifle chang'd, and former Friendſhip made fuel to kindle and keep burning everlaſting Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49481:53"/>A Sixteenth Experience of God's method to train me into Reliance upon himſelf, has been, by diſappointing me of one favour greatly deſired and expected, on purpoſe to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a greater. The Lord has often iſſued forth a marvellous Mercy out of the Boſom of a diſappointing-Providence; and could the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this Experience be otherwiſe than to truſt God for all Events attending my life, however bad they lookt at the preſent, leaving them to his Will; that ſo, if a diſappointment occur'd, I might not immediately repine, but by Patience, through former Experience and Prayer, wait without diſquiet till the Divine Providence has ſweetly ordered that diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to be for my greater good.</p>
               <p>I could inſtance in this Experience, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of greateſt worldly concern, where diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment has fallen out contrary to deſire and probable expectation, from whence has iſſued a Providence at firſt appearance not ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or pleaſing, but a Mercy far beyond what I now know the other would have been, and has ſome comfortable circumſtances in it not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in ſuch a matter. One inſtance greatly advancing Reliance upon God, and confirming what has been formerly laid down, of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain correſpondency between Chriſt's Spirit helping the Soul to Ask in Prayer, and the Lord's returning it, was, that my frame in Prayer
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49481:53"/>
was my great ſupport, while under no other view than that of a diſappointment.</p>
               <p>Who would not in the Enjoyment of ſuch eminent Experiences, leave all things to Heaven's conduct, and by entire dependance thereupon, with continued Prayer to be intereſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſpend a whole life through this Earth, and that with greater ſucceſs to outward Affairs, leſs anxiety of Mind concerning them, or toil of Body to obtain them, and much more ſweetneſs, than when brought about, and no other Agent ſeen therein, but outward endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our ſelves, ſtrength of Friends, or the like, upon whom our Truſt was wholly fixed?</p>
               <p>Seventeenthly, To advance an entire general dependance upon God, he has marvellouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered immediateneſs of his Hand in matters of very ſmall moment, and that both as a return to Prayer concerning them, and as a token of ſpecial favour in them; and tho' they have been ſuch things as are reputed ſmall, yet they have been accompanied with as immediateneſs of Providence, as clear a diſcovery of Divine Love, as in weighty concerns, deſigning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bring me into a Dependance upon him for all things, the meaneſt not being excluded from the compaſs of his Providence.</p>
               <p>Many inſtances of this Experience I could bring forth in reſpect of my going from one place to another; of Servants coming to, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49481:54"/>
going from me; yea, reaching even to irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures, that I have made uſe of: I have had Experience, that according to my ſtrength in Petitioning Divine Favour concerning them, and according to the time of neglecting, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and continuing this ſeriouſneſs, ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs or unſucceſsfulneſs has occurr'd.</p>
               <p>At this very time of God's training me into a Dependance upon himſelf, a powerful bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home of Scriptures upon my Soul, of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for inſtruction, conduct, and comfort, has been a remarkable mean in God's Hand, and marvellouſly bleſſed with that great end of removing Diffidence, and ſetling Reliance upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Firſt whereof by way of Promiſe, was that of the 6th Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> verſ. 33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> Of this Promiſe, till now, I could never feel the powerful Efficacy, and apply it to my ſelf for comfort.</p>
               <p>At my firſt entrance upon Buſineſs in the world, this Scripture ſuddenly ſeized my Thoughts, without any previous Meditation thereupon, or Reading it with remark in the Scriptures, but with ſuch conſtancy of impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that in diverſions in real Buſineſs, at home and abroad, this Scripture would ſtill ruſh upon my Thoughts: Its ſuddenneſs and conſtancy of impreſſion, its ſuitableneſs to my circumſtances, at that time going to engage in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49481:54"/>
the affairs of the world, where Temptations to omit or intermit the ſeeking Grace in my Soul might abound, and its correſpondency to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences that afterward occurred in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns on Earth, as means of ſounding Grace in my Soul, made me hope it was bore upon me by a Divine Power. A further confirmation and certainty whereof I have had, not only from its continuance even till this day in my Thoughts, with the powerful influence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me ſeek God firſt in all my concerns, and to truſt in him as the God that hears Prayers, but alſo from the marvellous method of God in my life, enabling me to uſe endeavours, and giving his ſucceſs to them; chiefly, when I am moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to advance his Kingdom of Grace in my Soul; never could I ſay, that I was diligent and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in the means of Reading, Prayer, and the like, for the advancement of Grace in my Soul, but even then all outward Comforts flow'd in upon me with great ſweetneſs in their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and then Divine Providence has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me opportunities and ſucceſs in my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affairs; yea, I never obſerv'd my ſelf at any time diſquieted, or under the probable or real danger of the withdrawings of theſe Comforts, but I always found my ſelf out of the road of ſpirituality of frame, and of the diligent uſe of means of Grace.</p>
               <p>To the enjoyment of this Experience, I am ſtill held, and do hope, while I live, ſhall be able to apply it as a ſpecial Gift from God's
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49481:55"/>
Divine and Merciful Hand: Yea, with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in the 19th <hi>Pſalm</hi> and 49th v. I have often found it a prevailing argument in Prayer, That <hi>the Lord would remember the word to his ſervant, upon which he had caus'd him to hope;</hi> it was indeed his own work ſuddenly to bring and fix it upon my Thoughts, at a time when I was altogether ignorant of ſuch a thing, as a ſpiritual Power accompanying any Scripture-Truth, and a beginning only to be ſenſible of a ſpecial conduct of Providence round me; but now it appears more plainly his work, by its confirmation, from the outward Providences, and inward workings of Chriſt's Spirit in my Soul ſince; till which confirmation, I did not experimentally underſtand it; and bleſſed be his Name, I am at quiet that he will continue my hope therein, till the Kingdom of Grace has had its Perfection here, and I paſſed into his everlaſting Kingdom of Glory, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhall be no more of uſe, but there ſhall be the perfect Fruition of our rich Priviledges, both of Grace and Glory.</p>
               <p>A Second Scripture bore home upon my Soul with inſtruction, and as a mean of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Reliance upon God, more than upon means, was, That Scripture in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſaid, <hi>That by the bleſſing of God, the pulſe nouriſhed him; that he looked fairer and fatter than theſe Children fed with King's meat.</hi> One evening in Reading this paſſage of God's Word, I found my Mind deeply impreſt with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49481:55"/>
Meditations upon it in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, tho' many a time I had read the ſame Scripture, and with great ſeriouſneſs, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch depth of Thought: This made me hope at the time, that it was the work of Chriſt's Spirit, it proving afterwards a rule of action, and a means of advancing greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon a Divine Bleſſing to food, than ever formerly I had obſerv'd in my ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Thoughts ſeizing me at the time, were, Firſt, The great weight to be laid upon a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bleſſing for the nouriſhment of our Bodies, as well as upon the food Eat.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The great ſeriouſneſs that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Petitioning a Divine Bleſſing, and the exact extenſion of our Petitions to all things receiv'd for that end of nouriſhment; thereby reproving my ſelf and others for the formal, and overly addreſſing God herein; and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the ſame ſeriouſneſs and ſpirituality of Frame, as in other ſet and ſolemn Petitions, and not Petitioning God's Divine Bleſſing for every thing we deſire Nouriſhment from, or Pleaſure in.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Reſolution, and I hope I may ſay, a Performance, at leaſt much better than ever before, to extend my Supplications to God for all things taken for the ſupport of life, and in as ſerious a manner, as for matters of higher concern, God being the ſame when then addreſs'd to, as when by ſolemn, long and numerous Petitions; and though to others,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49481:56"/>
Food comes in a common way of Providence, yet to God's own Children in a line of ſpecial Favour; and therefore more Obligatory upon them to ſhow their Truſt to God for Mercies ſeemingly in common with others, as well as for more ſpecial concerns; and that in a way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the God they are more eſpecially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; and the greater Truſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and do give to God than others, who only enjoy all thoſe Favours, as out of the hand of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Provider, in a common way of Diſtribution.</p>
               <p>The effect of which Inſtruction, Reproof, and Reſolution, has been in my ſelf to avoid all opportunity of publick Petitioning a Divine Bleſſing upon theſe outward Favours, and that upon the following accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe of the neceſſity of going out of the common road, if my Reſolution be faithfully performed; and any thing uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, either in ſpiritual or outward things, draws forth many times Reproachings from Carnal Perſons; yea, the very apprehenſion of ſuch Perſons preſent, to my certain experience, is the occaſion of marring a ſerious ſpiritual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning God's Divine Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The common road of Profeſſors in this Duty is form and brevity; and conſidering the mixt Company, this Duty is often to be performed with a petition for God's Divine Bleſſing, with, the ſerious thoughtfulneſs upon what is expreſſed, many times prevents the Mockings that attend a Spiritual poſture of Soul in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49481:56"/>
performance of this Duty without a Form; there being many converſant with us at Meals, who were it not for the power of Education and fear of Reproach, would pleaſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, without any Bleſſing petition'd thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I'm ſure with greater comfort, than when burden'd with a Serious Addreſs to God, or Religious Converſation amongſt themſelves; I rather therefore eſchew the opportunity, than ſpoil my ſerious Addreſs to God, having little ſatisfaction in performing this Duty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiritually: And ſure I am, that the mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to a Form of Thoughts and Words afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, muſt needs lay occaſion of reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Breathings of a Divine Spirit, which runs with ſtrong force of Thought upon the Soul, and great extenſion of Word, as any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith, will witneſs of me. I grant a ſeriouſneſs of thought is very agreeable to a Form in this Duty, but far different from that ſpirituality of Soul evidential, ſenſible of Chriſt's Spirit acting therewith; yea, from my own Experience, I can witneſs that I have had my frame of mind that has been in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual poſture, allay'd with an overly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this Duty.</p>
               <p>Brevity I accuſe, as marring of a Heavenly Frame; I muſt teſtify, that ſometimes I have been in the beginning of Prayer Cold and Lazy in the Frame of my Soul; but in the progreſs thereof, a holy heat has been diffuſed in my Affections, and therefore juſtly may fear, that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49481:57"/>
if my frame be cold, paſſing immediately from the World to this Duty, a repeating ſome ſhort Sentences in a Form will be over before Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality has ſeized my Thoughts, and ſo prove an occaſion of preventing Spirituality: But for a ſerious ſpiritual Soul, I think him hardly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of performing this Duty with common brevity, he being carried out many times beyond deſigns and words, both expoſing him and the Duty to the Mocking of ſuch, if then preſent, and therefore reſervedneſs in the publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this Duty I greatly affect.</p>
               <p>Take therefore my reaſon thus for eſchewing the Publick performance of this duty, that I may neither keep off Divine influences by form, nor ſhort'n the ſweetneſs thereof by brevity, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my ſelf and the duty to the ridiculing of thoſe, who either would willingly feaſt upon God's good things, without ever acknowledging him the Giver, or petition his bleſſing to follow them, rather than cool the Victuals a degree-more than ſuits their Palate, and gratifies the ſenſual Appetite.</p>
               <p>A Second reaſon of eſchewing Publick perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty, has been becauſe of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual frame and Heavenlineſs of mind I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after, throughout the day, out of duty, as well as in duty, which hinders a ruſhing from Worldly Diſcourſe, to a petitioning of God, with Three or Four Sentences by Roat, and ſets forth a duty proceeding from a mind ſpiritual and actually ſerious. Beſides, when at any time
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49481:57"/>
I am Heavenlily carry'd out, petitioning God in any duty, I find that often Petitions and Expreſſions will run upon Matter that I have been formerly pleading for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day, of which I ſhould not willingly deſire any Company, perhaps, to know of; and to reſtrain my ſelf in this Frame is what would greatly burden my Soul, and rather incline me to loſe ſuch Comforts tho' never ſo grateful to Senſe.</p>
               <p>My Method therefore, and great Endeavour is, That whether others perform this Duty, or my ſelf, I may, if poſſible, meet with nothing that may occaſion its unſpiritual performance: And when others are ſo ſhort, my Soul is not at eaſe till I have ſeriouſly ejaculated my Thoughts to Heaven, eaſily done without the leaſt knowledge to the Short-ſighted Profeſſor's round; and privacy to my ſelf I make choice of, unleſs Family-relation engage me, that ſo neither Form nor Brevity may hinder me of ſo ſweet an Enjoyment as ſpiritual Frame in the Duty; and that what bears moſt in my Thoughts towards God through the day, may not be prevented from being utter'd, through the fear of others knowing it, or ridiculing the Duty becauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Scripture was bore home upon my Soul by way of Inſtruction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; when one day I happen'd to be out of all Buſineſs reſpecting my Calling, and diſcovering one of the ſame way with my ſelf in great
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49481:58"/>
hurry therein, ſome repining melancholy Thoughts begun to ſpring up, of which I was concernedly ſenſible at the time, and anxious how to ſuppreſs them; but after walking ſome four or five paces, I ſee the Bible before me, which I took up, without any deſign of ſerious reading therein: But the firſt Verſe that my eyes fixt upon, was that of the 9th Verſe of the 5th Chapter of <hi>James, Grudge not one against the other;</hi> which immediately bore home upon me with aſtoniſhing amazement, that ſo exactly it ſhould ſuit my Circumſtances, which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, might have from Luſt within, and Satan without, occaſion'd the neglect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding God in all Events, and the attributing this to Chance, or ſome external Accident, if I had not diſcover'd God's own hand in the matter: For beſides God's adapting it ſo ſuitably to my preſent Caſe, by the true meaning of the words, there immediately iſſued relief to my anxiety, and full quiet of mind, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſatisfaction, without the leaſt repining. And I ſtill find upon the occurrences of the like temptation, a power not reduceable to my ſelf as the Fountain, but proceeding from Chriſt, and conveyed by his Spirit, working mightily in my Soul. Let therefore theſe proſper, and others excel me, my ſatisfaction is founded on God's ſpecial conduct of Providence round me, God's over-ruling all Events for ſuch an end, as the dethroning of Corruption, and the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Grace to ſuch perfection of Faith, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49481:58"/>
meetneſs for Heaven, as will be rewarded with an abundant entrance into that bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This divine calm of Mind was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Holy Spirit, the great Comforter; for meer Reaſon and natural Conſtitution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not quiet us upon ſuch Motives, and are but weak Bulwarks to defend againſt diſquieting impreſſions when difficulties occur.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Having ſet apart ſome time for private Prayer, concerning a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Affair, and reading ſome Scripture before it, one Verſe thereof affected my thoughts by way of Inſtruction, more than the other parts of that portion of Scripture; it was the laſt Verſe of the 10th Chapter of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Curſe not the King in thy thoughts, nor the rich in thy bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; for the birds of the air ſhall declare the voice, and the fowl with wings ſhall tell the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> In the reading whereof, ſuch a divine Power accompanied me, that ſet me a reſolving from that moment to eſchew ſpeaking evil pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and that by way of whiſper, againſt my Superiors and others; and to leave whatever might be expreſs'd againſt my ſelf in ſuch a manner, to the permiſſion of a Divine Hand, under whoſe eſpecial Conduct I had ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable evidence of being ſtated, having at this very time often and often experienc'd, that upon reporting any thing injurious to others, either from a foundation of Self-applauſe, or of ſpreading a reproach with that privacy, that I have imagin'd it impoſſible the reproach could ever reach their ear; yet it has been heard of,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49481:59"/>
and providentially return'd me with the juſt puniſhment of Reproach, either from the ſame perſon, or from another, by a reproach of the ſame kind. And that this reſolution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this Scriptural Leſſon might be the more effectually perform'd, I ſet it upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, with a deſign of viewing it every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before my entrance upon publick Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to help forward that reſolved watch, <hi>of taking heed to my ways, not to ſin with my tongue.</hi> To the intermiſſion of which watch, ſo many daily Temptations occur, not only from natural inclination to applaud one's ſelf, and to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others, but from the ill example of others, who, upon pretenſion of concern and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for a perſon, and truſting to their privacy they are converſing with, whiſper an ill report, with the name of the perſon reproach'd, and thereby draw forth a mutual diſcourſe upon the thing, that aggravates and fixes its belief upon their minds and thoughts, that it is ready to break forth on all occaſions, while the perſon reproached is perfectly ignorant, and perhaps as truly innocent. This is the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin of the Chriſtians of this day, either to believe a Reproach too ſoon, or to aggravate it in its after-report, and neglect the ſpeaking to the perſons concern'd, for their amendment. This is privately contrary to the Rule of the Goſpel, and hinders the obtaining of ſpiritual Bleſſings; yea, brings Men under the danger of that denunciation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.5. <hi>Whoſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49481:59"/>
ſlanders his neighbour, him will I cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, When I have been under great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the omiſſion of Duty, and loſing that delight therein that I had formerly enjoyed, then the Lord has made that <hi>verſe</hi> of the 7th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a powerful relief to my fear of its being evidence of no grace; <hi>The law of the mind, warring againſt the law of the members.</hi> And when I have found before the performance of Prayer, a ſtruggle between do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and neglecting it, and the moſt trifling oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, looking out at a Window, a great noiſe, and the like, delaying of my Duty, then my Soul labour'd under the weight of concern, leſt it betoken'd my being altogether empty of Grace; and that till God was pleas'd to bear home this expreſs Scripture-truth to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd in my ſelf, and to quiet my Mind by a Sermon Preach'd upon the 1ſt <hi>v.</hi> of the 4th <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews, Let us fear leſt we come ſhort of that reſt;</hi> wherein in the Explication of Fear, ſo far as Duty, he diſcover'd the mixture of Corruption and Grace in a Chriſtian Soul here on Earth, and that ſtrugglings often riſing thence, would cauſe fear in the Soul, but what was no ground of fear, unleſs when overcome by them; after which time I begun to obſerve the victory over theſe diſturbing fears within, and the exerciſe of a greater watch unto Prayer, to endeavour their repulſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49481:60"/>Sixthly, Another Scripture powerfully bore home, has been that of the 16th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> where Chriſt deſires his Diſciples to <hi>Remember the five Loaves;</hi> which Scripture, then and ever ſince, in the ſteps of God's advancing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance in my Soul, has been of great uſe; and when God has ſeem'd to withdraw any ſorts of Mercies, it has made me have immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to former Experiences, with the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of accuſing my ſelf for my little faith, and forgetfulneſs ſo ſoon of his former preventing Mercies, haſtening me to Prayer for ſtrength of Faith and Reliance upon him: Let this be upon the Thoughts of poor Creatures under God's ſenſible withdrawings, to prevent ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fears, leſt they are without Grace, when there is Grace in Sincerity, but not in that ſenſible ſtrength which by Prayer, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of God's former Mercies, they ſhould diligently endeavour to obtain.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Scripture of <hi>ſeeking the Lord while he may be found,</hi> and <hi>calling upon him while he is near,</hi> bore home in ſweet Exerciſe, at ſuch a time when God's Breathing has been ſenſibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Soul, raiſing my frame to a Heavenlineſs of Mind; when the Holy Spirit by warm influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences excites the Soul, 'tis a ſeaſon of Grace to the unrenewed, and a precious opportunity and advantage to the real Chriſtian. This has made me to prize the ſmalleſt motions of the Divine Spirit, not to quench them, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of entertaining them in the exerciſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49481:60"/>
and Prayer, eſchewing what Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation might at that time bring levity of Mind to dethrone them.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Another Scripture impreſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon my Heart, was the 21ſt and 22d verſes of the 18th chapter of <hi>Matthew; Then ſaid Peter, Lord, how oft ſhall my brother ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and I forgive him; till ſeven times? And Jeſus ſaid unto him, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil ſeventy times ſeven.</hi> This has been a Scripture accompanied with great power, to repel riſings of Corruption to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Revenge, and perfectly to quiet my Mind with a Reliance upon God concerning the matter. The firſt Experience whereof met me in the Streets, where hearing of a falſe and unmerited Aſperſion upon my ſelf, at whoſe hands I deſerv'd better; immediately a deſign of Revenge was riſing, and was carried further on by meditating upon it, till coming home, and entring my Chamber, and taking the Bible in my hands, that very Scripture was offered to my View, and by the influence of Heaven, made an aſſiſting-inſtrument of quiet at the time, and ever ſince a ſtrong help to watch my ſelf in the like caſe: Its ſuitableneſs to my circumſtances, its effectual power reſtraining me from complying with Satan and inward Corruption, and inclining and enabling me to obey God, whoſe Will is declared in his Word, was a teſtimony that a gracious Providence brought that Scripture to my ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49481:61"/>Ninthly, When Reproaches againſt me, and malicious Deſigns had a probability of taking effect, and have been turn'd into other Events, againſt the Deſign, Wiſh, or Expectation of my Enemies, then that Scripture of the 11th verſe of the 41ſt <hi>Pſalm, By this I know thou favoureſt me, becauſe my enemies triumph not over me,</hi> has been not only confirm'd, but impreſt upon me with much inward Comfort.</p>
               <p>At one time the whole 15th <hi>Pſalm</hi> was bore upon my Thoughts with that ſtrength and continuance, that I was continually deſiring Conformity to it, and meaſuring my Actions by its Rule, till God gave into my Soul the Evidence of ſome meaſure of Conformity to it, with other ſpiritual Comforts at that time.</p>
               <p>A multitude of other Scriptures have been applied to my Soul at the times of needing Comfort and Inſtruction, but they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my Diſcourſe too much, and might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a diſcovery of the Author, and therefore I chuſe rather to ſtop here, having enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated ſo many as afford a Teſtimony to the reality of Chriſt's Spirit, applying to the Precepts and Promiſes of the Word, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home Scripture Truths as inſtructive, to inſtruct and remember us of our Duty, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to perſevere in it till we arrive at Heaven.</p>

               <head>Experiences of God's Spirit's ſenſible withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Prayer from helping the Chriſtian to ask what he will not return, though in his deſign to Petition.</head>
               <p>THe Firſt Experience whereof was, That though I had deſigned to have Pray'd for an event, yet in the Prayer I have not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Petition for it; and though I have intended in the performance of that Duty, ſeveral times to Pray for it, I have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When one day I deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new my Requeſts to God for obtaining a matter in my morning's Supplication, my deſires were fervently excited; but in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon I was much reſtrain'd, and in ſome hours afterwards, my Soul was drawn forth earneſtly to ſeek it; and upon enquiry, I found that the three different alterations in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that day, and the different times of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, exactly ſuited the times of different Prayer.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate which, I'll give you one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance amongſt many, concerning a Friend whoſe Circumſtances I put up to the Lord three ſeveral times in one day, and ſuitable to my great enlargement for them in my Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Prayer, were much better; but ſuitable to my Afternoons conſtraint, were for ſome
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49481:62"/>
hours in racking miſery; and ſuitable to my return in ſpirituality in Prayer for them, there was a return of mercy in their relief, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time exactly ſuited one another, that there was a refreſhment from Pains, and a return of them according as Prayer was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and enlarg'd, or reſtrain'd, of which I made careful Obſervation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another Experience of conſtraint from Prayer, has been concerning a matter, which (all circumſtances conſidered) was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely to ſucceed, but not finding my Heart in a frame to pray for it, I ſuſpected the iſſue, and accordingly it was not effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>An inſtance thereof was, concerning the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relation I had on Earth, who being Sick for 6 weeks, I was reſtrained from Prayer, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon God for reſtoring Mercy; and the iſſue was, the Death of that Beloved Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for whoſe recovery thorough the courſe of their Illneſs, I could never put up one ſerious Petition.</p>
               <p>Two very late paſſages I can ſet down great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhing my ſelf, and marvellous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. One was concerning a Perſon of great Worth, of whoſe Death I had information in all probability certain, but being in the Street all alone, I found my ſelf enlarged to pray for their Soul's Salvation, and that with marvellous Pleaſure, as if I had been aſſuredly certain of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49481:62"/>
their future eternal Happineſs; and being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in ſerious Prayer, I found the ſame ſweetneſs as I have enjoyed, in Spiritual Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from above; upon this, I humbly ſaid to one who was my Boſome-friend, I was not of the opinion, that the Perſon I pray'd for was dead; and imparted my Reaſon hereof, That the Lord by his Spirit had help'd me in ſweet ſpirituality to ſupplicate for them: According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we had an account of the Perſon's being better; but the next morning following, I found ſuch a reſtraint from Praying for that Perſon, that I then ſaid to my Friend, That the Perſon was Dead, and that very account we had preſently after.</p>
               <p>The other paſſage was, Concerning one to be Executed, for whoſe Salvation I found my Affections very ardently drawn forth in Prayer to the Father of Mercies; but in Prayer for his Life, my Deſires were dried up, and my Tongue did as it were cleave to the Roof of my Mouth. Three times I found this change in my ſelf, being always carried out with fervency and freedom to Pray for his Soul, but reſtrain'd and diſcourag'd to Pray for his Life; obſerving this difference in my ſelf, I told an intimate Friend, That I had good hope of his eternal Salvation, but no hope of his Pardon. The iſſue was, the Condemned Perſon was Reprieved for two days, and was afterward Executed; and at his Death,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49481:63"/>
his Behaviour was ſo humble and Chriſtian, that the Miniſter that attended him, declared his great ſatisfaction, that he died a Penitent Believer.</p>
               <p>Many inſtances of the ſame kind I could ſet down, but I ſhall only add the following inſtance: I was going to ſee a Friend that was Sick, and addreſt my ſelf to God in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Prayer before I went, but a kind of terrour ſeiz'd my Mind, and Words ſtopt, that I could not offer up one Petition in any ſeriouſneſs, or with any hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard for recovery: And going to ſee the Perſon, found that they had been dead ſome time before. This was a diſcovery to me, that the Holy Spirit does often withdraw his Aſſiſtance to Ask for that which he knows God will not beſtow.</p>

            <div type="experiences">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:49481:63"/>
               <head>Experiences of God's Method of training me to the ſerious, aweful, and delightful hearing of Sermons.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, by ſuiting Sermons upon a Sabbath unexpectedly to things my Thoughts have greatly ruminated on through the week, and by bearing home inſtruction and comfort to my Soul thereby. One inſtance, (without expreſſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I could give) was, when through the week greatly thoughtful concerning the knowledge of effectual calling, and my evidence thereof in my Soul; and happening to be one day in a Friend's Cloſet, where ſeveral Books lay, I lookt into one, and being pleaſed with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I brought it home, without knowing that any thing concerning Effectual Calling was in it; in the peruſal whereof I found an Appendix concerning Effectual Calling, which greatly pleaſed me at the time, my Thoughts being then in great Exerciſe concerning it, but ſtill without any ſenſible ſatisfaction in my ſelf from uſing it. The following Sabbath I found a ſtrong inclination to hear another Miniſter than whom I uſually heard, without argument to my ſelf againſt him, or any ſenſible and more grateful motion to hear another. The Inclination grew ſo ſtrongly and ſuddenly, that no objection could ſtop my deſign, tho' I met with ſeveral; and at my hearing the Miniſter, found his Sermon upon Effectual
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49481:64"/>
Calling, and accompanied with ſuch ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inſtructions, and ſweet Senſe of my being effectually called, that I was amazed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed at the time; which plainly proved the word Preached to be the power of God, bringing forth evidences which are means to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By bearing home Duties with ſuch Power of Chriſt's Spirit in the hearing of a Sermon, that immediately their performance has been reſolved, and the practice dutifully and delightfully continued. One remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was, By a Sermon of a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Showers,</hi> in a <hi>December,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to the Sacrament; wherein he preſt, That as People, at that time uſually, were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their Account-Books, to know their Circumſtances; ſo we might at the ſame time every year, take an Account of our Souls, to know the State of Grace, whether growing, decaying, or at a ſtand; which greatly impreſt me at the time, and was a mean in God's Hand to perſuade me to the Cuſtom thereof; which ever ſince I have uſed; and not only then, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night, and at the end of every month; and bleſſed be God it has been of great Service to my ſelf in the diſcovery of the advancement of my inward Change, and in the preſerving of me from miſapprehenſions of God's Ways with me, helping me to know what Grace is moſt in exerciſe, and what Corruption moſt tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49481:64"/>
and a continual diſcovery of God's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſuiting his Providences to each. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it, as an Example to others, and to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their comfortable Pilgrimage on Earth.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of that Experience, was, In the powerful Influence that accompanied my Soul in hearing the Sermons Preached upon Family-Duty, by which, tho' I always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Evening Family-Prayer, yet had never performed it in the Morning, till by that means God was pleaſed to inforce it as Duty, and help me to practice it with Comfort: And if theſe Miniſters had no other Seal accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Religious Undertakings, this one may Comfort them, and let them know it was not in vain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By influencing Sermons with a power to ſuppreſs Evils predominant at the time of hearing, which gave me ground to fear they would interrupt me in that Duty. I have often found my ſelf under Diſquiet, and in great fear leſt the Diſquiet ſhould occaſion an unprofitable Hearing, it being natural for a thing diſquieting to draw forth the Mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, even when it ought to fix upon a thing of higher concern; and yet I have been ſo far from loſing the advantage of this bleſſed mean of Grace, that it has been through the Bleſſing of God effectual to remove the Diſquiet it ſelf, and to bring me into a ſweet ſpiritual frame of Soul. How ought this greatly to caution us,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49481:65"/>
not to add one folly to another, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of unfitneſs to hear, to neglect hearing, it being a means by Divine Aſſiſtance to make you ſit? How often have the Prophane of the Earth, vainly ſaid, They were as knowing as their Miniſters, and underſtood as much as they could acquaint them? And why ſhould they go to hear what they know before-hand? Never conſidering, Hearing as a means not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructing their Judgments, but changing their Hearts, eſtabliſhing them Experimentally in what they know, and raiſing them by a Divine Hand to a ſerious ſpiritual heavenly frame of Soul, the Element a Saint deſires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to breathe in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By ordering the Sermons of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſlik'd from ſome circumſtances in their way, as means both of Inſtruction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; and the circumſtance deſpiſed, more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualizing my frame than ordinary, to prevent partial reſpects to Miniſters, and to ſee the aſſiſting means that God affords us, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in the uſe of the means that God affords us, the moſt unlikely means being truly ſucceſsful, as it is influenced with a Divine Spirit.</p>
               <p>One inſtance whereof was, Before I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know or hear a worthy Miniſter of this City, I ordinarily exclaim'd againſt his Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hymns, not as unlawful; for Hymns, Pſalms, and Spiritual Songs, are the parts of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49481:65"/>
Praiſe under the New Teſtament; but leſt it ſhould give encouragement to others, not ſo ſound in Learning and Divinity, not only to neglect the uſe of Pſalms, but to compoſe what might be erroneous, weak, and diſſonant from them, one day I found a mighty inclination in my ſelf to hear him, without any rational mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it at the time: And tho' I was in an extraordinary lazy cold frame, yet no ſooner did I enter the place, but I met with the Hymn I had ſo much exclaim'd againſt, plainly made uſe of as a mean to bring me into a moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing ſpiritual frame of Soul, which continued with me in all the after publick and private Duties of the day.</p>
               <p>I have alſo Experienc'd, That when upon the conſideration of a low eſteem of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for his weak parts, and unſuitable way of Preaching to what I wanted, I have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn to ſome place elſe, that that very day I have had an unuſual Teſtimony of the Worth of this Miniſter's Sermon whom I left; and inſtead of meeting with that ſweetneſs I have expected, or ſometimes have had from the other, when I have gone with ſome inward conſtraint, I have found my ſelf in as bad a frame as ever, without any ſatisfaction and eſtabliſhment, but rather an uneaſineſs of Mind concerning it.</p>
               <p>O how inſtructing is this of the Inefficacy of the beſt means without a Divine Power, and of the Efficacy of the weakeſt means with a Divine Power! It is neither learned matter,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49481:66"/>
nor fine Oratory, that will ſavingly inſtruct the Mind, or comfort the Soul, though it may affect the fancy, and inform the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a time; how inſtructing is it of a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God in the uſe of means he lays providentially in our way as our Duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when God goes out of his ordinary road, of which we are not to make a Rule? If they be weak means or ſtrong means, it is according to the influence of a Divine Spirit that they become effectual; and if you ſlight a weaker Preacher, under whoſe Inſtruction you are by the Deſignation of Providence, and chuſe to go to one more learned and pleaſing, you have not ſo good a Warrant to expect a Bleſſing, partly becauſe of your neglecting the appointed means for your ſpiritual Profit; partly leſt you be in danger to limit God to afford his Bleſſing to the Preaching of one, and not of another; whereas his working is as glorious, if not more, with a weak inſtrument, than by a ſtrong; and it is the plain ſerious Sermon that I have many times found moſt pleaſing to my ſelf, however other ſorts have raviſhed my Senſes at the time.</p>
               <p>The Method I uſed that my hearing the Word Preach'd might be profitable, was and is, to examine my ſelf, whether I could aſſent to the Truth of what I heard, from my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as well as the Miniſter's Aſſertion, by which I was eſtabliſhed and comforted, when my private Experience was conſonant to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49481:66"/>
Doctrine of a publick Preacher: But when this was wanting, if the Doctrine was proved from Scripture, my Petitions to Heaven have been ſpiritually carried forth, That the Truth might be ſealed to my Soul by feeling its Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; and I have in a ſhort time found my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires anſwered, by the operations of Divine Providence, and of the Holy Spirit in me. The right hearing of the Word conſiſts not in a grave outward geſture, or giving ear to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, either upon the Fundamental Principles of Chriſtianity to be believ'd, or the practical Duties to be perform'd, but you muſt compare your Faith and Life with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and that ſeriouſly, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of wandring Thoughts, and with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer for a Divine Bleſſing; ſometimes God is pleaſed to give Grace more richly by a weak than by a more able inſtrument: This reproves many, who content themſelves with attendance upon the Miniſtry of the Word, and with an outward grave behaviour in Hearing, but never ſeek after an inward frame of Heart ſuitable to the Word; ſo that a ſerious frame of Soul, as well as a grave geſture of Body, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon, and comparing it with your own Experience, as well as a reflecting upon and comparing it to your own Notions, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all that would hear God's Word Preach'd with profit thereby.</p>

               <head>Experiences of God's Method in training me to the Knowledge of right participating the Lord's Supper.</head>
               <p>PRevious to which, let me premiſe my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof, and Practice then while only under the Notional Knowledge of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and the Power of Education, and that in the following Parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That by the ſtrength of Education I believ'd the Sacrament an extraordinary Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſolemnly to be gone about, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily to be prepared for; wonderful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God being there to be enjoy'd, of which I never then had felt any Experience, tho' I had once partaken of it with all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by the inſtruction and example of others, and my own Thoughts of the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Ordinance, but without any other ſeriouſneſs than what is wrought by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's affecting Diſcourſe, and delivery of an affecting Subject; but ſpiritual Communion with Chriſt, without which, Sacrament Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is unprofitable, and the diſcovery of God's love to the Soul, which Holy Miniſters have ſpoke of as more valuable than all the World; all this was Myſtery to me, and not deſired; but now, bleſſed be his Name, has been Reveal'd, and Experimented in my Soul by the means of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49481:67"/>Secondly, When I felt an inward change in my Soul, and I had clearer knowledge of the Nature and End of that Ordinance, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manner of performance was Spiritual, and the Benefits concomitant and conſequent with that Ordinance were enjoy'd. It's true, that Prayer was the firſt Duty wherein I felt a ſerious hearty delight, and underſtood fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God; but gradually I advanc'd to the Experience of the ſame delight and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of frame in other Duties, and amongſt the reſt, in that Duty of the Sacrament, but without that high flight of Joy as ſometimes I have had in Prayer; but I ſtill imagin'd, that though I had not attain'd its experience ſo much in that Duty, yet it was to be enjoy'd therein, and that God would pleaſe in due time to give me the Senſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That no ſooner I had the Senſe of this inward change, but as ſoon my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was clear, as to the repetition of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sacrament; for before, neither the Reading of the Inſtitution, nor Miniſters preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon, were ſo powerful as to induce me to its often performance, which frequency I once imagin'd Sinful, or at leaſt the occaſion of leading to a careleſs Sinful performance thereof: Satan like an Angel of light, diſturb'd my tender Conſcience with this Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt frequent Communion, That I was not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49481:68"/>
to partake of the Lord's Table without a Week's ſolemn Preparation; but I was more inſtructed concerning my Duty, by my own Call after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for once being in great Affliction both inward and outward, I reſolved to go to the Lord's Supper, imagining it a ſeaſon in which I could beſt be ſerious, and thereby better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd than when the preſſure of the Affliction was over: And if there were any ſuch thing to be experienc'd as the great Comforts the Saints declar'd, I might then probably feel them; and accordingly did partake with greater Gravity and inward Thoughtfulneſs than otherwiſe I ſhould have been able to do; but I did not feel thoſe raiſed Affections, nor that inward Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, or raviſhing Joy that I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; which diſappointment greatly concern'd me, Satan forcing home upon me this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, of its being an Evidence how unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd I was, and what an unacceptable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I offered to God; which made me conſult a ſpiritual Friend, whoſe Sincerity and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had in very high value: His Anſwer was, The Spirit of God is not to be limited; God's ways of imparting himſelf is not confin'd to the time of Partaking this Ordinance, but you may judge of your right Performance by your frame before and after, as well as in the Duty. This greatly reviv'd me, and was a mean of quieting me, and of keeping me in the frequent Participation of the Ordinance; the Truth of his Words I have found by many Experiences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49481:68"/>Fourthly, I have ſometimes found great heavenlineſs of frame before the Partaking of the Ordinance, and ſometimes after it, even when in the time of the Duty I have been cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected, and without ſenſible Comfort; Upon hearing my complaint, my Friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, Though God in training you to the knowledge of himſelf and his ways, has dealt with you as a darling Child, with wonderful ſmiling providences, think it not ſtrange if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtain'd his end of working Faith of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, he change his Method, and tries the Grace he has wrought in your Soul.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In the mean time this Bleſſed Saint being at a diſtance from me, I often pray'd, O that I had fellowſhip with God in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that I might feel therein what others do, or what I have felt in other Duties, I ſhould be ſatisfied if I ſhould never enjoy it there again; unbelief ſtill working in me. It pleaſed God in his wonderful Condeſcention to comply with this deſire, and thereby to diſcover the greatneſs of my weakneſs, as well as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Reliance upon God in the uſe of means, without limiting him to our deſires; for in the participating of the next Sacrament, I was admitted to ſuch a ſweet raviſhing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment that I never had before Experienc'd in that Duty, which perſuaded me of the Truth of what I have often heard; but ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting darkneſs was conſequent both in my
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49481:69"/>
Mind and outward Affairs, that I by the rich Mercy and Power of God was then help'd, ſweetly to reſign my deſire to his Will, and to ſupplicate for his influences, as he pleaſed to diſpenſe them, never limiting God to things or times further than as ſuitable to his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient Will; by this Experience I was helpt in all my concerns, leſs as well as greater, to caſt them at Heaven's Gate, to hope in his Mercy for them, with this deſire only, that I might by the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, be aſſiſted to make known my Requeſts to God with Faith and Reſignation, ſo as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him; and in this I find my Hearts Eaſe.</p>
               <p>I have ſince eſteem'd it Duty, and had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Deſire of Partaking the Lord's Supper every Month. While my Religion was merely from Education, I thought once in a year or two enough, to partake of this Ordinance, but ſince my regard to my Sovereign's and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Command, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and my performance in Obedience to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I have enjoy'd raviſhing ſweetneſs in Communion with Chriſt in this Duty: And I ſhall add, That the frequent repeating of this Ordinance is attended with great advantage; for by Preparatory Examination, I am more fully acquainted with my Spiritual State, with my preſent Corruptions and Graces ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or weaker, and the way how God makes this Duty a mean to ſuppreſs the one, and raiſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49481:69"/>
the other, with my Defects in the performance of this Duty; and I have a fuller ſight of Chriſt in all-ſufficient merits in his Treaſures of Grace that are open'd to all that come with Holy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to him. The ſerious and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing our Covenant with Chriſt in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, will endear him to us, and engage us to live to him who died for us; and the warm im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his love will be maintain'd in our Souls, which is too apt to cool and decline, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fed and reviv'd by the frequent Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of our Crucified Saviour.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the beginning of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Ordinance I have oft been in a cold frame; but at the approach of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this frame has chang'd, and my Soul has been ſweetly carried forth to petition for the imparting the Priviledges of Chriſt's Body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and Benefits annext to it; and I have found from receiving the Elements, the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of the Spirit, verifying our Saviour's Words, <hi>That his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed.</hi> This has been a means to preſerve me from Anxieties, and to perſevere in the frequent Commemorating of Chriſt's Death preſcrib'd in his laſt Will: I alſo find, that the more frequent renewing my Vows, makes me more careful to perform them, and that it's more eaſie to take an account of our Faithfulneſs to God and our Souls, or of our Neglects, once every Month, than when there is a greater diſtance between the time of our
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49481:70"/>
Receiving, and Examining our ſelves, how correſpondent our Converſations have been to our Covenant ſeal'd in that Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, At the time of partaking this Ordinance, I have often deſir'd with ardent Affections, two Things, That I might be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-minded in the whole courſe of my life, and that Holineſs may be advancing in my Soul till I arrive at perfection. This will be attended with ſolid Comfort, according to the Promiſe, <hi>Great peace to thoſe who keep thy law:</hi> And altho' we are to ſeek the ſhining face of God, the joyful aſſurance of his love in the uſe of his Ordinances; yet ſince the ſhedding abroad in the Soul the clear Evidences of God's Love, is a free Diſpenſation according to the Divine Pleaſure, my principal requeſt has been to have a pure Heart and Holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, depending upon God for inward Comfort.</p>
               <p>From which Experiences you may upon good ground fear, that when the excuſe of neglecting the Sacrament, is becauſe of its being a Solemn Ordinance, and therefore to be ſeldom receiv'd, is an Error of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind, and a Temptation of Satan to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us from uſing frequently that means of Grace, which confirms our Faith, inflames our Love, and ſecures our hope of Glory, and makes us more exact and conſtant, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in the everlaſting way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:49481:70"/>I ſhall conclude this with Advice to thoſe who have not felt thoſe Joyful Emanations in this Ordinance which they have expected, and others of the Saints have enjoy'd; Be not diſcourag'd from your Duty, but with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainting perſeverance, continue in the uſe of the means of Grace; The Lord waits to be gracious, to beſtow his Comforts in the beſt ſeaſon: There is ſweet Peace in our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Divine Commands, tho' we have not raptures of Joy; And our Obedience is more pleaſing to God, when notwithſtanding all difficulties and diſcouragements, it's with Conſcience to his commanding-Will perform'd, than when it's made eaſie by ſenſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>

            <head>THE APPLICATORY, AND <hi>SECOND PART</hi> OF This Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>CHriſtianity, as is deſcribed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is Experienc'd in the Souls of Real Chriſtians, in different degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Power; but the moſt who are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in Profeſſion, are ſtrangers to its vital Efficacy.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this diverſity is, Becauſe the moſt reſt in the ſpeculative Notion of the Chriſtian Religion, and are contented with the external Character of others; others are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and changed by the Truths of the Goſpel, and are inward Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Among Chriſtians in Title there are various Diviſions and contrary Sentiments, according
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49481:71"/>
to the Principles of the Education, which often cauſe violent Contentions among them.</p>
            <p>Among real Chriſtians there are Differences, but not of ſo deep a nature; Some Chriſtians are weaker by damping of this powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Regeneration, through too long omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the means of Grace, or by too deep mixing the Thoughts and Affections in the Buſineſs of the World; or by a levity of Mind in their indulging too free a uſe of ſenſitive Pleaſures that are innocent in their nature. And from theſe Reaſons it is, that ſpiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences are obſtructed, and the Divine Nature in Chriſtians is not ſo lively and vigorous as in others, who regard their Souls, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal things, with great application and diligence, ſometimes carnal Pride inſinuates into thoſe who are real Chriſtians; and to maintain their Parties, and to be diſtinguiſh'd from others, will with Heat contend for their Opinions in things that are not clear, nor of great moment, as if they were Fundamental Doctrines.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Chriſtians that have not only the life of Grace planted in them, but the livelineſs of Grace; they are working and watchful to prevent any impreſſion and taint of Evil from the Contagion of the World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are encompaſt; And they are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto Good, they are ready to exerciſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace in its ſeaſon, and by a continual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation of ſtrength from Chriſt, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ſinful Errors and irregular Paſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49481:72"/>Our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt has paid the price of our Redemption, and that we may have an intereſt therein, and enjoy the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof, as evidence and earneſt of Heaven God has appointed means whereby we may obtain this Bleſſed end; means that are ſuitable in their uſe to rational and lapſed Creatures, in their human capacity, ſuch as exclude boaſting in ourſelves, and of Preſumption, Licentiouſneſs, and ſecurity in a carnal Converſation; theſe means are preſcrib'd in the Goſpel, as Prayer, Meditation, Hearing, and the Participation of the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Sphere of the Holy Spirit's Activity, in theſe we draw near to God, and he draws near us; By theſe means Chriſt with all his ſaving Benefits is applied to Souls; By theſe they are revived from the Death of Sin, and reſtored to the favour and Image of God; They live in Communion with him, and are confirmed thereby againſt the Temptations of the Evil Spirit, who rules the World.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who neglect the holy and conſtant uſe of theſe means, whether from the deluſion of their Minds, or the corruption of their Hearts, will find, that Darkneſs is their guide, and the iſſue of their way will be fatal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore apply the foregoing Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative thus: There are ſome Profeſſors that have knowledge in an eminent degree, and are of a fair unblemiſht Converſation, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49481:72"/>
and impreſſion of Education, but are ſtrangers to the inward power of Godlineſs as ignorant Heathens: Let ſuch duly conſider the Caſe, and neither deſpair, for the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can quicken them; nor delay the ſerious and diligent uſe of means which God has made effectual for the Converſion and Salvation of others: Let them obſerve both the outward Providences of God, and the inward Workings of his Spirit, and apply themſelves to God in the Ordinances, both private and publick, that they may receive renewing Grace of God, and be preſerved from deſtructive Evils.</p>
            <p>If a Notional Knowledge of God's Word, and an unblemiſh'd outward Converſation, be no real Chriſtianity, no certain Teſtimony of Real and Saving Grace, How utterly void of it are the Prophane? To them I would give this Counſel, Not to be averſe from Serious and Real Religion, upon the account of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors who have only a name to live, but are dead; or from a conceit that the Chriſtian Religion is ſo extremely rigorous, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of all Natural Comforts; or upon the account of different Opinions in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World; but to remove all Prejudices, and to endeavour to underſtand the Goſpel, to believe the Doctrines, to obey the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of it, and then they will find Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be more than an outward Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſerious Divine Principle, regulating the Heart and Life; and that it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49481:73"/>
of God by every ſincere Seeker of it; and that it allows the temperate Uſe of Natural Comforts, and only forbids the licentious Abuſe of them, whereby men become moſt unlike God, and are <hi>like the beaſts that periſh:</hi> And the lawful ſober Enjoyments of Nature are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt in the hearts of the Saints; which is infinitely more ſatisfying and laſting than all the Pleaſures of Senſe, for which ſo many loſe Heaven, and are condemned to Eternal Torments.</p>
            <p>If Chriſtianity and its Power may be really felt in the Soul, and yet damp'd by the too long intermiſſion of the Means of Grace, and clouded by the admixture of too much of ſelf, producing a kind of Chriſtians lazy in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the continued Power of Chriſt's Spirit in their Souls, and ſo are in danger both of long intermiſſions of fellowſhip with God, and breaking of fellowſhip one to another; more diſhonouring God than either the mere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, or Prophane, who never experienc'd the Reality and Comfort of True Chriſtianity:</p>
            <p>To ſuch I would apply this Exhortation, Not only to be in the Right Uſe of Means, but in the more Continued Right Uſe, than ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; for undoubtedly, if the Means of Grace be the ways by which he walks, and by which he communicates to Believers, (to the truth whereof all experiencing Chriſtians will put their Seal), then the oftner Chriſtians walk in thoſe ways, the oftner and the more they receive both
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49481:73"/>
of Knowledge and Comfort from God; which undoubtedly is the reaſon why ſome real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians go beyond others in the knowledge of his ways, and are in the more cloſe walking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule of his Word, with more inward Fellowſhip with God, both in the Means of Grace, and common Converſation.</p>
            <p>That therefore the Word of God (the doubting whereof being one great occaſion of Error and Vice) may be experienc'd as Truth, and the means leading thereto given forth, I ſhall previouſly lay down Two Propoſitions, the firſt Inſtructive, the other Cautionary.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That all the Children of God in their Pilgrimage-ſtate are under Three ſorts of Conducts.</p>
            <p>The firſt is that of God's Word, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Faith, and the Infallible Rule by which we are to judge of all Doctrines, of all our Experiences, and all the Paſſages of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is that of the Divine Spirit, who according to the Promiſe of Chriſt, inſtructs us in all Saving Truth by the Word, and brings it to our remembrance to guide us ſafely to Heaven.</p>
            <p>The third is that of Divine Providence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enlightning what ſeemed dark in the Word of God, and in the Actings of Chriſt's Spirit, but founded upon his Word of Truth, and agreeable to both, though the diſpenſations of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49481:74"/>
Providence are no Certificate of God's ſpecial love to men; yet we are aſſured by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that there is a peculiar tender Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that regards his Children, which is declarative of his ſpecial Love; and by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious obſervation of it, their Duty and Comfort will be encouraged and improved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Cautionary; Not to limit the Spirit of God to any particular way or time of working in the Soul, either in planting of Grace, or its further growth. Though by obſervation of outward Providences God was pleaſed to bring me to the firſt ſerious ſenſe of my ſelf, and to a dependance upon God for Life and for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and by marvellous ſteps of his outward diſpenſations, joined with the inward Workings of his Spirit, he has begun and increaſed a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Change in my Soul; yet he has uſed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious methods in the Converſion and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others; which whether External or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, if obſerved and remembred, would ſeal to Souls the Truth of Chriſtianity, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all its Oppoſers. There is a clear diſcovery of the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, in the different means that God is pleaſed to uſe for the ſaving of Souls; all which are to be conſidered with Reverence, and to be complied with by Obedience; the end of all being our Holineſs, as preparatory to Eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt Duty or Means I would have you apply your ſelves to, is that of obſervation of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49481:74"/>
outward Providences; this having been ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in me, I earneſtly recommend it to the ſerious practice of all concern'd for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but that you may know in what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod rightly to obſerve, I will give its Characters in the parts I have found ſo advantageous to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You muſt obſerve all ſorts of outward Providences; great and more remarkable, leſſer and not ſo palpable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You muſt obſerve all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attend ſuch Providences, and ſet them upon Record, on purpoſe to reflect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one with the other; many confirming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences have loſt their favour and eſtabliſhing effect, as much by miſſing ſome Circumſtances thereof, as by forgetting of the whole: By this neglect ſome have had miſapprehenſions of God, and falſe conceits of themſelves. The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time wherein that Nobleman's Son was recovered, <hi>John</hi> 4.52. exactly anſwering the hour when Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>Thy Son liveth;</hi> was the convincing-proof that the Cure was performed by Chriſt, and conſequently of the truth of his being ſent from God. In like manner, the obſervation of the return of my Prayers, with Succeſs anſwerable to the fervency of my deſires, and Unſucceſsfulneſs of Prayer when I have been cold, and not duly affected in that Duty, has confirmed my belief, That it was from the Excitation of Chriſt's Spirit that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49481:75"/>
enabled me to pray, and from his excellent Goodneſs the return of my Prayer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You muſt obſerve outward Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences with improvement: The Lord's deſign in laying paſſages of Providence before you, is not only to view them, but to ſee Him in them, and thereby to underſtand his Being, with the glorious Attributes of his Wiſdom, Power, and loving-kindneſs to Man, and that with the ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Improvement of Eying him in all things, ſeeking to him for guidance in Means, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Events of all things.</p>
            <p>Obſervation unimproved, ſerve not God's Honour on Earth, and will ſerve your ſelves no other way than by heaping up Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to your Accuſation before the great Judge's Tribunal, for neglecting to improve his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Talents by Reliance upon him, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying his Love.</p>
            <p>To excite your Obſervation under theſe three Characters, I'll lay before you the following Motives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God's own encouragement to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.43. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things, they ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> If in God's account Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation be Wiſdom, and accompanied with the bleſſed diſcovery of his loving-kindneſs, can you blame my Friendſhip in preſſing you to make uſe thereof to obtain a Wiſdom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and baffle the falſhood and errours of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49481:75"/>
Fooliſh, (though Wiſe in their own Eyes) and to enjoy a ſenſe of God's Divine Favour?</p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt is giving an account of ſome remarkable outward Providences attending Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Churches, and particular Perſons, and then concludes, That <hi>who is ſo wiſe to obſerve ſuch things, ſhall learn the knowledge of God, and his loving kindneſs to their Souls.</hi> If Chriſtians of our Age had but been exact in the obſervation of National Church-Providences, our Wiſdom had more ſhin'd in the times of the Goſpel, Scriptural Fulfillings had been more clear, and Errours reſpecting ſuch things had leſs aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded than they do in our days. What a little proportion of Care does the publick Men of our Age bear in recording the marvellous ſteps of Providences, concerning the Nations and Churches of the Earth, to that Care of God's publick Officers under the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>? Our Civil Records abound from one year to another, with all Teſtimonies that advance the Honour of Princes and People; but where is the Record of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand in the wonderful Works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, reſpecting Churches, Nations, and particular Chriſtians, for the vindicating of his Honour, and the diſcovery of our infinite Obligations to him, that his Authority may be born up on Earth, and thoſe diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced who refuſe the Lord to reign over them. What more clouds the diſcovery of God than the unmindfulneſs of Divine Providences? In
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49481:76"/>
the room whereof, the conduct of Chance, the agency of natural Wit and Policy, has taken place in our Obſervation, Admiration and Dependance; and God has been neglected in his Diſpenſations; and truſting with a boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our ſelves for the bringing about Events encouraged.</p>
            <p>If publick Providences concerning our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Church, ſince our late Revolution, had been with all their Circumſtances ſtrictly remarkt, and ſet upon Record, there are none of us but who could own God's agency in them, and make the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ours, <hi>They get not the land in poſſeſſion by their own ſwords, neither did their own arm ſave, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance going along with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope, tho' Marvellous and National Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences have not had place in any of our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Records, for fixing the Faith of a Deity, and his Divine Providence; yet the Private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Particular Chriſtians are fill'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. I ſay again, His God been ſo viſible in the outgoings of his Providence ſince, and at the late Revolution, and are we ſtill attributing the Events that have fallen out for us, to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Strength of Policy, Treaſure and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage? How often has God turned the moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Methods of the Wiſe, to lay bare and open its Inſufficiency? And how has the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War, adorned with Courage, been ſwept off? That from Nations ſo abounding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49481:76"/>
therewith, How few appear at this day? How near is our Treaſure to be exhauſted, by vaſt Expence of War, and by Scarcity of Current Money? Has this no Language? Or has its Voice never entred the Ears and Hearts of the People of the Nations? It is the black Sign to me, the little Sight of God in his Providence, though he has been ſo Viſible; and the little Improvement thereof, by dependance upon him in the uſe of Means: Though our Means were fewer, and of leſs ſtrength, it ſhould not afford me ſo diſmal a Proſpect of things to come, as the diſregard of God in all our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the little dependance we ſhew upon God, by our ſolemn and ſerious Addreſſes to him, and by our Endeavours to pleaſe him, in walking conform to his Will. Did ever Error and Vice abound more in our Reformed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Were Chriſtians ever more lazy than in our days, ſpending their time in the full Exceſs of Riot of all thoſe things that God, in conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Love, has beſtowed upon us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſtinguiſhing us from other Nations? How many times does God bring private Chriſtians, yea, Nations and Churches, to great imminent Dangers, before he pours out his Smiles, on purpoſe to make us ſenſible of that regard of God we ought to have in his Providences round us, of our Duty to cry unto him in Publick and Cloſet-Addreſſes? And if theſe were the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our Troubles at this day, if we were brought to far greater Pinches of Extremity
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49481:77"/>
than we are or can be at, I ſhould not doubt but to behold the Returns of Providential Smiles upon our outward things, and ſpiritual Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon our Souls with Riches, and inward Peace amongſt Chriſtians yet in our Land.</p>
            <p>It was but this Summer, when God provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially, by the great and continued Rains, threatned Scarcity of Bread, and in merciful Condeſcention ſuffer'd it to fall out, when a Faſt was appointed to be kept for Succeſs to our KING: that at the ſame time, by the Rains viſible before us, we might join in Prayers to Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

we may know what that bleſſed Duty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God means, and may taſte of its bleſſed fruits both upon Souls and Bodies.</p>
            <p>In this diſcovery of a Divine Hand in the out-going of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ovidences, a fair reproof ariſes, Firſt, To the Prophane, who reject the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a Divine Providence, and will not obſerve his ways of it, leſt they be brought to a Senſe of the juſt Power above, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der terrour for deſpiſing his Laws that are not pleaſing to the Carnal Appetites.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the meer Profeſſor and lazy Chriſtian, who would limit God in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to matters of great moment, and not extend it to all events, tho' the Scripture, as well as Chriſtian Experience, bears ſufficient Teſtimony thereto.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us, <hi>Matthew</hi> 10.30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.7. <hi>That the very hairs of our heads are all numbred,</hi> and that conſequently his Divine Providence influenceth the moſt minute things, by upholding and ordering the world. If this be true, as to a general Providence over the whole Earth, How is it much more clear as to a ſpecial Providence, reſpecting his own Children in their Pilgrimage and Warfare here below? even then that as it's ſaid by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Luk</hi> 21.18 <hi>One hair of his Diſciples heads ſhould not periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49481:78"/>Chriſtian Experience confirms this Truth, That in the moſt mean Events, God's over-ruling Hand is greatly diſcover'd, and Prayers put up for ſmall matters are return'd with ſuch full diſcovery of him in the bringing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that the obſervation thereof afford greater inward Comfort in the enjoyment of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward benefit; were this more firmly rooted in the Hearts of profeſſing Chriſtians, we ſhould have leſs talk of Fortune and Chance, and leſs Truſt to Humane Endeavours, diſtinct from a Divine Influence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the Obſervation of outward Providences, you may not only diſcover God therein, but even from thence be led to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, and a Truſt to him, and that for matters of great moment, and alſo for your ſmalleſt concern on Earth, you will ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Thy right hand ſaved us;</hi> and as in the 6th verſe, <hi>I will therefore not truſt in bow;</hi> and as in the 8th verſe, <hi>I will boaſt in God all the day long, and praiſe his name for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You wont with the Prophane, confine the acknowledgment of God; your Addreſs to him, and Reliance upon him to pinches of extremity, when Evils ſeem nigh at hand, forcing the Creature by the very light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to cry out for help from God, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thoſe they have formerly mockt at as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, to ſupplicate Heaven to withhold the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49481:78"/>
Evil, or that God would have Mercy upon them in it.</p>
            <p>You wont, with the meer Profeſſor, expreſs only your truſt to God's over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Words, cenſuring thoſe that deny it, and yet live as without the ſenſe of a God therein, by doing Evil privately, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his All-ſeeing Eye, or endeavour to obtain things deſired in the uſe of ill means, without conſidering his over-ruling Power in the bringing forth of all Events.</p>
            <p>You wont, with the lazy Chriſtian, limit his governing-hand, but clearly know the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of his Power towards all things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining ſmall Events in the lawful uſe of means, as well as greater; and that God's conduct of his Children in their ſmall concerns, as much honours his condeſcending Goodneſs, as his regard of them in their moſt difficult concerns glorifies his Power and Godhead. The exact Obſervers of his ſpecial Providence, find as truly his Compaſſionate Care in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their Requeſts for ſmaller things, as in the greateſt concerns of their Life: Yea, that when matteas of ſmall moment has been manag'd in the uſe of means, with Dependance and Reſignation to him, they have then had both a better Event, than if the whole ſtrength of humane Power and Policy had been truſted to, or ill means made uſe of for its obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And that the honouring of God ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the diligent uſe of means, and true
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49481:79"/>
Reliance upon him for the Event of a ſmall concern, has been encourag'd by God's laying a greater matter in their way, and greatly Honouring them therein.</p>
            <p>It is therefore your Duty, to truſt God in all circumſtances, afflicting or ſmiling in your Souls, and in ſmall as well as greater things that concern our Temporal State, and give up the leaſt concern of your life to his conduct, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs him for his Guidance in it, and depend upon him for the Events. This is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to all; To the Prophane, who mind not God in the goings forth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and to the meer Profeſſor, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him in Word, but in Action deny his over-ruling Power; and even to the lazy Chriſtian, who minds not God in matters of ſmall concern, and gives not God the ſame Tribute of real Reliance for ſuch things, as for matters of weighty concern; and this many times cauſes a ſlight and formal performance of our Duties to God, which is a diſhonouring of God as truly as the more viſible Sins of thoſe who are Strangers to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the obſervation of outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and of God therein, with a reliance upon him, you are in the way of obtaining a diſcovery of the inward workings of Chriſt's Spirit in the Soul, an enjoyment making you ſenſible of what formerly you could not give credit to, though exactly deſcrib'd in his Word,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49481:79"/>
and making you bleſs his Name, that he ever put it in your thoughts to practiſe that excellent and greatly neglected Duty of obſervation, that is, the promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> The conſcientious regard of external Providences, will lead us to a diſcovery of greater things more marvellous in their nature, more dignifying our Souls, and more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably eſtabliſhing our Faith in God's Word, than a Series of outward Events: The freeing of the Soul from the power of Original Corruption by the ſweet dominion of Grace, the degrees of ſpiritual growth in the uſe of means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for that bleſſed end, will be of excellent advantage to encreaſe in the Soul light and joy, and eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>An Obſerver of ſuch things is enabled to ſee good, where others diſcover nothing but evil; and evil, where others think all is good. He is arrived to the eminent degrees of thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who in the 5th Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the 14th, are ſaid to be ſuch, <hi>who by reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil;</hi> who by habitual obſervation of God's ways by his Spirit and Providence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, are enabled to ſee the deſign and end of Providence, not miſtaking the merciful Methods of God's dealings with them as the effects of Anger, nor the trial of their Grace for a puniſhment for want of it, and thereby diſhonour God, and ſink under deſpondency; they can <hi>rejoice in tribulation,</hi> the bleſſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49481:80"/>
of thoſe who are in a ſtate of favour with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and feel a power above themſelves ſupporting them in all Troubles.</p>
            <p>It is therefore to be lamented, That ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and comforting things are laid in our way to obſerve, and yet that ſo many with their Circumſtances ſhould paſs without Record and Improvement. Though Chriſtians are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that God's Gifts are without Repentance; that they have the evidences of Grace in their Souls, and are kept ſtedfaſt in that Grace God has freely beſtow'd: yet by their not obſerving God's Means working, and the proportion'd advancement of Grace to ſuch Means, they are not ſo duly affected with the infinite Mercy of God, nor ſo comfortably ſenſible of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings with them, nor ſo firmly eſtabliſh'd in the hope that he will not ceaſe his working in them, <hi>till they are made mete for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light.</hi> The obſerving-Chriſtians have the priviledge of the Angels, though in a lower degree, to ſee the Face of God, they have the enjoyment of Heaven by the aſſurance of it; they live in the exerciſe of Divine Love, Joy and Praiſe, which is the Life of Heaven.</p>
            <p>I would from hence reprove thoſe Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, who by their neglect, coldneſs, and long intermiſſions from Holy Duties, are juſtly deprived of the ſweetneſs of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and are apt to cenſure others who are more ſpiritual and heavenly in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49481:80"/>
their Converſation, as phantaſtick and enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, an Inſtance whereof I had, by an Aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome Miniſters upon the Writings of a Saint now triumphant in Heaven, whoſe Life was employ'd in Study, to underſtand God's Word, and the actings of Chriſt's Spirit in the Soul; by which Holy Care, and the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he obtain'd the precious Jewel of Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and for many Years was poſſeſt of it.</p>
            <p>The Aſperſion run againſt him as a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful melancholy perſon; of the latter he had very little, but of the former much more, I do believe, than his Aſperſers, and what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the weight of the matter his thoughts run moſtly upon, often bemoaning the trifling, ſuperficial thoughts of the Chriſtians of our Times concerning Goſpel-Myſteries, Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty experienc'd, our paſſage hence, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another ſtate in its certainty and eternity. The Aſperſion alſo run againſt him for laying ſtreſs upon enlargement in Prayer; and that concerning inward Religion his Diſcourſes were unintelligible.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the firſt part of the Cenſure, I can from my own bleſſed Experience declare, That I have had the Promiſe verified to me of the Holy Spirit's helping our Infirmities, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting me in the things to be pray'd for, and inflaming my deſires in the Duty, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my Faith in the power and love of God; and the Returns of my Prayers have been moſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49481:81"/>
convincing and comforting evidence, that God's Spirit was the Indicter of that Prayer of which God was the Fulfiller.</p>
            <p>To the other part of the Cenſure, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, That the Communications of God to the Soul, are more convincingly felt than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt: <hi>The peace of God paſſes all underſtanding;</hi> and the comfortable ſenſe of it cannot be fully ſet forth by human Language, but the real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment is far diſtant from Enthuſiaſm. The ſincere Chriſtian knows, that communion with God is a Heaven on earth, though ſome who have only Notional Divinity, think it's meerly imagination without reality; our communion with God and Chriſt in the uſe of Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, is the beſt preſervative from the Illuſions of Satan, and the diſtempered Mind.</p>
            <p>Having given Reproof, Let me adviſe all ſuch, (who expoſe the high Attainments of Chriſtianity experienc'd) to reflect upon their by-paſt life, if exactneſs of Obſervation of all paſt between God and their Souls, either as means, or the end, lie by them upon Record in their Diaries; and whether they have not reſted upon the uſe of means as Duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving and recording the Enjoyments therein, and their advancing-effects upon their Soul, and have not reſted upon Evidences with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever obſerving by what means and method of God they were firſt made ſenſible of them,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49481:81"/>
or had them further eſtabliſhed. Has there never a ſtep of outward Providence, round you, paſt your Obſervation, and ſearch for God therein, or as a return to Prayer for that bleſſed end of cruſhing a Corruption, and exciting a Grace? In ſhort, Has all the ſteps of God, in training you to the Senſe of Converſion, and Graces after growth, been remarkt by you? If you can witneſs this, I am confident you have attain'd to the Experience of ſuch things as will keep you off from Cenſuring others, and engage you to bear Seal to the Truth of what Chriſt bears ſenſibly on the Chriſtian's Soul; but if upon Reflection, you have been out of this road, my Compaſſion is greatly towards you, even though you are Chriſtians indeed; and that becauſe of the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort withheld from you, it being puniſhment enough to want the Comfort that ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers enjoy in this life: And generally there lodges at the bottom of ſuch Cenſurers, either Ignorance of the ſame enjoyments from Heaven, an unwillingneſs to have any in greater eſteem than your ſelves, or prejudices from their being of another Party, Opinion, or the like. All which I would greatly adviſe to ſerious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of themſelves, before their Cenſures be put forth againſt others; for my own part I have often found from ſome inſtructing and eſtabliſhing paſſages, ſuch amazing diſcovery of God and my ſelf, that I have thought nothing more could be added thereto; but ſoon after I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49481:82"/>
have had a further knowledge and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſame thing, and that by another paſſage, caution enough to ſuppreſs diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, but from their example to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir thy ſelf more than ever in the uſe of Means, if a Soul therefore were to live Thouſands of years on earth, it attains not to know ſo much; but upon ſtrict obſervation in the continued uſe of Means, more and more Myſteries would be imparted. No wonder the Apoſtle's different Chriſtians grown from others by a capacity of diſcerning good and evil, and that by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual uſe of obſervation, and experiencing God's ways with the Soul; if therefore you find others expreſs what you have not felt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe not them, but cenſure your own neglect: eſpecially, if upon the review of your life, you have not been acting with an exact obſervation and improvement of knowledge of God in his Word, outward Providences, and inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>I think it not amiſs to ſubjoin to this Reproof and Advice, an Experience concerning my ſelf, and the very Saint thus reproached. I once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing importuned to aſſiſt in a particular matter, a more than ordinary willingneſs to it ſeiz'd me; in the undertaking whereof a ſucceſsful Iſſue occur'd, and great benefit to the perſon that importuned, whoſe Poverty and Goodneſs I had no diſcovery of, though greatly known to others, but was under a ſurprizing force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49481:82"/>
their grateful Acknowledgment. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about an hour after to unboſom my ſelf to this Saint, amongſt other things I imparted this Paſſage, with a wondring at the meaning of ſuch a ſurprizing willingneſs to the action, and unwillingneſs to accept of reward, though Duty oblig'd me to it, when no other Motives to the contrary appear'd. To which he grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer'd, You ſhall receive it as a reward of this action ſixty-fold, by God's imparting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to your Soul this day; but be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, though a diſquiet follow it before you ſleep. This then, in my account, run like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, eſpecially after its fulfilling; our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being about eleven in the forenoon: About two in the afternoon, in a Chamber all alone, ſuch enlargement of Soul, ſuch ſudden raviſhing, and heavenly affections, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible delight ſeiz'd me, with amazement in my ſelf, to obſerve the firſt part of his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made out: But about nine at night, there came a Penny-poſt Letter to my hands from one whoſe Malice prompts them with falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations to aſperſe me, and that expreſs'd in ſuch bitterneſs, that it greatly did diſquiet me; and going immediately with it to him, he with Modeſty and Concern repli'd, <hi>That the Devil had been at the penning thereof.</hi> His foreſight of theſe two ſuch different Effects conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to this action, was neither by Prophecy nor Revelation, but purely from his ſtrict and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant obſervation of God's ways round himſelf
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49481:83"/>
in the like caſe, and though then it ſeemed ſtrange to me, hardly being able to forbear from thinking of ſomething prophetical in it; yet ſince by obſervation I may ſay often or never falls out a voluntary lively Act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without the leaſt of ſelf, and much of God in it, but great ſpirituality of frame has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and after this, one diſquiet or other has fallen out; yea often, I may ſay always as yet, at the time of this fellowſhip, an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſome ſucceeding diſquiet is in my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have reproach'd his Writings, would have been as ready to have reproach'd this Experience of him as Melancholy, unleſs they had been ſtrict obſervers of God's ways with themſelves.</p>
            <p>I do believe that every Chriſtian had not met my paſſage with the ſame return, and that none but thoſe who by uſe are made diſcerning of good and evil, had been capable of what I find he was.</p>
            <p>Be humbled therefore, lazy Chriſtians, and think of others better than your ſelves, and not of your ſelves above what you are, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing each other: You encourage thoſe who know nothing of inward Religion, to keep out from trying its Enjoyments, and others to mock at Experimental Chriſtianity. Alas! Is ſo much of the depth of God's Ways to be known by years Obſervation, and this time

made uſe of to rack Thoughts to explicate Events notionally, altho' the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> himſelf found it too painful for him to explicate the inequality of Providence without God's Word; yet our Land abounds with ſuch Deiſts, who, to deſtroy the Being or neceſſity of Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or of a Holy Spirit, as helps in the uſe of means, exalt Reaſon alone, and expunge all things incomprehenſible by it, as Fancy or Chimera; as well as the Chriſtian treated of; expunge Injoyments obtain'd beyond others, in a conſtant and cloſe walking with God as Enthuſiaſtical.</p>
            <p>Some, I am apt to believe, affect this way of high Pretenſions to Rationality, when at the ſame time they are greatly diſtant from its Exerciſe, either to obtain a Character of being Learn'd, or a liking in Society, by Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Converſation, or to draw Followers after their Notions, and they to appear as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thereof. You that have rational Souls, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your Reaſon more for God's Service and your own Intereſt; the more Rational, the more capable of improvement with the bleſſed helps of God's Divine Word, Providence and Spirit: Place your Knowledge in Divine Things, upon his Word as the foundation, and learn to eſtabliſh it by the obſervation of his Providence and Spirit confirming it to you; and then I dare ſay, there will need neither Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick nor Diviſion to keep up the Chriſtian Religion in its Power amongſt its Profeſſors.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49481:84"/>
You are too weak to comprehend the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel, put forth never ſuch acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, without the powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Chriſt's Spirit opening the Eyes of your Underſtanding, and fixing your Faith therein by your Experiencing its Truth in your Souls, ſuch clear knowledge and eſtabliſhment appears, as reſiſts all the fanciful and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Notions of others; yea, ſuch unſpotted Converſations, as may engage others to your way, and to be Members of Chriſt's Myſtical Body here on Earth. I have with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, known ſome Chriſtians weak in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſtrong in the knowledge of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Religion, clearly underſtanding an Event of Providence; yea, rejoycing in an Event outwardly afflicting, when a Learned Wit could neither comprehend the meaning of the one, nor free himſelf from diſquiet under the other. How often may you hear ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Experimental Religion, but greatly knowing in Notional Divinity, mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauding a Sermon, itching their Ears with a Rhetorical ſtyle, and Philoſophical arguing: And others, mean in Learning and worldly Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but well acquainted with inward Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, eſteeming this ſame Sermon an empty noiſe, and the Preacher a feeder of his Flock with airy Notions, that have neither ſolidity nor comfort in their reliſh, and will lead them in no other Path than that of a meer Notional Knowledge, as a Bate to be catch'd by the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of this Age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:49481:84"/>If Miniſters and People were more cloſe to the uſe of means, whereby God's Truths might be Experimentally felt, both would ſee far leſs need of adjoyning the high flight of Notions in Pulpits, or in Converſation, for its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their Souls. I think it in our day a more advantageous Sermon, and a more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Book, that leads Chriſtians to the uſe of ſuch means, by which much of God's Spirit may be communicated to their Souls, and thereby God's Word experienc'd as certain, and their Reliance upon it as the foundation of their Faith, evidently to themſelves and others brought forth: Such I ſay, ſeem more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, than the Sermon or Book inlarging upon a Divine Truth, with ſuch fine Oratorical and Philoſophical Style, as may itch the Ear of the Chriſtian with eſtabliſhment of its own Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religious Theory; and of the illiterate, with an opinion of the Preacher or Writer's great and learned Gifts, indangering both, through obtain'd applauſe, not only of Pride, but of keeping Reaſon out of its due place; and if this has not brought forth many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necceſſary Heats at this day, I am greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: Reaſon is that noble Principle diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing us from all other inferiour Creatures, and tho' Corrupted, yet capable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to greater Perfection and Stability, than when Man was Created at firſt perfect, but ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of falling: God has made proviſion of ſuitable helps to advance, and to bring forth
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49481:85"/>
this Perfection; but the Pride of Corrupted Man is ſuch, that as at firſt it prompted him to affect an Equality with God; ſo now it prompts him to the vain imagination of himſelf, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without Divine helps to regain his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State, and obtain by his own knowledge the underſtanding of all neceſſary Divine Truths, and by his own ſtrength the performance of all neceſſary Duties; And if this has not brought forth the undervaluing of Reveal'd Religion by the Deiſts, the undervaluing of Chriſt by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the undervaluing of a Divine Spirit expoſing him as no help, neither his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Influences as ſtrength to work out our Salvation by, I am as much miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Experimental Religion cuts off all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; For the more a Chriſtian obſerves of himſelf in his experienced failures; the leſs room and lower ſtation ſelf-ſtrength obtains in his Affections, the more he finds of Chriſt's Spirit unexpectedly and powerfully bearing home Scripture-Truths to his perſonal experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, formerly unacquainted with, tho' often Notionally heard of; the lower eſteem Reaſon muſt have, as by its ſelf incapable rightly to underſtand Goſpel Myſteries: And tho' in our day, we have ſome ſo openly confident, as in Print to tell us, That nothing is Myſterious in the Goſpel, againſt God's own Word, the Seals of Martyrdom, and againſt the Experience of all the Saints of the Earth, endeavouring thereby to act Factorſhip for Satan, by whoſe

pleaſing ſuggeſtion of Mans Reaſon and Strength in himſelf to be relied on, without any other help to believe or to do what is neceſſary for the obtaining Heaven hereafter, and a ſecure undiſturb'd quiet of Mind here. I muſt believe, that that Creature has never yet been under any other diſcovery of Goſpel-Truth, than what was the effect of notional Knowledge; and that continuing in the ſame State, he can hardly expect to be a Member of that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Society, whoſe Eternity will be taken up in the Admiration and the Praiſe of that Myſterious method of Redeeming Man from a ſtate of Corruption and Miſery, to a ſtate of Perfection and Glory above; the proſpect whereof we only now enjoy darkly through a Glaſs, and yet the views thereof that upon this Earth we ſometimes experimentally have, are known by all Experiencing Chriſtians, both to be Myſterious, far above Nature's foreſight or enjoyment through it ſelf, and rendring the Creature unexpreſſible aſtoniſhment in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon the Soul; though the Proteſtant Nations abound with ſuch Errors, yet they neither derogate from God and his Word, or afford darkneſs to Chriſtian Profeſſors, who have experienc'd the reality of both upon their Souls, but expoſe themſelves to them as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans certainly ignorant of God and his Word, whatever fine Notional Flouriſhes in Print or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they expreſs, and alſo draw forth Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans pity towards them, and help Believers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

their praiſing God, who has made them in the uſe of means to differ from others.</p>
            <p>Experimental Religion makes us become as little Children, and eſteem our ſelves ſo low as to lay all our depraved Faculties at God's Footſtool, and uſing them not alone by way of Reliance, but with the help of God's Divine Spirit in the uſe of means: We have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years enjoyed ſo much of the Goſpel, but alas in Notion only, that I have ſtood in a maze to hear the Diſcourſe of ſome illiterate People, concerning the Notions of Chriſtianity; and to ſee their Zeal, debating their Preachers No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with that hear, as if they had been throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire-Balls one to another, till Fire has been kindled amongſt Aſſemblies of Profeſſors, when at the ſame time, experimental Religion has never been called in, as a help to unlooſe their difficulties. At the time of hearing ſome ſuch differences, my own Experience in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity has made me diſcover, that either their Debates could be reſolv'd in various Words; or that if means made uſe of by God, as helps to the People or Preachers Soul, for their experiencing of Divine Myſteries, had been more preſt upon the People, with that enlargement which their own Experience might have afforded, no ſuch Debates would have riſen, and People and Preachers ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known in our day; and whether God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the eſtabliſhment of his Truth, ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, or outward Intereſt, were at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſuch hot Zeal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:49481:86"/>When once in the uſe of means, a Chriſtian finds the evidences of Sanctification, he ſhall then make the current of his Zeal run towards further evidence of its reality and further growth in it, adviſing others not to debate whether Juſtification or Sanctification precede, whether certain Conditions muſt precede qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying to be united to Chriſt, or union to Chriſt, before any thing of Holineſs in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appear; but to walk in the uſe of God's means, and in them to obtain the application of Chriſt, and all his Priviledges, by the help of his bleſſed Spirit, and ſo both Conditions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a renew'd State by your Union to Chriſt may ſenſibly appear at the ſame time: By the obſervation of the means thus bleſſed, and the ſteps of advancement in this newneſs of Nature, is brought forth not only eſtabliſhment to themſelves, but a capacity of inſtructing and comfirming others upon ſurer ground, than that of ſtretch of Wit and Notional Theory.</p>
            <p>Our Debates concerning Free-Grace and Works, carry along with them too much of Self, and too little of Divine Experience, and I'm ſure, too much of fiery Conſtitution; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Chriſtian finds enough in himſelf to keep both in their juſt Bounds, according to Scripture Rule; and imagines the Debates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necceſſary, and bringing forth of no other Fruit, than that of Faction, Diſhonouring God, and expoſing Chriſtianity as uncertain to thoſe that are ignorant thereof. The Experiencing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49481:87"/>
Chriſtian finds that the more of the Free-Grace of God in Chriſt appear in his Experience, the more love to God is kindled in his Soul, the more of true Sanctified Love, the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he finds to pleaſe and to obey him in all his preceptive Commands, and that his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Free-Grace no ways tend to a Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Life: Whatever the Notional Knowledge of Free-Grace may do amongſt thoſe who know nothing of a real Faith, and experience of God's Grace in their Soul, and where unſtrictneſs and unholineſs of life appears in the greateſt Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot for Free Grace, it ſavours of nothing more than its Notion in their Brain. Again, the Experiencing Chriſtian finds, that when he ſets himſelf to be moſt diligent to perform Good Works and Religious Duties, yet in the firſt he is often overtaken with faults, and in the latter conſtant failures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ur, wandering Thoughts therein, diſcompoſure of Mind from ſome diſquiet falling in before, or ſome ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion from Satan, or corruption within, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up at the time, which forces the Soul to lay by truſt to Self-ſufficiency, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Free-Grace of God in Chriſt; that through his Divine Spirit, ſupplies may be conveyed, enabling of us to do Works, though our own, yet perform'd by Chriſt's ſupplies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling of us; and accepted from us thorough his Merits perfuming them, that being our alone argument to obtain both, for the ſake of the multitude of his tender Mercies, the opening

and pouring forth of which we owe to our Bleſſed Redeemer, who has remov'd the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sword, and given us acceſs to the Throne of Free-Grace, but ſtill in the uſe of the bleſſed mean of Prayer: And I think it more a Soul's concern, to try the Truth of acceſs to the Throne of Grace by Prayer, in our own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and obſervation, if return'd, (that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mean of obtaining of Prayer in Chriſt's Strength) than before the trial of Prayer, to purſue firſt the Knowledge, whether Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be previouſly neceſſary before acceſs to this Grace, as is ſet down in the firſt <hi>verſe</hi> of the fifth <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Alas! While we are a ſtriving which things go firſt, we are in danger of miſſing all; while we are debating about the Notions of Religion, we ſuffer the Truths of God in their Experience to drop. Oh that our Debates were more at home with our inward Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſighting it with the continued uſe of means capable by Chriſt's Strength meeting us in them, to overcome it, and to fructifie Grace in its room, and leſs with our fellow Chriſtians, unleſs in point of ſtrict and Holy Lives: Chriſtianity needs no other bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark from us, than the true plain meaning of Scripture-truth, and putting Souls in the uſe of ſuch Means as God conveys the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in; and where the power of Chriſtianity is felt, let him be Church of <hi>England,</hi> or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter, under all its Subdiviſions, he becomes the Object of my love, becauſe of the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49481:88"/>
the Divine Spirit ſeems to have ſtamp'd upon him. Of their being ſuch, we may eaſily have diſcovery in diſcourſe one with another, and that without any extraordinary gift of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning. However others think of this Goſpel-priviledge, there is ſuch a difference between the Nature of Notional and Experienc'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, between the way and words of a meer Notional Profeſſor, though never ſo outwardly ſtrict, and of an experiencing Chriſtian, that to my ſelf I find not the leaſt difficulty: And it is greatly ſuitable to the forecited Text in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where it is ſaid, That it is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of grown Chriſtians to diſcern <hi>good and evil;</hi> and theſe Chriſtians are ſuch, who have grown thereto by uſe and experience. And where I can diſcover nothing of this, whatever Party he is of, let his Notions and Zeal in ſpreading them fly never ſo high, I am always afraid that the Motive of Self bears too much room in his witneſſing for God and his Truth: Let all therefore be reprov'd, who ſet up Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with thoſe that bear Chriſt's Image upon their Hearts and Lives, and only differ in their Notions and Conceptions about the Truths of God. Let Holy Lives and Acquaintance in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with their experiencing Chriſtianity in their Souls, be the Touchſtone of trying and eſteeming them. By the denying familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with ſuch upon ſuch differences, you pinch the great evidence of loving the Brethren, and ſhew to the world that ſuch an one is laid
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49481:88"/>
aſide, or introduc'd to your Favour, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a name of being one of ſuch a Party; and ſo give occaſion of producing Proſelites in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to ſuch a Party to obtain intereſt, and encourage thereby others to ridicule Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity becauſe of ſuch Profeſſors blemiſhes, through the want of Chriſtianity's power in their Souls; though theſe inward enjoyments (into which obſervation of outward Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lead as a mean) are incomprehenſible by the prophane and meer Profeſſor while in that ſtate, yet they are outward paſſages greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering God, bringing forth good where all evil is ominous, if obſerv'd by meer Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
            <p>It is experimentally known, that a paſſage of Providence dark and afflicting in its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, has many times had in its boſom a rich mercy. There is a known paſſage of one who broke his Leg in his Journey to go a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; a dark and afflicting Providence, both by reaſon of his breaking his Leg, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of his Voyage; but in its boſom was that great mercy of ſaving his life, the Ship being loſt in which he was to have gone. It is not long ago ſince a Wind hindring our Fleet to go forth was afflicting, but in it was that great mercy of the preventing of a <hi>French</hi> Invaſion; ſuch paſſages the prophane and meer Profeſſor cannot dive into, and if each were but obſervant of ſuch like, they would be reckon'd by Millions round Nations and People, and all
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49481:89"/>
with a diſcovery of God, the Governor of all things, and would help us againſt repining for diſappointments, and advance a reliance upon him in all things, by committing them to a Divine Conduct by Prayer, and diligently uſing means providentially laid in our ways.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it not known with experimental Chriſtians, that the Lord many times intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a rich ſpiritual mercy by a dark Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a ſpiritual inſtruction for their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by an afflicting Providence? It has oft been their experience to be brought under an outward diſquiet on purpoſe to free them from a cold, lazy frame of mind, and to introduce a ſweet heavenly poſture of Soul, who therefore from continued obſervation of this experience, will not forbear repining, and exerciſe patience, till the diſcovery of God's deſign therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; yea, work together with him for the ſame end, by addreſſing the Lord for ſtrength to ſtand firm in the exerciſe of reliance and love to him, which greatly eſtabliſhes the Soul in the exerciſe of theſe Graces, and therein ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, and is even met many times with a viſible reward ſuited to that particular Action, tho' performed by his own Divine ſtrength, the obſervation whereof has oft brought that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to my thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. <hi>Great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee, which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee before the ſons of men;</hi> either by hiding them in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of thy preſence from the pride of man, or
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49481:89"/>
keeping them ſecretly from the ſtrife of Tongues; and what eſtabliſhment hereto the perſonal experience of an obſerving Chriſtian would give, is more fit for filling up of ſheets, than a few lines: <hi>Mark</hi> the 10th Chapter, ver. 29. <hi>None has left houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for my ſake, but he ſhall even in this life receive an hundred fold, and eternal life in the world to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not the perſonal experience of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be diſappointed of the deſigned and deſired iſſue of an endeavour to introduce the ſucceſs of another and better? the conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof muſt needs bring the Soul to a greater meaſure of patience under a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to a ſooner and better ſight of the Providence than the other, who, though under his diſappointment, is ſtrengthned to rely by Divine influence perhaps in return to Prayer, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning ſtrength to honour God therein, yet he muſt needs be under more ſinking Fears, through the courſe of the paſſages of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments; the other Chriſtian having theſe ſupporting helps, the reflecting upon God's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ways of the ſame kind obſerv'd, and upon record, with the inſtructing and eſtabliſhing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ſuch ways had then upon the Soul, and the better event brought forth in a way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than what was expected, together with Prayer put up, and ſtrengthning ſupplies of grace received; however dark this may ſeem to the Notional Chriſtian, yet this, I hope, will receive many Seals in its peruſal by obſerving Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:49481:90"/>Is it not the experience of Chriſtians to be led into a pinch of extremity, on purpoſe to ſee the more of God, and the leſs of means in an event, and to ſtir up the greater reliance upon God with means, and the leſs upon means with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Divine Hand accompanying? How often are lawful, diligent uſing of means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed to Chriſtians, till they be brought to ſerious and often Prayer for Heaven's conduct and bleſſing thereto? The obſervation whereof keeps the Soul ſafe between means, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand, affording each his due place, without preſumption towards God, or Idolatry towards the other; if therefore the Chriſtian Obſerver is enabled to diſcover good and evil, where others not ſo uſed thereto, are uncapable even in theſe more common Experiences; how far leſs capable are ſome Chriſtians to diſcover more ſecret and adorable methods of God, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by others? Either they were never expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by them through the long intermiſſions of fellowſhip with God, or at leaſt never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, reflected upon, or improven by them to the end of further knowledge of God in the depth. There is therefore not only in the ſight and enjoyment of ſpiritual things, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Chriſtians and meer Profeſſors, but even between Chriſtian and Chriſtian, and that without either a Gift of Prophecy, or an extraordinary Gift of Diſcerning, but with ſuch Gifts as are communicated to the Soul in the uſe of common means; only with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49481:90"/>
that theſe means are more continually and in greater heavenlineſs perform'd, and the enjoyments of God therein, either for comfort or inſtruction more carefully remarkt in all its Circumſtances, and laid up in record for this very end of improvement, the greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtianity, and of God's more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſteps therein. Thou therefore, O Chriſtian, that has neceſſary occaſion of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of lawful diverſion, greatly admixt with thy Religious Duties, as a mean of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſuch fellowſhip with God as thoſe do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, whoſe life does run in a ſtream of actual heavenly mindedneſs; reproach not, I ſay, theſe other Chriſtians with melancholy Fancy or Enthuſiaſm, either of which bear their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct marks from that knowledge of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the conſtant uſe of means, and by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fellowſhip therein, in continual and ſerious receſſes of Soul with God; but bemoan your Circumſtances thus involv'd in the neceſſary occaſions of the world, when compar'd with ſome others, and do more with the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you have, than ever yet you have done, and that according to the means treated of, and bleſſed by God to others.</p>
            <p>In the hope therefore of paſſing from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Providences in your obſervation, to ſpecial ones round your ſelf, yea, to the ſteps and workings of Chriſt's Spirit in your Soul, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondent to his Word, affording you ſuch knowledge thereof, as expoſe the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49481:91"/>
and Errors of the Earth to your Pity, and keep you ſafe from the diſcouraging Blemiſhes, and infectious Failures of Chriſtians. In hope, I ſay, of this, let me preſs you to this great and experienced Duty of Obſervation, and I am hopeful your expectations will not fail, but a myſterious diſcovery of the reality of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word ſhall be unfolded, ſuch as could never have been forethought, or foreſeen by you.</p>
            <p>It is not to be ſuppoſed that ever the moſt refin'd Wit on earth could have made up ſuch a Syſtem of Myſtery as is contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and is experimentally felt in the Soul. Is it ſuppoſable that the Wits of our Age (who pretend their Reaſon as their Guide) could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, contrive, or rightly comprehend the Work of Chriſt's Spirit in renewing the Soul? Or is it ſuppoſable, that the moſt rational man on earth, unacquainted with experimental Chriſtianity, can imagine the work of Chriſt's Spirit in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Soul to a heavenly Frame, and the ſtate of the Soul at that time? Is it imaginable, that by the will and power of man, ſuch a Frame by which we are admitted to fellowſhip with the Godhead, can be retained without a Divine Influence? when though that this Divine Work is declar'd in the Scripture, yet with their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and light of God's Word without Divine Spiritual influences, (obtain'd by God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon means) they are not able to comprehend it, and therefore is left unknown to ſome of them,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49481:91"/>
and mockt at by others of them; yea, the Word of God made the occaſion of Errors on earth, the prevention of all which comes in by the right and continued uſe of theſe means God commonly affords the ſenſible experience of himſelf according to his Divine Records.</p>
            <p>Some Chriſtians excel one another in Faith of Reliance hereby, that if there be no aſſurance going along, yet their Hope is without ſhock, and that in the uſe of Reflection upon former Experiences, which in the 5th <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and the 5th and 6th <hi>ver.</hi> is ſaid, to <hi>bring forth hope, that maketh not aſhamed;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly found to do ſo in the Experiences of ſuch Chriſtians, if their Seals were given forth to the World.</p>
            <p>Let us imagine the judgment of any meer Profeſſor under never ſo rational a Conviction of any one Scripture-truth, yet without the power of Chriſt's Spirit bearing it home as Truth upon the Soul, you will hardly ſee (as the certain effect of this) ſaving Faith therein, either commenced or ſo ſixt, but that it may give way to a ſucceeding Error, if it have a fairer appearance to his rational Comprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than the other. I don't therefore much wonder at the prophane or meer Profeſſors, who have no other ſenſe of Divine Things than what is Notionally imparted and comprehended by them: My greater admiration, is, That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed, who feel the certainty of what others have but heard of Notionally, and much

more than can be expreſt by any, ſhould not be more endeavouring the witneſſing for God's Truth in Preaching, Printing, and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and leſs for the ſetting forth of their own Parts, or Notional Controverſies, not ſo material in our day, where the Truth of God's Word is ſo much expoſed and ſtruck at.</p>
            <p>A Third Motive to this Duty of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, That it is no hindrance to your world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buſineſs, or lawful Pleaſures, but rather by fixing your Thoughts upon an adjutant to your ordinary means, even a Divine Hand, and Bleſſing, you may conform to his Will, and receive the reward of ſuch a Duty: The Experience of Chriſtians diſcover, that a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide anxiety of Mind, and hurry of Body, and a laying the matter before God, with the diligent uſe of means occuring in their way, obtains more buſineſs, better ſucceſs, and greater Peace and Comfort, both in the way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, and its after-enjoyment, than when they ey'd nothing elſe, beſides natural Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, which when mightily made uſe of, is apt to lead a Man beyond true ſincere Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and their diligent lawful Induſtry, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for ſome ſpecial end of cutting down a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or for ſome differences of the temper of the Mind: God's Method differs with the Soul; but whatever difference be in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, it will end in the ſame delight, eaſie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and diſcovery of Myſtery. I add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to this Motive, being it belongs
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49481:92"/>
alſo to the other means to be mentioned, which tho' commonly talkt of, yet not ſo Experimentally treated of, nor Practiſed in ſuch a manner as bring in Knowledge of God and themſelves, or afford that inward Comfort that might be attained thereby.</p>
            <p>Let therefore your obſervation be general, as to all the ſteps of God's Providences round your Bodies and Soul, and you will ſee God in all, and may be brought to rely upon him for all, and have diſcovered ſuch a Myſterious Work, as the implanting and growing of Grace in your Souls; yea, you may be led to more than ordinary fellowſhip with the Godhead, with the diſcovery of ſuch ſteps, as even other Chriſtians have never been admitted to, or have let ſlip in their reflection and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and thereby be made more capable of witneſſing for God than others, and better judges of meetneſs for Heaven than otherwiſe you ſhould have been; and all this, without hindering your lawful Buſineſs, but rather with leſs anxiety of Mind, and hurry of Body; yea, with greater ſucceſs, and more inward comfort, without confining you from Pleaſure, unleſs it run to an extream, either of being Sin it ſelf, or the occaſion endangering you to Sin.</p>
            <p>The Second mean you are deſir'd to be in the uſe of, to bring you into the knowledge of Experimental Relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, and thereby the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of God's Word, and of his Ways with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49481:93"/>
the Soul againſt Errors abroad, and Darkneſs within, is that of Prayer.</p>
            <p>In this very Duty did I firſt underſtand the meaning of Fellowſhip and Communion with God, of Divine Influences, Spiritual Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſpirituality and heavenlineſs of Frame, which are words mockt at by the Prophane in our days; and was unintelligible to my ſelf, while only under the inſtruction and power of Education, and muſt be incomprehenſible to all others, under the meer profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, let their outward Behaviour be never ſo innocent, and their Duties never ſo grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd to the obtaining a name on Earth.</p>
            <p>While I was under the power of Education, I ſeldom miſs'd my ſet times of Prayer, with as grave a geſture as now at this day, and my concern us'd to be more for neglect of Prayer, than for not performing it aright; but after the Eying of God in all things, by the mean of obſervation of outward Providences, I began to think, that if I would have God's favour act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining in any paſſage concerning me, I ought to ask it, and in asking by Prayer, to do it with a real deſign and deſire of obtaining it. Firſt of all, I found a ſeriouſneſs therein like unto the ſincerity and unwanderings of one Man's ſpeaking to another to obtain any favour; but ſoon after I was carried beyond this, with an awful Senſe of the Majeſty of God, who behov'd to be of great Might, to bring forth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49481:93"/>
all Things, and to act in all Things, ſo viſibly as I had obſerv'd, and with ſuch height of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and heavenlineſs of Mind, that my Thoughts darted upwards, as with Wings, the ſame time my Words were expreſt; and that with ſuch pleaſure of Mind, as I had never obſerved before in Prayer; all my delight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly having been, that I performed, and not miſs'd my times of Prayer, but according to my uſual time and way, had the ſatisfaction of doing it; and ſo from this went on as I have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Experiences concerning Prayer.</p>
            <p>I know there are many prophane Creatures, whoſe Education perhaps has not been Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo this Duty of Prayer has never been enforced upon them: They live without the ſight of God in his common Providences, and therefore are the leſs mov'd to call upon him by Prayer for his favour in them, unleſs in a pinch of extremity, where, by the very light of Nature, and the power of their Conſcience, they are forced to lift up a Petition to him, but perhaps without any apprehenſion of God at the time, or concern of ſeeing their requeſt brought forth in a diſcovery of him in paſſages of Providence, bringing it about, or in a way of return to that Petition, their concern chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly running upon the Deliverance, whatever way it come.</p>
            <p>But alas there are others, amongſt whom I was, and for whom I am now under great concern, and for whoſe ſake I have ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49481:94"/>
expreſt the ſteps of going off from formality in Prayer to its ſpiritual and right performance; and from my Soul I wiſh, have, and ſhall beg of God, that what I am to ſay concerning Prayer, might influence their Minds with a ſenſe of their State, and a deſire to be out of it, in the right uſe of theſe few means; They are ſuch, who have had Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Education, who profeſs the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion even in a ſtricter way than others, who perform all outward acts of Worſhip with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gravity, who are free from known Vice; and ſtill from no other Principle than either that of Parents inſtruction and example, fear of offending them, or of reproach from others, but void of inward ſeriouſneſs of Mind in the Service of God; yea, in hearing Miniſters or Chriſtians expreſs in Duty, or out of Duty, Communion with God, Divine Emanations, and the like, apprehend the Words without any inward ſenſe of their meaning, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle deſire after it, or mock at ſuch words, as too familiar and inconſiſtent with the greatneſs of that Majeſty we approach unto in Prayer; not knowing experimentally the Mercy of God, as well as his Power; the Wiſdom of God in expreſſing his own Myſterious Truths by Words inferiour to the Myſteries, but proportioned to our weakneſſes, as well as the condeſcending ſteps of God with a poor guilty Creature, in firſt planting Grace in the Soul; and I am confident, not knowing experimentally what a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49481:94"/>
heavenly frame in Prayer is; for then when the Soul is in a raviſhing ſpiritual poſture, words of this kind are forc'd to drop from their Mouths, and there is more ſatisfaction in the Soul, and greater acceptance with God from a familiar ſtyle to him, influenc'd by his Divine Spirit, than from a whole Prayer of another, where diſtance appears, either from the words, fine ſtyle therein, or length of Prayer, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiritually perform'd: Yea, from this very principle of Education, there are ſome who have an outward ſincerity, and from thence an inward ſatisfaction in their Profeſſion, with a reſting in their knowledge and practice, as all the Religion to be obtain'd, with good hopes of their ſtate for Heaven, without ever doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either their profeſſion or ſecurity for Heaven. There are others under the power of Education alone, who tho' unſpiritual in their Minds in Prayer, yet upon any failure of their ſet times, are really uneaſie and diſſatisfied, eſpecially the breach of their continued cuſtom.</p>
            <p>And as it is for theſe my concern is greatly put forth, ſo it is with thoſe that many times greateſt difficulty is to reclaim. It is well known how deeply are fixt the Impreſſions of Education, and that nothing but a ſpiritual working of Chriſt's Spirit is able to blot them out, or to impreſs them a-new; upon which very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, Childrens Education, with true Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Chriſtian Religion, can never enough pay their Obligation to ſuch Inſtructors; it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49481:95"/>
being an excellent preparation for renewing the practical impreſſions of the ſame Notions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Hearts, as well as upon their Brains: In a word, Religion is between God and the Soul, and according to the heavenlineſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavenlineſs of the Temper, and frame of the Soul; ſo a thought, word, or action, in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or out of Duties, is either acceptable or unacceptable to God.</p>
            <p>Before therefore you leave off the Errors of Education, to a right notion and performance of Prayer, you are firſt of all to be convinced of what is Erroneous, and then of what is True and Right.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore a laying too great a weight upon a particular place for the performance of Prayer, is an error of Education: I know there are ſome ſo ſtrictly addicted to Prayer in a Church, that neither earlineſs nor lateneſs will obſtruct their Cuſtom herein, as if it were a circumſtance material in God's account. It is not againſt Prayer in a Church that I ſet my ſelf to oppoſe, but the great ſtreſs ſome from Education are pleas'd to lay upon it: I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if others were as painful to bring their Minds into a ſerious poſture, as theſe are (by retrenching their natural Reſt in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, retiring themſelves from Diverſion through a day, or at an evening) to have their Bodies in the Church at the times, Prayer would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known, and much more purſued in its
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49481:95"/>
right performance, than at this day. For my own part, if my Soul be right with God, it is neither to Houſe or Church I affix my ſelf, but the place I can be moſt private in, either from the diverting ſight of others, or their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſing noiſe; and if I have opportunity of choice, no place is more grateful to me than that in which I have had greateſt enjoyments of God in Prayer. Privacy I greatly value, from an unwillingneſs to expoſe my ſelf to the Cenſure of Shew and Applauſe, or a Prayer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably performed to the mocking of ſome, finding it impoſſible to reſtrain my ſelf from more than ordinary flood of words, and from a more than ordinary audible voice, when the LORD is pleas'd to raiſe my affections above my ordinary frame. The reaſon of chuſing a place favour'd with God's preſence to my Soul, is, that the memorial thereof may excite the greater endeavour after it, and former Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences may be one of my pleading Arguments for it. This is abundantly ſuitable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>David,</hi> who would often ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.6. <hi>That he remembred the hill Hermon-Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and other places, which were remarkable to him, from the rich entertainment of God's preſence in them; from all which, I drive only thither, to make you know how little the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Place, Prayer is performed in, avails in God's account, or comforts the Chriſtian's Soul within, whatever cuſtomary performance, or outward applauſe afford.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:49481:96"/>Privacy is recommended from Chriſt's own example, who would retire to the Fields on that very account; yea, part then from his own Diſciples, and conſtant Companions: And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more ſerious a Soul is, the more willing to be from all, and to center all his thoughts upon his dear God. If therefore any labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this failure of Education, let me adviſe againſt it, unleſs on the account of better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Prayer; and becauſe I hope there are ſome who on this very account give ſtrict example thereof, let me adviſe all from cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch an Action; the doing of it for a greater meetneſs, for fellowſhip with God in Prayer, makes it a Circumſtance congruous to a well-perform'd Duty; but the Circumſtance of pleading for it in Converſation, and fixing it upon others, from a liking of the way, argues it rather an Error of Education, than a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance experienc'd in themſelves, helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their ſeriouſneſs with God: for though to ſome it may have this advantage, yet to my ſelf it could not have; the ſeeing of any before or with me in any performance of private Prayer, proving many times viſible hindrances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A laying too great weight upon punctual keeping of ſet-times to pray, is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Education. There are many in no other ſtate of Chriſtianity, than that of its meer Profeſſion, and outward Acts of Worſhip, who with marvellous ſtrictneſs perform the ſet-times of Morning and Evening-Prayer, purely from
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49481:96"/>
the Rule of Education; but ſtill at a loſs what communion and fellowſhip with God in Prayer means: I accuſe not their praying at ſet-times, but Profeſſors confidence therein, as evidence of their religious ſtate, or their Prayers right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. <hi>David</hi>'s ſet-times of Prayer are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in his Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and I hope there is not any experiencing Chriſtian on earth at this day, who ſlights their appointed ſeaſons of private Prayer, to ſupplicate the Lord's conduct from morning till night, and from evening to morning; yea, by obſervation of continued Mercies through the day, are kept in a poſture of Soul fitted to ejaculate Praiſe; and by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of continual Wants, fitted to ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Supplication throughout the whole courſe of the day, and ſo kept in obedience to that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command, of <hi>praying without ceaſing,</hi> even amidſt diligent endeavours in buſineſs, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lawful pleaſures, as well as in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of morning, noon, and evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. My Challenge therefore takes place, when exactneſs in that Circumſtance proceeds from no other foundation than that of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or guided by no other Rule than that of others Example, and tending towards no other ends than Applauſe, or pleaſing themſelves by their Cuſtomarineſs therein. The former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my ſelf under the alone power of Education, and now under the power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, gave me occaſion to reprehend this Error, having then found my ſelf more uneaſy
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49481:97"/>
at the neglect of a ſet-time of Prayer than I am at this day, when a lawful occurrence falls in my way to hinder my performance of Prayer at my uſual ſet-time, then I have found my ſelf ſtill under anxiety for the omiſſion only; but bleſſed be the Lord, my experience is ſuch, that a heavenly Frame (the continual deſire of my Soul) is neither confin'd to ſet-words, nor ſet-times of Prayer, and follow'd with as evident returns when put forth in Ejaculation, as when in Solemn Prayer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A laying too great a weight upon the performance of Prayer in form, or extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, is an Error of Education; the frame and poſture of the Soul in Prayer, is the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of its right performance, and therefore either of which the Chriſtian finds moſt raiſing a ſpiritual frame, that I think ſafeſt for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſtick to.</p>
            <p>For my own part, without regard to the opinion and way either of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or Diſſenter, but purely to perſonal expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, founded I hope upon Scripture-Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I muſt ſay, that when in Cloſet or Family-Prayer, my frame of mind has been rais'd to great ſpirituality and heavenlineſs, my words then have run from me with an amazing free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and current, and in a moſt affecting way to my ſelf and others; from whence I muſt imagine, that the Soul confining himſelf to words in a form of Prayer, gives an occaſional
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49481:97"/>
hindrance of this ſpiritual frame, by confinement to what is deſign'd to be utter'd, and ſo keeping off ſuch Divine Influences, which we are uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bounding either in the frame of the Soul, or in the Chriſtian's outward expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Again, There is a mighty difference between a Chriſtian's ſeriouſneſs, when nothing elſe is ſenſibly productive thereof, but the ſtrength of the Creature's ſelf, by the means either of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God's All ſeeing Eye, upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Majeſty approach'd to, or by the means of drawing off the thoughts from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting things: There is vaſt difference, I ſay, between this ſerious frame, and a ſpiritual hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame ſenſibly, ſuddenly, and powerfully influencing the Soul without any thing of Self, unleſs as in the uſe of Prayer, but ſenſibly rais'd from a higher hand, to thoughts and words far beyond the other. I bleſs the Lord without the latter I am never ſatisfi'd; and I know the firſt may be perform'd, and yet without ſenſible fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God, but perhaps real fellowſhip with him by his ſtrengthning influences, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, fixes the thoughts from diverſion, or diſcovers Self, and Chriſt's ſpiritual Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and carries the Soul more out of Self, to cry and depend on Chriſt's Supplies, than ſuch extemporary Prayer with obſervation. But if this Experience can be oppoſed by others, who, for any thing I know, may find leſs diſtraction, and greater heavenlineſs of frame in a form'd Prayer, whatever their opinion be, I ſhall never
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49481:98"/>
offer my Cenſure againſt the Circumſtance of formed or extemporary Prayer, being only to be accuſed, when either it's perform'd, ſtuck to, and pleaded for, becauſe of Education, and not by reaſon of the one or the other's being a better mean towards performing of Prayer in a more heavenly and ſpiritual manner; if our Concern run more upon the obſervation of the Soul's frame in the performance of Duties, than upon the various methods of their outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, the common diſtinction of opinions and quarrellings about needleſs Circumſtances would ſoon be abandon'd. I diſſent from all, tho' of my own opinion, who lay weight upon any Circumſtance, but in ſo far as it contributes to greater ſpirituality in Prayer; and ſhall never cenſure thoſe of another opinion, who ſtick faſt to ſome Circumſtances, and thereby differ from me, purely becauſe ſuch Circumſtances are more ſerviceable to their Souls, in raiſing their frames to greater ſpirituality than when otherwiſe perform'd: But to be ſtrict in their uſe, and to plead for them in converſation, purely becauſe of being educated with them, without trying the contrary way, pleaded for, and experienc'd by others, ſeems to me the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Self, rather than the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Again, I am of the opinion, that Children educated with Forms of Prayer, are led to greater lazineſs in their more grown years, and often proves a mean of rendring them ſecure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fellowſhip with God in Duties: Not as if I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49481:98"/>
confin'd God's ſpiritual Influences to an extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prayer, or that there were never a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual frame in praying with Form; but that the latter more conſines the Soul with its thoughts in the Duty, and ſo fits the Soul far leſs to receive ſpiritual breathings, than an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Prayer. And when a Soul in the uſe of Form in Prayer is raiſed by Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to a heavenly frame, I think I may ſay, that then the Soul goes beyond the path of Form it begun the Prayer in, and reaches further in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, than what his Soul deſign'd by his uſual Form.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A laying too great a weight upon the Circumſtance of Length in Prayer, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Error of Education, eſpecially amongſt the Youth of Diſſenters, who are as much pleas'd herewith, as thoſe of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are with Form in Prayer. Length in Prayer I accuſe not abſolutely; for if the Soul be in a heavenly frame, and admitted to near approach to God in Prayer, its delight therein is ſuch, that it is unwilling to, yea, can hardly give over; but when Length in Prayer proceeds from no other foundation than Education or Cuſtom, it is a Circumſtance no ways promoting the Soul's heavenlineſs in it, or God's acceptance of it. There are many, who from being train'd up in the way of extemporary Prayer, can with ſtrength of memory, judgment, and readineſs of expreſſion, lengthen out Prayer to their own
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49481:99"/>
conceit and ſatisfaction, and with applauſe from others, and yet never know at the ſame time the meaning of acceſs to God in Prayer; it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that has often moved me to concern for ſome under good Education, and religious Character, but altogether unacquainted with inward Religion. The meaning of outward Worſhip to God, is to honour him on earth amongſt our ſelves; and the ſervice that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to God, is ſpiritual in the Soul; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion being no acceptable Sacrifice to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon that account of ſpiritual Worſhip; it's that which aſſimilates a man moſt to God, and brings a man ſooner to the knowledge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of God, and to a meetneſs for that Heaven wherein in all his Childrens Servants ſhall be ſpiritual and heavenly. A Prayer ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, ſeems to fly with wings by the gale of Chriſt's Spirit blowing upon the Soul, making it ſail towards God with ſuch words and thoughts as appear more the fruit of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, than of great memory and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let us but make obſervation of one man's Prayer at one time and another, when the judgment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> are left only at the helm, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and faintly does his words drop, though never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o fine; but when God breathes ſuddenly and freely upon the Soul, his frame is viſibly chang'd, is more affecting to the hearer, and is admitted to plead with God in greater familiarity, with greater power, and readier expreſſion. It is experimentally known
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49481:99"/>
how much more pleaſing and affecting a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Prayer is, though perform'd by an illiterate hand, than the Prayer perform'd by the moſt ingenious but unſpiritual. There needs no other way to converſe with the experienced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but by bringing Experiences to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; but for others unacquainted with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Chriſtianity, I hope the uſe of the means treated of, will bring you to the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and then your arguings upon Air will vaniſh, and they'll find the Chriſtian Religion ſolid and true, and filled with all ſolid comfort and eſtabliſhment to your Souls.</p>
            <p>Abandon therefore Circumſtantial Niceties as evidential of your right-perform'd Prayer, reſtrict your ſelf to no place, in performing the Duty, or in debating concerning Prayer, but where you find moſt privacy, and greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance towards a good frame of Soul; confine your ſelf not to morning or evening Prayer only, but throughout the whole day, upon any occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of affair, or company you are call'd to, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt your ſelf, without begging God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct therein; and if under conſtraint from Set-Prayer, endeavour after a good frame of mind in ejaculating a Petition to God, which will iſſue in as ſweet and remarkable a return, by which means the frame of your mind is kept in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſeriouſneſs to anſwer that Command of <hi>praying without ceaſing,</hi> as was ſaid before, and as a mean to repel forgetfulneſs of God. And
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49481:100"/>
to hinder the danger of running to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in lawful diverſion, which at this day is an occaſion leading to much evil, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt real Chriſtians, lengthen out your Prayer according to your Suits you find you ſtand in need of, or are ſenſible of at the time; and if you are heavenly, you will lengthen it out with pleaſure; uſe form or extemporari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not becauſe you have been ſo educated, or becauſe thoſe of your Party do, and plead for it, but try both, and then uſe what you find moſt ſerviceable towards a good frame of Soul.</p>
            <p>Theſe Errors being remov'd, I come to give you my Experience of right perform'd Prayer; not by Philoſophical Definition or Diſtinctions, there being ſufficiency thereof by excellent hands already in Print, but by Enlargement, according to my method of experiencing the gradual ſteps of knowledge God was pleas'd to afford concerning Prayer in the performance and continuance of it. In general therefore, judge of your right performance in Prayer by the following marks, which were the two I was firſt of all made ſenſible of, tho' afterward others (of which you ſhall hear in the repetition of the ſame two, with the addition of others) occur'd: But I choſe rather to keep them in the method of time as well as matter that they were experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in; not ſo much for grown Chriſtians who have experienced the ſame with my ſelf, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49481:100"/>

            <p>Firſt, You may judge of your right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Prayer by the frame of your mind in it, if ſpiritual and heavenly, if your thoughts are carri'd upwards with ſincerity and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the ſame time your words paſs your lips; the power of Inſtruction, Cuſtom or Applauſe having ſmall room as Motives thereto; but the obedience of God's Command, the ſenſe of your need of, and inſufficiency to bring about what you ask. The ſenſe of power in God, and of his willingneſs to beſtow, if for your good, moving you to addreſs him, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience whereof, and ſtrict continuance in the uſe of ſet and ejaculatory Prayer, with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of what occurs therein, you will find more knowledge and enjoyment creep upon you, than all the Divines on earth that ever I have met with has been able to expreſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You may judge of your right and acceptable performance, by returns to your Prayers. Such objections, that a return may come to a Prayer, and the Chriſtian not know it to be the return; or that a return may be ſo long
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49481:101"/>
deferr'd, as when it comes in, the Prayer that Petition'd it being out of the Chriſtians Thoughts, he is in danger of miſtake, by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Prayers not being ſpiritually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, not accepted of God, or return'd by him, when the Prayer has been perform'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, God pleaſed with it, and yet anſwer'd: Such Objections ſhall fully be anſwer'd in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſing concerning Prayer: Only give me leave to ſay, that when a return comes to a Prayer, and the return not known to be ſuch, it is certain argument to me, of lazineſs in that Chriſtian, and that a general and exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Enjoyments accompanying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and continued Prayer, has not been the practice of that Soul, and that that Prayer has not at firſt been remarkt; God's ways between the Praying, and its return, not exactly obſerv'd, and reflected upon, and conſequently the return given i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49481:103"/>
to help your infirmities, and to raiſe your frame to ſuch a poſture of heavenlineſs as you never knew before, unleſs by the hearing of the ear, and will ſoon unfold what a dark ſtate you have been in; that all the ſeriouſneſs you had in Prayer, was no other than the ſtrength of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that there is ſomething elſe in the Chriſtian Religion you have never yet been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, more ſuitable to the feeling of the Soul, than to the utterance of the greateſt Orator on earth. The Spirit of God has expreſs'd in the Scriptures theſe Myſteries in a ſtile ſuited to our underſtanding; but when the ſame Spirit bears them home to the ſenſible feeling of a Chriſtian, what addition is given to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's underſtanding of them, and true Faith in them! I go not therefore about to expreſs theſe experienced Myſteries in a better ſtile for your underſtanding, but to put you in a way of obtaining their experience upon your Souls, by the working of a Divine Spirit in the uſe of common means. You loſe your labour in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to underſtand them in their ſaving efficacy by your natural reaſon, without the help of a Divine Spirit, and his internal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. What can better unfold or expreſs the breathings of Chriſt's Spirit upon a Soul in its holy frame and performance of any Religious Duty, than its reſemblance to the blowing of the wind upon our Bodies, which, though ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly felt, yet is myſterious as to the parts of the Heavens from whence it blows, or the way of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49481:103"/>
its blowing upon us. In like manner, though the Spirit of God, breathing upon a Soul in praying to God, comes often ſuddenly like a gale of wind, refreſhing the Soul's dead frame with a raviſhing heavenly life and power; thoughts, deſires, and all the affections being then carri'd heavenward, like a Ship towards its Harbour, with ſweet delight therein, and an actual undervaluing of the richeſt treaſures and pleaſures on earth, in the balance with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſweetneſs for the time enjoy'd, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance whereof would afford the Soul a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on earth; yet the Spirit of God, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Divine Nature, and in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of thus changing the frame of the Soul, is incomprehenſible by the reach of human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and to the experienc'd Soul there is but a diſcovery of him in his bleſſed effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and a ſight of him through a Glaſs darkly, till that bleſſed change paſs upon them, and they obtain a perfect meetneſs to ſee and to underſtand him as he is.</p>
            <p>No wonder therefore the prophane, or meer profeſſing Chriſtian, attempting to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God's Word as to the work of the Spirit of God in planting Grace, or watering it with conſtant influences to keep it in exerciſe, find themſelves at a loſs how to underſtand it; and therefore never feeling its effects upon their Souls, either look upon it as <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and the Being of the Spirit of God, or his bleſſed ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49481:104"/>
of converting and ſpiritualizing a Soul, to be only Notions of a melancholy Brain. How many are there at this day who mock at the Spirit of God, and the Divinity of our Bleſſed Redeemer, and ridicule expreſſions of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him as canting diſcourſe; for they never receiv'd the precious benefits which the Son of God purchas'd, and the Spirit applies to the Souls of unfeigned Believers. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that one in a violent hot Countrey unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the blowing of Wind? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that one that never taſted Honey? Is it poſſible, I ſay, that the firſt and latter, from the deſcription either of the blowing of the Wind, or of the nature of Honey, in the moſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous words, can ſo well underſtand, or ſo firmly believe the blowing and refreſhing effects of the Wind, or the nature and the ſweetneſs of the Honey, as thoſe who have enjoy'd of the firſt, and taſted of the latter? This is a true reſemblance of their condition, who are void of the real inward knowledge of Religion; and their ſlighting and disbelief of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual efficacy of the Ordinances, cannot weaken the Faith of Believers, who have experienced the reality thereof upon their Souls; but give them greater eſtabliſhment, and afford them matter of repeated exerciſe of love to him, who paſt by ſome, and calls others, and advances them to a further reliance upon him, in the due uſe of means, for the obtaining a richer abundance of the communications of the Holy
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49481:104"/>
Spirit. When the Errors of the prophane and meerly profeſſing Chriſtians endanger the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of any real and true Chriſtian, it is often my fear leaſt that Chriſtian has been too careleſs of his Duties, and has not improved the pure motions and aſſiſtance of the Spirit within, and the advantage of the external means of Grace; for elſe he would be above the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the objections of carnal perſons againſt his own feeling. Is it poſſible that force of the moſt powerful Argument of the greateſt Rationaliſt, covered with the fineſt dreſs of words againſt the ſweetneſs of Honey, can ſhake the Faith of any one that has taſted thereof? perhaps he cannot diſcover the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry of the Allegation, but he knows it's falſe; like the poor Woman, when oppos'd by the enemies of Truth, her Faith was firm in her Saviour, and ſhe anſwered all Arguments with theſe words, <hi>I cannot diſpute for Chriſt, but I can die for him.</hi> A ſincere Chriſtian can ſay, I cannot perhaps demonſtrate with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional arguing, the Being of the Spirit of God, and his effects of renewing the Soul, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Chriſt's Image, and ſpiritualizing its frame in Duties, but I am well aſſured of it againſt all the Infidels on earth. Let what I have ſaid move thee, O prophane and meer profeſſing Chriſtian, to the uſe of obſervation and right performance of Prayer, as helps by which you may experience the reality of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chriſtian Religion; yea, let it move you,

O lazy Chriſtian, who know not ſo much of God in the Soul, and of inward Religion, as is attainable by you, be more ſerious and conſtant in converſe with God, in the uſe of his means, that you may enjoy what others have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: The wiſe and ſerious obſerver of Gods dealings with his Soul, who frequently reflects upon them, will better underſtand the harmonious agreement between the revelation of God in the Scripture, the workings of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and the divine diſpoſals of things in this low life, than another ſincere Chriſtian who does not acquaint himſelf ſo intimately with God, by a conſtant application of himſelf to him in all the ways wherein he draws near to us. It is the hand of the diligent, in the uſe of means, that makes rich; ſo is it the mind of the diligent Chriſtian, in the uſe of means, that is fill'd with knowledge. God's private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are not to be div'd into, but what is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Word is to be ſought after, and may be found out. It's the trial of his Word that brings Experience, and Experience brings hope; and it is the not trying the Truths of God, that makes ſo many doubtings and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings in a Chriſtian's Faith, and ſo much of unſetled hope of their inheritance above.</p>
            <p>I return from the lazy Chriſtian again, to the meer Profeſſor and Prophane, and beg you'd be entreated to join the eaſy and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Duty of Prayer to all your endeavours,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49481:105"/>
not contenting your ſelves with the cold forms of words, but mixing holy affections, which are the life of Prayer, and obſerving the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious return of Prayer, when perform'd by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Grace. This is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge provided for you, and to be obtain'd by you in the uſe, and continued uſe of right means; the reaſon you miſs the Divine Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, becauſe you don't preſent your ſelf in God's way. If a Beggar expects the Alms of a Prince, he will endeavour to be in the ſame ſtreet he paſſes thorough, and as near him as ever is poſſible; he will neither go to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſtreet, nor to the oppoſite ſide of the ſame ſtreet; neither will he plead his Poverty alone, but expreſs all his Wants one after another, as ſo many Motives to move charitable Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. All Beggars keep not to the ſame form of words, but open their Cries differently, according to the different Sore, Lameneſs, Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or the like, wherewithal they are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſibly with. Prayer is God's way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a poor Creature may draw near to him without hindrance of this or the other diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion between his Soul and his King; and when a Chriſtian is once ſenſible of his Wants, and of the All-ſufficiency and Condeſcention that is in God, it is not Form or fine words, but fervent ſerious pouring out the deſires, that moves the compaſſionate Father in Chriſt. A Cloſet-Prayer is oftentimes the opportunity of receiving great mercies from God, and is many
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49481:106"/>
times the ſetling of a diſquieted mind, and the change of a carnal earthly frame, to a ſpiritual heavenly one. It allays our Sorrows, and gives peace under ſharp Afflictions. This Duty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and conſtantly perform'd, will make you happy by Experience, and to reſolve with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>It's good for me to draw near to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to diſcourſe more particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer ſpiritually perform'd, be pleas'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the many Experiences in the forepart of this Diſcourſe, concerning ſpirituality in Prayer, as evidential of its right performance; yea, God's acceptance thereof, and of God's returning what was askt therein. I hope with an humble rejoicing I may ſay, that ſince ever I begun to experience a real heavenly frame in Prayer, when my Soul therein has been carri'd forth to God with high ſpirituality concerning any one particular Event, with full quiet of mind, and ſenſible exerciſe of reſignation at the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, a return to that Addreſs has never as yet failed me; and that when my deſire has been in exerciſe towards any one thing that God would not beſtow, I found my ſelf by the ſtricteſt obſervation under a conſtraint from this ſpiritual frame; yea, ſometimes from words to utter any Petition: or when words have been utter'd, it has been in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as when I was altogether unacquainted with inward Religion.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other Experiences are built upon no ſlenderer a foundation than God's own
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49481:106"/>
Word in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. according to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou wilt prepare their heart,</hi> to wit, the hearts of the humble, and of God's own Children, and <hi>thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any thing more plain or more fully experienc'd by obſerving Chriſtians, than that when God enclines his Ear to hear a Petition from a Child of his own, that he prepares his heart aforehand to ask it. He prepares the heart to ask by the influence of his Divine Spirit, one part of whoſe work is ſaid to be to <hi>help our infirmities,</hi> and that infirmity of our not knowing what or how to ask, by making interceſſion with us in Prayer for what God is to return, as well as exciting us to ask what we ſhould not have otherways done, though really ſtanding in need thereof. As the ſpirit of a man knows the things of a man, ſo the Spirit of God knows the mind of God; and is it to be imagin'd that this Spirit knowing the mind of God concerning what he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, will raiſe a Chriſtian's Soul to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of frame, and thereby prepare his heart to ask of God for an Event, when he knows God will not return it? A ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual heavenly frame is not the fruit of Self-power, otherwiſe a Chriſtian would be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of getting and retaining it when and as long as he pleas'd, which from its ſweetneſs in enjoyment would be deſir'd for ever; but it is the certain operation of the Divine Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49481:107"/>
a Chriſtian's Soul commonly in the uſe of means, and extraordinarily without means, for the end of letting the Soul experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the ſweetneſs of nearneſs of fellowſhip with, and acceſs to God in Prayer, as a foretaſte and earneſt of more intimate and laſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in Heaven; and for the end of helping him to pray in ſuch a manner as may be acceptable to God, and return'd by him. It is as, yea more, inſuppoſable that the Spirit of God would help the Soul to plead with God for a thing contrary to his ſecret Will, (not a Secret to him) as to help him to ask any thing contrary to his revealed Word and Will, where his aſſiſtance is given to ask, it is aſſuredly for the obtaining of what he knows God will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; however the return be deferred, and and Chriſtians loſe its ſight by the intermiſſion of obſerving of paſſages between the addreſſing God, and God's giving in a return thereto.</p>
            <p>Preparation to ask of God in Prayer, obtain'd through the ſenſible comforting Influences of his Divine Spirit, and preparations to petition the Lord, obtain'd without any other ſenſible help than outward endeavour in the uſe of means, are eaſily diſtinguiſhed in their preſent ſenſe, and after-effects; the one is ſenſibly the interceſſion of a Divine Spirit, with the bleſſed effect of inward delight, reſignation of mind, and return to the Prayer; the other has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe apparent beſides the Creature's own ſtrength, without that inward comfort or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49481:107"/>
following it, but the latter is often the means of obtaining the firſt. I have often found, and to be ſure other obſerving Chriſtians the ſame, that when I have deſign'd and deſir'd to lay a Petition before God in as ſerious a manner as poſſibly I could, my preparatory means has been to bring my Mind in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and my Body in gravity of geſture; to read a Scripture again and again, to fix my Thoughts with ſeriouſneſs, and to meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the All-ſeeing Eye of God, to whom I was to addreſs, on purpoſe to over-awe me from levity of mind in my Prayer: But when I have been actually ingag'd in the Prayer thus prepared for, the deſir'd and deſign'd petition has never been mention'd; either my Thoughts have been carry'd upon ſomewhat elſe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, which I have with earneſt affections and ſubmiſſion prayed for, and has ſenſibly had it afterward return'd; or if the deſir'd and deſign'd petition has been expreſt, it has been in ſuch a manner, tho' ſincere and unfeign'd; yet ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a Prayer perform'd with Self preparation, and greatly wanting heavenly ſupplies to enliven and ſpiritualize it; and as ſpiritual and heavenly ſtrength preparing to ask was with-held, ſo was the return: Yea, beſides the experience of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency, of heavenlineſs of frame in Prayer, the true comforting preparation of Chriſt's Spirit to that Prayer's return, I hope I may ſincerely witneſs that in the enjoyment of ſuch a heavenly frame in Prayer, words of Praiſe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49481:108"/>
concerning the thing I deſign'd to petition for, without the leaſt fore-knowledge of the mercy obtain'd, has been given in. Who obſerves not theſe things at the time, and lays them not up in their Diary till the Explicatory paſſage appear, ſuch loſe the comfort of ſuch enjoyments; the Knowledge of God's deep ways, and their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of witneſſing for him as others.</p>
            <p>Some real ſincere Chriſtians may here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps adviſe, and wiſely too, to have a care leſt by God's changing this method, obſerv'd as certain, the ill conſequence of darkneſs and Faith's ſtaggering occur not, leading to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt both former experiences, and the new methods of experience God gives in.</p>
            <p>To which, I ſay, that any miſtake concerning the Spirit of Chriſt interceding for any one thing in Prayer, and the return thereof as certain, is not becauſe that ever it otherways has been, or ſhall fall out; God's word being true, and the certain Foundation of this experience, but by reaſon of ſome failure on the Chriſtian's part thorough lazineſs in obſervation.</p>
            <p>Again; This Objection is evidence to me, that thou, O Chriſtian, art not in the way of Obſervation, otherwiſe thou wouldeſt have known from experience God's infinite conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention to be ſuch as to ſuit his Diſpenſations according to the State of the Soul in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and in its progreſs in Chriſtianity. To a new Convert the experiences of God are ſo marvellous and plain, either in their Nature, or by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49481:108"/>
God's continuing to repeat them, till the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian underſtands them plainly. If he apprehend not one, he may others; if he cannot ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a Divine Power in a common ſerious frame brought forth by the Soul's own ſtrength, and ſincere endeavour; yet he may in a rais'd, raviſhing, heavenly, delightful frame, coming ſuddenly, and that again and again, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the latter, and not to the firſt; that the one may be the more diſtinguiſht from the other, and the ardently ſought after. The Leper weak in Faith had his Prayer immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately return'd; but the Woman in <hi>Canaan</hi> great in Faith had the return of her petition deferred, with the intermixture of many trying paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Thus by Obſervation of God's ways with my ſelf, I have found that my Prayers ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely perform'd, when firſt ſenſible of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change, were immediately return'd; that I had not time to loſe ſight of God and his condeſcending love in them: But ſo ſoon as the Faith of the certainty of acceſs to God in Prayer, was eſtabliſhed in me, and Faith of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon him was ſtronger, then his returns of ſuch Prayers were greatly defer'd: And as a condeſcending help to prevent deſponding anxiety, quiet of mind concerning the return to be defer'd, always accompanied my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and the Lord left me not to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of corrupt nature, or of Satan's ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Or if either had aſſaulted me, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſtrength raiſing me to an actual reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Will at the time, fortified me againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:49481:109"/>Again; An Obſerving Chriſtian ſees ſo much of the depth of Wiſdom in God's ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, that it muſt be ſtrange if he preſum'd to confine God to one method, when the variouſneſs, yea the contrarineſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to bring about the ſame end, is one great evidence of the Excellency of his Wiſdom. An obſerving Believer knows, that God tries the ſtrength of Chriſtians various ways in order to their Eſtabliſhment: Not becauſe he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the exact meaſure of their growth in Chriſtianity, but from love to them, that by their faithful continuance in Prayer deferr'd as to its return, the Graces of the Spirit may be excited, and exerciſed, both to the honour of God, and their inward Comfort: For what can be more reviving than to find corruptions weaken'd, and grace ſtrengthened, which is the ſweet iſſue of many grievous afflictions, that are not removed upon our renewed Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till we are purified by them.</p>
            <p>Hereafter may ſome ſay, Since ſpirituality in Prayer is the Spirit of God's gift, and it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly comes, we may lay by Prayer with our own Endeavours, and wait as the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, till the Spirit move, and then to Pray. To this I ſay, Spirituality in Prayer is the alone Gift of Chriſt's Spirit, and it comes when he pleaſes; but by ſincere Prayer, we obtain this bleſſed Gift: It is not the uſual way of God to beſtow it in more excellent degrees, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our ſincere asking it in the humble ſenſe of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49481:109"/>
our need of it. The <hi>Quakers</hi> acknowledge, as from converſe with ſome of them I have heard, they have an innate Spirit, by which they are acted, and according to its inward ſtriving, ſo they move in Duties. I know in us all there is that innate Principle of Corruption, which reigning, makes our faculties of Soul and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Body move as it liſteth to evil; but a principle of Grace that inſpires us with new life in our Duties, comes from Heaven, and is obtain'd in the uſe of his Ordinances. This does not in the leaſt obſcure the Glory of God's Free-Grace; for his Spirit excites us to Duties, and ſupplies us with ſtrength to perform them; but it directs us to ſeek God in the ways ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that we may find him.</p>
            <p>That therefore Chriſtians may rightly judge of this heavenly frame, and interceſſion of the Divine Spirit preparing them to ask from God what he is to return, (Errors herein proceeding either from miſtaking the work of Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit helping them to ask, or from applying the return to what they ought not,) I ſhall give the following marks accompanying ſuch a Prayer, and that obſerv'd from my own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Experience.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A heighth of ſpiritual Thoughts and Affections throughout in Prayer, or in one particular Petition thereof, far beyond common ſeriouſneſs, which tho' by words it be almoſt inexplicable, ſo as to make the unexperiencing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49481:110"/>
Chriſtian comprehend it, yet it is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the experiencing Chriſtian. In this rais'd frame of the Soul, either in ſolemn or ejaculatory Prayer, there is ſuch heavenlineſs of Thought, as if the Soul were already in Heaven's Enjoyment: And for the comfort of young Obſervers, I muſt acknowledge, that my ſpirituality of frame in Prayer, the real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Chriſt's Spirit to ask, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidential of God's return, was at firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be much leſs in degree, tho' the ſame in nature, than now it is; one degree of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Knowledge, preparing for farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. This brings to my Thoughts the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual riſe of Chriſtians meetneſs for Heaven, by Chriſt's Spirit in his common way of working by the uſe of means, of which obſerving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſweetly ſenſible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another mark of Chriſt's Spirit's interceſſion in Prayer, as token of God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance thereof, and his return thereto, is, when with an Addreſs ſo ſpiritually perform'd, goes along a comfortable quiet of mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Event, tho' the praying-Believer be encompaſt with Afflictions. A calm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of mind in our truſt upon the gracious Will and Wiſdom of God to diſpoſe of all things concerning us, is our Duty, but 'tis the Gift and Work of the Holy Spirit, who is ſtiled the Comforter. We muſt obſerve in the Word of God, what he Commands us to do, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49481:110"/>
to enable us to do: He Commands us, That <hi>Sin ſhould not reign in our mortal bodies;</hi> and he has Promiſed, That <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over us:</hi> In like manner, God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us, <hi>To be careful for nothing, but by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to lay our requeſts before God:</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly freedom from anxiety and diſquiet, and a full poſſeſſion of the Soul in Patience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any thing, in commending our Affairs to God by Prayer, is the product of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, and not from the natural temper and ſtayedneſs of the Mind: And where the Chriſtian actually experiences it in Prayer, he may ſafely conclude himſelf influenc'd by a Divine Spirit, not only in raiſing his frame to ask, but leaving it at God's footſtool as to the Event, and that as preſaging of God's return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour, and introductive of his bleſſing. The Promiſe of God is the foundation of this Truſt; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, and he ſhall bring it to paſs:</hi> The habit of Reſignation may be in the Soul, but 'tis drawn forth into exerciſe by the renewed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You may judge of the interceſſion of Chriſt's Spirit in your Souls, in addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God by Prayer, by the paſſages of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that bring about the return of this Prayer. In the Obſervation whereof, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality of a Divine Hand in the Providences bringing the return about, is as diſcoverable,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49481:111"/>
as immediateneſs of a Divine Spirit influencing the Soul to ask with calm and reſign'd ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as to the Event. The obſerving Chriſtians do often ſee theſe two joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and each illuſtrating one another, where others do not, or hardly are at the pains to obſerve the one or the other; And what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the firſt <hi>ver.</hi> of the 116th <hi>Pſal.</hi> in the fifth <hi>ver.</hi> of the 118th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and in the 121ſt <hi>Pſalm,</hi> finds that Prayers return obſerv'd, and the paſſages of Providence diſcovering or bringing it about, is powerful in bringing his Soul to the actual exerciſe of love to Reliance upon Admiration and Praiſe of God: <hi>I love the Lord becauſe he has heard my ſupplication; I called to the Lord and he heard me, therefore ſhall I ſee my deſire; and he is now my ſtrength and my ſong; I will praiſe thee, for thou haſt heard me, and art become my ſalvation:</hi> The unobſerving Chriſtian therefore of Prayer's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and of the method bringing it about, loſes thereby the actual excitement of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Graces, and ſo miſs of much comfort and light that others enjoy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You may judge of the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt's Spirit in your Prayer, by the never-failing correſpondency between a Prayer perform'd as is expreſt, and a return thereto: This is according to God's own Word, and the Experience of diligent, true, obſerving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; And if it were not ſo, I doubt not but
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49481:111"/>
amongſt thouſands of Experiences training me to the knowledge thereof, and eſtabliſhment therein, I ſhould have met with one contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. I know I have met with many paſſages upon my advancement in the knowledge of God's ways, that at firſt view ſeem'd greatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of this; and if a ſtrict obſervation had been intermitted, the ſhaking of my Faith, or miſtake therein, had been the conſequence; but keeping ſtrict to obſervation of Providences pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and reflection upon paſt ones, with patient waiting the full ſight of the return to Prayer appear'd, with that improvement of being more ſerious and conſiderate in the obſervation, and comparing God's ways of Providence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings of his Spirit, according to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will. I would ſubjoin to theſe few marks of Prayer with the interceſſion of Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſome things you are to beware of, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of miſtaking this Prayer, and deluding you with a falſe reſemblance of it; and ſomething I would adviſe your obſervation of, that may be a means to lead you into the performance of Prayer aright, and thereby an opportunity of obtaining Chriſt's Spiritual influences therein.</p>
            <p>I begin with the latter; Firſt, Be adviſed to enter upon private Prayer without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of Spirit from the things Temporal that pleaſantly affect us: The thoughts of them will be ready to ruſh themſelves upon your remembrance: I could eaſily ſet down
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49481:112"/>
the many Prayers I have had ſpoil'd by ſuch things ruſhing upon my thoughts at the time; but circumſtances will not permit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Without any vexation upon your Spirit, unleſs you uſe Prayer in ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as a help to quiet your mind, and to ſuppreſs the further riſe of corrupt motions; for which end I dare recommend private Prayer as a healing means.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Have your thoughts as free of worldly Perſons and Things as poſſibly you can; otherways paſſing immediately from Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the world, you will be apt to caſt a lingring look back upon the world, and to have thoughts ſtealing into you, which will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Spirit's aſſiſtance to pray, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before charecteriz'd.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Do not curſorily perform the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Prayer to ſatisfie your mind that you have diſcharg'd the Duty, and till night you are not to return to it; but conſider, that Prayer is not only a Duty, but a heavenly Priviledge, wherein we may with a filial freedom addreſs our ſelves to the Lord Almighty as our Father, who from the infinite treaſures of his love will ſupply all our wants, and ſatisfie all our regular deſires: Therefore let us be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in the time for that Duty. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Prayer, our Hearts are more fully poſſeſt with God; and by wreſtling with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49481:112"/>
him, we get a holy heat of Affection, tho' in our entrance into the Duty we were but cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the hindrances which a Chriſtian is to watch againſt; and there are many other which the obſerving Chriſtian will diſcover, and endeavour to prevent.</p>
            <p>Concerning the other, to wit, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of miſtaking the natural workings of the Affections, for the Spirit's work in Prayer, I ſhall firſt in general ſay, That the not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtate of the Soul, firſt deſigning to Pray, in Praying, and after Prayer, leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many miſtakes: According to the inward and habitual frame of the Soul, ſuch is the exerciſe of the Affections in that Duty, and uſually ſuch are the influences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The judging that common ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in Chriſtian Duties, is all the ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that is neceſſary or attainable, may be an occaſion of miſtake: For this will make them content, without ſeeking for ſupernatural influences, and without the perception of them. Cloſe walking with God in the often uſe of Prayer, is the beſt help to train this Soul in the further knowledge of the Breathings of Chriſt's Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49481:113"/>Thirdly, A more than ordinary ſeriouſneſs, from the ardent deſire of obtaining the thing petition'd for, may impoſe upon ſome with its reſemblance to ſpirituality; as alſo a Chriſtian's indifferency in obtaining a thing pray'd for, may impoſe a reſemblance to the Souls of ſtraitning in Prayer thorough Chriſt's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The rational hope of obtaining our Petitions, or the rational improbability of obtaining, may ſometimes impoſe a reſemblance of ſpirituality and conſtraint in Prayer.</p>
            <p>An Experience whereof I have had concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Friends dangerouſly Ill, who in my thoughts, and in the judgment of their Phyſitians, have been Dying, from which ſeeming certainty of their Dying, I have had an unwillingneſs, as being altogether needleſs to pray for them.</p>
            <p>I remember of a Child, who was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Ill, without ſenſible pulſe, cold as clay, and in the opinion of all, Dying or Dead; which rational conjecture ſo impreſt me, as to reſtrain me from Prayer concerning it: But next morning in my Cloſet Prayers, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning a Petition for the Child, ſuppoſing it then aſſuredly Dead, a ſudden ſeriouſneſs and ſpirituality ſeized me, carrying me forth in Prayer for this Child, which at firſt aſtoniſh'd my Thoughts, till ſending to know if alive, I heard of its life and great amendment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:49481:113"/>To the praiſe of the infinite condeſcention of God, I ſhall mention two directions as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive of Error and Miſtakes in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Prayer, and the enjoyments accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, and that as an encouragement to weak Chriſtians, to uſe theſe means without fear, or doubting of God's wiſe and loving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of them, to preſerve them from Error, unleſs God's permiſſion thereof be for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's good, taking that way to eſtabliſh Grace ſtronger in the Soul.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His impreſſing me at the time with the true ſtate of the matter, that never to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was I under falſe reſemblances of ſpirituality or conſtraint in Prayer, but at the time I had ſome diſcovery of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such dangers never occur'd to my Experience, till God had eſtabliſh'd my right knowledge both of ſpirituality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint in Prayer; and that by Experiences in abundance, a part of which is laid down in the Hiſtorical part of this Diſcourſe: I ſay this, as a witneſs for God's Condeſcenſion and Wiſdom in training the ſincere diligent Chriſtian groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the true knowledge of God's ways in the right uſe of means; yet I ſay it not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage lazineſs, either in the beginning or more grown Chriſtian, but excite them to more ſerious and ſtrict obſervation of their Souls, that they may not be deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:49481:114"/>I find it more common with private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians than formerly, to obſerve enlargement in Prayer, and conſtraint therein, as forerunners of their injoying or not injoying what is Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd from God; but in Converſation, I find their obſervation as too narrow and confined, looking upon that that may be a Chriſtian's common Food in the cloſe continuance in the means of Grace, as an extraordinary Feaſt, and minding it moſtly concerning the recovery, or the dying of Friends, and not extending it to all things, hoping the life, or fearing the death of one, from a Miniſter's pouring forth his Soul, or from a private Chriſtian's fervent addreſs to God, or the conſtraint of both: It makes me remember how extraordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing and delightful ſuch Experiences were, when at firſt obſerv'd by me in the more tender days of my Knowledge in Experimental Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and makes me greatly afraid, that however notional Knowledge abound amongſt Miniſters and People that have liv'd ſo many years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Goſpel Inſtruction; yet Heart-Service to God in the performance of Duties, or at leaſt ſtrict continuance therein, eſpecially this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Duty of private Prayer, is not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſo the Enjoyments that follow, are leſs and ſeldomer experienc'd: But to this real and comfortable Experience of Enlargement in Prayer, concerning the recovery of Friends, that is more obſerv'd by Chriſtians, let me give you two cautionary Inſtructions from my
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49481:114"/>
own Experience therein, and of which ſome obſerving Chriſtians are not at the pains to remark, concerning this Enlargement in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Not peremptorily to hope the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a Friend from once obſerving your ſelves, or others, carried out in a heavenly manner, in Prayer concerning them; and tho' anſwerable to this once obſerv'd ſpirituality, appear ſome real amendment at the time; yet often with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continuance of Prayer, thus ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, their amendment falls off, and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their omiſſion of further Praying thus, their Friend Dies, unleſs God act in a ſtream of more than ordinarily condeſcention to weak Chriſtians. I know not but the Reliance upon the Evidence of one Prayer ſpiritually put up for a Perſon's Recovery, may occaſion careleſneſs in the Duty afterward, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obtaining the bleſſing that was thought to be coming to us. I remember a Holy Chriſtian, who was in great Thoughtfulneſs concerning the Recovery of his Wife, for whom he had ſo near acceſs to God in Prayer, that he had great hopes of her life; but ſhe dying, gave him ſome more concern of Thought, that he ſhould hope on ſo good ground, and yet be miſtaken; whereas his near acceſs to God in Prayer was but once experienc'd, his Eye was upon the frame of his Soul in Prayer, and not upon the Words utter'd, while under this Divine Influence: His omiſſion of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing thus to Pray, hindered him from clearer
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49481:115"/>
diſcovery of God's Ways: His miſſing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Words, rendered him incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of applying the return to what God helped him to Ask; to wit, God's love to her Soul greatly manifeſted in her paſſage hence. At this very time I can inſtance in a Child for whom I found great ſpirituality in Prayer, but without the leaſt appearance of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a fourth night's time, which ſeem'd to oppoſe all former Experience, and might have occaſion'd great miſtake if I had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded my words, as well as frame in Prayer ſpiritually perform'd, which were centered in one Petition, without the leaſt deviating from it throughout the whole fourth night, That the Lord would ſpare his life, and that his life might be precious in his ſight, without the leaſt inter-mixture of deſire or word in Prayer for Health or Recovery. When a Prayer ſpiritually put up, is remarkt as ſuch, and correſponded with a return of amendment, but followed with after-lazineſs and forbearance of the ſame diligence, no wonder the return ſtopt, and a contrary effect to what was deſir'd, or immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent appear; If therefore your heavenly frame in petitioning Health or the like, be once obſerv'd and continued in, I never knew ſuch petitions return to fail; but if this frame be obtain'd but once, and afterward it go off, you'll undoubtedly find amendment anſwerable to the time of having ſtrength ſpiritually to petition it; but ſuch a frame going off, either
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49481:115"/>
thorough the intermiſſion of your own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after, or God's with-holding it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but diſappointment to your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and deſire, and juſtly to your depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon once experiencing the frame, falls out: It is lazineſs in the right performance of means, and not continuing therein, that keeps off the many experiences of inward Religion, or occaſions the miſtakes that abounds concerning the great things of inward Religion; however ſome ſatisfie themſelves with the ill uſage of that Propoſition, <hi>God's ways are in the depth.</hi> It is from multitudes of inſtances experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd, that if the Soul be carried forth in Prayer for any Friend ill, that ſuitable thereto there is many times viſible hopes; but if this frame is not continu'd in, the Friend does decline and die. I know that once feeling this hopeful frame has made ſome Chriſtians lazy and ſecure, and not by ſerious Addreſs afterward, lay themſelves in God's way to obtain the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this frame, and ſo their Health and Life has gone: To conclude thence, That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is not always ſuited to ſpirituality of frame, is miſtake and erroneous, and evidence of your lazy unexactneſs in obſervation of God with the Soul: Right obſervation hereof would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover condeſcending Mercy in God, on purpoſe to keep the Chriſtian continually holding on that Duty of Prayer till the final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, iſſu'd, which meets commonly with great reward, tho' the continuance and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49481:116"/>
of Prayer continued in, be his own work in the Soul.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Cautionary Inſtruction, is, Not to be peremptory in judging the ſpirituality of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's Frame, or an Event anſwerable thereto; but to be ſtrict and diligent in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own Frame, and Events conſequential to it.</p>
            <p>I would adviſe great carefulneſs in judging another man's ſpirituality in Prayer, as preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of certain return anſwerable to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality ſuppoſed in his Frame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe of the difficulty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another man's heart in Prayer: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires exactneſs of Obſervation to raiſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to the capacity of knowing his own Frame when ſpiritual, or to raiſe him to an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the reality of Correſpondency between his Prayer's ſpirituality, and its certain return; but how can we be ſure of another man's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs? I have known many under no other knowledge of Chriſtianity than what is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, acquainted with no other power in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Duties, than that of Education, and Self-ſtrength, and yet pray with that ſenſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctneſs, and outwardly appearing heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Hearers have been affected with a good hope of the perſon, and a delightful thought of their ſpiritual ſeriouſneſs in Prayer; yea, the ſtrength of natural parts in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49481:116"/>
of Prayer, may heat the affections, and may perſuade a perſon and others that he prays in the Holy Ghoſt. If therefore you may hear a Prayer from a meer Profeſſor, ſo near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a Chriſtian's Prayer, influenced by Chriſt's Spirit, then to be ſure a real Chriſtian ſeriouſly performing a Prayer with a natural affecting way of expreſſion, may make a near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to a heavenly Frame, like unto that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible preparation given in by a Divine Spirit to ask what God is to return. Now to judge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Prayers ſeemingly put up in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality as really ſpiritual, and to expect from thence the health and life of your Friend, upon that ſure foundation of God's Word, telling us that he prepares the Chriſtian to ask when he is to encline his ear, and yet the perſon does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, may greatly tend to make them miſtake, when they judge it from the ignorance of their minds, and the deluſion of Satan, a failure in God's truth, rather than a failure in themſelves, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Prayer ſpiritual, and preſaging a gracious return, which really bore no evidence of either. But if you obſerve the Prayer of a Miniſter, or other Chriſtian in publick, put up ſpiritually, and judge it as God's Token given you for good; You that are concern'd, and really ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with experimental Chriſtianity, do not only find a ſenſe and impreſſion at the time of this Prayer, as its being God's evidence of good, but retiring your ſelves to your private Prayer, you'll find the ſame Frame upon your
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49481:117"/>
own Soul, as evidence both of God's returning it, and of the other's performing it ſpiritually; and that your judgement therefore was right, when a return is in God's deſign; though his Spirit be one, yet he influences many at the ſame time to ask the ſame thing of God. Thus there are more Witneſſes to his mercy, and its greatneſs appears the more, and he is the more honoured thereby.</p>
            <p>Both Cautions I'll endeavour to explain by a late Inſtance of my own Experience amongſt many I could produce, which for Brevity I muſt omit, that thereby you may know how many times a Chriſtian is help'd by a Divine Spirit to ask of God for a Friend's Recovery, and yet unleſs continued thorough the whole Illneſs, the Recovery has not iſſu'd; thereby you may alſo know the right judging of another's ſpiritual frame in prayer. The Inſtance is concerning a Friend of my own, for whom the Lord was in a ſolemn manner addreſt to by ſome Miniſters, who ſet apart ſome time for this very purpoſe; they ſeemingly were wonderfully carri'd out in Prayer, anſwerable to which there was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Relief appear'd, but went off ſoon after, and continued not. Throughout the courſe of their Illneſs, I found in my ſelf in Prayer a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect drineſs as to the frame of my mind, and words in Prayer for them, which made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expreſs my ſelf with fear of their death, excepting one Prayer in an evening in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49481:117"/>
my Cloſet, which upon diſcourſe with other Friends. I found to be the very exact time of others being united to pray, and the time of there being ſome hopes; of which joint and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer I knew nothing at the time of my own obſervation which I had ſet down in my Diary, till afterward in diſcourſe with Friends; and I had ſet it down with ſpecial Remark; but excepting that one Prayer, I found them loſt in all my other Petitions, and proclaim'd my fears, when their Phyſicians had great hopes, and their ſymptoms had ſome abatement, with the wondring of Friends what could be my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moving me to think this.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ask me, after what has been ſaid concerning Spirituality in Prayer, and its anſwerableneſs to return, Whether Returns from God are only to ſuch Petitions breath'd upon ſenſibly by Chriſt's Spirit, and raiſing them to greater heavenlineſs of thought and word, than commonly; or if extended to Prayers perform'd with no other ſenſible ſeriouſneſs than the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavour of a Chriſtian's ſelf?</p>
            <p>Before the Anſwer, I ſhall firſt lay down the difference between ſtrengthning and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Influences of Chriſt's Spirit; <hi>David</hi> had his withdrawings of comfortable Influences to ſuch a degree, and to ſuch a time, as made him cry out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.7. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone? will he be favourable no more?</hi> And in ver. 8. <hi>Does
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49481:118"/>
his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi> And yet at the ſame time, though inſenſible then thereof, he was under the ſtrengthning Divine Influences of Chriſt's Spirit; for when <hi>David</hi> comes to himſelf, after he had ſaid, <hi>I have cleans'd my heart in vain;</hi> and returning thence to the enjoyment of comforting Influences, he ſays in ver. 22, 23. <hi>Though I was ſo fooliſh, and carried my ſelf as a beast before thee, nevertheleſs thou hast holden me up by my right hand.</hi> From whence I draw a Caution to dejected Chriſtians, Not to think that tho' God withdraw his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting breathings formerly experienced, and that for holy ends of Reproof for not better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them formerly enjoy'd, or of excitation to prize them more when they return, and to keep cloſer and ſtricter, and more continually to the uſe of means to obtain, and to retain them; that therefore they have loſt the grace they had once the ſenſible evidence of, by Chriſt's comforting Influences, and ſo give Satan op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of following this thought with his ſuggeſtion of Apoſtacy, and danger of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the being no advantage in the further uſe of means; whereas the continuance therein, is evidence of ſpiritual ſupporting power, and of God's holding them up from falling, however unſenſible they are of his comforting Influences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a difference between ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Influences ſtrengthning the Soul to the continued uſe of ſincere Prayer, and between
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49481:118"/>
ſpiritual Influences, making the other comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſenſible, and carrying the Soul out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with more fervency and joy than at other times.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That ſhorter Intermiſſions of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſincere endeavours therein, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute greatly to the drawing down of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued comfortable Influences, and that the more cloſe we walk with God in the uſe of means, the more clear comfortable delightful enjoyments occur.</p>
            <p>I anſwer therefore firſt, That a Return is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that Prayer that is directed by the Holy Spirit to God, for obtaining a bleſſing for us; and an evidence of this direction is, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame of mind, and more than ordinary freedom of utterance in the Duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That often God returns a Prayer perform'd with ſpiritual Influences, though they are without that delightful evidence at the time of Prayer; the Spirit of God exciting and ſtrengthning the Soul to ask, carries him to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is ſuitable to God's Word, and with Reſignation in the Chriſtian's ſelf, whether this heavenlineſs of frame be ſenſible at the time of Prayer, or not; and therefore if God's Spirit be helping the Soul really, tho' inſenſibly to the Chriſtian, or really and ſenſibly too, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn certainly follows that Prayer, but with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49481:119"/>
this difference, that under heavenlineſs of frame he enjoys the Comfort of the return afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and under ſtrengthning influences, he is not ſo certain of the ſpirituality of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance or its acceptance with God, till the return make it manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That ſuch a comfortable ſenſe of ſpiritual Supplies to ask, is many times the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſerious ſelf-denying Chriſtians, and truly depending upon God in Prayer; and that the other is the allowance of real Chriſtians, but leſs watchful, and not ſearching into, and deſirous of the knowledge of God's ways, and therefore have not that aſſurance of preſent acceptance and after-return, as the ſerious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Chriſtians have.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That comforting Influences are more experienc'd as the portion of beginning Chriſtians, and training up to the knowledge of God, of tender hearted Chriſtians, and of thoſe who walk continually with God in their thoughts by ejaculation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The evidence of ſupporting Influences without the other, is continuance in ſerious uſe of means, notwithſtanding God with-holds its comfort, which muſt evidence a power above the carnal nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:49481:119"/>My Advice therefore is, To begin the uſe of ſerious Prayer, as well as of obſervation of outward Providences, that you may have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Godhead even on earth, and come to the knowledge of God's ways without the fear of miſtake, becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and tender love that is in your Guide and Conductor, leading you in the right way, unleſs you ſtand ſtill, and walk not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on in the uſe of means, or walk in them inadvertently. Pray the Lord to prepare you to ask the things which he has declar'd in his Word, he is ready to give, and in his time you ſhall obtain them. This humble, conſtant, and affectionate continuance in Prayer, will be an excellent means to make you underſtand the method of God's beſtowing mercies, as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of his Favour.</p>
            <p>By this Duty of Prayer, and obſervation therein, you'll be able to expoſe all the Errors of the Age; you'll ſee <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> at the root of our new-ſprung Errors: for if they cannot defend Self-ſufficiency to will and chuſe ſpiritual things, and to comply with ſaving means, they muſt look to Chriſt, and acknowledge that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from its beginning to its perfection, is to be aſcribed to Divine Grace. Others deny the Deity of Chriſt, and think him as meer Man like themſelves; inferior to the Devils, who acknowledged him the Son of God, his power over them, by begging he would not torment
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49481:120"/>
them, but finding the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt's being God ſo clearly aſſerted in the Scriptures, they turn Deiſts, and deny all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, that ſo we may have nothing above our own Reaſon and Self-ſufficiency to recur to, for the obtaining the Favour of God here, and of Heaven hereafter. God believ'd as Creator, and men living in the practice of publick moral Vertue, though private Vices are allowed, is ſufficient, in the opinion of ſome, for their preſent peace and eſteem, and their future happineſs: But the Scripture and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience does ſtrongly refute thoſe <hi>Arminian</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, in that firſt Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and the 13th verſe, <hi>We are not born of the will of man, but of God.</hi> And in the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>It is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Theſe Texts are confirmed by the experience of all ſincere Chriſtians, who feel the grace of God, in turning them from the love of Sin, to the love of Holineſs; and carrying them thro' a tempting World, to the eternal Kingdom; expoſing both, with the embracers of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, in their true Colours? Their growth is no marvel to me; their not being more is a greater wonder. Prophaneneſs in Practice, Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in meer Profeſſion, Experimental Religion diſcouraged by ſome, and neglected too much in the Converſation of God's own Children, with their diviſions and unneceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Nouriſhers of ſuch wild Grapes.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49481:120"/>
I do believe I may, without the breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſay, That if <hi>Arminians</hi> in this Age are underſtanding in God's Word, their knowledge thereof is meerly Notional, with Self-Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereupon, but ignorant of its reality from the experience thereof in their own Soul.</p>
            <p>That what I ſay may not ſeem Cenſure, but what has true ground for ſuggeſting, I'll call forth all the experienced Chriſtians on earth to witneſs, If any one of them was ever able to bring themſelves by their own ſtrength, and when they would, to a heavenly frame of Soul in Prayer; yea, though God has given forth means to obtain this frame. I appeal to their experience, whether their reliance upon theſe means, has not often obſtructed this Gift of Chriſt's Spirit influencing the Soul depending thereupon in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p>We have Millions of Inſtances, and I believe I could produce thouſands from my own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal experience, of being out of a heavenly frame of mind, and that ſuddenly and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly a raviſhing heavenly frame has ſeized me, without any previous working my ſelf therein, only ſuddenly this frame has ſeized my Soul like a ſudden Gale of Wind, filling the Sails of the Faculties of the Soul, and driving the Ship towards the heavenly Harbour of God's Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:49481:121"/>We have alſo multitudes of Experiences of the ſame power of Chriſt's Spirit ſuddenly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſignedly, and powerfully working, with a verſe of a Chapter read, and with a ſentence of a Sermon preached, both the converſion of Chriſtians, and alſo the ſpiritualizing of their frames, without the leaſt deſign or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought in the Creature's ſelf, and without any other ſtrength of man than laying himſelf in God's Road, and Highway of Duties, in which he commonly walks, and by which he acts when and how he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>My Argument is from leſſer to greater: If a Chriſtian cannot bring forth nor retain a ſpiritual frame in the Soul when or as long as he will, how much leſs is an Unbeliever ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of chuſing and working Grace in his Soul when he will? Where is that Inſtance of a Chriſtian that dare pretend, when he is in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame, to be able ſo to keep himſelf? I dare ſay any that ever had it in reality and power, would deſire no other lot on earth, but to be kept in this Heaven on earth.</p>
            <p>If thou therefore, O <hi>Arminian,</hi> art uncapable of believing without a Divine Power, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a heavenly frame in Prayer when thou wouldeſt, or to retain a ſpiritual frame when thou art in its enjoyment, lay by Self, and forge no more lying deluſions for thy Bulwark, all
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49481:121"/>
experiencing Chriſtians find out thy falſhood, and bemoan thy miſery. I ſhould rejoice if God ſhould honour me as an Inſtrument to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with thee to walk in thoſe means in the method mentioned, that with a Divine Spirit accompanying them, you might be led to a diſcovery of your Errors through blindneſs, and the evil of broaching and fructifying them on earth.</p>
            <p>Apprehend with your ſelves how unmeet you'll be to admire the Infiniteneſs of Mercy, in providing theſe bleſſed helps of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, Divine Providence, and Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and how unfit to praiſe his Name for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when now you derogate from all, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix it upon Self. Let not matters unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and capable of being experienced in the uſe of few and eaſy means, be debated firſt, but rather let your arguings ſucceed to your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, unleſs they be ſuch Myſteries as are meerly to be credited according to Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and uncapable of man's comprehenſion in this life; and then in God's method of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and watering Grace, you'll obtain a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Self-inſufficiency, the need of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to look to, and depend upon God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Word in conjunction with his Divine Spirit, as your chief helps hereto.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Arminian,</hi> to plead his own power, is like the prophane and meer Profeſſor, mocking and doubting of fellowſhip with God in Prayer. It is the <hi>Arminian</hi>'s want of Grace, or at leaſt the want
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49481:122"/>
of the obſervation of ſteps, that has led to their Grace and its growth, that keeps them ſtill exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Self; and it's the others never experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing communion with God in Prayer, that make them ridicule it. Put Self to the tryal, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> whether you can in your ſtrength work Grace? try it, and do not delay till a dying hour. And if you find you can't, then bring to the tryal another ſtrength, even that of a Divine Spirit in the uſe of means recorded in this applicatory part, and then you'll follow Chriſt's Command, and become as a little Child, obedient in the uſe of God's means to help forward the right knowledge of him and your ſelves, and ſhall be enabled to get out of Self-confidence, into a reliance upon a more Divine Foundation, even Chriſt's Spirit, the Gift given to the Chriſtians in the world, upon Chriſt's leaving the Earth, and his Aſcenſion to Heaven.</p>
            <p>By Prayer, and Obſervation therewith, you will ſoon diſcover <hi>Socinianiſms</hi> Falſhood, as it has ſprung from <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> by ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting Self; ſo the diſcovery of the vanity of the latter, ſoon lays open in Chriſtian experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the deluſion of the former. Let a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian but obſerve the difficulty of laying aſide Self-truſt, even after God's moſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiences dethroning it, and the prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind to admix Self in Duties rightly perform'd. The difficulty of putting on Self-denial, and of being cloath'd with that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49481:122"/>
glorious Grace of Faith; yea, the means made uſe of by God to uncloath us of the one, and to adorn us with the other. The Obſervation I ſay of all theſe in a Chriſtian, will ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of our inſufficiency, and encline us to exalt Chriſt as the Object of the Soul's truſt and adoration, for the deſtroying of that branch of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> even the denial of the Godhead of our bleſſed Redeemer. Beſides Scripture plainneſs, the attributing to Chriſt all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable perfections of the Deity is proof againſt them. Will all the <hi>Socinians</hi> Sophiſtry on earth make me disbelieve his Godhead, when I have experienc'd that in the worſhip and adoration of Chriſt, the Grace of God that has converted me from Sin to Holineſs is then in exerciſe? GOD is a jealous GOD, and will not part with that Prerogative of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more to meer man than to vain Images; and yet, Who are the ſanctified ones in Chriſt? who are the Perſons <hi>Paul</hi> judg'd meet to write unto, in his firſt <hi>v.</hi> of his firſt <hi>ch.</hi> of his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> even ſuch who call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord not nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſo, but ſuch a Lord as is made the object of Adoration in the Goſpel Churches; none elſe being fit Members to make up a Chriſtian Church, and all denying Chriſt's Godhead and this Adoration due to his Name, exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from being fit matter for a Goſpel Church. My Adoration of Chriſt as God, I obſerve moſt ſolemn and with an intire truſt in him, when I
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49481:123"/>
am in a heavenly frame of Soul in private Prayer, being then certain that the exerciſe of Adoration to Chriſt is the true effect of God's Divine Spirit influencing my Soul. Often in meditation in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating the Lord's Supper, the admiration and adoration of Chriſt as God bleſſed for ever, has been kept up with great warmth and ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Soul. To the <hi>Socinians</hi> I would put this Queſtion, If ever in a private Prayer to God, in participation of the Lord's Supper, or upon a ſick, and in appearance dying Bed, they experienced a heavenly raviſhing frame of Soul? and if they have, what exerciſe of thought in either of theſe three Circumſtances concerning Chriſt and themſelves then ſeiz'd them? I dare anſwer, That if really influenced with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly frame, <hi>Arminius</hi> with honour to Self, and <hi>Socinus</hi> with his diſparagement of Chriſt, were low as the duſt in their Opinion then.</p>
            <p>How unſuitable are thoſe who deny Chriſt this Tribute on earth, to reign with him in Heaven, when the Myſtery of the Trinity, the Myſtery of Redemption by God the Son, and the Myſtery of Converſion by God the Spirit, ſhall be perfectly unfolded; when the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adoration of God, for his infinitely wiſe and condeſcending Mercy in delivering man, muſt be in frequent exerciſe: This is the moſt excellent, beneficial and comfortable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a Chriſtian's Faith, Contemplation and Affection. We can only ſee it here through a Glaſs darkly; in the full ſight is the perfection
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49481:123"/>
and felicity of the Saints in Glory: But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of redeeming love in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, fills the Soul with a Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious.</p>
            <p>God conſtituted man at firſt with all the neceſſary faculties of Body and Mind, and with their beautiful Ornaments, that man by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the excellent Goodneſs of his Maker, might Glorifie him, and not meerly pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own Perfections, and the fruition of Paradiſe: In like manner, a gracious Soul is renewed to Chriſt's Image in Converſion, not that the doing of it may be proclaim'd as his own work and Glory thereby derogated from the Godhead of Chriſt and his Bleſſed Spirit; Man is made meet for Heaven by Grace grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Soul on Earth; And does he paſs that perfecting change at the day of Judgment? and is he admitted to theſe glorious Viſions in Heaven for the admiration of himſelf? No; He will know, that as the Creation of Man was the product of the Counſel and Power of the Deity, as it's declared in theſe words, <hi>Let us make man;</hi> ſo the Converſion of man from the power of Sin to Holineſs, is the ſole effect of the free Mercy and Power of God, and for the honour of his Grace. Pride firſt diſcover'd it ſelf in our fatal fall, and has continued to ſhow it ſelf in arrogating to our ſelves what is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely due to God; but the perfected Spirits of Juſt men, know how unworthy and unprepared they were to ſee God in his full Glory: They
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49481:124"/>
continually pay the humble Homage of Praiſe to him that ſits upon the Throne, whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſanctified them, and to the Lamb, by whoſe Sacrifice and Satisfaction Heaven was opened to them. Can a meer man receive the Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs above, and rob the Father of the Praiſe of the Triumphant Saints in Heaven? With what faces will thoſe who deny the Deity of Chriſt, look upon a Redeemer glorified as God and Man in one Perſon, when ſuch a view of him will force their remembrance of denying him in their Minds and Hearts, the Adoration due to him as God, equal with the Father, tho' he humbled himſelf that we might be exalted, and might in Heaven ſee his Glory, and be transform'd into his Glorious Likeneſs? It will be righteous, that thoſe who vilified the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, ſhould not reign with him; and ſince they deny, that he waſht away the guilt of their Sins with his Blood, it's righteous that their guilt ſhould remain on them for ever. He that feels the power of Chriſt ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, will notwithſtanding the ſubtil Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of others, glorifie him as the incarnate Son of God, who purchas'd Grace and Glory for him by his Humiliation, and confers it in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation.</p>
            <p>As for Deiſts, who deny all Reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, their Error is brought for the ſupport of <hi>Socinianiſm;</hi> for in the Scripture there is ſo full a proof of the Eternal Deity of the Son of God, and of the Holy Spirit, which is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49481:124"/>
ſupernatural and incomprehenſible by our narrow minds, that they will rather return to Heatheniſm, than receive the Goſpel: Beſides, the purity and perfection of the Goſpel in its Commands they will not obey, and therefore will only follow the dim light of Nature, that diſcovers not many Sins which they love, nor ſome Duties from which they are averſe.</p>
            <p>You therefore under this Character; Let me invite you to the trial of God's Word, and if you find in your Experience any one thing that was incomprehenſible to natural Reaſon, but ſenſibly felt in your Souls, it will lead you to the deſire and endeavour of Experiencing more. If in Prayer you come to underſtand a ſtrength above your own, even that of a Divine Spirit according to Scripture Revelation thereof, you'll deſire to comprehend many other Chriſtian Priviledges and Changes of the Soul by Grace, of which you never formerly had any true Idea: If once you come in the uſe of means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and truſt things unſeen, which to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Creature is a Myſterious Doctrine, but of Scripture Revelation, and certainly experienc'd as Truth by Holy Souls.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe, O Deiſt, ſhould I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf to argue the caſe of there being a ſpiritual heavenly frame in Prayer, of there being a truſt to a thing unſeen, more ſtrong and durable than a truſt to an object before the Eyes; the one being ſupported by the Divine Truth and Power, the other by a weak mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49481:125"/>
Creature. All the Argumentation and Oratory on Earth cannot make a ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doubt of the Truth of the Goſpel, which he has felt to be the power of God to ſave him from Sin and Hell: A ſuperficial aſſent to the Doctrine of the Goſpel may be eaſily chang'd; but when the Truth of it is fixt in the Soul by deep Experience, a Chriſtian is as ſtable as the Center againſt the ſtrongeſt ſtorms of oppoſition: You may as well ſuppoſe a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul to be without thinking, as when it's convinc'd by over-powering light, and an inward real ſenſe of the Truth of Religion Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd from Heaven, he ſhould be apt to change his Faith, and like a Drunken Man reel from one Opinion to another.</p>
            <p>I therefore earneſtly recommend the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after an Experimental Senſe of the Truth of the Goſpel in the uſe of all Ordinances, as the beſt preſervative from Unbelief.</p>
            <p>But now I come to the third and laſt mean of bringing Creatures into the certainty of God's Word and inward Religion, and that is a right reading of the Scriptures, not a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial reading of them in Obedience to Parents, or out of Cuſtom, a Chapter morning and evening, without ever one thought reflective upon what is read; but ſuch a reading as may lay you in the way of the influence of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, who communicates light unto us in this Duty, as well as in that of ſpiritual Obſervation and Prayer; we muſt fix it in our
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49481:125"/>
thoughts as the Rule of our Life, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly obſerve what may be directive in thoſe Duties that belong to us, and may ſerve for Comfort in diſquieting Afflictions to which we may be expos'd; Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our Reading. This method was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly bleſſed to me in the practice of it with Obſervation and Prayer; I ſoon ſaw the worth of God's Word, the benefit of uſing it in this manner, and my Soul was ardently and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſirous of Divine Grace to conform me entirely to the Precepts and Examples of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſet down in it.</p>
            <p>The method I us'd at firſt, was, To Read a Chapter of the Old Teſtament, a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and a Chapter of the New, with <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon each; and this ſincere endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Knowledge of God in his Precepts, was ſoon accompanied with the inward workings of a Divine Spirit, influencing me with a deſire after, and, in ſome meaſure, Conformity thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>How ſhall a young man cleanſe his ways?</hi> It is <hi>by taking heed thereto accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's Word:</hi> Thoſe that read not his Word, or read it in a cuſtomary way, obtain no knowledge thereof, or at leaſt what is only notional to diſcourſe of; How can a Chriſtian cleanſe his Heart and Ways, or be in the means of obtaining Chriſt's Spirit helping forward this work, but by comparing conſiderately his Ways and Thoughts to God's Divine Truths, as he goes on in the reading of them;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49481:126"/>
and nothing more fixes the Thoughts to this, than a reading with Annotations, and many times in comparing Scripture to Annotation, a compariſon of ones ſelf to Scripture, either for inſtruction, or comfort occurs; reading with Thoughtfulneſs is a mean God many times bleſſes with ſweet ſucceſs that way.</p>
            <p>Reading with reflecting the light of the Word upon the Soul, warms it, meets the Affections, and makes them receptive of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly impreſſions.</p>
            <p>The meer Profeſſor, Religious only from Education, I greatly compaſſionate for this neglect; it being for the ſerious, a probable mean of affording eſtabliſhment in their right notional Knowledge wherewith they have been impreſt, thorough the inſtruction of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and applicative Reading the Scriptures, is the means, with the Spirit's bleſſing, of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing us on that Divine Foundation of Faith and Obedience.</p>
            <p>This Advice of Reading the Scriptures with <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations, is not to be limited to thoſe only in younger years, but neceſſarily to be extended to Perſons of more mature Age.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I adviſe the younger, That they would not reſt ſatisfied to anſwer their Parents Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or in the cuſtomary method of reading
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49481:126"/>
ſo many Chapters a day, and that at their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al times; but to conſider what degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Word, and Conformity to it, they are advanc'd to by it, that by right Conceptions of God and his Holy Will, they be preſerv'd from youthful Luſts, from the Erroneous Opinions and vicious and contagious Examples of others: Let the firſt Principles of Religion in this way, be deeply ſet in them, before they read Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Religion: I do really acknowledge, that from reading a Chapter, with Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations concerning a point, I have had more clear knowledge and confirmation than by reading Controverſial Books; And I do believe it one of the moſt common failures of Youth under Religious Education, not reading the Scriptures with Annotations, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixes the Thoughts upon ones ſelf, and God's Divine Rule, if conform unto it either in Heart or Life.</p>
            <p>Be adviſed therefore, to begin your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Spiritual Things right, and not to end where you ſhould have begun; and to read but one Chapter with Annotations and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, rather than many ſlightly; remarking that part of Scripture your Thoughts at the time of reading moſtly fix to, and obſerve the method of Providence afterward appearing, and perhaps you may diſcover its correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the matter remarkt, either as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or Comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:49481:127"/>Secondly, I adviſe grown Profeſſors, who buſie themſelves with Controverſies, and with Books Eloquently written, or of high Notions, but ſtill are without an affectionate vital knowledge of Divine Truths, and in danger of being infected with this or the other new-ſprung Error: I ſay to ſuch, That I am afraid the advice given to younger Perſons has not been follow'd by them; I therefore earneſtly exhort them to read the Scriptures with a deſign to be enlightned and ſanctified by them, and with the aſſiſtance of a ſound Expoſitor, that their imperfect and unſetled Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Divine Things may be rectified, and ſtrongly impreſt within them, and the power of them may be viſible in their lives.</p>
            <p>If you cannot enjoy full meaſure of time once a day, do it by parts. Many ſit in their Shops waiting for their Cuſtomers, and Reading of Books of no value, or thinking upon what they can give no account of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that have great opportunity of uſing this method: Many might detract from their great time ſpent in Dreſſings and Viſitings, and thereby might have more leiſure for this profitable and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounding work: I am hopeful, if this method was once in uſe, there might be an excellent foundation laid for your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God the Lawgiver, and of your own Loyalty and Duty to him in Heart and Life.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49481:127"/>
The delight the Soul would taſte in Reading the Word, would cauſe us to diſreliſh all other Books, tho' never ſo pleaſing to the carnal Fancy and Deſires that govern the unrenewed part of Mankind. I have often thought upon the fancy ſo delighted with variety, and have pitied ſome ſuch who would be taken with every new thing, but did not Experimentally know the varieties of things in the Scriptures greatly alluring, worth the reading and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating, and the varieties of impreſſions affecting the mind in reading the ſame Scripture at various times.</p>
            <p>But I have obſerv'd, the better the Duty is, the more inſtruction and comfort abound therein, inward corruption and Satan keeps the Soul the more backward from it: And let any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing Chriſtian reflect upon the days of their Ignorance, and the Beginnings of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Knowledge, they'll find, When Hearing and Prayer has been practiſed by them, yet ſerious Reading was greatly neglected, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with an Expoſitor: A Duty eſtabliſhing and comforting a Chriſtian, is the Duty Satan loſes moſt by; to Read matter indifferent, overcomes neither Satan nor Corruption, but Scripture-Revelation diſcovers both in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Colours, and a way to eſcape the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of either. I remember the neglect of Reading the Scripture while only under the power of Religious Education, kept me in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49481:128"/>
darkneſs and ſecurity for not bringing the falſe hopes of the goodneſs of my ſpiritual State to the Touch; I preſum'd that I was in a ſafe condition, but by ſerious Reading the Scripture I had a true diſcovery of God and my ſelf, and I delighted in the diſcovery and the bleſſed means of it: That which before was ſo unpleaſant to the corrupt Nature, was ſweeter than the Honey-Comb; This is the uſual Reward that is joyn'd with our Obedience to the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Of ſearching the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am afraid the neglect of this Duty keeps not only prophane and meer profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from a change to a ſtate of real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but even real Chriſtians in a careleſs neglect of their Converſations; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reading a Chapter in the morning would ſo fix the matter upon the Chriſtian's Thoughts, that now and then he would be reflecting, whether he has ſtept aſide from Conformity to what he had Read in the morning, and would make him watchful againſt Temptations that ſurrounded him, leſt he be ſurpriſed by them. How ſad is the careleſneſs even of real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, with reſpect to the inward frame of their Souls, and their outward Converſation, which I do believe may in ſome meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the neglect, or at leaſt the unſerious performance of this Duty, and the not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that God ſees them in their Companies, in their Families, in their Cloſets, and in their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49481:128"/>
Hearts, and their neglect of ſerious yielding themſelves to the conduct of the Holy Spirit thorough the day? I remember a paſſage I heard of a Miniſter, who had neglected his ſerious morning-Prayer before his going forth upon that Sacred Work of Preaching; and after Reading his Text, was ſtopt, that he could go on no further, and another was forc'd to ſupply in his room; and upon review, found that his neglect of Praying for Divine Aſſiſtance, and dependance upon it, was the cauſe why he was ſo deſerted. If Chriſtians were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have their morning Duties ſtrictly perform'd, their Converſations would be ſtrict and ſpiritual thorough the day, they would not diſparage their Profeſſion, and diſhonour God by ſo many blemiſhes in their Actions; they would not ſo harden the prophane and meer titular Chriſtians in their ſinful ſtate; whereas Prayer joyn'd with the Reading the Word in the morning, is a bleſſed means to maintain our Communion with God in all the buſineſs and lawful refreſhments of the day.</p>
            <p>If innocent Recreations, by fixing our thoughts upon them, or by reaſon of the length of time we are in them, leſſen our ſeriouſneſs, we ſhould be leſs frequent and ſhorter in them; let the Converſation be never ſo innocent, and the Company never ſo dear, they muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of communion with Heaven, we muſt ſo uſe the world as we may enjoy God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49481:129"/>
viſiting of Friends a Duty, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but prolonged to a day, or an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, meddling in others affairs, cenſuring ſome, and commending others, perhaps without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is grieving to a ſpiritual-minded Chriſtian, unleſs where he may either do or receive ſome ſpiritual good. The ſerious exerciſe of our minds upon ſpiritual things, and diſcourſe of them, preſerves the ſacred fire burning in our breaſts. Spiritual Converſation is as rare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians as it's profitable; it's the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Heaven, and reduces friendſhip to the ſtate of Paradiſe: But we are ſo ſadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, that unleſs he is a perſon of eminent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and gravity that interpoſes divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in Converſation, it's entertained very coldly, or with contempt and deriſion.</p>
            <p>As to Recreations doubtful amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, playing at Cards, and the like, whether lawful or unlawful, I think it is beſt to keep the judgment free from entangling Scruples, but to reſtrain our practice, and accordingly I deſire to order my Converſation, and that for theſe three Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſince nothing in Chriſt's Commands or Example, or of the Apoſtles, is expreſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I judge it beſt to regulate my practice by the example of the moſt holy and heavenly Chriſtians, who I know have abſtained from Recreations of a ſuſpected nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:49481:129"/>A ſecond Reaſon to me is, That Recreations, though ſeeming innocent, have often been, and are dangerous ſnares to men. How many have reſolved to ſpend an hour in a Recreation, and have ſpent many, to the irreparable loſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time! How many have begun with Pence, and ended with Pounds, to the waſting their Eſtates, and impoveriſhing of Families! The perfect forbearance from ſuch allurements, is our ſecurity and happineſs; and that others who allow themſelves in ſuch things are not overcome, is from reſtraining Grace, and not from corrupt Nature.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe to my own experience ſuch things wither a heavenly ſpiritual frame of Soul, by drawing off the thoughts from ſeriouſneſs, to a little levity, and from leſs to more, till a heavenly frame be gone. The heavenly-minded Chriſtian is the only Judge of this matter, the prophane and meer Profeſſor never having had a heavenly frame, can hardly be ſaid to judge of, or be concern'd for its decay or removal; neither the lazy, though real Chriſtian, who if ſerious in his morning or evening duties, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not the want of a heavenly, ſerious frame of Soul throughout the day in his buſineſs and pleaſures, of the number whereof too many abound in our Age, by reaſon whereof while under afflictions, or in their dying hours, when their evidences ſhould ſhine not only with light
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49481:130"/>
to themſelves, but as witneſſes for God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they appear more dark and clouded than in thoſe whoſe life has been a continued enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. How many real Chriſtians have bitterly lamented their time miſ-ſpent in Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and when near Eternity, have had gloomy thoughts, and diſtracting doubts of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State; when thoſe who have uſed the world with indifferent affections, and have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in working out their ſalvation, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in the Lord. In ſhort, a heavenly frame of Spirit, is the beſt Antidote againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſenſual pleaſures.</p>
            <p>The main Reaſons to preſs Chriſtians ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Converſation in doubtful things, are from pity to the prophane and meer Profeſſor, and to prevent the drying up of ſpiritual ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of frame in real Chriſtians; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, I hope, thorough the exerciſe of Grace, may limit their pleaſures and diverſions from being inductive of Sin: but the carnal are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their profuſe waſting time, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging their ſenſual deſires, even by Saints innocent Recreation of themſelves in them, pleading for themſelves by ſuch a Queſtion, Does not ſuch an one do ſo and ſo?</p>
            <p>Miniſters, of all other Chriſtians, ſhould be very diligent to prevent a taking occaſion and encouragement from their example, to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs in things of this kind; they have the beſt opportunity to ſpiritualize Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their People, and improving time
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49481:130"/>
to the moſt excellent advantage; that is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their knowledge, holineſs and comfort. This was the practice of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſo great a Lover of Chriſt and Souls; this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice would refel the double Accuſation of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in our days.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they are ſo much ſeen in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the world, and are ſo little at home converſing with God and themſelves, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with their People, unleſs in outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and without ſpiritual profit to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The other Accuſation, is their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Peoples ſpiritual ſtate, and their more applying themſelves to maintain ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as are the Characters of their Party, than to preach Truths ſuitable to the Caſe of the Congregations. Some Preachers are called Legal, others Evangelical, and according to the different opinions and affections of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, are cenſured or commended; but a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel defames and pollutes his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who does not make it his ſole end to glorify Chriſt, and ſave Souls; and for that end the Law is to be preached, diſcovering the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition of Sinners, that they may come weary and heavy-laden to our compaſſionate Saviour, making him appear the more lovely to their view, that they may with unfeign'd willingneſs walk in thoſe means wherein his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be found, to apply Chriſt with all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits to the needy Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:49481:131"/>I cannot but mention what I have obſerv'd in my ſelf, that upon any ſtirring of corrupt nature, tending to puff me up after enjoy'd communion with God, or leaving a kind of ſecurity in the following Duties, what need I have had of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Law, ſhewing thereby to my ſelf how inſufficient I was to give full obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereto, or to perform any one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aright, unleſs by the continued aſſiſtance of a Divine Spirit to be obtain'd in the uſe of means; and therefore it is Duty to be in the cloſe work of uſing means, and to aſcribe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit obtained therein to the free and powerful Grace of God, and not to any diſpoſitions or ſtrength of our own: Therefore the meditation of Law and Grace muſt be join'd, the firſt leads to the other, and greatly diſcovers the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy thereof; yea, more than that, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated alone, ſhall I ſee the precious excellency of Chriſt, and not ſee my loſt, corrupted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd ſtate? Shall I ſee the need of a Divine Power in working and planting Grace, not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own inſufficiency to act without it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, before the cloſe of the ſame evening, I have been brought under ſuch concern for one failure or other, that the neceſſity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the free-grace of God in Chriſt has convincingly and comfortably by ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection wanted to have been appli'd to my Soul, ſhall therefore one Chriſtian need the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home of both the Law of God and the Free-grace of God in Chriſt in one day, how much
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49481:131"/>
more ſhall a Congregation made up of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whereof ſome are ſecure, and others tender and ſelf-condemning, ſtand in need of Sermons of both ſorts, or of a Sermon made up of both.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the great Duty of Miniſters to be frequent and fervent in their Prayers to God, that by Divine influence they may be directed in the choice of fit Subjects, and aſſiſted in their preparatory Studies, and in their preaching the Word, in demonſtration of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Not with enticing words only of man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that it may be beneficial and ſaving to their Hearers; the neglect of this method may occaſion the choice of an unſuitable Subject, and its delivery to be unſavoury, unleſs to the meer Notional Chriſtian. A Miniſter of eminent Holineſs told me, That Converſe with God in Prayer was his beſt preparation for preaching; and that according to his frame in Prayer in the Lord's-day morning, ſuch was the frame of his heart in preaching. I have my ſelf found, that according to the holy exerciſe of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in my Cloſet-Prayer, ſuch has been my enjoyment of God in publick Ordinances, and eſpecially in receiving the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The Profeſſors of ſerious Religion, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Miniſters, are more in the view of the world, and more obvious to Cenſure, therefore they ſhould be very regular in their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and watchful to prevent reproach upon Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:49481:132"/>If a Divine Spirit once meet you in the uſe of theſe three means, you will find that whereas you have formerly enjoyed the good things of this world without thankful thoughts of the beſtower of them, and of his rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy diſtinguiſhing you from others in a lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and without ſerious conſideration that they are Talents committed to your truſt, to be improved for his honour, and for which a ſtrict account muſt be given; you will, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of God's general and ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, acknowledge him to be the Fountain of all your bleſſings, and depend upon his conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending care of you in the uſe of due means, and employ his benefits for his glory; a ſweet effect of obſervation!</p>
            <p>You that pray'd, becauſe by Parents you were inſtructed, commanded, and had their example to move you to it, will find that now you pray in obedience to God's Command, as the bleſſed mean of acquaintance and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him; and that if you expreſs your ſelf with never ſo free and learned utterance, you are uneaſy, unleſs the frame of your minds has been ſerious, and your affections heavenly and ſpiritual; and you have ſome hope that he is pleaſed with your performance, and has evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced his acceptance. There are not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are not at the pains to uſe means to come to ſuch a comfortable knowledge, but who will hardly obſerve whether ever they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49481:132"/>
enjoyed the return of ſuch a Prayer, unleſs the return has come in ſoon after, or in ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable way, that they could not but ſee it was a return to that Prayer, by reaſon of which negligence God is ſometimes pleaſed to defer a deſired return; but at laſt, in compaſſion to his Children, gives a remarkable Anſwer that deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affects them, and is for their great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>You that read the Scriptures, becauſe your Parents led you into the road of a Chapter morning or evening, or for the hiſtorical part thereof, or to be knowing in the Notion of it for Converſation, now find that your uſe of it is a mean for the right knowledge of God, the comprehenſion of his Divine Truths, and as a Directory to your life, and as a help to your evidences, in comparing your life to it, and as a preſervative from infectious Errors.</p>
            <p>You that heard Sermons, and appear'd ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous all the while for fear of Reproach, or to obtain a good Name, without any thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the matter diſcours'd, unleſs to paſs a judgment of the ingeniouſneſs or dulneſs of the Preacher, and to entertain Company with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the matter or manner of his Preaching, find now ſuch an inward change, that every Sermon is tranſmitted to your hearts thorough your ear, producing a Reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and a comparing it with your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49481:133"/>
I think nothing can be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than in hearing a Miniſter, or in reading a Chapter, to be able to ſeal the truth of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our experience. Inſtead of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the words of a Sermon as to the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, you now mind the matter it ſelf, not ſo much if learnedly manag'd, as to conſider whether you have experienced its Truths, which will he a comfortable evidence to the Soul; or if you have not felt its efficacy, it will excite earneſt Prayer to God that he would make the inſtruction powerful in you.</p>
            <p>O how reproving is this of the Prophane, who ſlight the conſtant attending to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, it being unknown to them when and how God may work by it upon their hearts, the neglect of a Sermon may be the loſs of an eternal Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>You that before converſt about Religion in the Letter and Notion, ſpeak now your own experience; You that aim'd at Reputation for your knowledge in Divine Things, now deſign Honour to God, and the Confirmation of the reality of revealed Religion; You that aimed at worldly Intereſt, now you aim at the enlarging of Chriſt's Kingdom; where greateſt S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You that before ript open the Faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either from a corrupt Principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, inherent in the very nature of ſome more than others, or from a deſire of raiſing your Reputation by the depreſſing others, you'll compaſſionately bear with the infirmities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, knowing your own frailty.</p>
            <p>You, who before affected only ſuch Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors as were of your own Opinion, will now extend your Charity to all who believe the great Truths of the Goſpel, and live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>Can the World imagine otherwiſe, but that thoſe who preſs hard after ſtrictneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, by avoiding all liberty that may be an occaſion to Sin, have not the ſame natural corrupted Inclinations and Principles as others, but they are cleanſed and changed by power from above. A rational Principle, produces a rational Action. A ſenſitive Principle, produces a ſenſitive Action. A corrupted Principle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a corrupted Action. A gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, produces a gracious Action; according therefore to the dominion of the inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49481:134"/>
ſo the outward Action is, or at leaſt the Inclination towards it. The Soul formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Principle of Sin was enclin'd to ſin; and upon the occurrence of any Object to ſet this a moving, the Soul was acted; but now under the dominion of a Principle of Grace upon the occurrence of any good Object, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Inclination is active, and with greater pleaſure, than under the power of the carnal Principle. Prophane perſons, and ſtrangers to the life of God, are utterly miſtaken to think that the Actions of the ſpiritual life are not mixt with the ſweeteſt and moſt ſatisfying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The outward Acts of Religion, if they are not produced from a Principle of Life, are without reliſh, and toilſom to the carnal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lowing from an inward and real Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, they are productive of the moſt ſolid and pureſt pleaſure in the preſent exerciſe, and in the joyful reflection, and are the beginnings of heavenly fruition.</p>
            <p>I have thought, that to repreſent this with the greateſt illuſtration, is of no force with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a method propoſed to bring it to men's Experience; that Proverb reigning amongſt prophane and meer Profeſſors, That <hi>ſeeing is believing;</hi> let therefore feeling in the Soul be believing: The days have been, when in all the outward parts of God's Worſhip I have made a ſpecious ſhow, but from no other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than that of Education, being altogether
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49481:134"/>
ignorant of any inward Comfort in Duties, and without longing after it, imagining it to be more talkt of than really enjoy'd; This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have been my caſe alone, but I dare ſay, the caſe of many profeſſing Chriſtians who have had Religious Education; and therefore my method has been, not only to ſhow the evidences of a Change, but the ſteps of God's way thereto, and the few eaſie means made uſe of by my ſelf, and ſucceſsfully bleſſed by the Divine Spirit: And if this be not the fruit of my labour, to bring you to the uſe of theſe means, that you may lay your ſelf in the way of receiving Divine Influences, my Experience will make but ſmall impreſſion; but if the Lord accompany your ſincere endeavour in theſe few means, believe me, the internal ſweetneſs of inward Religion, of fellowſhip with God in Prayer, of Reading the Scriptures with improvement, of obſerving God's Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, with Reliance upon him for all things, will ſo affect you, that you will need no other motive to perſevere in the uſe of means, and you will abſtain from all carnal Diverſions that alienate the Heart from Communion with God. The preſerving a ſpiritual frame in the Soul every day keeps us watchful, leſt Temptations ſhould break in, and Corruptions break out. This affords us a foretaſte of Heaven, and an aſſurance of it; who can doubt of the Hell that is reveal'd in Scripture, who feels the tormenting fire of guilt, and extends his Fears
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49481:135"/>
to Eternity? Theſe are the beginnings of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Who can doubt of the Heaven reveal'd in the Goſpel, who has felt in his Soul a Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and glorious, and differing from the Joy in Heaven only in the degree, and the manner of Divine Fruition?</p>
            <p>I do believe, the Conceptions of prophane ſtupid Sinners, concerning ſpiritual Comfort in the Soul, and concerning inward Agonies for Sin, are as doubtful as they are of the reality of Heaven and Hell in the future State. Oh! Therefore let not Chriſtians be diſcouraged by the Atheiſm, the Infidelity, and Wickedneſs of this Age, but let them pray and labour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more full experimental ſenſe of things reveal'd by the Word of God, which will be a powerful preſervative from the Errors and Vices of the infectious World, and will make them admire Divine Grace that diſtinguiſhes them from others, and will make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate thoſe who are careleſs of things that concern their precious and immortal Souls: And to preſerve a ſpiritual frame in its liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vigour, let thoſe be our choſen and intimate Friends in whom the Image of God ſhines, who partake of a Divine Nature that declares it ſelf in ſpiritual Communion, where we may be confirm'd and comforted in the ſerious practice of Godlineſs, and prepared for the Joy that flows from the Divine preſence above, to the bleſſed Celeſtial Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:49481:135"/>Beſides theſe three means, of right Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, right Prayer, and right Reading of the Scriptures, there are other means of God's own appointment; ſuch as the Hearing of God's Word, the Participation of the Lord's Supper, and Communion with Saints; but I have confin'd my ſelf to theſe three upon the following Accounts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe Obſervation was the means of my own ſenſible Converſion, and the other two the ſpecial means of further growth in Grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By reaſon of the Chriſtian's ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the right and continued performance of the other means, when excited and allured by the Enjoyments that attend the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe three.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That my invitation to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and meer profeſſing Chriſtian may meet the ſooner with ſucceſsful acceptance, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the difficulty, and of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of real Chriſtianity, as if it were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with natural pleaſant enjoyments, frights many from the acceptance of the Goſpel, and Obedience to it; the falſhood whereof I have endeavoured to ſhew, in that ſpiritual Religion allows a modeſt temperate uſe of ſenſitive Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and Religion when ſeriouſly practiſed,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49481:136"/>
ſweetens thoſe Duties which to Carnaliſts are ſo uneaſie; for when the Soul is cleans'd from ſinful Affections, and chang'd into the Divine likeneſs, the ſuitableneſs between the Duties of Religion and the Soul, cauſes the pureſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Since our Redeemer had reconciled God by his Meritorious Sufferings and Mediation, and has obtain'd ſuch precious privileges for all that will accept of him, our preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and future Glory, Holineſs and Happineſs in perfection; How can reaſonable Creatures neglect the great Salvation ſo dearly bought, and ſo freely offered to them in the uſe of ſo eaſie and few means? Methinks we ſhould hear convinc'd and alarm'd Sinners cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> and apply themſelves to the Redeemer, to obtain ſpiritual and eternal Life by him: The Pearl of Price is offered to all that ſincerely accept of it.</p>
            <p>To preſs the Duties of Chriſtianity upon a prophane and meer profeſſing Chriſtian, is as if Food was offered to a Dead Body to receive and digeſt, as if the carrying of heavy Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were recommended in exchange with an eaſie, quiet, and pleaſant courſe of life. The prophane Creature is Dead in Sin; though his Ear be open as the effect of natural Life, yet his Soul is ſhut from the reception of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Truths, as the effect of a ſpiritual Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:49481:136"/>Now to ſhut up all, I'll give you my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Exhortation, with ſome Reflections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, reſpecting the foregoing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>Be exhorted therefore, O prophane, meer profeſſor and careleſs Chriſtian, to walk in the uſe of the three means mention'd, and take an eſtimate of your performance, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs of your obſerving the paſſages of Providence, from the ſpirituality of your Prayer, ſolemn or ejaculatory, from the ſtrictneſs of your conformity to God's Word, the Rule of Obedience, and you will obtain the firſt life of Grace, and an experimental encreaſe of Holineſs and Joy.</p>
            <p>The world is blinded and ſecure, from Luſts that darken the Mind, and from tempting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the world that divert from the ſerious thoughts of the righteous God, who is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt Rebellious Sinners: Now the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of viſible Vengeance that often falls upon the wicked, will ſtrike men with the fear of God, which is the firſt motive to fly to his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Or men are blinded and ſecure upon the account of external profeſſion and outward performance of Chriſtian Duties, and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Knowledge of the Goſpel. The remedy of this deſtructive deluſion, is the frequent
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49481:137"/>
and ſerious addreſſing to God by Prayer, to obtain a living principle of Holineſs that will be permanent and powerful in the Soul.</p>
            <p>There are real Chriſtians, who by neglect of their Duty, decline from God, and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Profeſſion; Let ſuch be excited to a conſtant and ſerious uſe of thoſe means whereby Grace is convey'd into our Souls. If they will obſerve God in all his ways more ſtrictly, and pray more frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, and read and hear the Word with more application, they will feel the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs reviving in their Souls, and will ſhew forth the beauty of Holineſs in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which will be convincing of others, that Religion is a Divine diſpoſition produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of fruits ſuitable to it; A holy habit of Soul may be preſerv'd in the buſineſs and diverſions of the world, by our conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Heaven every day.</p>
            <p>You have two excellent motives to this Exhortation:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it may be done without any hindrance to your buſineſs and lawful diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: How eaſie is it in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you enter into worldly Affairs, to read a Chapter with <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations, and to give your ſelves and all your concerns by Prayer to the conduct of a Divine Hand to direct and ſucceed your lawful Endeavours? How eaſie is
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49481:137"/>
it thorough the day, while in the midſt and courſe of your lawful buſineſs, to direct an ejaculatory deſire, Lord, Let my endeavour be according to Duty on my part, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a diſcovery of Mercy in the Event; and according to the many endeavours you are active in throughout a day, ſo many Ejaculatory Petitions in a ſerious frame to be repeated, which you'll obſerve to iſſue in great inward Knowledge, and perhaps great ſucceſs to buſineſs, as an occaſion of turning your many and various Ejaculatory Petitions to one ſolemn Duty of Praiſe in the evening.</p>
            <p>How eaſy is it in an evening in your Shops or Cloſets to record, that in ſuch an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you were kept ſerious with God in your thoughts, and you were bleſt accordingly! The remembrance whereof will make you ready in all your Affairs to pray for the Divine Bleſſing, and depend upon God in doing your Duty, and thankful for his ſucceeding your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, That this conſtant looking to God in Prayer ejaculatory or ſolemn, with the uſe of means, will enable us to perform the works of our ordinary Callings with leſs trouble to our Mind, and toil to our Bodies: This will cure the anxiety of our Minds concerning the Event, and conſequently make us more moderate and orderly in the uſe of means. It is the anxious deſire of obtaining an Event, the great fear of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, that ſets peoples minds on the rack to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive means, and their Bodies on the hurry to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49481:138"/>
uſe theſe means, and how often does unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs accompany both? Whereas by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of God, the Governor of all things, acceſs to him for his favour in any thing is diſcovered to the Soul, and that the dutiful uſe of means is ſucceſsful by his favour, when the eager purſuit of a deſir'd thing has been ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. This has been verified to all by many Experiences, and therefore ſhall add this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as the ſum of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To uſe means with the ſame diligence, as if by them alone, without a Divine Hand, Events were to be obtain'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To eye God with a reliance upon him for Events, as much as if they were to be brought forth by him without the uſe of means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which Rule I would reprove the Cenſures againſt God's Children, who from their dutiful diligence in buſineſs, without the intermixture of pleaſure in fear of loſing providential opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it, are reputed Covetous; And adviſe others to judge themſelves by their inward aims, if conform to God's Will; and whatever be the Cenſure of Men, they thereby prevent the condemning ſentence of Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Judge. It is neither the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter or Cenſure of any, that ought to bound our Endeavours, but the being in Duty or out of Duty, and the regarding of the Lord in all our ways.</p>
            <div type="reflections">
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:49481:138"/>
               <head>Reflections that muſt naturally follow the peruſal of what is written.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT the Author having felt ſuch Experience of an inward change upon his Soul, without any other hand of his own therein, than the uſe of the means above recited, Ought I not to believe there is a Knowledge above human Judgment, and a power above natural Strength? for otherwiſe he had continued in the ſame ignorance of God, then appearing ſufficient knowledge, wherein he was involv'd for many years, tho' enjoying the outward diſpenſation of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it was but ſuitable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Affection in him to endeavour that others may tread in the ſame ſteps with the ſame ſucceſs, eſpecially finding ſome Miniſters in their Sermons to run from plainneſs and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to Rhetorick and Notion, and finding the care of Chriſtians more to run out upon arguing the Notions of Religion, than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Divine Truths, and the eſtabliſhing the Minds of others by the Seals of their own Experience: If experimental Religion was more Taught in Sermons, and Diſcourſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, the performance of Holy Duties wherein it's obtain'd, would not be thought a meer fancy, and the light and beauty of Grace would more ſhine in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:49481:139"/>A <hi>Third</hi> Meditation enſuing upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, may be, Whether you have not ſome longings after the ſame eſtabliſhing Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? If you have, theſe longings may be kindled by the conſideration of their being attainable. I was once ſo carnal as only to look to things ſeen, and thought the Reliance upon an unſeen Superiour power to be a vain imagination; but God in his excellent Mercy has convinc'd me beyond all doubt of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Providence, that diſpoſes of Events for the good of thoſe who wait upon him; and the ſame goodneſs will be extended to all that ſincerely ſeek his face for ever.</p>
               <p>We muſt regard the Word as our Rule, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as our Guide, to direct us by that Rule, and the Diſpenſations of Providence correſpondent to that Rule, and we ſhall be preſerv'd from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical neglect of God, and from the fancies and phrenſies of thoſe who pretend to Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from above, and from doing thoſe things which are directly and ſcandalouſly contrary to the reveal'd Will of God. O that Chriſtians would earneſtly pray for the Holy Spirit, that by his directing-light they may underſtand the Scriptures; and by his warm impreſſing them on their Hearts, they may feel their cleanſing and comforting power; but truly, Chriſtians in our day are not much concerned to mind and try the work of God in their own Souls, nor ſeek after knowledge of him by his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in others. The Obſervations of our ſelves, and the Communion of Saints, are rare
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49481:139"/>
Duties: We live at a diſtance from our ſelves; and in converſe with others, the ſubject of our diſcourſe is the preſent World, or Notional Religion, which occaſions Diſſention and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; whereas the mutual communicating of Chriſtians to one another what God has done for their Souls, and how variouſly according to their wants, their deſires, their ſorrows and fears, he has attempered his Diſpenſations, would be an excellent means to raiſe their admiration of his condeſcending and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Goodneſs, and of his Wiſdom, and eſtabliſh their joyful truſt in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If you have any longing, and find it attainable, can you have eaſier means? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Religion affords no Leſſon for emaciating your Bodies with outward Faſtings, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a rational and moderate ſupport of our Bodies, ſitting them the more for ſerving God. We are not enjoyn'd to be Pilgrims, and to take weariſom Journies as a Penance for Sin; Chriſtian Society and Communion will make us more watchful againſt Sin. The Goſpel does not enjoyn ſeverity and niceties in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Converſation, which rather diſcourages than invites thoſe who are without; but allows a civil ſweetneſs to all; but there are Seaſons of Retirement and Recollection from the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſures of the World, which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to improve for more immediate Fellowſhip with God. There are choſen hours, wherein the Soul aſcends to God by ſolemn
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49481:140"/>
Thoughts and ardent Deſires, and God deſcends into the ſoul by the Excitations of his Graces, and the Influences of Joy; and it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to think Religion to be ſowre and unpleaſant, becauſe wiſe and holy Chriſtians prefer God before the Creature, and Heaven before the Earth. Begin therefore, and go on in the right way, with ſteady Reſolutions not to ſtand ſtill, or draw back, and you will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Strength and Comfort afforded, you will be advancing every day in your Journey, till you arrive at the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Reflect not only upon the eaſineſs of your means, but alſo upon the certainty and comfort of obtaining your end of Holineſs here, and Happineſs hereafter by them. How are you able to ſpend your ſpirits upon Notions that have no other foundation than depraved Reaſon, and little other deſign than Self-Applauſe, and the Character of Learned, or Leader of ſuch a Party? Let it be the great Work of Miniſters to preach thoſe Truths whereby we may have Communion with the Lord crucified here, and with him glorified hereafter; and thereby the Souls of the people will be confirmed in the bleſſed hope.</p>
               <p>God has given an account of his Truths to be believed and obeyed, yea, to be try'd; and the more ſtrict and particular the Enquiry is, the more certain of our Profeſſion here, and of our Priviledge hereafter. It is ſuperficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Religion, that occaſions uncertainty in our ſelves; but an inward ſerious ſenſe of its
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49481:140"/>
Power, will fortify us againſt all the fiery Darts of Satan.</p>
               <p>Be at certainty therefore of your Perſuaſion here; and as to your Inheritance hereafter, I ſhall add this, Who that ſincerely and with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance pray'd for the Spirit of Truth, that read and heard the Word with attention and application, yet has remained in darkneſs and diſtracting doubts about eternal things, God will make good his Promiſe, Thoſe that ſeek him ſhall praiſe him for the Revelation of his Goodneſs to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let this be the Reflection of the Reader of theſe Papers; What Excuſe at Chriſt's Tribunal can I make, either for the ignorance of my mind as to the Truth of Chriſtianity, or the looſeneſs of Converſation from God's Divine Rule, after reading the great things in the Change of this Author's Soul; the few and eaſy means that led him to it? Can you think any thing elſe, but as it witneſſes for God on earth, ſo it will witneſs againſt you above, and aggravate your Sin and Puniſhment? Light came into the world; others compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it, walk'd in it; the Light that truly might obtain the Inheritance of the Saints in light; but you choſe rather to walk in darkneſs. If you now think it not worth your while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the means of obtaining ſuch a Pearl of Price, as the true knowledge of Chriſtianity, and its Practice on earth, and perfect Holineſs and Happineſs above, the reward of it, you may walk on under a Cloud of Deluſion, but
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49481:141"/>
you will find, that inward Darkneſs will bring you to outer Darkneſs, in an everlaſting Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Let therefore your Meditations iſſue here; I will in the ſtrength of God begin the uſe of theſe Three Means, according to the Preſcription of this Witneſs for God; and I will try whether I find the ſame Experiences, or others as marvellous, or more ſuited to my Caſe, it being poſſible for me to uſe theſe three means, when hearing the Word, taking the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and communion with Saints are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd me, yea, eaſy and pleaſant, to admix them in all my buſineſs and pleaſures.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="directory">
               <head>To encourage which Reſolution, I ſhall ſubjoin the following Directory as a means of keeping up conſtant fellowſhip with God, and your ſelves; and as a Bulwark againſt the Prophanity and Error of the Age.</head>
               <p>LET me previouſly bring to your thoughts what has been already treated of, to wit, three Methods of God's conducting his Children thorough this lower life, The conduct of his revealed Will in the Scriptures, Of his divine Providence without, And of his divine Spirit by his workings in the Soul; anſwerable to which three Methods of condeſcending power and love, three Duties have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as means to be intereſted in this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold divine bleſſing; Obſervation of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Providences, as a help to know and to believe in his general and ſpecial Providence round the created and adopted ſons of God;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49481:141"/>
ſerious Prayer as a help to know, to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the certainty of the ſpiritual operations of a divine ſpirit in the ſoul; Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations, a help to know notionally God's Will, and experimentally to know it as Truth made out in his way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and inward workings in the ſoul. As neceſſary therefore to guide you to the right and continued uſe of theſe three eaſy Duties intereſting the ſoul in theſe three marvellous bleſſings for which the Godhead will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, lov'd and prais'd in our eternal ſtate, I give you my own courſe thorough a day as what has kept my ſelf in conſtant heavenlineſs of frame, and afforded me the aſtoniſhing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of Grace, and that with ſo great eaſe to lawful buſineſs and diverſions. Your knowing my hurrying affairs, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Grace I have experiene'd and given forth now to the world, would be ſufficiently convincing how eaſy and how comfortable (no ways detracting from diligence in buſineſs, or lawful recreations) this bleſſed life of Religion is; and ſince I am not to be known, I deſire to impart the way I walk in for your imitation, and ſoon you'll be convinc'd of the reality and ſweetneſs of inward Chriſtianity, however the meer profeſſion thereof expoſe it to the Cenſure of others as burden, melancholy, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Day is to be divided in three parts; the Morning, the Courſe of the Day, and the Evening: The Evening I appropriate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to the exerciſe of that Noble Faculty of

the Soul, Even-Reflection; the two former parts principally to Apprehenſion and Obſervation.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, After awaking, or in the time of dreſſing, obſerve the frame of your Souls, whether ſerious, or not; whether it ſeems to be the bent of your mind to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and your Duties to him, or whether there wants a force upon your ſoul thereto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, After dreſſing, begin your Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duties with reading a Pſalm or a Chapter, by <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annotations; obſerve the Words and Sentences thereof, that impreſs your minds moſt, with ſerious advertency to them; obſerve the thoughts that thence ariſe at the time; if tending to explain what formerly you were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of; if tending to eſtabliſh you in what formerly you had the knowledge of; if tending to make you reſolve you'll conform to it; or if tending to comfort you, as having walk'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to it, and thereby diſcovering your ſelf in the reading ſuch a Portion of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Enter upon private Prayer with a ſerious Acknowledgment of God's Favour in conducting you through the Night; and with a ſincere Supplication to him for his conduct thro' the Day, by his ſpecial Providence and Spirit; that from the evidence of both thorough the Day, you may diſcover his ſpecial Favour to your ſouls as a comfortable evening Cordial; and that by his ſupplies of Grace throughout the day, you may be enabled to bring forth the bleſſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of both, by the exerciſe of Truſt in, and Love to the Godhead, for life and ſalvation.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49481:142"/>
Obſerve your frame of ſoul throughout this Prayer; obſerve if it continue in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſeriouſneſs throughout the whole, or vary according to the various Petitions put up: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and record the different Frames and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Petitions.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Occaſions of your Entrance into it, whether Idleneſs, Luſt within, Neceſſity, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Frame of your Mind while in it, whether on your watch againſt the evils thereof.</p>
               <p>And 3. The Iſſue of it, whether freedom from, or commiſſion of Sins.</p>
               <p>But now in the evening of the day, Reflection according to the Obſervation and Record of the day, is the Duty preceding your laſt Cloſet Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to be recommended to your practice.</p>
               <p>Perform it in the following Parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Reflect upon the frame of your Souls that you obſerv'd in the morning, whether by the Duties of Reading and Prayer, it was not brought to a ſeriouſneſs, if obſerv'd to be unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; or to a greater ſeriouſneſs than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſeriouſneſs at firſt obſerv'd, yea perhaps to great Heavenlineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:49481:143"/>The improvement whereof muſt needs be, that it is good to draw near to God in the Duties he has preſcrib'd, and a fix'd reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to walk therein, and perhaps daily conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance may bring in daily additions of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of Grace, and preſerve the Chriſtian in daily heavenlineſs of Soul, as Bulwark againſt all the Temptations of the day, with Honour to God, and great inward Peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Reflect upon the paſſages of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence round you through the day; and,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, compare them to the parts of the Scripture you read in the morning, and to the Thoughts that then moſt impreſt your Minds, to ſee whether or not theſe paſſages of Divine Providence afford you ſome diſcovery of the reality of that part of the Scripture thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, eſtabliſhing your Faith in it.</p>
               <p>The improvement whereof muſt needs be a reſolution to go on in the ſame Duty of reading the Scripture in the morning before the entring upon the buſineſs of the day, and perhaps there will ariſe to your ſenſible Experience, greater knowledge of God's Word than ever yet has been obſerv'd by you in the enjoyment of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Inſtruction; yea, ſuch eſtabliſhment to its truth and reality, as could not be brought forth by the ſtrongeſt arguings of the moſt Learn'd, and into which the ſtrongeſt Dart of Erroneous Sophiſtry can never pierce; enabling your Soul not only to ſee the Reality, but even Harmony of God's Word to his Providence and Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:49481:143"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Compare the Providences of the Day, to your Morning-Duty of Cloſet-Prayer, to the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions therein put up, and to the frame of Soul you were then under, that you may diſcover what Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Providence ſeem to be afforded you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Prayer, and what Frame your Soul was in, and what was your Utterance in that Prayer, or part thereof, that was return'd.</p>
               <p>The improvement whereof muſt needs be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Certainty of Acceſs to God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a Deſire to be always in that Frame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you was, when you pray'd that Prayer that is ſo viſibly return'd. It will help you to ſee a difference between one kind of Prayer and another; between a Prayer with our own Spirit, and with the Spirit of Chriſt; between a Prayer with the Spirit of Chriſt enabling to ask ſincerely, and a Prayer with the Spirit of Chriſt, giving the Soul the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe of it as ſuch; and diſcovering the Reality of a Divine Strength above our ſelves, both bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Providences of the day to us, and bringing forth the improvement thereof in us, by a gradual advancement of relyance upon, and love to the free Grace of God in Chriſt, by whoſe ſatisfaction this once-ſeal'd Fountain is open'd, and by whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit its Waters of Spiritual Life continually flow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and in the uſe of Duties apply'd to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Reflect upon your own way of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Buſineſs and Converſation with others; that ſo you may not only diſcover a ſpecial Providence round you, but the actings of a Divine Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you; and that by comparing,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Your Frame of Soul, to the Paſſages of Providence laying Undertakings in your way, through the day; reflecting whether God was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in bringing them about, as a diſcovery of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49481:144"/>
Divine Strength in you, carrying your obſervation beyond the enjoyment, even to God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By comparing your Frame of Soul, to your method of uſing Means, and managing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours thus providentially laid in your way; not only whether God was regarded therein, laying Providences in your way, or helping you to obſerve him; but whether your concern run out chiefly upon doing Duty, neither deſigning ill ends, nor endeavouring to bring about any purpoſe in the uſe of ill means, but regarding Duty to him in all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Compare your Frame of Soul to the Events of ſuch Undertakings thus providentially laid in your way, and thus faithfully managed by you; if they are according to expectation, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than expectation: Reflect whether exerciſe of the Grace of Love and Faith were not and ought not to be brought forth by ſuch a Diſcovery, and a fix'd reſolution to keep on in the ſame lawful uſe of means, with a truſt to Divine Supply for Events; as full evidence of the working of Chriſt's Spirit in your Soul, and of your being under his Spiritual Conduct.</p>
               <p>In Converſation with others,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reflect upon your Entrance to it; whether its occaſions were Neceſſity and innocent Recreation; with a previous Addreſs for Divine Conduct in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reflect upon your Carriage in it, thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the Temptations you met with therein, and the Strength you had to reſiſt them; and that in anſwer to your Ejaculatory Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reflect upon the Iſſue; whether it was freedom from being overcome by its Temptations, and that in return to ejaculated Thoughts for Divine Strength to preſerve you, before entrance in it, or at the time you were engaged with it.</p>
               <p>The Improvement of which Reflections muſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49481:144"/>
needs be, A Reſolution to enter no Society, but when under the conſtraint of lawful Buſineſs, or Recreation; and even then, with an eye to God in the uſe of Ejaculatory Prayer, either aforehand, or while in Converſation, for Strength to reſiſt Temptations that may either endanger occaſions to ſin, or of loſing a ſpiritual Frame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Reflect upon the Failures of the Day, and what you have let paſs unobſerv'd; what Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures in your Buſineſs and Converſation have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd: If the eye of God has been as much regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the eye of the World: If the opportunity of Secreſy has not clouded your fear of God: If you have kept your Tongues with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Bridle, from Lying in telling Stories to divert Companions, or as Excuſes for Faults: From Self-commendation, with an inward deſign to diſparage others: From cenſuring others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Chriſtians, and picking out ſomewhat in their life to make a diſcourſe of to diſparage their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, rather than endeavour their amendment by acquainting themſelves therewith. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in your Reflection you find has been amiſs herein, let particular acknowledgment be made, that with the Pſalmiſt, you may thereby eſcape the puniſhment of your particular Sins, and vow, not to repeat it, and tho repeated by you, forbear not your Reſolutions and Endeavours againſt it; your unwilling breaches reflected upon, will bring you ſoon out of your ſelves to a Redeemer, and to cry for his Spirit to apply ſtrength to your Souls to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>In reflection upon the paſſages of Providence through the day, and upon the ſtrength conveyed by a Divine Spirit to your Souls, evident not only by your ſpiritual Frame in the Duties of the day, but in the Improvement of its Providences, by eying God in bringing them about, by regarding his Will
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49481:145"/>
in the uſe of Means, and truſting to him for Events, with a conſtant watch to ejaculatory Prayer againſt the Temptations of Company; In reflection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariſes a fair and comfortable diſcovery of your being under three bleſſed Conducts, of God's Word, Providence, and Spirit, and is laid before you as your laſt Evening-duty, (e're your head lies down upon your Pillow) a private Prayer, bleſſing God for the diſcovery of his Love in his Word, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Spirit, bleſſing him particularly for each particular ſtep therein, and begging his further grace to be upheld in thoſe means wherein he is pleaſed to diſcover ſo much of himſelf in ſtrength and comfort to the Soul, above what is attainable by other helps or comforts in this life. Give therefore your ſelves up to God for conduct thorough the night, that if your eyes ſhould never open more upon this earth, your Redeemer may find you laid at his Footſtool as the laſt performance of your life, and may raiſe you up to that glorious dignity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing embraced into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom; a bleſſed iſſue to ſuch comfortable endeavours! And however te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious this Directory may ſeem in its reading, yet I dare witneſs to this truth, that the perſon in the greateſt hurries of outward Affairs, has time enough for this eaſy work, it being eaſily to be intermixt in the throng of Affairs; and the more Affairs are laid in your way, the greater opportunity you have to obſerve God's Providence and his Spirit, and that built upon his bleſſed Word, as a Mean of keeping up the ſenſe of God's Love in your Souls, and the ſenſe of your love to him; that ſo Communion with God may be your Life on earth, which will make you live comfortably, and dye triumphantly.</p>
               <p>I can do no more but lay the way before you; and the Lord himſelf give you ſtrength to chuſe it, and to walk in it.</p>
