            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And it is further ordered, upon Mr. <hi>Spurſtows</hi> motion, that <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 20. be one of thoſe Texts conſulted: <hi>And</hi> Herod <hi>was highly diſpleaſed with the men of</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>but they came with one accord to him, having made</hi> Blaſtus <hi>the Kings Chamberlain their friend:</hi> And upon Maſter <hi>Jenkins</hi> his motion, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 2, 3, 4. was ordered to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietneſs, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy providence, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept always, and in all places, moſt Noble</hi> Faelix, <hi>with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> notwithſtanding, that we be not further tedious unto thee, well may thee accept of this.</p>
            <p>The 23 of the ſixth moneth.</p>
            <p>It was agreed upon, that a Liſt of thoſe thouſands that muſt now lye down in heart breaking ſorrow upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of their faithful Guides, be prepared for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties view, that he may ſee the ſtrength of our party, and may be convinced that the people of God is his greateſt ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The 22 of the ſame moneth,</p>
            <p>It was agreed upon, that would be for the advancement of the Cauſe, if they would take the occaſion of ſome fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Sermons to promote it, provided, that thoſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhould be very quickning: And 1. That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Lye</hi> was to bid them beware of Epiſcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Lye</hi> Sermon.</note> of Ceremonies of Popery, and to weep a quarter of an hour: 2. That Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people that any place is as holy as the <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Serm.</note> Church, and that two or three met together in a private houſe, might do as well as a thouſand in the publick Congregation. 3. That Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> being to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that place in the Revelation about them that walked with the Lamb in white, ſhould take that occaſion to ſpeak againſt Surplices. 4. That Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> may give twenty Rules which may be his Congregations Directory, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Rules this may be one; That ſeeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98340:5"/>
have their Miniſters, they may yet read their books; ſo that if they cannot preach, they may yet live by writing. 5. That Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> do cry two hours together next Lords day for the abominations of Service-book, Altar-worſhip, Lordly Prelacy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſame day it was Enacted, That ſome well-affected Stationers do gather all the Farewell Sermons in City and Country to one volum, and that they ſcatter them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Nation for the propagation of the Goſpel, the Cauſe will not be a little promoted by the dying words of the faithful Paſtors; and becauſe the twelve Apoſtles are painted before the Bible, though we otherwiſe allow of no Images, yet it may be very convenient that twelve Reverend perſons heads may be ſet before the Sermons; and though Mr. <hi>Serman</hi> urged, that their heads ſet there would give occaſion to the prophane, to compare them to the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors heads at <hi>London-bridge,</hi> or to that row of heads ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that prophane book called <hi>Montelion</hi> laſt year, yet it was voted unanimouſly, that they were not ſo fearful as not to dare ſhew their heads, they were ready to die, as well as to be reproached for the Truth: But when it was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> head might be amongſt them, Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> ſtood up, and voted it down as ominous.</p>
            <p>The 23 of the ſixth moneth, heatheniſhly called <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there was an offer made by ſeveral well-affected Citizens of Mr. <hi>Seamans,</hi> and other Congregations that were ready to oppoſe that Maſs book, commonly called the Service-book, but it was over-ruled, that thoſe Eminent perſons be excuſed that ſervice, and be reſerved for more honorable ſervice, and that the work of the day be carried on by the Apprentices, who with ſuch ſucceſs helped the Lord againſt the Mighty in the beginning of the wars, that ſure the preſence of the Lord was ſtill amongſt them; whereupon Mr. <hi>Greenhil</hi> held forth upon thoſe words of the eighth Pſalm <hi>(Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings haſt thou ordained ſtrength, becauſe of thine enemies, that thou mightſt ſtill the Enemy and the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:)</hi> Out of Mr. <hi>Meads Diatriba,</hi> three quarters of an

hour by <hi>Shrewsbury-</hi>clock, as Sir <hi>John Falſtaffe</hi> ſpeaks, in the third of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth and the fifteenth.</p>
            <p>It was offered by Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> that the Lord had often forſaken the Prentices, as in 48. with Colonel <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and in 59. in <hi>Hewſons</hi> buſineſſe: to which Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> replied, that it might be, their ſtrength might fail them when they raiſed tumults againſt their brethren, and the ſervants of God: but if you mark it, ſaid he, the text ſaith, the <hi>enemy</hi> and the <hi>avenger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day in the afternoon was brought in by Mr. <hi>Gurnall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ford, &amp;c.</hi> and other Latitude men, the humble Petition of ſeveral young men, that had not taken the Covenant, for leave to conform as their Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done before the Warrs: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> roſe up in a great fury, and ſaid, If <hi>Baal</hi> be God ſerve him, if God be God ſerve him.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> More moderation becomes you, you know conſcience is a very large thing, and you know not how far it may reach.</p>
            <p>Saith old Mr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> Brethren, it is neceſſary that there be ſome ſeed-plots laid for the next Generation: Had not the Lord left us a remnant among the old Conformiſts, we had been as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and we had been like unto <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> We know not but that theſe young men may live under the Government to caſt it off as we have done; they may be through Reformers. Brother <hi>Calamy,</hi> brother <hi>Aſh,</hi> had not we become all things to all men we had gained none: In the Epiſcopal times we were Epiſcopal, that we might gain the Epiſcopal men; in the Presbyterian times we were Presbyterians, that we might gain and rule over the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and in the times of Anarchy we were moderate, that we might gain them that pretended to moderation.</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſee, ſaith <hi>Tho. Goodwyn,</hi> the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe root up and ſwallow all Forms; you ſhall ſee the Formalities and Ceremonies of the Prelatiſts flee and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh before the Spirit, the life and the power that is hid in a few faithful ones: You know the Church is ſometimes compared to an Oak, whoſe <hi>ſubſtance</hi> is in her; <hi>i. e.</hi> whoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98340:6"/>
heart and pith is found, though its outſide may ſeem to fade and decay: the outſide of Profeſſors may look dead, formal, and ceremonious, by compliance in the outward Diſpenſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns with the Laws of the place they live in, yet the root of the matter may be in them; there may be that inward ſpirit and life, that upon opportunity may devoure all form and ceremony.</p>
            <p>Verily (ſaith Mr. <hi>Wild)</hi> I think theſe young men may be diſpenſed with upon the ſame terms that Pope <hi>Sextus Quintus</hi> diſpenſed with the Catholicks here in <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign <hi>(mi fili da mihi cor tuum)</hi> O ye young man, ye may give the Prelatiſts your hands, but give us your hearts.</p>
            <p>Brethren (ſaith <hi>Philip Nie)</hi> it is neceſſary we leave ſome in the Miniſtry, <hi>i. e.</hi> to make a diviſion among the miniſtry and the people: that the people may have honeſt men to follow, under which pretence they may leave the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Miniſters.</p>
            <p>It were very well, Mr. <hi>Meriton</hi> did conform at <hi>Martins in the Field,</hi> to propagate the truth at the Court among the choiceſt Nobility and Gentry.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Venning</hi> hath done a great deal of ſervice at <hi>Olaves,</hi> which one <hi>Maggot</hi> may undo, unleſſe young <hi>Meriton</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he hath prayed, and cried, and preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe times) ſucceed him, and hold thoſe people in play with his ſhort <hi>Sententia pueriles,</hi> Jingles, and quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>It were well, Mr. <hi>Glendon, Parker, Phillips, &amp;c.</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, that they may go to law, quarrel with, and vex all the Epiſcopal men in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Weſt</hi> would do well to ſtay in, to inſtruct all the young men of his acquaintance, that are turned out of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to <hi>follow the Lord fully,</hi> and to be faithful to the end.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bucke</hi> my Lord <hi>Bradſhaw's</hi> Chaplain, and Mr. <hi>Hib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> having been faithful upon all occaſions, I think, may be truſted with the Common-prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98340:7"/>
But ſaith honeſt Doctor <hi>Bates,</hi> how can they in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence read the Common-prayer.</p>
            <p>Alas ſaid Mr: <hi>Nie,</hi> that may be done by Readers and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and when they are enjoyned to read it, they may read it as they do Brieſs, or ſome other impertinent things in the Church: And it will be no mean ſervice to our Cauſe to have the ſervice-booking by the ſlight reading of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lye</hi> ſaid, that in vain do we provide for one or two places, when all the reſt were taken up by Epiſcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> replied, never fear that, you know the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal Divines will preach but once a day, and if the good people will have an Afternoon-Lecture, they muſt pay for it, and therefore in reaſon they muſt chooſe, and you know they will be directed by us in their choice, ſo that the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon and Weekly-Lectures ſhall be as effectually and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully performed as formerly.</p>
            <p>But the wicked will call that engroſſing of Lectures, ſaith Mr. <hi>Dolittle,</hi> as Pluralities.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſaith Mr. <hi>Greenhill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> that one man of ſix places, and Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> that had eight places at once, God ſeeth no iniquity in <hi>Jacob,</hi> he obſerveth no perverſeneſſe in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> theſe are the ſpots of Gods children: We ask only againſt Pluralities of Parſonages, a man may have as many Lectures as they ſay Doctor <hi>Downes</hi> hath Lectures and Coracies, and they ſay he hath twelve; or as Mr. <hi>Hardy</hi> hath Preferments, and they ſay he hath nine; or as Doctor <hi>Pory,</hi> who hath, as is reported of him (how truly, let others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it) ſixteen places at leaſt.</p>
            <p>Verily and in good ſooth, ſay both Mr. <hi>Meritons,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more then three Lectures apiece, with our Parſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and a private Living in the Countrey that no body heareth of.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The firſt of the ſeventh moneth.</p>
            <p>Upon the Report of his Majeſties reſolved Anſwer, it was agreed upon, that the monethly Faſt be revived, and that at each Faſt there be ſix appointed to carry on the work of the day, whereof the firſt is to confeſſe their apoſtacy to the Royal Party, who they knew would deceive them and their folly in truſting in the arm of fleſh, <hi>viz.</hi> my Lord <hi>Monke,</hi> my Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> my Lord <hi>Chancellor, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond is to pour out Supplications to God to turn the Kings heart, and to overthrow the counſels of the men of this generation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is to pray for a bleſſing upon the ſeveral Councels, that are managed for the advancement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the good old Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth is to be wail the neglect of the many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities put into their hands to make all ſure, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the Lord to truſt them with the Sword once more, and to unite all thoſe that fear the Lord into one body againſt the common Enemy, that now prevaileth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth is, to ſtrengthen the weak againſt Popery.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98340:8"/>
6. The ſixth is, to gather up all the Intelligence, and thence to obſerve ſuch providence as tend towards a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; eſpecially that of wonders, miracles, apparitions, and conjunctions, that portend ſo much alteration in the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time it was ordered, That there ſhould not meet above twenty at a time in a meeting; therefore Mr. <hi>Jacomb</hi> was very much blamed for entertaining above two hundred the other day at the Counteſſe of <hi>Exeters;</hi> and that the number met, have their table laid ready, that if any ſurprize them, they may ſay, they only go to dinner or ſupper: and it was thought convenient, that there were a Boy ready to read a Chapter, that if they be interrupted they may give out, a man cannot read a Chapter in his houſe as the times go now, but they are in danger of being called in queſtion about it.</p>
            <p>About this time Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> moved, that ſeeing he and others were ſilenced, their ſoul-ſaving Works might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reprinted, <hi>viz. Smectymnuus, Lex Rex, Holy Commonwealth, Antica Valieryme,</hi> with moſt of <hi>Milton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi>'s Papers, and all the Sermons preached upon publick Faſts and Thankſgiving-dayes, before the long Parliament, and other Parliaments, from the year 1640. to the year 1658. together with Mr. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> writings, and all the godly Books publiſhed in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his time; and becauſe Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> Doctor <hi>Heylin,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Gauden,</hi> have written ſo much of late of Epiſcopacy and Liturgy, it were to be wiſhed, that Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> were intreated from this Committee, to write a Diſcourſe of Liturgies, when they were firſt compoſed, and when impoſed, which may be privately conveyed from hand to hand, for the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Brethren in that point: and that Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> ſhould write another Treatiſe of Separation: But leaſt Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> ſhould ſtate the buſineſſe of Separation ſo, that he ſhould ſet up Independancy, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſeparation as well from Presbytery as from Epiſcopacy, Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> may be intreated to ſtate the caſe ſo, as that the Miniſtry withdraw
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98340:8"/>
from their Miniſtry under Biſhops, though the people ought not to withdraw from their duty under them; that though the Miniſter do not read the Liturgy, yet the people may hear it; and that the people ought not to divide from the Church for any corruptions, though the Miniſters may.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jacomb,</hi> that this motion was very ſeaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our adverſaries obſervations, and our own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence taught us, that by the ſame reaſons that we perſwaded the people to avoid communion with the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> formerly, the Sectaries perſwaded them to avoid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us; and therefore we muſt by all means hold the people to the Church under the Biſhops, that they may hold to it under us; we muſt leave the Church, leaſt Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery be ſwallowed up of Epiſcopacy; the people muſt not leave the Church, leaſt Presbytery be brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by Independency.</p>
            <p>September 5:</p>
            <p>It was put to the queſtion by Mr. <hi>Seamor,</hi> Whether the good people ſhould hear thoſe Miniſters that were ſent them by the Biſhop? Whereupon Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, It was dangerous to teach the people to forſake the publick Aſſemblies. Why ſaith Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> why ſhould they hear the Antichriſtian Clergy? Nay, replyed Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if we teach the people to leave the Epiſcopal Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Antichriſtian; the Sectaries may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to leave us becauſe we are Antichriſtian. Nay, ſaid Doctor <hi>Manton,</hi> we need not trouble our ſelves about that, there be many honeſt and ſober men in the City, there is confiding Mr. <hi>Hibbard,</hi> ſweet Mr. <hi>Meriton</hi> and his Reader at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> honeſt Mr. <hi>Buck</hi> and his Lecturer at &amp;c. <hi>Nich. Acon,</hi> precious Mr. <hi>Neaſt,</hi> and many more, yea all the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and places to be beſtowed by the people, are to be filled up with hopeful young men.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh of the ſeventh moneth.</p>
            <p>There was Addreſſes from the City Dames to the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend the Committe of faithful Miniſters, congratulating their ſtedfaſtneſſe in the Cauſe and Covenant, with a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to ſtand by them with their lives and fortunes, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98340:9"/>
an aſſurance of their kindneſſe for them as formerly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they held forth to them Liberty of Conſcience, to do what they liſt in ſpight of their Husbands, who pretend to be Kings in their Families, as they take Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do what they will in ſpight of King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; withall offering, whether they have any deſign to which they may be inſtrumental, in perſwading their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, which they praiſe the Lord they have done hitherto very incceſsfully, as <hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of all the Living, did her Husband <hi>Adam,</hi> and the zealous Women have done in all ages; and particularly, whether they ſhould perſwade their Husbands to pay <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts no Tyths?</p>
            <p>To this Addreſs it was ordered, that Mr. <hi>Venning</hi> ſhould reply, out of his Epiſtle to that Lady, to which he dedicates Mr. <hi>Stongs</hi> Works; and Mr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> out of his Epiſtles to the Baroneſſe of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> and the Counteſſe of <hi>Clare.</hi> And likewiſe it was ordered, that they ſhould be ſtiled, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Women that were ſtirred up, as it is written in the 19. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and that this paſſage ſhould be inſerted into the Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>whereever the Goſpel was preached this which they had done ſhould be ſpoken of throughout the world:</hi> Which Reply being peruſed and drawn up with theſe Greetings; <hi>Greet Priſſilla and Aquila, our helpers in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 6. 13. <hi>Greet many who beſtoweth much labour on us. Salute Tryphena and Tryphoſa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Perſis, which laboured much in the Lord,</hi> ver. 6. 12. <hi>Salute one another with an holy kiſſe,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>All the Saints ſalute you.</hi> Whereupon the holy Siſters deputed Mrs. <hi>Winſtanley,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Gayre,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Fouke,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Allen,</hi> Mrs. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwood,</hi> to invite the Reverend Men to enjoy the Creature at a Banquet at <hi>Gains</hi> mine Hoſt in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious-ſtreet,</hi> as it is written <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>As to the matter of Tythes, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> went over the ſheet he writ three or four years ago, for the Miniſtry and the whole Committee pleaded for the divine right of it, and concluded it very dangerous to inſinuate to the people that they may withdraw their Tyths at their pleaſure, upon the leaſt diſlike of their Miniſter, for as Mr. <hi>Glendon,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98340:9"/>
Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sheffield,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi> obſerved very well, it may be our turn next; and who knoweth what a day may bring forth? it may be our own caſe. Yet it was agreed, that the Siſters ſhould ſend in their Husbands on that day ſeven-night. When they came, and by agreement all the old were burned, and new agreed upon to be ſhewed the new Incumbents; with which if they reſt ſatisfied they have not half their dues, and ſo cannot live; if they will not be ſatisfied, but endeavour to reſtore the Church to her juſt rights, they ſhall be wearied out with Suits of Law maintained by common ſtock, (for <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44. as it is written, thoſe that believe are together, and have all things in common) and withall ſhall be publickly loaded with the ſad aſperſions of covetouſneſs and contention.</p>

            <p>The twelfth of the ſame moneth, the Citizens and their Wives made an humble Addreſs to the Committee, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the word well-affected in the Table of Duties, and who are the well-affected Miniſters; whereupon, by Order of the Committee, Mr. <hi>Lye</hi> explained that particular thus: Beloved, a well-affected Miniſter is one that in conſcience was called to the Miniſtry by the Elders, but in prudence was ſince called by the Biſhops, who uſeth indeed the laſt Call and Ordination, but relieth wholly on the firſt, who indeed complieth with the publick Injuction of the Church, yet profeſſeth they are a burthen and a grief to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Beloved, a well-affected perſon, is he that being weary of reading Common prayer, prevails with the Brethren to hire a Reader for that tedious work, and then preacheth and prayeth himſelf three hours by <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> Clock.</p>
            <p>Thirdly: Beloved, he that ſavours of your former faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter, and are endued with their ſpirit; and to that purpoſe preach thoſe Notes they have taken from them; as honeſt Mr. <hi>Cave,</hi> who preacheth and prayeth as like Mr. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton,</hi> under whom he read, as if he had his Note: Ah! make much of thoſe <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s, that have the Spirit of your <hi>Elijah</hi>'s that are taken from you.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> verily we have many gracious perſons that are not defiled with the white Surplices, nor abridge the Liberty of their Conſcience by a Superſtitious Girdle, that bow not the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> that viſit our ſick after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,

baptize our Children by the Spirit, and bury our dead by the gift of Preaching; that will offer ſomething for the preſent Government in publick, but make amends for all in ſome holy and private conferences about the good Old Cauſe; theſe are a precious Remnant left us, for whom we are bound to bleſs the Lord.</p>
            <p>Siſter <hi>Priſcilla;</hi> verily Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cave,</hi> Mr. <hi>Neaſt,</hi> &amp;c. do preach up the comfortable Doctrine of Aſſurance, the Soul-ſaving Doctrine of Chriſt in Believers, the heart-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting truth of the in-dwelling of the Spirit, which are great refreſhings to us, who can hear nothing elſewhere but good works, repentance, obedience, and other legal doctrines of men unacquainted with the ſweet Myſteries of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The ſeven of the ſeventh moneth;</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Neaſt</hi> moved, That it might be one character of a well-affected perſon, that he can improve a godly Sermon, and havea piece for it at his own Church, an Angel at a Lecture, five pound for it at a Funeral Sermon, and a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at a godly Meeting.</p>
            <p>A good woman of <hi>Iſlington</hi> the ſame day petitioned, that their godly Miniſter might paſs for well-affected, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had no Humane Learning, no ſuperſtitious Hebrew, Greek or Latin, but ſavoured ſo much of precious Maſter <hi>Gurnalls,</hi> ſweet Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> holy Mr. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> &amp;c. that as ſhe ſaid, you could ſcarce diſcern his Sermons from their works.</p>

That he prayeth <hi>extempore</hi> three quarters of an hour before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and half an hour after, and mention neither King nor Biſhop directly in neither, and ſometimes without the Lords Prayer. 5. That he uſe four <hi>ab Lords,</hi> and <hi>hus</hi> in't a time. 6. That he preach moderation, bewail the ſins of the times, and threaten Antichriſt, and tell them of what is done abroad, but the good man is ſorry for it; that he preſſe inward ſincerity when the Law calls for outward conformity; that he ſay, keep holy the Sabbath-day, when the Church ſaith, obſerve Holy-dayes. 7. That he deliver the flowings of milk and honey; that he pour out refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comforts, when carnal men preach moral honeſty, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience, and good works. 8. That he have a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate from Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Caſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Seaman:</hi> That he is a confiding perſon, fearing God, ill-affected, to the preſent Government. 9. That he comply not with the Miniſter of the place, but if occaſion be, he ſet up his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt againſt him: and that what the Miniſter of the place will not do he may, for the caſe of tender conſciences.</p>

            <p>Notice being given at a Provincial meeting of the well-affected, that St. <hi>Antholines</hi> Lectures were to be choſen at the time ſuperſtitiouſly called <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and that the high Prieſt of <hi>London</hi> had a deſign to furniſh it with men whom the ignorant call Orthodox and peaceable, and upon mature conſideration, that thoſe Lecturers were the ſeed-plots of the good old Cauſe: It was ordered, that all the honeſt

The ſame day is being taken into conſideration, whether the faithful ſhould be preſent at the reading of the Service: It was ordered, that they might <hi>hear</hi> the Common-prayer, provided they did <hi>think</hi> according to the Directory: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſaid Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> I ſhall ſay to you in that caſe as the Pope did in the ſame caſe in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, <hi>You may be preſent, you may hear, but Son, give me thy heart.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The ſame Committee offered, that an Envoy be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Mounſieur Coirt,</hi> to expedite the bargain of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and in caſe the Chriſtian King ſhould think it too dear, to aſſure him, that there are ſome Chriſtian friends here, that will advance 45620 <hi>li.</hi> provided they may have Liberty of Conſcience there, in caſe of perſecution here; and to that purpoſe they added, That our honourable Friend ſhould promote the ſaid bargain at Court.</p>
            <p>Not long after, Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> and Dr. <hi>Jacomb</hi> reported, that they had it from ſome very good Chriſtian Friends, that it pleaſed God (upon the news of Liberty of Trade and Religion allowed by the moſt Chriſtian King of <hi>France)</hi> to move the Kings heart (which is in Gods hand as a River of water) to think of a gracious Declaration, about Liberty of Religion and Trade: Whereupon the thanks of the Aſſembly was returned to the Committee, for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportion of tender Conſciences to <hi>Dunkirk, New England, Amſterdam, &amp;c.</hi> And the fifth of <hi>November</hi> was obſerved as a Thankſgiving-day, for a door of hope opened in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties gracious Inclination.

You are very dark, ſaith Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> as to the language of the preſent Diſpenſation, which ſeems to ſpeak nothingleſſe, then a moſt abſolute deliverance from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſlavery.

Really, ſaid Mr. <hi>Bates,</hi> we have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98340:15"/>
great reſpects and kindneſs from my Lord <hi>Digly,</hi> and as we are beholding to him for that paſſage of his againſt this Church, which we quoted from his Letter to Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi> in the latter end of our <hi>jus divinum miniſterii,</hi> ſo we are obliged to him for the excellent Reaſons for Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he hath offered in our behalf and our brethren the Catholicks, not long ago in a very ſolemn Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>A while after it was judged convenient, that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of integrity that attend at Court, ſhould look into the bottom of that affair, and ſee whether Indulgence was likely to go on: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Seaman</hi> and Dr. <hi>Goodwyn</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was no way better to try the Kings proneneſſe to indulgence, then to make uſe of their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an friends aforehand at ſome holy meeting, or if that were not publick enough, at one of thoſe many Churches that are at our diſpoſal. And immediately Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> was ordered, to watch an opportunity at <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> and go up and preach, Very fit this, agreed upon by the whole company, for either the King would wink at it, and then we are ſure he hath a kindneſs for us, and the world may think that we are conſiderable in his eyes, and that we have over-ruled the Law, or it may be he puniſheth it, however we have honourable Friends, that ſhall bring Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> off, and it may be five hundred pounds in his way. Well ſaid Mr. <hi>Brice,</hi> we have a price put into our hands, the Lord give us hearts to uſe it; let us redeem the time, that hour, Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> had need be well ſpent. Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lye,</hi> withdrew to conſider what ſubject he ſhould preach upon; and they reported, that none was more ſeaſonable then this, either <hi>Ichabod the glory is departed,</hi> or <hi>The Ark is departed.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> was deſired to inſiſt on all the hints of fears, jealouſies, and ſurmizes, which had already poſſeſſed the people concerning the departure of the Goſpel. And it was ordered, that ſince notice ſhould be given of this extraordinary mercy, and that Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> being thanked by the City for his great paint, ſhould be deſired to print and publiſh his Sermon for the common good.</p>

            <p>It was reported on the 24th, of the ſeventh moneth, to the Provincial Aſſembly, then ſeeking the Lord by faſting and prayer, that the union among them of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way was now finiſhed, and that a great deſign was going on; whereupon Mr. <hi>Caſe</hi> preſſed, that they ſhould be unanimous, now <hi>Gebul,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> with them of <hi>Tyre</hi> were joyned together; And not long after there was an overture of accommodation between them, upon the terms of the Covenant; only ſome other time was reſerved for explaining the words, Herefie and Schiſme: As to the Deſign on foot, it was judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that ſo unconſiderable a part of the Nation could do any good; and therefore anſwer was made by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Aſſembly to the brethren of the Congregational way, that they would wait upon providence, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſee if their undertakings proſpered, if not, they would diſown it; for (as one ſaid very well) experience had taught them the method of overturning this Government; and that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is this, to keep the City, and get a major part in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; this Government muſt be inſenſibly overturned by poſſeſſing the major part of the people with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes

            <p>It was withall agreed, that two active perſons ſhould obſerve all the failings of State, and report them to a Committee appointed to improve and agravate them, as might moſt conduce to the good old Cauſe, eſpecially by engaging the people in conſcience againſt the government, and in paſſion againſt the Governours, and in contempt againſt both, and keep this worm upon their hearts, that the cauſe is Gods.</p>

That at moſt meetings there may be a Sacrament, which may be an obligation to ſecrecy and faithfulneſs. 6. That the meeting conſiſt of theſe exerciſes: 1.

That after due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of our ſelves we forget not the afflictions of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> but ſend portions to the poor diſtreſſed Miniſters and people; for it was very well obſerved by Mr. <hi>Seaman,</hi> that the King and Church have loſt moſt of their friends by neglecting to make a competent proviſion for them; for it is Intereſt, ſaith he, that governeth the world; the greateſt prop to our Cauſe was our care of diſpoſing places and Delinquents Lands to the well affected, where by a hundred thouſand families were engaged to live and die with us.</p>

            <p>But ſaid Deputy <hi>Aſh,</hi> What if all Officers for the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year muſt renounce the Covenant?</p>
            <p>Alas, ſaith Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> have not we all renounced it long ago? have not we all taken the Engagement, and was not the Engagement a renunciation of the Covenant?

            <p>October 17.</p>
            <p>It was moved by ſome well affected Citizens that did lye lyable to the Biſhops, that ſome confiding Lawyers were conſulted about their power, whether in all caſes they might not eſcape them by appealing to the Common Law, where the whole Cauſe will fall to the ground for want of proſecutors: and how far Church wardens might act without the neceſſity of taking an Oath; and what power they had in Veſtries and other Pariſh matters without their Miniſter, that they might underſtand what advantages they have in their places, for promoting the diſcountenanced In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Lord and his ſervants, and whore a man might get in with ſome Officers, under whoſe wings they may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve their Friends and the good old Cauſe.</p>

That though the Brethren of the baptized way differed from us in ſome points, yet they heartily agree in the main, <hi>viz.</hi> zealous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the tyranny, ſuperſtition, and prophaneſs of theſe times, which he underſtood to be the preſent Intereſt. 3. That becauſe no body would hear him before theſe times, he muſt now pleaſe every body to gain a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> urged againſt him further, that he being appointed to look out all opportunities of employment, and ſo bring in his deſtituted brethren to his Church, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98340:20"/>
them what he gained abroad, only reſerving two ſhill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ten for his own pains, he ſnatched up all that was to be got in Town, and employed his brethren, but allowed them little or nothing. He replied, that he knew not how ſoon he ſhould be out of all, for the High Prieſt of <hi>London</hi> threatned him every day; and he deſired to be excuſed if he lay in ſomething againſt an evil day. Another of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee urged againſt him the forty pounds it coſt him in the Maids buſineſs, where he was caught in <hi>Shoreditch.</hi> To which he replied, that the ſpirit was willing, but the fleſh was weak; his heart was right, he intended to propagate the Goſpel. When they told him he ſhould marry and not burn; he anſwered, I ſuppoſe that it is good for the preſent diſtreſs, I ſay, it is good ſo to be. After complaint of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miſdemeanours, the Curate tells them, that if they would anger him any more he would be Epiſcopal, for ſaith he, I was an Anabaptiſt, and they being too buſie with me, I turned Independent; the Independent troubled me in <hi>Wales,</hi> I came to <hi>London,</hi> and was Presbyterian, and if you will not let me alone, I will even turn, and be a Son of the Church. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Manton</hi> ſaid, we ſhould not nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row our Intereſt, nor offend the brethren, beſides, Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> is the moſt thorow-paced Nonconformiſt in Town.</p>
            <p>And if it pleaſe you, ſaid <hi>Lewis,</hi> I ſhall offer you twelve things for the propagation of the good old Cauſ which I do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I read little or no Common-prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I not uſe the Surplice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I preach Mr. <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Watſons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gurnal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Manton,</hi> and others Works, ſo that while I preach they are not ſilenced.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am in the morning at a Church, and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon at a Meeting.</p>
            <p n="5">5. At a Lecture I pray an hour, and preach two houres, wherein I hint many things effectually for the good old Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Where I do one office at Church according to the Common-prayer, I do five at home by the Directory, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in viſiting the ſick, and baptizing the faithful children.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98340:20"/>
7. Upon the 30. <hi>January</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 29. I hold a private Faſt, and have no Sermon at Church, unleſs it be a Sermon at night for preparation to the Sacrament, or ſo, for I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that cuſtome ſtill.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I watch every vacancy in Town by ſickneſs, abſence, and I bring in either my ſelf, or ſome well-affected brother to that place, whereby, as the Scripture ſaith, we take no ſmall advantage.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I keep two Regiſters, one for children baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Directory, which I have at home, and the other for children baptized according to the Common-prayer that I have at Church; one for people I marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licence, whereof I have married many of our dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters, the other for one or two in a year I marry with a licence, which licence I keep to ſhew for any body that is married.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I bring in all the Intelligence that is ſtirring among the Epiſcopal Divines, as they call them, who take me for one of themſelves, and accordingly admit me to their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Meetings.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I have a convenient Chamber for private Meetings and affairs at <hi>Sion</hi> Colledge, where I can do no little ſervice.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I receive to my Church all ſuch tender Conſciences as cannot keep their own Churches, being enjoyned reverence, and order, and decency, as they call it; and I let them do what they will, for I tell them, if the heart be right all is well; if they will keep on their hats they may, if they will receive the Communion fitting they may, which is a great eaſe to good men.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Whereas there is nothing but bitterneſs abroad, and railing, and reflecting upon the late times, I offer now and then a word of comfort in that particular, intimating the good of the late Cauſe, the holineſs of the people engaged in it, with a word of being faithful to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Committee diſmiſſed him, and wiſhed him to walk circumſpectly, and be wiſe as a Serpent.</p>
            <closer>God ſave the King.</closer>
