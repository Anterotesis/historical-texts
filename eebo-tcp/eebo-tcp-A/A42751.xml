         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the <hi>Text,</hi> yea of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe. In my <hi>Treatiſe</hi> I conteſt with them
both in one: here I will bend my ſelfe to the Second ſort.</p>
            <p>1. I would know of them, if they ſtand ſo much upon a <hi>Canon,</hi>
why did they not obey the Order of the <hi>Houſe of Commons?</hi> What was
their <hi>Order</hi> inferiour to the <hi>Canon</hi> made by the <hi>Convocation</hi> onely
without conſent of <hi>Parliament,</hi> without which no <hi>Law</hi> can binde the

               <hi>Subject?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If they did ever meane to leave it, why did they faſten it alſo upon
the <hi>Scripture?</hi> Many of them never practiſed it, nor found any <hi>Text</hi>
for it, till the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> had charged the <hi>Canon</hi> for it, which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, as<note n="c" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. lib. 5. ſect. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Maſter Hooker</hi> ſaith, none was <hi>conſtrained</hi> to uſe.
What was not the <hi>Text authentique,</hi> till the <hi>Canon</hi> had made it ſo?
or were they ſo <hi>ignorant,</hi> that they knew not how to <hi>worſhip God</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45540:4"/>
till the <hi>Canon</hi> was charged? or if they were not, how will they <hi>anſwer</hi>
it before <hi>God,</hi> ſome of them, that having lived long in the <hi>Miniſtery,</hi>
yet never before this time made knowne this part of <hi>Gods Counſell</hi> to
their <hi>People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. With what <hi>honeſty</hi> can theſe men ever leave their <hi>practiſe</hi> of it,
the <hi>Canon</hi> being <hi>overthrowne,</hi> except they renounce their <hi>opinion?</hi>
If they had not medled with the <hi>Text,</hi> they might have come off more
<hi>fairely,</hi> but if the <hi>Canon</hi> fall, all the power in the world can never
overthrow the <hi>Text,</hi> but it muſt ſtand for ever <hi>inviolable.</hi> Therefore
whereas it is the manner of theſe men to call all thoſe Miniſters <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and <hi>ſchiſmaticall,</hi> that obſerve not the <hi>Canon</hi> as they expound
it, what manner of <hi>Perſons</hi> will theſe prove themſelves to be, that will
not obey <hi>Gods ſacred Word?</hi> The <hi>evaſion,</hi> which theſe men make for
themſelves is beyond all meaſure <hi>ridiculous.</hi> They<note n="d" place="margin">Maſter <hi>Page</hi> ſaith ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe, <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of bowing,</hi> pag. 7.</note> ſay, the <hi>Text</hi> doth
but warrant this <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> hath taken occaſion from
the Texts <hi>warranting</hi> it, to command it, <hi>a very learned diſtinction.</hi>
We will view therefore the <hi>Text,</hi> as they exponnd it, and the <hi>Canon</hi> as
it ſtands: Thus they open the Text; <hi>When Chriſt had humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
God highly exalted him, and gave him the Name</hi> Jeſus <hi>to be
above every Name, that at the mention of it, all ſhould bow their
knees to the Glory of the Father.</hi> Is this but a <hi>warrant?</hi> take the
<hi>Text</hi> any way, can there be a more ſerious Ordinance? The dutie of
the <hi>Text</hi> is the maine end of <hi>Chriſts exaltation,</hi> and the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>his</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">All Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors hold, that this Text doth denote <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdome.</note> 
               <hi>Kingdome.</hi> What ſhall <hi>God</hi> lay flat this <hi>Glorious Name of Chriſt,</hi>
and lay downe his <hi>owne honour</hi> at the will of man? Surely not to obey
this <hi>Text,</hi> is to deny <hi>Chriſts Reſurrection,</hi> his <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and his
<hi>glorious Kingdome,</hi> to exclude themſelves from being <hi>ſervants</hi> to
him, and not to ſuffer him to reigne over them. Yea in their own <hi>ſenſe,</hi>
it is to deny him the <hi>Name Jeſus,</hi> and ſo they overthrow our <hi>Salvation;</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">A damnable opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make the honour of Chriſt, as he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, who by his death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to be but a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; arbitrary alſo at mans will.</note> For if this Name were given him, as they ſay, becauſe they ſhould bow
to it, if they will not bow, they deny him that Name.</p>
            <p>Now let us <hi>view</hi> the <hi>Canon,</hi> the words whereof are theſe; <hi>When

            <p>The occaſion of my <hi>publication</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is this; Sundry men
in the <hi>Countrey</hi> wherein I live, eſpecially ſince this <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> time,
have grounded this <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> upon the <hi>Text,</hi> and that upon the perill
of <hi>damnation,</hi> if it be <hi>refuſed</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">I have heard of ſome that have wiſhed that thoſe knees might rot that would not bow at the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Much like the words of Biſh. <hi>Andrewes</hi> on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. who ſaith, that that knee which will not bow at that Name, ſhall be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, that it ſhall not be able.</note>: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which, <hi>multitudes</hi> of ignorant

of my owne <hi>Pariſh</hi> ſome <hi>ſtaggered,</hi> and others were <hi>tainted</hi> with it;
therefore I thought it my <hi>dutie</hi> to <hi>labour</hi> in the <hi>point,</hi> and I tooke
paines to reade ſome <hi>Tracts</hi> of thoſe of that <hi>opinion,</hi> and found <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:45540:6"/>
Firſt, It is no way neceſſary ſo to underſtand it, becauſe <hi>(Name)</hi>
is not generally, or for the moſt part ſo taken in Scripture, but in
other ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe this phraſe <hi>(a great Name made or given)</hi>
is never taken in Scripture for a bare proper Name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe this phraſe <hi>(Name above another made or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)</hi>
is never taken in Scripture for a bare proper Name, above
another ſuch Name.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is not agreeable to the analogie of the Text, ſo to
underſtand it: My reaſon is this; becauſe the ſubjected Name in the
Text, muſt have of neceſſitie, a correſpondent Relation to Chriſts
advanced Name, otherwiſe the ſenſe cannot be Logicall. If then
the high advanced Name of Chriſt in the Text be a proper Name,
it will follow neceſſarily, that all the ſubjected Names muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Names alſo. Yea themſelves referre the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to divine
Names, preferring it before the Titles, <hi>Chriſt, Sonne of God, Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
&amp;c. And if it be ſo underſtood, though the ſenſe be Logicall,
yet is it not ſound, for this it will be: The Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a greater
Name than the Name <hi>Chriſt, Jehovah;</hi> and ſo conſequently above
the Name <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> above the Names of men, as <hi>John,
Thomas, Henry,</hi> and ſo above the Names of all creatures and things,
which will make a moſt abſurd ſenſe, which yet cannot be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon theſe mens grounds. Againe, ſeeing it is evident, that all
the ſubjected Names in the Text, muſt bow to the <hi>Name above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Name.</hi> If the ſaid Name be underſtood of a proper Name, they
not excepting divine Names, the ſenſe will be this: The names of
Angels &amp; Devils, the names of all things and creatures, the names
of men, as <hi>Richard, Thomas, William,</hi> yea, divine Titles, as <hi>Lord,
Chriſt, Jehovah,</hi> muſt bow to the name <hi>Jeſus;</hi> and how ſenſleſſe will
this be? Seeing then, that the Names ſubjected to the <hi>Name above
every Name,</hi> are not the names of creatures, and things ſubjected,
(for they are referred in the Text to <hi>knees, of things in heaven,
things in earth, and things under the earth,</hi> not to Names) but the
powers of things and creatures ſubjected, as I ſhall hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.
Then cannot the Name above them all be a proper
name; for then the ſenſe will be this: The name <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over every thing and creature, and every thing and creature
moſt bow knees to the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which will be ridiculous.
Laſtly, ſeeing the names ſubjected to the <hi>Name above every Name,</hi>
are meant the powers and vertues of things and creatures, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45540:6"/>
not divine Names, they muſt underſtand it alſo of the
power of God, then the ſenſe will be this: The name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
God, and that God himſelfe muſt bow knees to the name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
which ſenſe will be horride and blaſphemous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If it were neceſſary to underſtand <hi>(Name above eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Name)</hi> for a Name or Title, yet may it not be underſtood of the
Name or Title <hi>Jeſus;</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The word <hi>(Jeſus)</hi> doth no where in the whole new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
signifie the bare name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but onely then when it was
promiſed by the Angel at Chriſts Conception, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. and
given unto him at his Circumciſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 21. where neceſſarily
it muſt ſo ſignifie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> is never taken
in all the New Teſtament (where onely it is uſed) for the name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
or any other titles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in other ſenſes. If any ſhall
thinke, that it is meant of the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> in this place, making the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be the Dative caſe, and to agree in oppoſition with
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe there is no Article before it; I anſwer, in
ſundry places of the New Teſtament the ſelfe ſame phraſe is uſed
without an Article, and is never put in the Dative caſe, but alwaies
in the Genitive, and doth no where denote the bare name <hi>Ieſus;</hi>
as in theſe places amongſt others. <hi>Act. 2. 38. Act. 16. 18. Act.</hi> 4.
10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> is incommunicable to
any creature, being the onely prerogative of the Sonne of God:
but the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was communicated to others, as to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi>
which is the ſame name with <hi>Ieſus,</hi> Heb. 4. 8. &amp;c. Therefore it is
not ſound what Biſhop<note n="*" place="margin">Sermon on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Andrewes,</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iuſtification of vowing, <hi>Pag.</hi> 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Page</hi> from him doe
affirme, that the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is incommunicable, which though it
were given by men, yet they ſay, it was not given of God, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
none this name ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore they ſay
that it is greater than the name Chriſt, becauſe many were called
the Lords Chriſts by Gods owne allowance, as Kings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
For to this I anſwer: The name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was not given to ſome
at leaſt without a ſpeciall providence of God, as to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who
was a great Saviour, and type of Chriſt. Thus ſaith learned <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Catechiſ. <hi>Pag.</hi> 196.</note>
                  <hi>Atqui inquis Parentei Ioſhuae, &amp;c.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, ſaith
he, that the Parents of <hi>Joſhuah</hi> when they gave him this name, could
not imagine, that God would deliver <hi>Iſrael</hi> by him: He anſwers,
<hi>At Deus ſcruit &amp; voluntatem eorum direxit:</hi> But God knew it and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45540:7"/>
directed their will. And ſome are no more called the Lords Chriſts,
than others are called the Lords Saviours, as <hi>Nah.</hi> 9. 27. Theſe
Saviours there are called the Lords gifts, which is all one as if it
had been ſaid, the Lords Saviours. And whereas the name <hi>Jeſus</hi>
was a common name to be called by, generally allowed, and never
reprehended in any: But for the name Chriſt, howſoever ſome
were called the Lords Chriſts, as Types of Chriſt, yet no man
might take the name Chriſt as an ordinary name to be called by
without horrible blaſphemy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the <hi>Name above every Name</hi> was given to
our Saviour at his exaltation, according to the plaine words of the
Text. But the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was given to him in the beginning of his
humiliation. To anſwer here, that <hi>give</hi> ſignifieth to <hi>advance,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
it is not agreeable to the ſenſe of this word in other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and it marres the phraſe and ſenſe of the Text here, as I ſhall
hereafter demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Becauſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> was advanced after his Reſurrection to be
Lord and Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36. And it is conſiderable that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts
doe uſually call him by the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> onely in the time of
his humiliation. But in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, He is moſt
commonly called Chriſt, not neere ſo often Jeſus: And when he is
called Jeſus, it is very commonly with the addition of Lord, or
Chriſt, as Lord Jeſus, or Jeſus Chriſt, or both together, the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt. An argument, that Lord, and Chriſt, be Titles of his
honour, and ſo cannot be leſſe eminent than the name Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It is againſt the Scriptures to preferre the name Jeſus
above other divine Titles, becauſe God in ſubjecting all things to
Chriſt, did yet except himſelfe, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15. 27. And when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doe enter into particulars, Chriſts name is ſpecified to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
onely above created names, as above Angels, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.
above Kings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 27. above Prophets, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 3. above
Prieſts, <hi>Heb.</hi> Chapters 7, 8, 9, 10. above all other creatures
and things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. His name is never preferred above Gods
Name.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that the <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> cannot be the
name Jeſus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> what it is.</note> I underſtand it of the ſupereminent Glory and Power
of Chriſt, and that upon theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is no way contrary to the analogie of faith ſo to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it; for Name is uſed for Glory and eminency familiarly
in Scripture, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 4. and in common uſe of ſpeech, as we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45540:7"/>
ſay, Such a one hath a Name for wiſdome and learning, when we
note him to be eminent and potent for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Name of God, &amp;c. in Scripture doth commonly
denote the Power, Majeſtie, and Glory of God; and that two
wayes; Either implicitely, or expreſſely.</p>
               <p>1. Implicitely, when the Perſon of God, becauſe he is glorious,
and full of Majeſtie, is onely denominated properly and evidently,
as <hi>Pſal. 5. 11. Let them that love thy Name be joyfull in thee,</hi> that is,
Let them that love thee. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 2. ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16. even as we
ſay to great men according to their degrees of honour, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
your Grace, your Honour. So accordingly the Saints of God
have uſually ſpoken of God, and to God, and Chriſt, in, and by the
Title of his Majeſtie, <hi>(thy Name)</hi> becauſe Name, Glory, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
are properly his.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Expreſſely; when the Power and Glory of God is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and evidently manifeſted by the word</hi> Name; <hi>as</hi> 1 Sam. 17.
45. I come unto thee in the Name, <hi>that is,</hi> in the Power of the Lord
of Hoſtes. <hi>So</hi> Rom. 9. 17. That my Name, <hi>that is,</hi> my Glory may be
declared: <hi>So</hi> Act. 4. 7. By what power, or in what name.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is more agreeable to the Analogie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſo to underſtand it, than otherwiſe; for, firſt, a great Name
doth every where ſignifie the great glory and dignitie of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Secondly, <hi>Name above another,</hi> doth every where ſignifie the
Glory and Dignitie of the Perſon having that Name, above others
whoſe names are not ſo great.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It muſt be ſo underſtood here, and not for the Title
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe in this ſenſe it fits the words of the Text anſwerable
to other correſpondent Scriptures; for thus I reaſon:</p>
               <p>Whatſoever Name is the gift, which God gave Chriſt when he
exalted him, is the <hi>Name above every Name</hi> in the Text: for ſo the
words of the Text are, <hi>God highly exalted him, and gave him a name
above every name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Power and Glory is the Gift, which God gave Chriſt when
he exalted him, according to theſe correſpondent Scriptures
<hi>Mat. 28 18. All power is given me in heaven and in earth;</hi> and
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. God raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and gave him glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> Power and Glory is the Name in the Text <hi>above every
Name,</hi> Therefore not the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It is proved by the ſcope and coherence of the Text;
for there is oppoſed the exaltation of Chriſts Perſon to the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45540:8"/>
of his Perſon; not of the name Jeſus to the name Jeſus, or
any one Title to another. The conjunction <hi>(Wherefore)</hi> declares
a correſpondency of Chriſts exaltation, according to the diſtinct
branches of his humiliation. For the ſufferings of Chriſt in the
Text are reducible to two heads: The paine of feeling, and the
paine of loſſe: The paine of feeling, in theſe words; <hi>He humbled
himſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even unto the death of the
Croſſe:</hi> The correſpondent honour followes in theſe words;
<hi>Wherefore God highly exalted him.</hi> The paine of loſſe, that is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from his Name and Glory; which is amplified in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.
1. In regard of the excellency of the Perſon, that left his
Glory: <hi>He that was in the forme of God, and thought it no robbery to
be equall with God, he became of no reputation:</hi> An extraordinary
matter, that God ſhould become Man, that the Lord of Lords
ſhould become a ſervant, that the God of Glory ſhould receive
ſhame. 2. It is amplified by the meaſure of the Glory which he
laid downe; for the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He emptied himſelfe
of his Name and Dignitie, He left as it were no Glory remaining,
according to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. He became not onely man, but a ſervant,
not a ſervant onely, but the moſt deſpiſed of all ſervants, for he
was reviled from the Prince to the abject. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. He was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with Theeves and Malefactors, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 38. He had a name
of repute beneath all names and reputes; for <hi>Barrabas</hi> the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
was preferred before him, <hi>John.</hi> 18. 40. See now, how the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Wherefore,</hi> anſwereth to this; for it follows, <hi>God gave
him a name above all names,</hi> that is, Power and dignitie above all
created powers and dignities whatſoever. It anſwers expreſſely to
the name of Power and Glory, not at all to the name Jeſus. Thus
then I argue:</p>
               <p>In reſpect of what Name Chriſt by this Text ſuffered in the time
of his humiliation, in laying it downe, and emptying himſelfe of
it: in reſpect of that Name God his Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he exalted him,
gave him a Name above every Name. But Chriſt according to this
Text, in the time of his humiliation, ſuffered in reſpect of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and glory, in laying it downe, and emptying himſelfe of it.
Not ſo in reſpect of the name Jeſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> God his Father when he exalted him, gave him a name
above every Name, according to this Text, in reſpect of glory and
dignitie, not in reſpect of the name Jeſus.</p>
               <p>It will thus therefore follow from the premiſes, that ſeeing the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45540:8"/>
Name Jeſus is not the Name above every Name in the Text, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the Name in which every knee ſhould bow: and ſeing Chriſts
Name of Power and Glory is that Name, all knees muſt bow in
his Name of Power and Glory.</p>

but alſo his naturall Kingdome, which from all Eternitie he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Father, to which Kingdome he is advanced to by his
Father, according to his humane nature: and this ſeemes to agree
with many paraled Scriptures; as 1. with <hi>John</hi> 17. 4, 5. where
Chriſt prayeth after this manner; <hi>I have glorified thee on earth,
I have finiſhed the worke that thou gaveſt me to doe: And now O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
glorifie me with thine owne ſelfe, with that glory which I had with

from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. where God having excepted himſelfe, that

nothing but himſelfe. 5. It is manifeſt from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. in

is ſpecified the ſubjection of irrationall creatures; yea the Apoſtle
ſaith expreſſely there, that <hi>God having put all things under Chriſts

that it is manifeſt, that this Text of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. ſhall not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fulfilled till the day of Judgement, we ſhall finde that other
things beſides rationall creatures ſhall be ſubject at that day to
Chriſt; for the Apoſtle ſhewes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26. that <hi>he ſhall deſtroy
the laſt enemy, which is death;</hi> and <hi>Rev. 20. 13. The Sea ſhall give
up the dead which are in her, and death and hell ſhall yeeld up the dead

in phraſe and ſenſe to <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. where the Holy
Ghoſt having ſpoken before of all rationall creatures, how they
praiſed Chriſt, ſpeaks there of irrationall, both ſenſitive, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſitive,
and referres them to every creature, in heaven, in earth,

and travelling in paine for the ſinne of man, doe long for the day
of redemption, at which time they ſhall be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of corruption, into the glorious libertie of the Sons of God,
and now in their kinde they praiſe and glorifie Chriſt in hope of it,
but at that day ſhall their fulleſt praiſe and ſubjection be. So that it
ſeemes to me, that no creature, or thing, is excepted, but that all
muſt bow to Chriſt, yea, indeed the Text of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9 ſeemes to me
plainly to inferre it, for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of all knees of things

               <head>SECTION 3. Wherein it is to be examined, what is meant by bowing
every knee.</head>
               <p>BOwing the knee cannot be here taken plainly and literally for
the bowing of that member of the body,<note place="margin">Bowing every knee, <hi>what it is not.</hi>
                  </note> which is called the
knee; for theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be not ſo taken, it is not contrary to the Analogie
of Faith; for, 1. Bowing is applyed to the ſoules of men, which
properly cannot bow: <hi>Pſal. 44. 25. Our ſoule is bowed downe to the
duſt:</hi> 2. It is applyed to mountaines and hilles, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Knees are taken figuratively and metaphorically in
Scripture, for ſtrength, power, and abilitie, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 7. 17. where
God threatens, that when he ſhall ariſe to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he
will make all hands to be feeble, and all knees to be weake as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is, he will turne all their ſtrength into extreame weaknes.
So when God promiſeth to give ſtrength and ſalvation to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
He bids them to ſtrengthen the weake hands and confirme the
feeble knees:<note place="margin">Iſa. 35. 3.</note> becauſe by the hands and knees the ſtrength is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;
the knees being as it were the Baſis of the whole body, which
being feeble, the body ſinks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the moſt of the Creatures, which here muſt
bow knees, yet have no proper knees to bow: As Angels, Devils,
many ſenſitive, and all inſenſitive creatures. And ſeeing that the
Apoſtle begins with things in Heaven, where in the higheſt Heaven
are the Angels, and the ſoules of juſt men made perfect. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Heaven, Starres and coeleſtiall Orbes. In the loweſt Heaven,
miſts, dewes, and clouds; it were ſenſleſſe to imagine, that God in
the firſt place ſhould command theſe to bow proper corporall
knees, when they have no ſuch knees to Bow: hence I argue:
Whatſoever bowing is expreſly required in the Text, ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by every creature.</p>
               <p>But bowing of proper corporall knees, ſhall not be performed by
every creature; yea, not by moſt of the Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> Bowing of proper corporall knees, is not expreſſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45540:10"/>
The corporall Bowers at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> doe give this anſwer,
which indeed cannot ſatisfie: They ſay that thoſe creatures which
have not corporall knees, yet have ſomething correſpondent to
knees, and therefore doe bow after their kind and manner. I reply.
1. I would faine know how it is, that they bow after their kinde
and manner, except it be by their obedience and ſubjection, will
they nill they to the dominion of the Lord Jeſus. 2. However they
bow, ſurely they doe not bow corporall knees, therefore, if ſuch
bowing be expreſly commanded in the Text, how ſhall they fulfill
the Text. Seeing then that the moſt of the creatures can fulfill the
Text without bowing corporall knees; it is manifeſt that bowing
corporall knees is not expreſſely required in the Text. Surely it
would argue want of wiſdome in God, or great injuſtice, if he
ſhould command his creatures that dutie, which they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.
(To illuſtrate it by this ſimile) If a great King ſhould ſend
out an Edict to taxe every one of his Subjects both great and ſmall,
with a taxe of twentie pound a man, when he is not ignorant, that
there are thouſands in his Dominions, that are not able to pay
twenty ſhillings a man, would not this argue want of wiſdome and
juſtice. In like manner, this would argue the like imputation in
God, if he ſhould injoyne all creatures and things to bow corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
knees, when the moſt of them have no ſuch knees to bow. If it
ſhould be ſaid that thoſe Subjects of ſuch a King cannot pay, where
it is not, it is ſufficient that they pay what they are able; but let
them that are able, pay the whole ſumme. I anſwer, this had been
reaſonable; if the Kings command had been ſo, but how ſhall this
excuſe the King, that againſt his knowledge ſhall command all his
Subjects to pay alike, as well thoſe that are not able, as thoſe that
are? So to ſay in reſpect of this Bowing, let thoſe that have no
knees, pay what they can, but let thoſe that have knees pay knees;
It were faire indeed, if God ſhould leave it ſo at libertie. But how
can this at quit God of want of wiſdome and juſtice, if he ſhould
command all creatures and things to bow corporall knees, when
he knoweth that the moſt of his creatures, and things, have no ſuch
knees to bow.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that bowing of the knee cannot be taken literally,
I underſtand it of ſubjection, and ſo it is taken, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 29. Thus
<hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſeth <hi>Jacob, Let people ſerve thee, and Nations bow downe to
thee,</hi> that is, let them be ſubject to thee. So <hi>Pro.</hi> 14. 19. &amp;c So in
common uſe of ſpeech, when one ſaith to another, that he will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45540:10"/>
make him bow, he meaneth that he will make him yeeld. The
ſame ſubjection is ſignified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. by the word, <hi>Kiſſe,</hi> where
Rulers and Judges are commanded to kiſſe Chriſt, that is, to yeeld
their ſubjection to him. If then the word <hi>Kiſſe</hi> in that place, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be taken properly but figuratively, why ſhould it be thought
unreaſonable by any, to have bowing the knee here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
figuratively?</p>
               <p>Now that bowing here is meant of ſubjection, many correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
places doe evidently prove it, as 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 27. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. teſtified by the moſt judicious Primitive Fathers that

Divines, as that worthy and famous Confeſſor of Chriſt Maſter
<hi>William Prin,</hi> largely evidenceth in his learned Appendix againſt
bowing at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to which I referre thee.</p>
               <p>By <hi>bowing every knee of things in Heaven, things in Earth, and
things under the Earth,</hi> is underſtood the ſubjection of all things and
creatures, with all and every one of their powers, faculties, vertues,
and abilities, will they nill they to the dominion and government
of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Vindicationi of the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Pag.</hi> 72.</note> There is not the leaſt abilitie in the nature of man, ſaith
Maſter <hi>Gurnay,</hi> but muſt finde a knee to bow to Chriſt; our leaſt
muſcles, and knuckles, inclinations and diſpoſitions: The like may
be ſaid of every creature, they muſt bow the ſtrength they have in
every part of them, to the power and dominion of Chriſt. And in
this generall ſenſe, the knee of the body properly ſo called, is not
excluded; but in a proper and literall ſenſe it is not injoyned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is to be conſidered what is meant by the <hi>confeſſion
of every tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>confeſſion of every tongue,</hi> is not meant properly and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
the vocall confeſſion of that member which we call the
tongue, becauſe every Name under Chriſts Name, which muſt bow
the knee, muſt alſo confeſſe with the tongue, which for the moſt
part want tongues as well as knees.</p>
               <p>By the confeſſion with the tongue, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord,
is meant the expreſſion and yeelding forth of the ſeverall parts,
functions, gifts, powers, and abilities of every creature, both ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and irrationall, to the glory and praiſe of Chriſt the higheſt
Lord. 1. That it is underſtood of all kinds of creatures, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the forequoted place of <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. verſ. 10. where the foure
Beaſts, and the foure and twenty Elders, by whom are underſtood
rationall creatures, as Angels and men are ſaid to extoll and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45540:11"/>
Chriſt. And it follows verſe 13. that <hi>John</hi> heard all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, and in the Sea;
and all that are in them, to ſay, <hi>Praiſe, glory, and honour be to the
Lambe, &amp;c.</hi> which creatures there, are all irrationall creatures,
which have no proper tongues to ſpeake, and yet are ſaid to ſpeak
the praiſe of Chriſt. Even as the Heavens and the Earth are ſaid
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3. to ſpeake in all languages the praiſe of God their
Creatour. So now they ſhall praiſe Chriſt the great Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
And ſecondly, that every part and parcell of the creature
ſhall praiſe the Lord, it appeares from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 1, 2, 3. where the
Prophet <hi>David</hi> calles upon his Soule, and all that is within him,
that is, all the vigours and powers that are in every part of him,
to praiſe the Lord. As <hi>David</hi> in every part of him praiſed God,
and the Meſſiah to come, ſo ſhall every part of every creature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
willingly or unwillingly praiſe and extoll the great Name of
the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> being come and advanced; and in this generall ſenſe
the proper tongue of man is not excluded. And thus at the laſt day
the Friends of Chriſt with their wills, and his enemies againſt their
wills, ſhall call Chriſt Lord. <hi>Mat. 7. 22. Mat.</hi> 25. 37. 44.</p>

               <p>This expoſition which they make of the Text is one of the
maine pillars of their cauſe, which did they not make, they ſhould
looſe a maine and principall ground for this their opinion and
practiſe, and therefore this failing them all failes them. I know
they are not able to bring any one Scripture for to warrant this
expoſition. They have no viſion for it, therefore they are naked;
It is built upon the looſe Sand of vaine opinion, and not upon the

Chriſt, either expreſſely or implicitely, I take it, this phraſe <hi>In the

and glory of Chriſt expreſſely, ſo the ſenſe will be this: Every
knee or Power ſhall bow at, or to the Power and Glory of Chriſt,

to the Analogie of Faith, makes againſt them, and not as

               <p>THus having opened the Text, I will briefely gather the ſenſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
according as it hath been opened, and ſhew the meaning
of the Text, and compare it to the expoſition, which they make of
it, and then let judgement paſſe upon it.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe then will be this: Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt being in the
forme of God, equall with God, made himſelfe of no reputation,
(that is) laid downe his Name, and Dignitie, and received a Name
beneath all Names, and being made like unto Man, and taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the forme of a Servant, humbled himſelfe to death, even
to the death of the Croſſe: Wherefore God highly exalted him,
and gave him a Name above every Name, that is, Glory, Renowne,
Dominion, and Dignitie, above all things, and creatures, created
Powers, Dignities, Dominions, that all things, creatures, powers
in Heaven and Earth, and under the Earth, ſhould ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and all their ſtrength, vertues, and abilities, either willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or unwillingly to Jeſus Chriſt, thus glorified, and advanced,
and that they ſhould expreſſe, and ſhew forth, that Jeſus Chriſt is
Lord in the glory of God the Father, for ſo I take it that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
muſt be underſtood, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being often uſed for (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and thus this
branch of Chriſts exaltation will fully anſwer to that branch of
his humiliation, mentioned verſe 7. where it is ſaid, that <hi>he tooke
upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of Man,</hi>
but now being exalted, he ſhall be manifeſted to be Lord in the
Glory of God the Father. Which ſhall be fully declared in the
great Day of Judgement, when he ſhall appeare in his Glorious
Name of Power and Glory: And of this opinion are <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and
<hi>Hierome,</hi> and other Fathers, and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Zanchius,</hi> and <hi>Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
beſides ſundry other moderne Expoſitors doe allow of it:
Though the other expoſitions be ſound, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Glory of God
the Father, becauſe the honour of the Sonne is the honour of the
Father.</p>
               <p>Now this expoſition is full and eaſie, making the ſenſe cleere,
but the other expoſition, which they make, makes the ſenſe rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and is not agreeable to the ſcope of the Text, nor ſenſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
correſpondent Scriptures. For thus they reaſon; Jeſus Chriſt
being in the forme of God, though it no robbery to be equall
with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, &amp;c. Wherefore God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45540:12"/>
highly advanced him, and gave him a proper Name, or Title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
every Name, that when the Name Jeſus ſhall be ſounded out
in the Church, in the time of prayer or preaching, for there and
then, ſay they, is the place and time of this dutie, all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Earth, and under the Earth, ſhould bow corporall knees:
A moſt abſurd and ſenſles expoſition. I will note here a few abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
which they make in the ſenſe by this their interpretation, in
compariſon of the cleerneſſe of the former expoſition, leaving the
moſt materiall abſurdities to be conſidered of hereafter.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, To underſtand <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> for Glory
and Power above all, hereby is evidently ſet downe, what Name
it is, that God gave to Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Name of Power, and Glory.
But to underſtand Name for a proper Name to be called by, it is
not manifeſted what Name it is: they ſay, it is the Name Jeſus,
but the Text doth not ſay ſo in that phraſe as they underſtand it.
And expounding it of the Name Jeſus, what abſurditie is this to
ſay, that God gave his Sonne that Name at his exaltation, when he
received it at his Circumciſion? This is to make God to dally with
his Sonne: To give, and take, and to give againe; For it is plaine,
that if now he had it given him, it was not then in his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When we underſtand Name, for the Power, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſt, and bowing of ſubjection to the Power of Chriſt, or
to Chriſt himſelf advanced, it is ſhewed to whom this bowing ſhall
be performed, <hi>viz.</hi> to Chriſt. But by underſtanding Name for the
Name Jeſus, and the bowing to be done at the ſound thereof, they
onely ſet downe a time, when the bowing ſhall be done, but they
declare not to whom it ſhall be done: This they ſay, At the ſound
of the Name Jeſus, every knee ſhall bow, but they doe not manifeſt
the Perſon to whom theſe knees ſhall bow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In taking <hi>(in the Name of Jeſus)</hi> to be at the mention of
the Name Jeſus, as they doe not plainly apply any honour to the
Perſon, ſo neither to the Name; but it muſt ſtand but for a cypher,
or watch-word, to give notice when the bowing ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
but according to this their expoſition they cannot give it
any honour; and it is abſurd to have this Name to be ſo highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
above all Names, and yet not to give it honour. But they
will have honour to be given it, therefore they will have <hi>(in the
Name)</hi> to be underſtood to the Name at the mention of it. And
ſo Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> the Oracle of that opinion underſtands it, yet
hereby is not the Perſon of Chriſt properly denominated, becauſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45540:13"/>
ſo the expoſition referres the whole bowing to the Name, none at
all to the Perſon, and themſelves confeſſe, that to bow to the Name,
and not to the Perſon, is Idolatry.</p>
               <p>But they ſay, it is done to the Perſon, by bowing to the Name.
I reply. (to paſſe by the cenſure of ſuch a kinde of worſhip; for ſo
ſaith Biſhop<note n="*" place="margin">In his Works <hi>Pag.</hi> 245.</note> 
                  <hi>Babington,</hi> an Idolater may excuſe his Idolatry by
this diſtinction of concomitancy) What they ſay is one thing,
and how they expound the Text is another, according to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the Text, they cannot make that ſenſe of it, except they
adde to the Text, ſo that according to their owne grounds, they
muſt make the worſhip either vaine or Idolatrous.</p>
               <p>No marvaile therefore that that judicious and learned D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>The Minor is plaine, for to omit now to ſpeake of <hi>Angels, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,

therefore cannot ſo bow all their life; famous Churches do not ſo
bow. If this then be the true bowing, I would faine know, how,
and at what time they ſhall performe it, that in this life performe
it not.</p>
               <p>To deny the Major is abſurd; for the Text is plaine, that Chriſt
is advanced to ſo high a Name, that every creature ſhould bow to
him in that name. 2. It is ſuch a bowing, as there is alſo a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
that Chriſt is <hi>Lord,</hi> therefore if any <hi>creature</hi> ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45540:14"/>
from the bowing in the Text, Chriſt ſhould not be their
<hi>Lord,</hi> which would be <hi>derogatory</hi> to Chriſts honour, and contrary
to evident <hi>Scriptures;</hi> as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. where <hi>all Power is given
Chriſt, in Heaven, and Earth.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. where Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Heire,</hi> that is, <hi>Lord</hi> of all things. Whereas then ſome anſwer
that though every one ſhall not bow at the Name Jeſus, yet every

bowing be the duty of the Text, every one of <hi>neceſſitie muſt and
ſhall doe it.</hi> To affirme then, that the dutie of the <hi>Text</hi> ſhould be
done of all, though it ſhall not, is all one as to <hi>affirme</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi>

though he ſhall not. If then bowing at the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall not be

they ſhall not be perfectly ſubdued till the laſt day. But yet Maſter
<hi>Pages inference</hi> is not to the purpoſe, for to affirme that becauſe we
muſt be all ſubject to Chriſt at the day of Judgement, therefore we
muſt declare our <hi>ſubjection</hi> by <hi>bowing</hi> at the Name <hi>Jeſus;</hi> is all one
as to affirme, becauſe <hi>ſervants</hi> muſt be ſubject to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> that

muſt regulate the <hi>imperfect;</hi> therefore if <hi>bowing</hi> at the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi>
ſhall not be performed at that day, it concernes none ſo to bow

               <p>Some to whom I have put this <hi>Argument,</hi> and finding it too <hi>hot</hi>

               <p>Firſt, There is no <hi>Scripture</hi> for it, and it is in no wiſe to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,

               <p>Secondly, To what end ſhall the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> be ſounded out at

Chriſt; for ſhall veneration and honour reach to a bare Name as it

               <p>Names be ſignes, and a kinde of images of things or Perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented

he <hi>adores,</hi> which he cannot ſee; whereas if the Perſon were <hi>preſent</hi>
before him, he would never bow to the <hi>Image.</hi> The Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is

theſe men ſay, that they honour every Perſon <hi>alike</hi> perſonally at

confound the <hi>Perſons:</hi> For the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> is not in the

the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> being a proper <hi>Name</hi> to the <hi>Second Perſon,</hi> and
not the <hi>Name</hi> of the firſt, or <hi>Third Perſon,</hi> cannot denominate, but
onely the <hi>Second Perſon.</hi> And it is plaine, that the <hi>Name above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Name</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> is onely proper to the <hi>Second Perſon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> onely was humbled, therefore the <hi>Second
Perſon</hi> onely received this <hi>Name.</hi> From whence I agrue, looke as
the <hi>Sonne</hi> is perſonally honoured, ſo muſt the <hi>Father</hi> be.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Sonne</hi> is Perſonally honoured by bowing at his <hi>Name.
Ergo. So</hi> muſt the <hi>Father</hi> be. Or the <hi>Father</hi> is not Perſonally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by bowing at his <hi>Name.</hi> Therefore the Sonne muſt not be

               <p>I grant that the honour of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> is eſſentially the honour of
all the <hi>three Perſons,</hi> becauſe <hi>every Perſon</hi> is the ſelfe-ſame <hi>God;</hi>
according to <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 24. But here the Queſtion is of the <hi>Perſons,</hi>
not of the <hi>Eſſence:</hi> But let us reaſon from the <hi>Eſſence</hi> it makes

               <p>But when they honour the <hi>Son</hi> in the <hi>Father,</hi> they doe not bow

expound the <hi>Text,</hi> the time is appointed when this bowing ſhall be
performed, <hi>viz. At the mention of the Name Jeſus.</hi> Therefore it is
a ſinne at any time to name it, or heare it named, and not to bow.
Gods <hi>unlimited Commands</hi> cannot be limited, therefore the <hi>Church</hi>
limiting it to a <hi>time,</hi> could not ground it on <hi>Gods Command.</hi> The
Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the ſame Name at one <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>place,</hi> as at another.
It cannot be proved in the whole booke of God, but when God
determined a <hi>time</hi> of doing any thing, but that it bound <hi>ordinarily</hi>
at that time. When a <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhall ſay to his <hi>ſervant,</hi> At my <hi>calls</hi>
you ſhall anſwer, and give <hi>attendance.</hi> When his <hi>Master</hi> ſhall call,
and he give no attendance, is not he <hi>diſobedient?</hi> Would it be a good
<hi>excuſe</hi> for him to tell his Maſter, That he is not bound to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, but onely at the <hi>Table?</hi> So if <hi>God</hi> ſhall ſay; <hi>At the ſound
of the Name Jeſus you ſhall bow;</hi> when they heare it often mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and will not bow, doe they not breake Gods command?
Will it be a tolerable excuſe to plead, that they are not bound to
doe it, but onely at <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made a Decree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3 that <hi>at the ſound
of the Cornet, Sackbutt, &amp;c. all ſhould fall downe and worſhip,</hi> did not
he intend, that this command ſhould binde at all <hi>times,</hi> when theſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45540:18"/>
Inſtruments ſhould be <hi>ſounded out?</hi> And did not the <hi>people</hi> of the
Land judge <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> to be tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
of the Kings Commandement, when having heard the ſound
they did not bow: So if God ſhould ſay, At the ſound of the Name
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> you ſhall all bow. It is a manifeſt breach of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
when at any time it is heard, and no bowing performed.
Therefore when Gods commandement is plaine, and unlimited,
and they ſay, the Church muſt limit it, they give the <hi>Church</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
over <hi>Gods Word.</hi> They cannot deny but they muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>internally reverent</hi> at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> according to the <hi>third
Commandement,</hi> which injoynes <hi>inward reverence</hi> at all times, when
we mention any of Gods <hi>Titles,</hi> or elſe Gods Name ſhall be taken
in vaine. If then expreſſion of outward reverence at the Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
be alſo Gods command, it muſt be performed at all times
when it is mentioned, or elſe the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> will be profaned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they will have the Precepts of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> leſſe obligatory and
binding, than the Precepts of the <hi>Law.</hi> They may therefore with
as good reaſon affirme, that we are not bound to be <hi>internally reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
at all times, when we mention the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or any other
divine Titles, but onely in the <hi>Church,</hi> as not to expreſſe outward
reverence at all times when the ſame Name is mentioned, but onely
<hi>there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I reply. If we are not bound to performe the dutie
of the <hi>Text,</hi> but by direction and command from the <hi>Church.</hi> By
what authoritie ſhall the <hi>damned in hell</hi> doe it, who muſt yet fulfill
the <hi>Text</hi> as well as <hi>we?</hi> there is no <hi>Church-government</hi> in <hi>hell,</hi> or
will they have them doe it by direction from the <hi>Canon;</hi> into what
unſpeakeable ſnares doe theſe men run into by this opinion?<note n="*" place="margin">Surely Devils and reprobates will be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe men, if they can make their opinion good, for unleſſe they ſhould fulfill the <hi>Text</hi> they ſhould not be damned, and they have no canon to make them to doe it, and they are very fooles if they will make a Canon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Againe, they make the <hi>Church</hi> a perpetuall Perſon, and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
never to be ended by this their expoſition; For theſe two clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
of <hi>bowing the knee,</hi> and <hi>confeſſion with the tongue, that Jeſus Chriſt
is the Lord,</hi> are coupled together by a <hi>conjunction copulative,</hi> as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be done together, both muſt be done <hi>in the Name of Jeſus;</hi>
Therefore as they underſtand (at the Name <hi>Jeſus)</hi> and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bowing the knee <hi>plainly,</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> they muſt of neceſſitie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<hi>confeſſion with the tongue, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord</hi> plainly
alſo, and literally. See then what worke they will make of it.</p>
               <p>The Naming of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> will call for a bowing of the knee at the
ſound of it, &amp; alſo at that time a vocall confeſſion with the tongue,
that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Lord.</hi> In which confeſſion, <hi>Jeſus</hi> being againe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45540:19"/>
will call for a new bowing &amp; confeſſion, and ſo it will come
over and over againe, never to be ended: this ſnare they cannot
poſſibly avoyd by their ſo expounding the <hi>Text.</hi>

               <head>SECTION XII.</head>
               <p>VVHatſoever Expoſition of a <hi>Text</hi> ſhall diminiſh, weaken, and
Eclipſe the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Kingdome</hi> is falſe,
blaſphemous, and abominable.</p>
               <p>But the aforeſaid Expoſition doth ſo. I will prove that it doth
in ſundry reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When we underſtand <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> for the
Power and Dominion of Chriſt over all creatures, and things; by
this Expoſition the high Dignitie of Chriſt, ſpecified in theſe
words; <hi>God highly exalted him;</hi> is amplified, and enlarged; and
thus it anſwers other Scriptures, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 20, 21. where in the
twentie verſe, the high honour of Chriſt is ſet downe in theſe
words; <hi>He raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his right hand in
heavenly places;</hi> which words anſwers to theſe words in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9.
<hi>God highly exalted him.</hi> Then it follows, verſ. 21. <hi>Far above all
principalities and powers, and every name that is named;</hi> which is a
farther amplification of Chriſts Honour: and fitly anſwers this
phraſe in <hi>Eph. 1. 21. God gave him a Name above every Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, This anſwers patly to <hi>Daniels</hi> advancement, who was
a type of Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 48. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>the King made
Daniel a great Man, and gave him great gifts;</hi> which is as much as
if he had ſaid according to the words of <hi>Phil. 2. 9. He highly exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him.</hi> Then it follows, that <hi>he made him Ruler over the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Babylon, and chiefe of the Governours of all the wiſe men in
Babylon;</hi> which is an amplification of <hi>Daniels</hi> honour, and it is
as much, as if it had been ſaid, <hi>he gave him a Name</hi> above all the
<hi>Names</hi> of the wiſe men in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide: By underſtanding <hi>Name above every Name,</hi>
for the title <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the honour of Chriſt is rather diminiſhed; for
they give him in effect no Dominion and Power at all; for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> which others had as well as he, doth not properly
denote Power and Authoritie; but his Power conſiſts in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and dominion over all, as he is King of Kings, and Lord of
Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:45540:19"/>
Secondly, The <hi>Text</hi> according to the true meaning thereof,
makes Chriſt <hi>Lord</hi> of every <hi>creature,</hi> from whoſe government and
dominion, none can be exempted. The other Expoſition robs
Chriſt of the honour and dutie of the moſt of <hi>his creatures,</hi> which
cannot poſſibly performe their dutie to Chriſt, as they underſtand
it; as I have proved; ſo that it makes Chriſt <hi>Lord</hi> but of a few of
the Creatures, who is Lord of all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Text</hi> truly underſtood gives to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>honour</hi>
of every <hi>knee.</hi> Chriſt will have all the abilities of every part and
parcell of every creature to bow to him: every knee of every facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſoule, and part of the body muſt bow: he will be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with all our ſtrength. Now whereas Chriſt will have all <hi>knees,</hi>
they give him onely by this expoſition, the <hi>knee</hi> of the body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo called, or a low <hi>curteſie,</hi> and no more.<note n="*" place="margin">A mightie purchaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Chriſt ſhall have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by this expoſition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his extream humiliation and ſuffering, to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>ceremony</hi> done him at the mention of his Name, as theſe men call it, &amp; diſtinguiſh it from a <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> and <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty.

If it be a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to us, it is alſo a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to all the creatures: no marvaile then if theſe men affect ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ſo much, ſeeing they by their doctrine doe make every creature, yea all Angels and glorified Saints, to be altogether in practiſing a <hi>Ceremony.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Text</hi> in the true meaning thereof injoynes <hi>the
bowing</hi> therein at all times and places: every creature will they nill
they are ſubject to Chriſt, and we are bound to bow continually
all our <hi>ſtrength,</hi> all our gifts and endowments, all our naturall and
ſpirituall abilities, as faithfull ſervants to the will, dominion, and
pleaſure of Chriſt our higheſt Lord. The other expoſition tyes this
dutie not to every place, but to one place, <hi>viz. The Temple;</hi> and not
at all times, but onely one day in a weeke ordinarily, <hi>The Lords
day,</hi> and not at all times in the ſaid day, but onely then when <hi>Ieſus</hi>
is named, which amounts in all but to a <hi>few minutes</hi> in a weeke;
So that they will make Chriſt Lord but for a few minutes in one
day of a weeke: It is a poore honour that they will allow to Chriſt
from this <hi>Text,</hi> and indeed, it is all that the moſt of them can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him, or are willing to give him, allow him two or three cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefies
once in a weeke, and all their time elſe diſhonour him by
their ſcandalous lives.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whereas Chriſt is <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> eſpecially of his
Church, which amongſt men are onely his true and faithfull <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
for whoſe ſake he will bring downe all adverſary Power;
this their expoſition robs Chriſt of his <hi>true Subjects,</hi> and thruſteth
upon him, for the moſt part, the <hi>members of Antichriſt.</hi> For the
moſt <hi>famous Divines</hi> of all times, and of all <hi>Churches,</hi> are againſt
the ſaid expoſition. The <hi>beſt Churches</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe they
underſtand Gods Word, practiſe it not, and who doe practiſe it as
a dutie of the <hi>Text,</hi> (a few ſimply miſlead onely excepted) but a
ſort of ignorant, ſuperſtitious, lewd ſcandalous perſons, or meere
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45540:20"/>
men-pleaſers, and ſervers of the times; which are <hi>enemies</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
yet this opinion forceth theſe on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to be his <hi>true ſubjects,</hi> and
thruſteth going <hi>his owne people,</hi> purchaſed with his <hi>blood;</hi> and what
an unſpeakeable <hi>indignitie</hi> is this to <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">If a ceremony be the ſole ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to Chriſt by this Text, &amp; done him onely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by ſuch as theſe, ſurely then God hath highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Sonne to a very great purpoſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, The opinion of theſe men deprives Chriſt
of his honour and glory at the <hi>great day of Judgement.</hi> For. 1. It
puts no difference between his kingdome now <hi>begun,</hi> and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<hi>made perfect;</hi> for by their expoſition of the <hi>Text,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoyd it, but that they muſt make the bowing at the Name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
to be the true bowing at the great day of Judgement, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before.</p>
               <p>And 2. What an abaſement will this be of Chriſts honour at
that great day: For whereas he ſhall then appeare in his great
and glorious Name of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> accompanied with his
<hi>Mightie Angels in flaming fire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 7.</note> who ſhall then yeeld unto him
their <hi>fulleſt ſervice</hi> and <hi>ſubjection,</hi> which is the <hi>bowing,</hi> that they
ſhall <hi>willingly</hi> performe unto him at that day; To the end that he
may make all his <hi>enemies</hi> to tremble, that <hi>they ſhall licke the duſt,
and become his foot-ſtoole,</hi> give them a full and finall overthrow;
thruſt them into the <hi>bottomles pit,</hi> which is the bowing in the <hi>Text,</hi>
which they ſhall performe to Chriſt <hi>againſt their wills;</hi> and that he
may <hi>wholly</hi> free his Saints from the corruption of their natures,
and renue them <hi>perfectly,</hi> according to his <hi>image,</hi> and reward them
with <hi>everlaſting bliſſe and happines,</hi> which is the bowing that they
ſhall <hi>willingly</hi> yeeld unto him;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note> and that he may renue the <hi>creature,</hi>
which now groanes, and travaileth in paine by reaſon of <hi>mans ſin.</hi>
This their expoſition makes it to be nothing elſe but a<note n="*" place="margin">Seeing theſe men hold it not neceſſary to obey the Text, but by direction of a Canon. I wonder what they will doe for a Canon to command the Ceremony at the day of Iudgement.</note> Ceremony,
a corporall bowing at the title <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which will be a poore honour
to Chriſt, a poore affrightment to his <hi>enemies,</hi> a poore advancement
to his <hi>Friends.</hi> It will make this <hi>glorious day of the Lord,</hi> to have no
<hi>glory</hi> in it; yea, it will make Chriſts kingdome in the height and
perfection of it, to be but a ridiculous mock-kingdome; ſuch a
kingdome in effect as his enemies aſcribed to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 29.
<hi>Who platted a crowne of thornes, and put it on his head, and bowed the
knee before him, and mocked him.</hi> Yea theſe in ſome ſort deale <hi>worſe</hi>
with him than <hi>they,</hi> for they dealt thus with him in his <hi>extreame
humiliation;</hi> but theſe doe it in the greateſt <hi>height</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of
his Kingdome. This opinion therefore darkneth, diminiſheth,
yea overthroweth the <hi>kingdome of Chriſt,</hi> therefore it is a <hi>blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
opinion, not to be endured.</p>

               <p>THere is no <hi>example</hi> for bowing at the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> in the whole
<hi>New Teſtament,</hi> therefore it is not probable, that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
dutie. The conſequent is plaine; for what <hi>neceſſary dutie</hi>
is there, but there is ſufficient <hi>light in Scripture,</hi> that it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
We reade of the often meeting of the Church together in the
New Teſtament, of their Propheſyings &amp; Prayers, with the ſeverall
geſtures of them; but there is not the leaſt intimation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that ever bowing at the Name Jeſus was practiſed. As there

It is the uſuall wont of theſe men, to boaſt, that generally all the

But they muſt not thinke to carry it away with big words of <hi>oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>

kneele, or bow the knee to Chriſt. But <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
not <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He doth not ſay, that this kneeling or bowing ſhould be
done at the name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> It is alſo the manner of Chriſtians to bow
to God, doe they therefore bow at the Name God. And indeed
what <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith is now verified by every true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who
humbly pray to God <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> and is not this to bow to
Chriſt? Now that <hi>Hierome</hi> conſents not unto them it is plaine;
for when he entreats on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. the place in controverſie,
he ſaith there no more but this, according to the judgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Authors, that <hi>all Creatures ſhould adore Chriſt:</hi> An evident
Argument that <hi>Hierome</hi> was not of theſe mens opinion.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the Fathers are wreſted, not one is for them. If any
one in anſwer to this Argument will produce Fathers, I pray them
to produce them to ſay, not onely that the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is the <hi>Name
above every Name,</hi> but alſo to ſay, that by bowing in the Name of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> is meant bowing at the mention of the Name <hi>Jeſus;</hi> If they
bring none to ſpeake thus full, let them ſpare their labour, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
their <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> will halt, and not be worth a ruſh.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Viſitors</hi> at their Viſitations in the late crazy dayes, though
then they grounded the bowing at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not onely
upon the Canon, but alſo upon the Text of Scripture; yet did at
that time give leave to ſome Miniſters, that ſcrupled the ſole bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> (though it was very unwillingly granted)
to bow at other <hi>Divine Names,</hi> ſo they would bow at <hi>that,</hi> and not
onely ſo, but at that time they uſed veneration, and ſuffered it to
be done at <hi>humane Names.</hi> For at the <hi>Metropoliticall Viſitation at
the Cliffe by Lewes in Suſſex,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>July</hi> 1635. The
<hi>Viſitor</hi> entring into ſpeech of the <hi>Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury,</hi>
as ſoone as ever he named <hi>William,</hi> he put off his hatt, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the <hi>Ministers</hi> then preſent made low obeyſance: This
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45540:22"/>
is true, and thereof there be many witneſſes. I contend now, that
this <hi>toleration,</hi> and this <hi>practiſe,</hi> doth contradict this opinion of
bowing at the Name <hi>Ieſus.</hi> As for the ſecond inſtance, if any now
ſhall diſtinguiſh betweene <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>civill</hi> worſhip, and affirme that
this was but <hi>civill worſhip.</hi> 1. I reply, I could queſtion the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note n="*" place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Gurnay</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, from <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. to 107.</note>,
but though I ſhould grant that this diſtinction may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
elſe-where, yet cannot it be admitted here; for if the Name
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> be the <hi>Name above every Name</hi> in the Text, it muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
relation to <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Titles;</hi> then if the honour of the <hi>knee</hi>
be the advancement of the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> above other Names, no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>knee</hi> whatſoever, may be performed to any other name;
for then how ſhall the advancement of the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> above other
Names appeare. Againe, Though it ſhould be granted that the
civill worſhip of the knee may be given to the <hi>Names of men,</hi> which
yet is not to be granted upon theſe mens grounds, yet no <hi>divine
worſhip of the knee,</hi> upon the ſaid grounds can be given to any name
whatſoever. Therefore no <hi>Names of God,</hi> beſides the Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
can be adored with the worſhip of the <hi>knee.</hi> For whatſoever is <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
is onely capable of <hi>divine worſhip.</hi> Then, if any other <hi>Divine
Names</hi> may be indifferently bowed unto, they giving the <hi>prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
above them all to the Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> it is a plaine contradiction,
for then they make them as high, and as honourable, as the Name
<hi>Ieſus.</hi> But if other Names of God beſides the Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſhall not
be bowed to; as theſe ſuperſtitious Jeſu-worſhippers never doe, by
their bowing at or to the Names of men, it cannot be avoyded but
they give the preheminence to the Names of <hi>men</hi> above the Names
of <hi>God,</hi> which ſhall have ſome honour done them, all the honour
that they are capable of, but the Names of God ſhall have none at
at; for bowing the knee in the <hi>Text,</hi> doth denote preheminence.
To conclude, if all <hi>Divine Names</hi> may have <hi>divine honour</hi> done to
them, when they are named, and <hi>humane Names</hi> have <hi>civill honour</hi>
done to them, call it what you will; <hi>Jam ſumus ergo Pares,</hi> what
prerogative or ſuper-eminency of honour ſhall the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi>
have above other Names. Then the <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. as theſe
men underſtand it, ſhall ſtand but for a <hi>cypher;</hi> For if all <hi>Titles</hi> both
<hi>divine</hi> and <hi>humane,</hi> be of themſelves capable of the honour of the
<hi>knee,</hi> then was the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> capable of this honour, if it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been <hi>advanced.</hi> To what purpoſe then did God ſo highly <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi>
it to receive this honour.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall yet object, that though God have advanced the name
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45540:22"/>
                  <hi>Ieſus</hi> above every Name, that every knee ſhould bow to it, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Names</hi> may be bowed unto, becauſe the bowing of the <hi>knee,</hi>
which is due to <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Lord</hi> of all, and ſo to every <hi>Perſon</hi> of
the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> is alſo allowed to be done to <hi>men.</hi> I anſwer, 1. No
Text puts difference between the <hi>Perſons of the Trinity,</hi> but they ſay
that the Text of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9. puts difference between <hi>Names,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> above other <hi>Divine Names.</hi> Therefore upon
their grounds, <hi>Divine Names</hi> muſt not be honoured alike, (though
the <hi>Perſons of the Trinitie</hi> muſt) becauſe, ſay they, the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi>
is above them all.<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 43.</note> 2. God hath commanded the <hi>bowing of the knee</hi>

he hath no where commanded bowing of the knee to be done to
Names, either divine or humane; neither be there any examples in
Scripture, that either the one or the other was ever practiſed:
Therefore if it be true, as theſe men ſay, that bowing at the Name
<hi>Ieſus</hi> is Gods command to be done to it upon ſo <hi>ſpeciall</hi> a reaſon,
that it is the <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> there being no command, or
example of bowing at any other <hi>Name</hi> beſides, nothing can be
more <hi>certaine,</hi> but that the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is ſelected and culled out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all other <hi>Names,</hi> to have the honour of the knee <hi>peculiarly</hi> to
be done to it. Therefore to give this bowing to <hi>Divine Names</hi> is
evill, but intolerable preſumption to give it to the <hi>Names of men;</hi>
for this cannot be done without horrible <hi>profanation</hi> of the Name
<hi>Ieſus.</hi> This will neceſſarily follow, if bowing at the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi>

<hi>Rabbi</hi> and <hi>Doctor</hi> of his Church, hath no where taught them to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45540:24"/>
reaſon ſo: The <hi>Text</hi> cannot with any ſenſe beare this <hi>Reaſon;</hi> for
as I have ſhewed before, the Apoſtle argues from the <hi>humiliation</hi> of
Chriſts Perſon to the <hi>advancement</hi> of his Perſon; not from a <hi>Name</hi>
to a <hi>Name.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that the <hi>Name Jeſus</hi> was
humbled, therefore he doth not meane that the ſaid <hi>Name</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.
Therefore becauſe it hath no <hi>light</hi> from <hi>Gods Word,</hi> this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
might be ſufficient: but becauſe it is a reaſon much relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and <hi>ignorant men</hi> that know little elſe, have learned it <hi>exactly</hi>
from their Teachers, I will encounter with it, and make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that there is no ſtrength or ſoundneſſe in the ſaid reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I deny the Antecedent; The Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
above other <hi>Names;</hi> It cannot be well proved, that this Name
ſuffered at all; For no man denied <hi>Chriſt</hi> this Name, but both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
and friends gave it him; It was the <hi>Perſon,</hi> not the <hi>Name</hi>
that ſuffered; neither did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer for this Names ſake. When
<hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> Types of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were abuſed and perſecuted,
can any ſay, that their proper Names ſuffered, neither can it be
truly ſaid, that the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> properly ſuffered, when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
himſelfe ſuffered.</p>
               <p>Their maine proofe of this Reaſon they produce from <hi>John</hi> 19.
19. Where <hi>Pilate</hi> ſet up Chriſts title over his head upon the Croſſe,
<hi>Jeſus of Nazareth the King of the Jewes:</hi> This, they ſay, was done to
him in ſcorne; ſo that his Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was made an execration ſay
they. I anſwer, It cannot be proved that this Title was ſet up at all
in ſcorne. Judicious M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> on that place, is of another minde.
For thus he ſaith; <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Pilati conſilium fuit, &amp;c.</hi> It was <hi>Pilates</hi> policy
ſaith he, that he might revenge himſelfe of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who by
their obſtinate importunitie had forced him to puniſh an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<hi>Perſon,</hi> to condemn the whole Nation in the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </q>
So by his judgement this title was a reproach to the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi>
rather than to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He addeth yet further, <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Atqui in Chriſto
hoc extraordinarium fuit, quod ſine ignominia titulus apponitur,</hi>
This was extraordinary in Chriſt, that without any reproach
his title is ſet up.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. The offence that the <hi>Chiefe Prieſts of the Jewes</hi> tooke at this
Title, proves it not to be ſcornefull to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who were diſpleaſed
with <hi>Pilate</hi> for it; which if it had been reproachfull, they burning
in malice againſt our <hi>Saviour,</hi> would have liked it well enough.
3. Had it been ſet up in ſcorne, it was not in any quarrell to the

therefore God advanced it. I ſay, this Reaſon is not ſatisfactory;
for the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is not, what theſe Names are ſimply conſidered in
themſelves, but what they were in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the time of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
As the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is not, whether we are to bow at the Name

then, that theſe aforeſaid Glorious Names were more humbled
Names in <hi>Chriſt</hi> than the Name <hi>Jeſus;</hi> For <hi>Ieſus</hi> was his proper

                  <note place="margin">Workes, <hi>Pag.</hi> 245.</note> Chriſt in reſpect of theſe Glorious Names
ſuffered exceedingly; For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He emptied himſelfe of the
Glory of theſe Names. The <hi>Jewes</hi> generally would not give them,
nor ſuffer them to be given unto him. Whoſoever did but once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
his mouth to aſcribe any of theſe <hi>Titles of honour</hi> to our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
preſently he ſuffered for it; for <hi>whoſoever did but confeſſe him to
be the Chriſt, was put out of the Synagogue,</hi> Joh 9. 22. When at any
time he did but take the due honour of any of theſe Names to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
they immediately intended miſchiefe againſt him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 18.
<hi>The Iewes ſought to kill him, becauſe he ſaid God was his Father, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelfe equall with God:</hi> So <hi>Joh. 10. 33. For thy good workes,</hi>
ſay they, <hi>we ſtone thee not, but that thou being a man makeſt thy ſelfe
God.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 65. As ſoone as he had confeſſed that he was <hi>the
Chriſt, The high Prieſt cryed out againſt him, that he blaſphemed.</hi> So
that it is evident, that our Saviour ſuffered the <hi>paine of loſſe,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of theſe glorious Names, not having the honour of them, and
not onely ſo, but he ſuffered alſo the <hi>paine of feeling</hi> in himſelfe and
his members, when at any time, <hi>he</hi> or <hi>they</hi> did but aſcribe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of theſe <hi>Names</hi> unto him. Now that theſe Names, and not the
Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> are ſuffering Names, I will illuſtrate it by this <hi>Simile.</hi>
Suppoſe the <hi>Subjects</hi> of ſome <hi>King,</hi> whoſe proper Name is <hi>John,</hi> or

him, and at length kill him, not becauſe he is called <hi>John,</hi> or
<hi>Henry,</hi> but becauſe he will be their <hi>King,</hi> as indeed he is. I would

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45540:25"/>
                  <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Henry,</hi> or his Title <hi>King;</hi> no man can ſay it is for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Name,</hi> but for his Kingly Title, which they will not give unto
him: In like manner our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whoſe proper Name is <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
which Name others had as well as he, he is <hi>God,</hi> he is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is
<hi>King.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> never queſtion him for his proper <hi>Name,</hi> but they
will not give him his Titles of honour, they will not ſuffer him to
reigne over them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 27. but becauſe he takes this due honour
to himſelfe, they reproach him, and kill him; in all reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
theſe Glorious Names are ſuffering Names, and not the Name
<hi>Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. I deny the Conſequent; We are not bound to bow the
knee at the ſound of that Name, which is the moſt ſuffering Name.
Neither can this Text, or any other Scripture make good this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
there is nothing in the Text ſpoken of a bare <hi>Title,</hi> but onely
of the <hi>Perſon</hi> of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. The reaſon will be more evident (if it were lawfull to reaſon
without booke,) for bowing at the Names, <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> &amp;c.
than the Name <hi>Jeſus;</hi> for thus I reaſon:</p>
               <p>Looke what Names <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the time of his humiliation laid
downe, and at the mention of which received diſdaine &amp; reproach,
it is meete, that in the time of his exaltation he ſhould receive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
at the mention of thoſe <hi>Names,</hi> rather than at the mention of
that Name, which he laid not downe, and at the mention of which,
he received no diſdaine and reproach.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the time of his humiliation laid not down his Name
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> but he laid downe his Glorious <hi>Names,</hi> as <hi>Lord, God, Chriſt,
King,</hi> and at the mention of theſe he ſuffered diſdaine &amp; reproach,
not at the mention of the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Therefore it is meete, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> now in the time of his exaltation ſhould be honoured at the
mention of his Glorious Names, <hi>Lord, God, Chriſt, King,</hi> &amp;c. ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than at the mention of the Name <hi>Jeſus.</hi> So we ſee plainly, that
if there were a reaſon in the Conſequent, it makes not ſo much for
the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as for the Names above-ſpoken. If it be replyed,
that <hi>Chriſt</hi> having been humbled in his Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> it is therefore
neceſſary, that he ſhould receive honour in that <hi>Name,</hi> being exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I anſwer, If their meaning be this, that becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
called by the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> being humbled, therefore he ought to be
bowed to at the ſound of that <hi>Name</hi> being exalted, it is a ſenſles
reaſon without any proofe, conſequent, or ground, therefore let
them prove it, or ceaſe ever to mention it. If this were neceſſary,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45540:26"/>
why were not thoſe Worthies <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> Types of <hi>Chriſts
humiliation</hi> as of <hi>his exaltation</hi> by a ſpeciall appointment of <hi>God</hi>
bowed to, when they were advanced at their diſtinct Names of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
and <hi>Daniel,</hi> being ſo called when they were humbled. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſenſe it is true in <hi>Chriſt</hi> (though it be not an ever-binding rule)
for he ſhall be alwayes honoured by the <hi>Church</hi> in that Name,
which ſhall not be laid downe.</p>

               <p>THirdly, Thus they reaſon; We receive more benefit by the Name
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> than by any other Name; for it ſignifieth our <hi>Saviour:</hi>
And in this ſenſe they preferre it above other <hi>Names,</hi> yea above
<hi>Jehovah</hi> it ſelfe. Some have openly taught this ſtuffe, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is more
excellent than <hi>Jehovah,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> delivered the people from
the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the houſe of bondage, but <hi>Jeſus</hi> delivers
us from the wrath to come.<note place="margin">Iuſtification of bowing, <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note> Yea M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Page</hi> himſelfe ſpeakes very
meanly (in compariſon) of the name <hi>Lord,</hi> which is the ſame with
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> (for every where, where the Septuagints finde the name
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> they tranſlate it by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Lord.)</hi> Yea though he
doe acknowledge, that the name <hi>Lord</hi> doth betoken the <hi>Deitie.</hi>
For thus he ſaith; What tell you me of <hi>Lord,</hi> give me a <hi>Samaritan,</hi>
that may binde up my <hi>wounds.</hi> And in other places he preferres the
name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deſire to know, what they <hi>meane</hi> by this <hi>reaſoning.</hi>
If this be their meaning, that the title <hi>Jeſus</hi> did more for us than the
titles, <hi>Chriſt, Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> it is moſt ridiculous; yea it is <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
to attribute our <hi>Salvation</hi> to bare names, or titles, which our
<hi>Saviour</hi> himſelfe wrought for <hi>us.</hi> But if this be their meaning, that
the Perſon <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is greater, and did more for us, than the Perſon
<hi>Chriſt, Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>Lord;</hi> this is as ſenſles as the other; for 1. this
will divide <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and make <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> two <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
2. It will ſeperate <hi>Jeſus</hi> from <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſo making <hi>Chriſt</hi> not
<hi>God,</hi> or above <hi>God;</hi> and ſo in effect deny him to be a <hi>Saviour;</hi> for
if he had not been <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he could not have ſaved us.</p>
               <p>2. It is an abſurd kinde of reaſoning to attribute temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and Salvation to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> onely for as much as
<hi>Jehovah</hi> is the <hi>Authour</hi> of all good, temporall, ſpirituall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45540:26"/>
yea our Salvation in Scripture is ſpecially aſcribed to <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
or <hi>Lord,</hi> as <hi>Iſa. 43. 11. I even I am Jehovah, and beſides me there
is no Saviour.</hi> So <hi>Verſ. 14. This ſaith Jehovah your Redeemer.</hi> So
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 12. 2. The Church ſhall ſay, <hi>Behold, God is my Salvation, I
will truſt, and not be afraid, for the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength, and
my ſong, he is alſo become my ſalvation.</hi> So <hi>Deut. 33. 29. Pſal.</hi> 84. 11
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 4. And in very many places beſides. It is therefore beyond
meaſure <hi>abſurd,</hi> to preferre <hi>Jeſus</hi> above <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and to aſcribe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to <hi>Jeſus</hi> onely; for if he name <hi>Jeſus</hi> be above <hi>Jehovah,</hi> of
neceſſitie it muſt be above the names <hi>God the Father,</hi> and <hi>God the
Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and ſo either way the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> will be made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>third Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For thus I reaſon:</p>
               <p>Whoſoever hath a <hi>Name</hi> greater than others, is therefore more
<hi>excellent</hi> than thoſe whoſe <hi>Names</hi> are not ſo great.</p>
               <p>Therefore, If the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which is a name peculiar to the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Perſon,</hi> be a greater Name than <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to him with the other <hi>Perſons,</hi> or greater than the name <hi>God
the Father,</hi> or <hi>God the Holy Ghost,</hi> it will follow expreſſely, that
the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> is greater than the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>third Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part of the Argument is proved from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4. where
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> proves that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was better than the <hi>Angels, viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had <hi>obtained</hi> a more excellent <hi>Name</hi> than they. This is alſo
confirmed by the Analogie of the Scriptures; for I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>Name above another,</hi> doth alwayes denote the excellency
of the <hi>Perſon</hi> above another, that hath not ſo great a Name; as
<hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 19. The Lord promiſeth his people that will keepe his
Commandements, that <hi>He will make them high above all Nations, in
praiſe, in name, and in honour.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 5. The Lord promiſeth
to the <hi>Eunuches that will keepe his Sabbaths, a Name better than of
ſonnes and daughters,</hi> that is, he will beſtow upon them a greater <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
and <hi>honour,</hi> than thoſe that have <hi>ſonnes and daughters,</hi> viz. in
that reſpect, or they ſhall be more excellent by that <hi>name</hi> that he
would <hi>give</hi> them, than they ſhould have been by having <hi>ſonnes and
daughters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore to affirme that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is abave <hi>Jehovah,</hi> doth expreſſely
fight againſt this Text of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27. where <hi>God having ſubjected
all things under Chriſts feete, hath yet excepted himſelfe that did put all
things under him.</hi> Seeing therefore he hath excepted himſelfe, and
hath not ſubjected <hi>himſelfe</hi> to Chriſt: by the ſelfe-ſame reaſon he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45540:27"/>
hath not ſubjected his <hi>Name</hi> to Chriſts name, for if he had, by the
reaſon above-ſpecified, he had alſo preferred his <hi>Sonne</hi> above
<hi>himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anſwers which I have received to this Argument, are theſe
three, yet none of them ſufficient in my judgement.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is ſaid, that the ground and rule above-ſpecified, holds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſo it will hold between <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and all the reſt of the <hi>creatures,</hi> where there is a manifeſt <hi>difference,</hi>
but it will not hold between the <hi>Perſons of the Trinitie,</hi> becauſe they
are <hi>equall,</hi> and cannot be made <hi>unequall.</hi> This anſwer is very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives this reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> is better than
the <hi>Angels, viz.</hi> becauſe he had obtained a better <hi>Name</hi> than they,
which argument had been weake and uncertaine, and he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have made good what he <hi>affirmed,</hi> if his ground and rule could
ever have <hi>failed.</hi> A true rule is a perfect rule, or no rule at all.</p>
               <p>2. True it is, that it is indeed impoſſible, that the three Perſons
ſhould be made <hi>unequall,</hi> yet may <hi>one</hi> be preferred before, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
beneath <hi>another</hi> by ſome mens opinion, or practiſe. For as
<hi>Arrius</hi> undervalued the <hi>Sonne</hi> beneath the <hi>Father,</hi> in that he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
unto him a <hi>Name</hi> below the Name of the <hi>Father:</hi> And as we
prove againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>God</hi> equall with the <hi>Father,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the identitie and ſamenes, and equalitie of his names and
attributes with the <hi>Father,</hi> being called <hi>Jehovah, Sonne of God;</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>omniſcient, eternall,</hi> &amp;c. So it will be evidently proved by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
conſequence, againſt theſe men that hold that opinion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they poſitively deny it, that they are in ſome degree in an
extreame with <hi>Arrius,</hi> preferring <hi>Chriſt</hi> above the <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe
they attribute unto him a <hi>Name</hi> greater than the name of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Secondly, They anſwer, that the <hi>ſecond Perſon,</hi> though of
himſelfe he be equall with the <hi>Father,</hi> yet in reſpect of us he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
becauſe of the worke of <hi>redemption</hi> which he hath wrought for
us. I reply. This is a ſtrange anſwer, and very unſound: for 1. the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> doe every where as much extoll the <hi>love of God</hi> in giving
his <hi>Son,</hi> as the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> in giving <hi>himſelfe.</hi> 2. This anſwer doth
not agree with the <hi>Text,</hi> for the <hi>Text</hi> injoyneth the bowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
not onely to us men, but generally to all creatures, over whom
Chriſts <hi>Name</hi> is advanced, for therfore is every knee of every thing
to bow to <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe he having a Name above every <hi>Name,</hi>
hath alſo a Name above their <hi>Names.</hi> Therefore if the Son have a
Name above his Fathers <hi>Name,</hi> by the ſame reaſon the <hi>Father</hi> muſt
bow to the <hi>Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45540:27"/>
3. By this anſwer they contradict themſelves, for when they be
challenged that in bowing at the name <hi>Jeſus onely,</hi> they honour the
<hi>Sonne</hi> above the <hi>Father,</hi> they deny it, and affirme, that they honour
all alike at the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which indeed they cannot <hi>affirme,</hi> if the
<hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> be greater to <hi>us</hi> than the <hi>other Perſons,</hi> then we to
whom he is greater, muſt honour him <hi>more</hi> than the other, that to
<hi>us</hi> are not <hi>ſo great.</hi> Even as to the <hi>ſupreame Magiſtrate</hi> in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
we give a greater honour than to thoſe that to us are not ſo
great as <hi>he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thus it is anſwered, that the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a common
name to every <hi>Perſon in Trinitie,</hi> and therefore though it be above
other <hi>Divine Names,</hi> yet it doth not make inequalitie between the
<hi>Perſons,</hi> and in bowing at that onely, they honour all alike. Now
thus they goe about to prove their <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> God ſay they, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Saviour before Chriſt was incarnate, and Jeſus and Saviour is
all one, therefore the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> denominates every <hi>Perſon</hi> of the
<hi>Trinitie.</hi> 1. I reply, If Saviour and Jeſus be all one, why then doe
they not bow as well at the ſound of <hi>Saviour,</hi> as <hi>Ieſus,</hi> for their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is the ſame for <hi>both.</hi> 2. I affirme, that they are not all one:
the word <hi>Saviour</hi> indeed, before <hi>Chriſt</hi> was incarnate, ſhewed what
<hi>God</hi> would doe in the fulneſſe of time, <hi>viz.</hi> ſend his <hi>Son</hi> to be our
<hi>Redeemer;</hi> but it is no proper Name; <hi>Jeſus</hi> is a proper name, never
<hi>appropriated</hi> to the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> till Chriſt was <hi>incarnate:</hi> and ſome
good <hi>Authors</hi> affirme, that it is the name of his <hi>humanitie onely,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
given him upon his <hi>incarnation,</hi> and he being called generally
by that name in the dayes of his <hi>fleſh;</hi> and ſundry men being ſo
called as <hi>Types</hi> of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Sermon on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.</note> though (if it be ſo) it doe denominate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us his whole <hi>Perſon, God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> becauſe of the inſeperable <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of the two <hi>natures.</hi> But Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> aſſertion here is very
ſtrange, who affirmes that the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is the proper and chiefe
Name of <hi>God;</hi> but how can it be ſo, when it is not the proper name
of <hi>Gods eternitie?</hi> but was given unto the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in time by
reaſon of mans fall. But the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> denotes Gods eternall
<hi>Being,</hi> and therefore is the proper and chiefe name of <hi>God</hi> indeed.
And, how doth the <hi>Biſhop</hi> agree with himſelfe in that place? For
thus he ſaith; <q rend="margQuotes">The <hi>Perſon</hi> is taken out of our <hi>ſight;</hi> all that we can
do, cannot reach unto <hi>it,</hi> but his Name he hath <hi>left</hi> behinde to <hi>us,</hi>
that we may ſhew by our reverence, and reſpect to <hi>it,</hi> how much
we eſteeme <hi>him.</hi>
                  </q> For if the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> doe denominate the Perſon
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as taken out of our <hi>ſight,</hi> then it denominates onely his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45540:28"/>
                  <hi>humanitie,</hi> which onely was in our <hi>ſight,</hi> for the <hi>Deitie</hi> was never in
our <hi>ſight:</hi> But if it be true, as he ſaith, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the proper name
of Chriſts <hi>Deitie,</hi> then in this ſenſe he is not gone from us, but is
with us alwayes unto the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. and lives
and dwelles in the hearts of his Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is abſurd to affirme, that nothing we can doe can
reach to <hi>Chriſts Perſon,</hi> becauſe it is out of our <hi>ſight:</hi> by the ſame
reaſon, nothing that we doe can reach to <hi>God the Father,</hi> or the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>inviſible,</hi> then farewell all <hi>Religion.</hi> If
nothing that we can doe can reach to <hi>Chriſts Perſon,</hi> then the whole
<hi>bowing</hi> can reach but to the <hi>Name,</hi> none to the <hi>Perſon;</hi> and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the <hi>Name</hi> without the <hi>Perſon,</hi> is groſſe <hi>Idolatry</hi> by their owne
confeſſion. And how can theſe men affirme, that they honour the
<hi>Three Perſons</hi> alike at the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when nothing they doe can
reach to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, By the <hi>Biſhops</hi> reaſon, if we muſt bow at the Name of
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> becauſe he is not <hi>preſent,</hi> then we muſt not bow at the
name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which name, ſaith he, ſignifieth the <hi>Deitie,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>preſent,</hi> but at the name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which ſaith he, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground, is the name of the <hi>humanitie</hi> onely, which is gone
from us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the proper and chiefe name of God, then
ſhould all thoſe that were called ordinarily by that name (beſides
Chriſt) be called by the proper and chiefe name of God, which
without horrible blaſphemy could not be yeelded unto. It is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
impietie to call himſelfe God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. Yet worthy men
were called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and never tooke any offence at it, and were never
blamed for it. Seeing then the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was given to the Second
Perſon onely upon his Incarnation, it cannot be the proper and
chiefe name of God, or of every Perſon in Trinitie; and it no where
denominates any other Perſon, but the Second Perſon onely, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a name peculiar to the Second Perſon onely.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This anſwer overthrowes their owne ground from the
<hi>Text,</hi> for if the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> be the name of the <hi>Three Perſons,</hi> then
cannot it be the name above every name in the <hi>Text,</hi> for that <hi>Name</hi>
is proper onely to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> For 1. <hi>God</hi> gave him this <hi>Name,</hi> and
that after his <hi>humiliation,</hi> therefore was it not a name naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
in him as a Perſon of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> becauſe he had it not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
Secondly, the <hi>Perſon</hi> onely in the Text that ſuffered, received
this Name, but neither the <hi>Perſon</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> nor the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45540:28"/>
ſuffered, but the <hi>Sonne</hi> onely. Therefore neither the <hi>Father,</hi> nor
<hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> received the <hi>Name above every Name,</hi> but the Sonne
<hi>onely.</hi>

               <p>BUt the reaſon is naught, why they prefer the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> above
other Divine names, for ſignification ſake, becauſe it ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
our Salvation. For who taught them to reaſon thus, have they

               <p>1. If we muſt bow at the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe it ſignifieth our <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
then we muſt rather bow at the name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe this

               <p>If we ſhould heare of ſome <hi>Potent King,</hi> that he is become a <hi>great
Conquerour,</hi> hath atchieved a <hi>noble Victory,</hi> and hath made a great
<hi>conqueſt</hi> of his enemies, &amp; hath wrought a great deliverance to his
<hi>Subjects:</hi> this Newes indeed is ſomething; but yet this generall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
doth not ſo much ſatisfie, we deſire further to heare of <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;</hi>
therefore if it ſhall be declared unto us, how the <hi>Battell</hi> was

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45540:29"/>
and we reſt better <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and contented a great deale more this
way, than before, by the <hi>generall ſignification</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Thus it is concerning the Names <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> The name
<hi>Jeſus</hi> doth but in generall ſhew Chriſt to be a <hi>Saviour;</hi> But the name
<hi>Chriſt</hi> doth in particular make knowne, how he wrought <hi>Salvation</hi>
for us; For it denotes him to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to have offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

a <hi>King</hi> to ſubdue and conquer the enemies of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and to

to teach and inſtruct us, and to make known <hi>Gods will</hi> unto us,

<hi>reaſon</hi> therefore the Name <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth more fully and cleerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

bow at the name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe it ſignifieth our <hi>Salvation,</hi> why then
doe not they bow at the word <hi>Saviour,</hi> (which they make all one
with <hi>Jeſus,)</hi> which doth as plainely, yea more plainely denote our
<hi>Salvation</hi> than the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> being better underſtood of all.</p>

               <p>TO hold that we muſt bow by the Text at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>The Conſequent is very plaine; for the <hi>Glory of God</hi> is the <hi>end</hi>
of all his workes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 4. So it muſt be the maine end of our

                  <hi>Paul</hi> preferred <hi>Gods Glory</hi>

ſurely <hi>miſſe</hi> what he ſeekes for. Now that this <hi>practiſe</hi> will make
that we preferre our <hi>Salvation</hi> above <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> it is evident,
for <hi>Jehovah</hi> is the expreſſe <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> Iſa. 42. 8. I am <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>
(ſaith <hi>God)</hi> that is my <hi>Name,</hi> and my <hi>Glory</hi> I will not give

which whoſoever will not feare, God will make his plagues wonderfull,
Deut.</hi> 28. 58.. But the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the Name that ſignifieth our
Salvation, therefore it will plainly follow, if it be neceſſary to bow
at any Name, if we will bow onely at that Name, that ſignifieth our
<hi>Salvation,</hi> and not at that Name that ſignifieth <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> we love
our ſelves above <hi>God,</hi> and regard our owne benefit more than his

               </p>
               <p>It availes not to anſwer, (as ſome doe) that <hi>Jehovah</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the Name <hi>Ieſus;</hi> and therefore in bowing to <hi>Ieſus,</hi> they
alſo bow to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and ſo glorifie <hi>God.</hi> For it is abſurd to ſay,
that the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> doth generally include the name <hi>Jehovah;</hi> for
<hi>Iehovah</hi> is of far larger extent than the Name <hi>Ieſus.</hi> The name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>

himſelfe, to be an everlaſting <hi>being,</hi> and was before the name <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi>
The Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> betokens <hi>Gods incomprehenſiblenes,</hi> his

by which he will be alſo <hi>glorified,</hi> Pro. 16. 4. It betokens
not onely his worke of <hi>Redemption,</hi> but alſo his works of <hi>Creation</hi>
and <hi>Providence,</hi> for which works ſake, <hi>the heavens and earth doe
praiſe him, and ſpeake his praiſe in all languages,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1, 2, 3.

True it is, God ſhews his Glory abundantly in becomming a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>

in the extent of his <hi>Glory:</hi> It denotes <hi>Gods Glory</hi> eſſentially in
himſelfe, and <hi>generally</hi> in reſpect of all his <hi>mightie works.</hi> The name
<hi>Ieſus</hi> denotes his <hi>Glory</hi> onely <hi>particularly</hi> in reſpect of the worke of
<hi>Redemption,</hi> and onely by way of relation to <hi>us,</hi> whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.
Therefore the reaſon aforeſaid remaines <hi>inviolable,</hi> that if
we will bow onely at that <hi>Name,</hi> that denotes Gods Glory <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>
onely, and that doth onely reſpect our owne benefit in the
worke of <hi>Redemption</hi> wrought for us; and not at that Name that
betokens his Glory <hi>eſſentially</hi> in himſelfe, and that which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to all his Attributes, and to all his mightie works, or if we
will bow onely at Gods ſaving name, and not at all at any of his
commanding Names; I ſay, the reaſon ſtands firme, we love our
<hi>ſelves</hi> above <hi>God,</hi> and regard our owne <hi>benefit and ſalvation,</hi> more
than his <hi>Glory or Soveraigntie over us.</hi> As if a Subject will not bow
to the King, but onely in regard of ſome great extraordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
beſtowed upon him, it is evident, that he regards himſelfe
more than his Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Angels,</hi> which by the Text muſt bow as well as we, upon
the ſame reaſon of the <hi>Text,</hi> cannot have reſpect to the benefit of
Salvation. They ſerve <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his Glory ſake, and as he is their
Lord.</p>
               <p>3. And laſtly Seeing <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Reprobates</hi> muſt fulfill the <hi>Text</hi>
as well as <hi>we,</hi> and that alſo upon the ſame <hi>reaſon,</hi> by theſe mens
grounds, they ſhall be more <hi>ſincere</hi> in their ſervice than <hi>we</hi> for they
muſt bow to him <hi>gratis,</hi> and as he is their Lord, but we muſt not

<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> with the <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> wherewith we now <hi>glorifie</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny that the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> is a Name, that above all
other Names puts us in minde of Chriſts <hi>ſufferings;</hi> For this Name
in the plaine ſignification of it, doth not directly ſignifie <hi>dying.</hi>
Many called <hi>God</hi> their <hi>Saviour</hi> in the old Teſtament, yet few did
ſuppoſe that God ſhould dye. Many were called by the Name
<hi>Ieſus,</hi> and many <hi>Sauiours</hi> God ſtirred up, and yet dyed not as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours.</hi>
Chriſts Diſciples knew him all along by the Name <hi>Ieſus,</hi>
yet thought he had raved, when he once put them in minde of his
<hi>death,</hi> Mat. 16. 21. But indeed the name <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth more fully put
us in minde of <hi>Chriſts ſufferings,</hi> than the Name <hi>Ieſus;</hi> for <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Anointed;</hi> it denotes him not
onely a <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> but alſo a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> whoſe office was to ſhed
bloud, therefore it directly ſignifieth <hi>dying.</hi> God if he had pleaſed
could have ſhewed his <hi>mercy</hi> without his <hi>juſtice,</hi> but he would not.
He could have been a <hi>Ieſus</hi> without becomming a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but he
could never have been a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> unleſſe he had been a <hi>Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The Conſequent is to be denied, for if the Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſhould
above all other <hi>Names</hi> ſignifie Chriſts <hi>death,</hi> it will not follow,
that therefore it is the <hi>principall name</hi> to be bowed to, 1. Becauſe
they have no ground of <hi>Scripture</hi> for it. 2. Becauſe it contradicts

the <hi>Text;</hi> for the Name above every Name is the Name that leads
us to Chriſts <hi>exaltation,</hi> and not to his <hi>ſuffering;</hi> For God <hi>exalted
him,</hi> and then gave him that name, yea he is become a <hi>perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
by his Glorification. What profit had it been to us, if <hi>he</hi> had

written upon a wall, or in a Booke, or when it is thought of; for ſo
it will put us in minde of dying as well as when it is heard. Then
alſo we muſt bow at the name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> heard, ſeene, or thought of;

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny the Conſequent, for if the fulnes of the <hi>Godhead</hi>
ſhould ſo dwell in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as that the reſt of the <hi>Perſons</hi> were ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> which is blaſphemy once to imagine, there
might be ſome <hi>ſhew</hi> for this reaſon, but the whole fulnes of the
<hi>Godhead</hi> dwels in every <hi>Perſon,</hi> in the Firſt and Third as well as in
the Second <hi>Perſon,</hi> Ioh. 14. 11. But onely here is the <hi>difference,</hi>
that the fulnes of the <hi>Godhead</hi> dwels in Chriſt onely <hi>bodily,</hi> becauſe
he onely had a <hi>body</hi> ordained for him, that he might be a perfect
<hi>Saviour,</hi> Heb. 10. 5. And becauſe he is now <hi>glorified</hi> in that body.
So that there is no reaſon for that opinion from this place, but if
there were a reaſon in this place, it makes as much for bowing at
other titles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Ieſus,</hi> yea rather at the name Chriſt, which
is onely named in the <hi>Text;</hi> for the whole fulneſſe of the <hi>Godhead</hi>
dwels no more in <hi>Ieſus</hi> than in <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they preſſe it farther, thus; <hi>Chriſt</hi> man brings us to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and we could never have conceived rightly of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45540:31"/>
by the <hi>humanitie of Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer. Chriſt <hi>man</hi> onely did not
bring us to the Father; but Chriſt <hi>Mediator, God and Man;</hi> and
though by <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are brought to the right conceiving and true
knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> it is ſenſles to inferre hence, if the conſequent
were good, that therefore we muſt bow ſolely at the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
except they can prove that Jeſus brought us to the Father, and not
Chriſt. Some ſay, that Jeſus ſignifieth <hi>Chriſts Perſon,</hi> but Chriſt
his <hi>Office,</hi> therefore we muſt bow rather at the Name Jeſus than
Chriſt. I anſwer, I have proved already, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
of our Saviour as well as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though more ſummarily, and
I affirme againe, that the Name <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth every where denote
Chriſts <hi>Perſon,</hi> as well as the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and if this diſtinction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boveſaid
could be proved true, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſignifieth our Saviours
<hi>Perſon,</hi> Chriſt his <hi>Office,</hi> yet it will be an ill Conſequent to affirme,
(if it were neceſſary to bow at Names,) that we ſhould bow onely
at that <hi>Name</hi> that ſignifieth Chriſt <hi>Perſon,</hi> and not at that name
that ſignifies his <hi>Office,</hi> ſeeing by his <hi>Office</hi> he brings us to <hi>God,</hi> and
makes knowne unto us the <hi>Father.</hi> Therefore this reaſon is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>ground,</hi> and without any <hi>light</hi> from Scripture. The onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives ſignification of upon this ground
is this: Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> brings us to <hi>God,</hi> and reveales to us the
<hi>knowledge of the Father,</hi> therefore we muſt pray to the <hi>Father</hi> in the
Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but it doth not ſay, that therefore we muſt bow
at the Name <hi>Ieſus;</hi> and upon this their ground, it may be as well
inferred, that we muſt pray to the <hi>Father</hi> by mentioning of the
Name <hi>Ieſus</hi> onely, as bow to the <hi>Father</hi> at the mentioning of this
<hi>Name</hi> onely.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION. I will ſhut up all with this Argument drawn from the Premiſes.</head>
            <p>EVery Expoſition of a Text, which doth advance the <hi>Glory</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and doth cleere the <hi>Truth,</hi> without any am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie,
and abſurditie, is to be preferred before ſuch an expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which derogateth from the Glory of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
produceth many ambiguities, and dangerous abſurdities. But this
expoſition of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10. To underſtand <hi>Name above every
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45540:32"/>
Name</hi> given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the Power, Glory, and Dominion of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> above all creatures, and things, created Powers, Dignities,
and Dominions, Gods Name and Power onely excepted, and to

            <p>But on the other ſide, To expound <hi>Name above every Name</hi> in
the <hi>Text,</hi> of the advancement of the Name or Title <hi>Jeſus,</hi> either
abſolutely or relatively, above not onely all created Names, but
alſo above all Divine Names, and Titles; and ſecondly, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
bowing every knee, of things in heaven, things in earth, and
things under the earth, in the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> of bowing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

Theſe expoſitions doe obſcure the <hi>Text,</hi> doe deface the Glory of
