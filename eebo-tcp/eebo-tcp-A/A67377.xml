            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

LETTER
FROM AN
Anti-Paedo-Baptist,
TO
DOCTOR WALLIS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read the First Part of your Discourse
concerning the Christian Sabbath, and liked
it so well, that I was very eager to get the
Second: In reading whereof, I could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at the large Measure of Understanding, which
the Lord, out of his Goodness, has been pleased to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56509:4"/>
bestow upon you, above many other Pious and
Learned Men, that have formerly Treated of the
Sabbath, and disputed against the Jewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
with so much Weakness, that the Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
have been greatly thereby incouraged in their
Errour. And coming in <hi>pag.</hi> 91. to these words of
yours, <hi>You would have had—so much modesty, as
to think, the mistake may possibly be on your side, rather
than on the whole Body of Christians (some very few
excepted) who religiously observed the Lord's Day;</hi> I
did reflect on my self, who am perswaded, that
Believers Infants are not to be Baptized in their
Infancy, contrary to the Opinion of so many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Paedo-Baptists in Christendom, yea the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Christians; and it made me to think, the
Mistake might possibly be on my side, rather than
on the Body of Christians (some few excepted)
who Conscientiously maintain Infant-Baptism. And
supposing you, Worthy SIR, by your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
to maintain Paedo-Baptism, I took courage
and boldness, to write unto your self, for to know
your Grounds from Scripture, on which you satisfy
your Conscience in that Point.</p>
            <p>The main Reason, which satisfies me against
Paedo-Baptism, is, because I can find no where in
Scripture, either in express Terms, or by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or necessary Consequence, that it is the Will
of God, that Believers Infants are to be Baptized
in their Infancy: I cannot find any Precept to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them, nor so much that ever <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist,
or Christ, or his Disciples (that appears) did Baptize
any of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56509:4"/>
I know indeed, what Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Light-foot,</hi>
and the Athenian Society presume (as to an
Institution) from a Custom among the <hi>Iews,</hi> of
their Baptizing the Infants of Proselytes, as if
Christ out of Condescension to the <hi>Iews,</hi> to win
them, did include Infants in his Precept of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
all Nations, Children being a part of them.
But I cannot find in Holy Writ any such Custom
recorded, or that it had a Divine Institution. And
if those Writings from whence they would prove,
that there was such a Custom in our Saviour's time
amongst them, were of undoubted Authority, yet
I cannot see any reason to conclude, that Christ
would institute Infant-Baptism to gratify Infidel
<hi>Iews,</hi> who were but the least part of <hi>all Nations,</hi>
(if intended there by <hi>Nations.</hi>) As <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism
was from Heaven, and was so singular a thing, that
the <hi>Iews, Ioh.</hi> 1. 25. wondring at it, asked him,
<hi>Why baptizest thou then, if</hi> &amp;c. So the Baptism
Christ instituted, was not from any Jewish Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
or Rudiment of the Jewish World, but from
Heaven, and differing from any Jewish Baptism.
That <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, and our Lord first made Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and then Baptized those Disciples, I think is
plain from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. But I cannot find, that they
also Baptized the Children of those Disciples, as
if they had been the Children of New Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes.
As our Lord did thus among the <hi>Iews,</hi> by
his Apostles, so he did by them among the Nations;
and I can no where in Scripture find, that Believing
Gentiles were counted and called Proselytes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christians, and that their Children were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for that reason. The Doctor doubtless can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56509:5"/>
certify me, whether or no it was a Custom among
the <hi>Iews</hi> and other Nations, for great Masters to
initiate their Disciples by Baptism; and if so, there
would be more probability, that Christ instituted
Baptism from that Custom, if from any, and that
as they did not Baptize the Children of those Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
too, until themselves became Disciples, so
the Children of the Disciples of Christ, the great
Prophet of God, and our Master, are not to be
Baptized, until themselves also become Disciples.
<hi>Go ye, and teach all Nations,</hi> is explain'd, <hi>Mar. 16. 15.
Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every
Creature;</hi> and thus it is by several of the Fathers
understood. And by <hi>Baptizing them,</hi> viz. <hi>all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
there is no necessity to understand it of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
all Persons absolutely, for we have the words
<hi>[all Nations]</hi> in other Texts of Scripture, where
they do not mean all Persons absolutely, but of a
capable Condition, as <hi>Adorate eum omnes gentes, &amp;
Psallitate Deo omnes Nationes,</hi> &amp;c. And if Baptism
was the way of Discipling Persons, as some would
have it, then the Apostles needed not have first
required of them Repentance and Faith, as previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Dispositions and Qualifications for Baptism,
but rather have Exhorted them to be Baptized, in
order to their being taught Faith and Repentance,
with other things commanded by Christ to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
But as it plainly appears from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that our Saviour here excludes from being
Baptized, those Persons of all Nations, that are not
yet qualify'd for it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Not yet become Disciples,
or Repenting Believers, tho' capable of Faith and
Repentance; so it does not appear to me, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56509:5"/>
Infants Disciples are here included, tho' neither qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
nor capable, as Disciples should be.</p>
            <p>Thus when, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. the Apostle tells Gentile Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
that they were compleat in Christ, seeing
they were Circumcised in him by his Circumcision,
and Buried and Risen with him in Baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Some will from hence assert, that
Circumcision came in the room of
Baptism,<note n="*" place="margin">Perhaps he meant to say, Baptism came in the room of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</note> and consequently that
Infants are to be Baptized, as before they were to
be Circumcised, which I can no ways see: Nor
was ever any such thing pleaded by the Apostles,
against the Christian <hi>Iews,</hi> that were Zealous for
Circumcision. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Christ by his Apostle, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
Baptism among the <hi>Iews,</hi> while Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
was still a Duty to the <hi>Iews</hi> and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
I grant, that it may be proved from hence,
that Circumcision was a Figure of the Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made without Hands, in the putting off the
Body of the Sins of the Flesh, but not that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
figured Baptism: Which if it could be proved
from hence, yet there does not necessarily follow
a necessity of observing this Circumstance of Age,
any more than many other Circumstances of the
Type, as that of the <hi>eighth day,</hi> of the <hi>male sex
only, &amp;c.</hi> But the Analogy will hold thus more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly:
As Infants in the latter were Circumcised,
so spiritual Infants or Babes in Christ, that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like one of these little Ones, shall be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
Therefore that Argument from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Age, being but a meer Conjecture, proves
nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56509:6"/>
The Argument which is taken from the Action
of Christ's blessing Infants, does not prove to me,
that it is the Will of God, that Infants are to be
Baptized, but rather the contrary, in as much as
we cannot learn, but that Christ dismissed them
without Baptism.</p>
            <p>As for that saying of Christ, <hi>Except a man be born
again, &amp;c.</hi> it does no more infer a necessity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant's
Baptism, than that other of his, <hi>Except ye eat
the flesh of the Son of Man, &amp;c.</hi> does infer a necessity
of their partaking at the Lord's Table. The Gospel
speaks to Persons of Years and Discretion, and it
is they whom it ties to Baptism for their Salvation,
and the Baptism which saves them, is the answer
of a good Conscience towards God in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Gospel-requirings, which Infants are
uncapable to discharge. And for the Salvation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
God is able still to bestow saving Mercies
upon Infants now immediately, as he did before
the Institution, either of Circumcision or Baptism.
Even as it is in the case of Faith, <hi>He that believeth
not, shall be damned:</hi> Now, because Children are no
more able to give assent to the Gospel, than to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
therefrom, shall we from thence infer their
Damnation? And if the want of Faith does not
Damn them till they are capable of Faith, then
much more the want of Baptism will not Damn
them, till then, and may therefore be rationally
deferr'd till then.</p>
            <p>As to the Promise of the Holy Ghost to the <hi>Iews</hi>
and their Children, I cannot understand it, but
Conditionally, <hi>viz.</hi> To them, if they should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and be Baptized, (according to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56509:6"/>
to them,) and also to their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
of the same Capacity to receive the Holy
Spirit's Effects on their Natural Faculties, upon
their Repentance and Obedience of Faith: For,
as the word [<hi>Children</hi>] in Scripture, does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
mean Infants, else it would follow, that there
were no Adult Persons in all <hi>Israel;</hi> so I see no
necessity to take it here of Infants.</p>
            <p>As for the Holiness of the Children of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
spoken of <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 7. 14. (whatever that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be) it does no more necessarily prove, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of Believers are for that reason to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
than the Holiness of the Unbelieving Parent
there spoken of, will prove, that such an Infidel
is for that reason to be Baptized. For, that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Children, is derived to them from their
Believing Parent, as it is to the Unbelieving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and not from the Gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>And whereas for an Apostolical Precedent, there
is one pretended from Baptizing of <hi>Stephanas</hi>'s
Houshold, it is but a bare Conjecture, <hi>first,</hi> that
there were little Babes in the Family, and <hi>secondly,</hi>
that they were Baptized. It is said of the Ruler at
<hi>Capernaum,</hi> that <hi>He believed, and all his House,</hi> but
it does not thence follow, that there were Infants
in his House, and that they believed as well as he.
One seems just as probable as the other.</p>
            <p>Now, Good SIR, seeing I can find no Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Domonstration, and I may say, no Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
in these Arguments, that are usually brought
from Scripture for Infant-Baptism; if you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any Arguments that carry more Weight and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56509:7"/>
Demonstration in them, for that which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be the Truth, and against that which you
believe to be an Errour, and I (at present) a Truth,
I do earnestly and humbly entreat you, for my
Soul's sake, and as you are in Christian Duty and
Conscience bound to God, to be so Good as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
them to me, for to save my Soul from such
an Errour. And as your so doing may make much,
not only for my Spiritual, but also for my Temporal
Benefit, so you will thereby greatly Oblige,</p>

ANSWER
To the Fore-going
LETTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
               <dateline>Oxford,<date>Feb. 28. 1695/6</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received last Night, from I know not whom,
a Letter (concerning Infant-Baptism) Dated
<hi>Feb.</hi> 25. and Signed <hi>C. C..</hi>........ Whether this
be a true Name, or but a feigned one, I am not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
But guess it to be the latter; because I do not
remember that I have ever heard of any Man of
that Name.</p>
            <p>And, as I do not know from whom; so, neither
do I know, how qualify'd: Whether with a modest
Desire to be informed; or a captious Humour, to
quarel or cavil at a received Truth, as being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
with a Prejudice to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56509:8"/>
If the latter; I might answer as the Apostle
doth in a like Case; <hi>If any man list to be Contentious,
we have no such custome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> And
the Scripture seems to me to be written in such a
stile, not as to gratify the nicely Captious, but to
give a reasonable Satisfaction to such as are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
willing to be taught. <hi>If any man will do his
Will, he shall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of
God.</hi> And, <hi>The meek he will teach his way.</hi> And I do
not find that Christ thought fit to comply with
those who would be curiously inquisitive for a <hi>Sign
from Heaven</hi> (when and in what manner they
pleased) to confirm his Doctrine: Or, with the <hi>Rich
Glutton,</hi> who would have one <hi>sent from the Dead</hi>
to warn <hi>his Brethren:</hi> But would take his own time,
and his own way, to satisfy those who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be taught. And, in Matters of Fact, we
must content our selves with a <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi>
though we have not always a <hi>Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</hi>
And if, then, any doubt remain, as to
Matter of Fact, we must content our selves with
such reasonable Satisfaction, as God thinks fit to
give us, what is most likely to be true.</p>
            <p>But I am willing to understand the Writer in
the other Sense; as content (without cavilling) with
a reasonable Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And then, as to this Question, concerning Matter
of Fact; Whether Christ and his Apostles, or the
Church in their time, did Baptize Infants: 'Tis
clear, on the one hand, that we cannot be certain
that they did not, (there being no intimation to
that purpose;) and it is much more reasonable to
think they did; and to practise accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56509:8"/>
I shall parallel this with another Question of like
Nature. Whether Women did then, and ought now,
to partake of the other Sacrament.</p>
            <p>If it be objected; that Christ at first did celebrate
it with Men only, (the Twelve Apostles;) and
the Apostle directs, <hi>Let a Man</hi> (not Woman or
Child) <hi>examine himself,</hi> (not her self) <hi>and so let him</hi>
(not her) <hi>eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi>
Nor do we any where, in Scripture, find any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
mention of Women receiving it.</p>
            <p>Yet I am satisfy'd, notwithstanding this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
(and so, I hope, are you) that they did
then, and ought now to receive it. Because there
is no intimation of the contrary; and there seems
to be the same reason for the Women, as for the
Men, and the like benefit to each; And Women
were Baptized (though not formerly Circumcised;)
and did (as we have reason to presume, though I
do not remember that it is expresly said so) eat of
the <hi>Pass-over</hi> (notwithstanding it be expresly said
<hi>Exod. 12. 48. No Vncircumcised Person shall eat
thereof;</hi>) The words <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Houshold</hi> being
reasonably supposed to include <hi>Women and Children</hi>
also; and that the <hi>whole Family</hi> is to be reputed as
a <hi>Circumcised Family,</hi> wherein all the Males are
Circumcised. And, the Practice of the Church,
(which is a great Presumption) hath been always
consonant, to admit Women, as well as Men, to
the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>And, in many other cases, particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
may be presumed to be supplied (from the
Reasonableness of the thing, and parallel Cases,)
though not distinctly expressed in the History of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56509:9"/>
Fact; as may be amply shewed, if that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>Now (to apply this to the present Case) we are
first to consider, what Baptism is. It is a solemn
Rite, appointed by Christ, for the solemn Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or Incorporation, of the Person Baptized,
into the Christian Church; (as Circumcision was,
into that of the <hi>Iews;</hi>) and, a Consecration or
Dedication of the Person Baptized, to the Service
or Worship of the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost.
And consequently, those who have right to be so
admitted, and so dedicated, have right to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Rite of such Admission, and Dedication.</p>
            <p>Next we are to consider, that the Children of
<hi>Christians</hi> now, have as well a right to be reputed
Members of the Christian Church, as the Children
of <hi>Iews,</hi> of the Jewish Church; and consequently
to be solemnly received into it: that is, into God's
visible Church, both of them; and both a like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to be offered or dedicated to the Service
of the True God.</p>
            <p>And it is not reasonably to be supposed, that
God would so often, and so emphatically make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to the Righteous, <hi>and their seed,</hi> if there
was not somewhat of peculiar Preference intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, beyond those of the Wicked, or those that
are out of God's Visible Church.</p>
            <p>For if no more be intended, than such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Promise, <hi>If they repent and believe;</hi> this is
equally true of the Children of the most Profligate;
and of Heathens, as of Jews or Christians. How
great that is, I will not now dispute; but what
Preference did then belong to the Jews, I think is
now common to Christians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56509:9"/>
Otherwise, Christ's Coming would render the
Condition of Children, worse than before. And
particularly, those very Children, who in the Jewish
Church were Members of the visible Church of
God, must have ceased to be so, when the Christian
Church took place.</p>
            <p>Contrary to what Christ seems to intimate, in
that of, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and
forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
Which intimates a Capacity in Children of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Heaven hereafter, and in the visible Church
here; (especially if by <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> be here
meant, <hi>the Gospel Church.</hi>)</p>
            <p>As likewise to that of, <hi>Else were your Children
unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> Which implies a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Holiness, as to the Children of One, though
not of both, Believing Parents; which they would
not have, if neither of the Parents were Believers.
Which seems to me so clear an Evidence, of some
relative Holiness, or Interest in the visible Church,
or Dedication to the Service of God; as is not easy
to be avoided.</p>
            <p>And that slight Evasion, as if it were meant
as to <hi>Bastardy,</hi> is so weak, as (with me) bears no
weight at all. For, though both Parents were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
the Child would not be a Bastard.</p>
            <p>And it is to be considered, that, in all Religions,
the Children are reputed as of the same Religion
with the Parents (while under their Care) till they
do by some act of their own manifest the contrary.
The Child of a Jew is reputed a Jew; of a Christian,
a Christian; of a Heathen, a Heathen; of a Papist,
a Papist; and so of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56509:10"/>
Now what belongs to a Church, as a Church,
doth equally belong to the Jewish and Christian
Church, and needs no new Institution: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that of having their Children in the
visible Church-Communion with themselves; and
the Blessing appertaining to that visible Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
as that of, <hi>I will be a God of thee, and of thy
Seed:</hi> And this <hi>Blessing of Abraham,</hi> is come <hi>upon
the Gentiles also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though it is true, that this doth not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intitle them to Heaven (unless their Life be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable,
as neither did that of being the Seed
of <hi>Abraham,</hi>) yet it is to be reputed a real Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
as putting them into a fairer Prospect of
Heaven, and in a greater Probability of obtaining
saving Grace, than if out of the Church.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Advantage of the Iew above the Gentiles</hi>
which they then had; the Apostle tells us, is <hi>much
every way:</hi> (Yet not so, but that a Believer, though
not a Jew, might be saved by Faith; and an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
though a Jew, would be damned without it.)
And what Advantage was then to the Jews, (as
God's visible Church,) is now common to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
also.</p>
            <p>So that the Right of Believers Children, to be
within the Church, is not a new Institution, (as if
we should now look for a distinct Institution of
<hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> beside that of <hi>Baptism;</hi>) but as old
as <hi>Adam,</hi> for ought I know; But the solemn Rite
of Admission into this Church, (to which the Child
hath a Right to be admitted) is a new Institution;
then by Circumcision, appointed to <hi>Abraham;</hi> and
now, by Baptism, upon a new Institution, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56509:10"/>
By being Believers Children, they have <hi>Ius ad
rem;</hi> and by being Baptized, they have <hi>Ius in re;</hi>
whatever be the Priviledge of being within the
Pale and Promise of the visible Church. And so
long as, by our fault, we debar them from Baptism;
we do, so much as in us lyeth, debar them of that
Advantage, whatever it be.</p>
            <p>Nor is it only a <hi>Priviledge</hi> of the Children (to
be thus early admitted into the visible Church,
with the Benefits thereto appertaining, and thus
dedicated to the Service and Worship of God;)
but a <hi>Duty</hi> of Parents, and other Superiors, thus to
dedicate them, and (so far as in them lyeth) give
them up to God. And we need not doubt, but that
the Parent hath a natural Right over the Child of
so doing.</p>
            <p>And we do not know how soon the Effect of such
Dedication (upon God's acceptance) may operate.
<hi>Samson,</hi> before he was born, was devoted by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah,</hi>
to be a <hi>Nazarite.</hi> And <hi>Samuel</hi> was, by his
Mother, <hi>vowed</hi> before he was born, and after <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi>
while an Infant, to the special Service of
God: <hi>Ieremy</hi> is said to be <hi>sanctified from his mothers
womb;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> likewise; and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
while yet unborn; and <hi>Timothy,</hi> from <hi>a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we have no reason to doubt, but many
Children very early, and even before their Birth,
may have the habits of Grace infused into them,
by which they are saved, though dying before the
Years of Discretion. My meaning is, That God
may, by his Grace, so pre-dispose the Soul, to an
aptness for Good; as (by our natural Corruption)
we are supposed to be Habitually inclined to Evil,
though not yet in a Capacity to act either.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56509:11"/>
For as the habits of Corruption, which we call
Original Sin, by Propagation; so may the habits
of Grace, by Infusion, be inherent in the Soul, long
before (for want of the use of Reason) we are in
Capacity to act either; as is also the rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
before we are in a Capacity to act Reason.</p>
            <p>And we may have Incouragement to expect, or
hope for, such Work from God on the Heart of a
Child, from our early devoting him to God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
And the proper way, by Christ appointed,
for thus devoting, or offering up persons to God,
is Baptism, into the Name, and to the Service of
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>I am loth to charge it, as a just Judgment of
God, for such neglect; when we see the unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Children, of Faulty Parents, prove lewd and
debauch'd Persons; though we have reason to fear,
it may be an Effect of not devoting them to God
by Baptism, and a neglect of suitable Education.
For as we find Corruption doth, so (through God's
Blessing) Grace may begin to act very early; And
if we <hi>may</hi> do it, certainly we <hi>ought</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>And as Persons, when they be come to Age,
ought themselves, to give up themselves, and (as
it were) enter into a sacred Covenant with God;
(and renew it, from time to time;) so may the
Parents (and ought to do it, so far as in them
lyeth) give up their Children to God, and ingage
them in such a Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>We know, amongst our selves, a Child by his
Guardians, or his Parents, may be put into the
Possession of an Estate, and engaged to the Homage
and Fealty thereunto appertaining, before himself
do understand what is done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56509:11"/>
And in such a Covenant we find the <hi>Israelites</hi> to
enter <hi>(Deut. 29. 10. &amp;c.)</hi> in the Name of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their Wives, and their <hi>little ones,</hi> and even
of those then present, and those not present at that
Day. And of a like Tenour we suppose to be those
mention'd of <hi>Ioshua, Asa, Iehojada, Iosiah,</hi> That God
should be a God to them, and they a People to him.
Which is the same, for Substance, which a Person
of Age makes for himself, and the Parent for the
Child in Baptism.</p>
            <p>And if Children be thus capable, or their Parents
for them, of entering thus into Covenant with
God; why not of receiving the Seal of such Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant?
And why not that of Baptism now, as
well as of Circumcision before? For the Child is
passive in both.</p>
            <p>And, if <hi>Capable,</hi> you admit it to be a <hi>Duty.</hi> For
your Exception is, that it is to be understood of
<hi>Persons in a capable Condition.</hi> Now, that Infants
are <hi>capable</hi> of being admitted Members of God's
Visible Church; and <hi>capable</hi> of being dedicated to
God's Service, I think is no Question; which are
the Business of Baptism.</p>
            <p>I know it is objected, that it is said <hi>Matth. 28. 19.
Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them</hi> &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are first to be Taught (which Child<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en
cannot be) before they are Baptized. And others
(who put a greater force upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
chose rather to render it, <hi>Go make Disciples all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
baptizing them</hi> &amp;c. and therefore (say they)
they are to be made Disciples (by Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance)
before they are Baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56509:12"/>
Now I can well enough admit, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
may there be rendered by <hi>make Disciples</hi> (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
better than <hi>Teach;</hi>) But their Inference from
thence, is a great Mistake.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Go make Disciples by Faith and Repentance;</hi>
will not be good Sense. For Faith and Repentance
are to be Works of the Persons Baptized, not of
the Baptizer.</p>
            <p>And 'tis preposterous to think Faith and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
intended in the word <hi>Matheteusate.</hi> For Christ
is here speaking to his <hi>Apostles;</hi> instructing them,
what <hi>They</hi> are to do in Planting a Christian Church.
(Not what each respective Christian is to do in a
Church thus planted: For that is to come-in after,
amongst the things that are to be <hi>taught.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And the words lie plainly thus; <hi>Go, Disciple all
Nations,</hi> (that is, Gather Disciples of all Nations,
or indifferently of any Nation, Jews or Gentiles,
all the World over,) <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
commanded you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus, (those who are here called <hi>Disciples,</hi>
being after called <hi>Christians; The Disciples were
called Christians first in Antioch,</hi> Act. 11. 26.) <hi>Make
Christians of all Nations, Baptizing them—and
Teaching them—.</hi> And, (if we would lay stress
upon the order of the Words, <hi>Baptizing</hi> is to go
before <hi>Teaching.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>(make Disciples)</hi> is here a
Verb Imperative, or Preceptive; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>(Baptizing and Teaching)</hi> are Participles,
Exegetical or Declarative, how that Precept is to
be discharged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56509:12"/>
And it is in a like Form as this, (if the Founder
of a Free-School should thus give Instructions to
him that he makes School-Master,) <hi>Make Latinists
of any Parish in</hi> London, <hi>taking them into the School, and
there teaching them the Latin Tongue.</hi> Or, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the University (to the Governours there)
<hi>Make Scholars, or Learned Men, of any County in</hi>
England, <hi>admitting them into the Vniversity, or a
College, and teaching them what is to be there learned.</hi>
Or, in the Language of the City (to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
suppose, of the Merchants Company) <hi>Make
Merchants of any Country; taking Apprentices; and
teaching them the Trade.</hi> (For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Disciple,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the same as a <hi>Scholar,</hi> a <hi>Learner,</hi> an <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Would any Man now think, that the Boy must
first be a Latinist, before he may be taken into the
School? Or, the Academick must be a Philosopher,
or Learned Man, before he may be admitted in the
University? Or, the Citizen a skilful Merchant,
before he may be bound Apprentice? No; but the
quite contrary. So here, he is to be entered a
Scholar in Christ's School, in order to be farther
instructed in the Christian Religion, according to
the capacity wherein he is.</p>
            <p>But, whether one do put himself an Apprentice
(if a Man, and at his own Disposal) or be put
an Apprentice by his Parents or Guardians (at
whose Disposal he is) if a Child, is all one, as to
learning a Trade: And it is all one, whether (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be thus put an Apprentice) he have some
little Skill in the Trade, or none at all. And so
here; whether he be of such Years (if not the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56509:13"/>
Child of a Christian, or have been before neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
as to have been taught somewhat of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
or yet an Infant, and to know nothing of it.
And whether (as in the former case) he offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Baptism; or (as in the latter) he be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to it by his Parents; he is to be Baptized, and
to be Instructed, each according to the capacity
wherein he is.</p>
            <p>But why it should be neglected, when it may be
had sooner, I see no reason; at least if it be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be a thing desirable, and advantageous.</p>
            <p>Now this, for the most part, was the case of the
Apostles, when they converted Jews or Heathens
to the Christian Faith. It was not to be expected,
that Men at Age, and at their own Disposal, and
brought up in another Religion, would be willing
to declare themselves Christians, and be Baptized
as such, before they knew somewhat of it; (And
therefore I would not lay so much stress upon the
Order of Words, as if a Person Unbaptized might
not be taught, if capable of it.)</p>
            <p>But when they were so perswaded as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they did (with themselves) bring in those
who were under their Power. As <hi>Lydia,</hi> and all
her Houshold; the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> and all his; the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold
of <hi>Stephanas, Cornelius,</hi> and all his; and the
like, I suppose, of others.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose I understand that of <hi>Act. 2.
Repent, and be Baptized every one of you,</hi> whether
Jews or Gentiles, (this being a mixture of many
Nations) <hi>for the remission of sins,—For the promise
is to you, and to your Children,</hi> (as well as to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and his Children,) <hi>and to as many as our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56509:13"/>
Lord shall call,</hi> (and to their Children; for this I
suppose to be understood.)</p>
            <p>For, though I know that <hi>Children</hi> doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
signify <hi>Infants;</hi> yet, if no more were meant
of <hi>their Children,</hi> than of all the World beside,
there was no occasion of Naming <hi>Children,</hi> but the
Sense had been as full without it.</p>
            <p>Now it cannot reasonably be supposed, but that
there were Children in some of those Houses; (at
least it is more likely that there were in some, than
that there were none in any of them;) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Children were then Baptized, as well as
others; especially when there is no Intimation to
the contrary.</p>
            <p>And in such Cases, where there is a silence in
matter of Fact; it is reasonable to think, it was
so, as was most likely to be; especially when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appears to the contrary, and great Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it.</p>
            <p>I know there is sometime mention of Faith, in
order to being Baptized; but it is of grown Persons.</p>
            <p>Nor is it always meant of saving Faith, and
a cordial Conversion; but a <hi>Profession</hi> of Faith, or
a professed willingness to be Baptized, and declaring
themselves Christians.</p>
            <p>For 'tis said, <hi>Simon himself believed also, and was
baptized:</hi> Which cannot be meant of saving Faith,
and a real Conversion; for we find him afterward,
<hi>in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when so many Thousands were Baptized
in one Day, we cannot think they were all singly
Examined, so as to give (at least a probable) Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of saving Grace: But, their willingness to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56509:14"/>
be Baptized, was a sufficient Evidence of their
declaring themselves Christians, or professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>all Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>all Iudea,</hi> and <hi>all
the region about Iordan</hi> (that is, great Multitudes
from all those Parts,) <hi>went out to Iohn Baptist,</hi> and
were <hi>baptized of him, confessing their sins;</hi> it cannot
be supposed that such Multitudes were all singly
Examined, and made particular Confessions of their
Sins; But, the Verbal Expressions of many, with
the silent Consent of the rest, and the concurrent
Actings of all, was an evident Declaration of their
common Sentiments.</p>
            <p>And it can hardly be thought, that they did not
(many of them) bring Children with them; since
we know they had then an Opinion, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were capable of Benefit from the Benediction
of Prophets, and Persons extraordinary; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by their bringing of <hi>little Children</hi> to Christ,
(such as to be taken up in Arms) for him to <hi>lay his
hands on them and bless them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if each of these Considerations be not,
singly, convictive: Yet so many together, of which
each is highly probable, and when as nothing (so
much as probable) doth appear to the contrary:
It seems to me so great an Evidence (in Matter of
Fact,) that Children were then Baptized; that I
do not at all doubt, but that we are rather to think,
that Infants were then Baptized, than that they
were not.</p>
            <p>To which we may add, the continual concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Churches Practice, for near Sixteen
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56509:14"/>
Hundred Years; which, in Matter of Fact, is a
great Evidence.</p>
            <p>For I do not know, that in any Age of the
Church, it was ever so much as questioned, or at
all doubted, (but that the Children of Christians
might be lawfully Baptized,) till that about 100
Years since (in our Grandfathers time) the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
in <hi>Germany</hi> did (amongst many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Notions) begin to cavil at it. When as,
in all the former Ages of the Church, nearer to the
Apostles time, I do not know that any History doth
mention, that it was ever questioned.</p>
            <p>Whereas a thing of such Daily Practice, if at
any time, in any part of the Christian Church, it
had received any considerable Opposition; it could
not be, but that some History would have taken
notice of it.</p>
            <p>And, in such a Case, a constant Silence is, to me,
a sufficient Evidence, that it hath been a constant
Practice (even from the Apostles time) without
any Opposition. And, if so, no doubt, but by them
also. And I do not know of any thing alleged,
with any shew of Evidence, why we should think
the contrary.</p>
            <p>If any (who were not the Children of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
but converted from Heathenism) have defer'd
their Baptism too long; I think they were faulty
in so doing.</p>
            <p>But if any will obstinately think, that <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> had not, each of them, Two Hands, and on
each Hand Five Fingers, because it is no where
in Scripture (that I know of) said that they
had so: And, that therefore, we are rather to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56509:15"/>
think they had not, than that they had; I cannot
help it.</p>
            <p>These are my Thoughts, hastily drawn up; and
I pray God they may (through his Blessing) be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to your Satisfaction.</p>
