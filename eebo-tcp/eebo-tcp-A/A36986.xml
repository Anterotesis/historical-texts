         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO the Favour my generous and worthy Friends have done me
in vindicating this COMEDY against the ridiculous Malice
of a prejudic<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Party be very considerable, and I ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
well satisfied with my present good Fortune, yet is not my
Contentment perfect, till I am so happy to lay it to your Feet; and by your
unquestion'd Merit, Iudgment and noble Patronage, secure the Credit of
these printed Sheets in the reading, as the Applause of the Impartial, and
Iudicious, have already done in the Presentation.</p>
            <p>The Character your Lordship leaves amongst all Persons of Honour and
Worth, has encourag'd my Ambition to aspire to this honour; and tho'
the Trifle which I humbly Dedicate to you, has not merit enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me from being thought too presuming, yet the dutious Desire and Zeal
I have to serve your Lordship, and express my Gratitude for your abundant
Favours all manner of ways, will I'm sure, by your generous Nature, that
never frown'd on an addressing Author, nor discourag'd Wit, tho' in its
meanest quality, be receiv'd as I intend it. I have too long had the Honour
and Happiness to know your Lordship to be Ignorant of your great Modesty,
when you are oblig'd to hear any thing relating to your own Praise; and I
mòst humbly beg you to believe, that I have not so much of the Authors
common Quality, and which we see so generally us'd in all Dedications, that
I do pretend to flatter Merit like Yours, or offend your Eyes with an Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium
upon your Virtues, which perhaps no Poet has Wit or Skill enough to
do you Iustice in, and which your uncommon Modesty, and admir'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
I'm sure would discourage in us if we could.</p>
            <p>The Panegyrical Part then of a Dedication, which I confess I cannot for
fear to think reasonable here, because I know it would be just in a manner
quite laid aside, for what can I say in your Praise that our little World
here does not already know, your Early Courage and Bravery of Soul, has
made its Course like the Sun, and in relation to <hi>Europe,</hi> has almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it self as far, especially where Honour was to be got, or any glorious
Action was going forward; and as I believe 'tis impossible for any Person
<pb facs="tcp:44135:3"/>
to give a better accompt of the Sieges of <hi>Vienna</hi> or <hi>Buda</hi> then your self,
you omitting no Enterprise that could either signalize your Courage, or satisfie
your Curiosity so 'tis as obvious to the World, that the Great <hi>Leopaldus</hi> by
the glorious Spread Eagle, so royally bestowed and nobly added to your
Houshold Coat, sufficiently gave a Testimony that nothing but extraordinary
Worth could be capable of gaining such an Honour.</p>
            <p>This my Lord is so poor a Diminution of so extensive a Merit, that
I'm afraid I shall rather be accused of Injustice than Flattery: for saying
any thing in your Praise could not be done without saying much more than
this, especially should I consider like a right Author, that the Muses are as
much oblig'd to you for your generous Incouragement and Protection, as your
Country is for Loyalty, Love and Resolution.</p>
            <p>To be Patron both of Arts and Arms is a Title my Lord worthy of
you, and which the Actions of your Life daily demonstrate, that you will
more and more deserve, for whilst the Sons of <hi>Mars</hi> admire your Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in War, and the Sons of <hi>Apollo</hi> your acquirements of Wit and
Iudgm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt, no Name can appear fairer in the Book of Fame, nor no Worth
better deserve to have a Subscription there.</p>
            <p>And as I cannot, my Noble Lord, but think it very reasonable for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Persons to be rewarded with Blessings as extraordinary; so I
cannot enough express my hearts entire Ioy, that the very <hi>Best</hi> that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
can bestow is lately fallen upon you, in the possession of so much <hi>Vertue</hi>
and <hi>Beauty,</hi> which to her lasting Fame is so gloriously exalted, that even
<hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> our never enough Renown'd <hi>Royall Mistress</hi> (than whom
none is more Learn'd in the Eternal Volumes of Goodness,) is full of her
Aplause, and that this extreamest Happiness which now you possess, may
Crown your Days and Nights to all Eternity is the unfeign'd and real
wish of</p>

            <p>IF I were now half flustred with Drinking, and design'd to be
malicious, as some of my back Friends were the first day this
Play was Acted, I could make as ridiculous a description of their
Behaviour in the Pit, as my Comick Characters make of others
upon the Stage; but prejudice taking no effect and I owning my self
sober, resolve to desist from any Acts of Hostility in that kind; and
could wish that my hissing Antagonists of the <hi>Nimble Craft</hi> had as
ingeniously borne a little comical Diversion where no Reflection was
singular, &amp; which my courtesie &amp; good nature took such care not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in any particular person, rather than by a noisie exploding of what
the Judges of Wit allow deserv'd it not, do themselves that Injury
which I never intended, by rendring themselves fit to be laugh'd at,
for seeming to be netled at what they might reasonably finde, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Honour (Judges of Sense and Gratitude) to whom I've the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be known, were true, <hi>viz.</hi> That I liv'd at a Boarding School
near <hi>London</hi> all last Summer, and in return of their hospitable Civility,
writ this Play ungratefully to expose 'em, I could not defend my self
from being really as guilty as they must naturally think me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but my
Stars were so happy to give an occasion of satisfying these noble persons
to the contrary before the Play was acted; and I now think it reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to inform the Reader, and the Town in general, that I never was
oblig'd more than for common Courtesies <hi>(en passant)</hi> to any of 'em,
which I may fairly say I have equally return'd, and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
upon their House keeping, in spite of Revolutions, have always
been so lucky not to have the necessity of being troublesome to
them for maintenance, or accept of any Courtesy which I could not,
or did not, return.</p>
            <p>And tho after the poor and envious Injury of endeavouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode
a thing right or wrong, I ought to be proud of my Conquest,
which has done me the favour of shewing not only the power, but
number of my Friends, and totally at their own Weapon routed my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
yet will I not expose my self by an unnecessary boast, nor
side with them in their opinion that this Comedy was writen pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to reflect on a particular Family to whom I had a prejudice, for
<pb facs="tcp:44135:4"/>
I utterly disown any such thing; for had prejudice excited me, I might
have fix'd my Characters accordingly, and given some occasion to 'em
to be exasperated, which I'm sure my Comedy has not done, all the
Scenes being general, and no Character nor D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor can any Poet be blam'd for shewing this new humour of a School,
when even our Senate House, na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ght have been <hi>York</hi> as
well as <hi>Chelsy,</hi> if the Beauty of the Place had not given me occasion to

            <p>And now to shew that even our little Railery in Plays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meerly for mirth only, yet have power to disturb even the Men and
Women of the greatest Sense, who are byass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d by other people who
mischeivously resolve to place the Reflexion upon the wrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
it has been to my amazement told me, that some Words in the
beginning of Lady <hi>Addleplot</hi>'s part, reflect upon a certain noble person
now in distress, whom by all that's sacred I am and ever was so far
from reflecting on, or doing the least unmanner'd Injury in that kind,
that I'm sorry from my Soul for his Misfortune; and if they please
to consider of the time when this Play was written, being in <hi>Iune</hi> last,
they will find 'tis impossible for him, amongst all mankind, to be the
Subject of that Scene, which touches no particular, nor person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but common Ruffians in general.</p>
            <p>As to the Comedy it self, the Success it has had is so well known,
that I need give no Further relation, only I must acknowledge my
self sensibly oblig'd both to the Patentees and Sharers for dressing it so
well, and to all the Actors in general for their extraordinary perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance:
And as Comedy, tho never so good, lessens it self to the Reader
wanting its taking Ornament of Action; so if this chance to meet with
moderate liking from the Judicious, and those that have so generally
appear'd my Friends, I shall beg leave to make use of a Couplet of the
late famous Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and say
<q>
                  <l>If but some few whom I omit to name</l>

must confess, a great part of my study there was Woman, that dear damn'd
tempting Sex as thou hast call'd 'em; I made Remarks from Rules of Physiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
studied Complections, knew whether Black or fair were true or false,
all Female Pinaccs, and how much Love would freight 'em; even blinded my
own with poring on black Eyes, to finde their subtile motions; and for Noses,
I knew all Natures from the high Roman Arch, to the sharp little turn-up Nose
that stands as if 'twere set i'th face to hang one's Hat on.</p>

                     <p>OH <hi>Will,</hi> well met; when were you last at the Boarding School?</p>

                     <p>Yesterday, Sir.</p>

                     <speaker>Old Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you must give me leave to guess your business there; nay I'll
not question you, but only let you see a Fathers Eye guided by his indulgence still
most observes when it seems least to do so: what think you of <hi>Mirtilla?</hi>
come speak freely.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>To. Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, to dissemble is a Courtiers Vice, that ne'r intends to do the
thing he promis'd: I'll speak my thought as free as Air, I think her the brightest
Jewell of her Sex, her Vertues set in her Beauty are unparalell'd; and like the
Jewel of great Tuscany, too rich for all the neighb'ring Kings to buy.</p>

                     <speaker>Old Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou speak'st my thoughts; dost love her, prithee tell me.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>To. Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Alas Sir, be not pleased to hear my Follies; my Will you know is
bounded in your Pleasure, on your Commands depends my love or liking; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
tho dress'd in Beauty, Wit, &amp; Innocence, I hear she is an Orphan, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
not fit for me to love that cannot raise her to what her worth deserves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Old Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>She may be known hereafter; &amp; not to baulk your fancy Sir, I give
you leave to exercise your liking, &amp; if you think fit license you to love her.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>To. Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Which I could do, and faithfully, but must grieve that my small
fortune—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Old Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Do not upbraid me Son; if my distresses have like clouds hung o'er
me, &amp; so involv'd thee in my sad Misfortunes, believe me 'tis no fault of mine
but fates; that thou deserv'st more I must needs confess; for tho my Son thou
art to Vertue nearer, Arts still have been thy aim, Wit, Honour, Justice, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
soft Musick, with all the train of noble Sciences.</p>

indebted to your goodness.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Old Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Thou art not in my debt, but rather I in thine; the trust I had in
the last Reign deceiving me, beggering my hopes, makes me but half a Father: I
deserv'd well, &amp; loyal Faith express'd, but Ruine was the word, and I amongst
the rest.</p>

                     <speaker>To. Merr.</speaker>
                     <p>Today Sir, who told me he was much beholden t'you for a late
Plot upon his sordid Uncle.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, for I must own I hate that vicious Fellow more than
Cowardise, tho for some private reasons I seem to indulge his Humour; more
of that hereafter; I know you are for the Boarding School this Afternoon, to
see the Fair forlorn; well, give her my Love, she'll make thee not less welcome
for't I'm sure.—Adieu.</p>

                     <p>I have maintained her there this many years unknown to any, and will proceed
till fate make ripe my project; young <hi>Amorous</hi> was framing an Intrigue till I
discover'd, &amp; diverted him with a specious Plot upon his Uncle to amend his
Fortunes; she is not of that mean desert she seems, nor my Son's Love so weak
as he pretends 'tis, Time must ripen all. Here comes Sir <hi>Rowland</hi> as merry as
Wealth and Wickedness can make him,—my first game is with him, I shall go
near to dash his jollity.</p>

starving notion that all the World laughs at, &amp; which the wiser part of it always
abhorr'd: prithee ask the young Cocking Athiest how he got his rich Widow
with 6000l. a year, &amp; see whether he answers Vertue, or the illiterate Dunce that
can scarce spell his own name, whether he got his Place at Court by Vertue;
the sweaty splayfoot Citty Putt, whether he came to be Lord Mayor by Vertue;
ask how the Laundress came to be a Lady, or the lawless Pettifogger a Judge,
and see if Vertue be the cause on't, ye old Church Weesel, ha, ha, ha.</p>

why I tell thee, like an incorrigible Sot as thou art, that Reason has nothing
to do in the business, neither the course of all humane Affairs depend on Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Reason &amp; Vertue are as useless drugs as Learning &amp; Poetry; the first is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd

                     <p>What satisfaction! Suppose I trade with some of her Aunts the Bawds, and get
the Pox, and give it her, why then the Venom of her own Nature will relieve
it, and I alone am wretched, or should I cut her into little Morsels, like a true
Serpent, every part would live, and every part would joyn agen to sting me.
No, I have it, the Purse is the Whores mortal part, I'll stab her there.</p>

'tis unreasonable to expect a separation; and if thou thinkest thy Wit or
Love could make her constant, thou art weaker still; for a Whore has no
Love but what depends on Appetite; the coursest Food often goes down the
best, and is just like one invited to an excellent Treat, yet is not satisfied,
nor thinks himself well entertained, unless after all you let him take a nasty
