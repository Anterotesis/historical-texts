            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Six years agone we had of Sex fourescore,</l>

            <l>A Book that's call'd the Gangrean, printed late,</l>
            <l>Their Authors and Opinions doth repeat:</l>
            <l>Ninescore Religions that book sheweth cleer,</l>

            <l>The Devill can turn himselfe t' an Angell bright,</l>

            <l>He did intend, like to himselfe to make 'em</l>

            <l>CAIN did pretend with ABELL, like a friend</l>

            <l>ACHITOPHELL pretended Truth and Reason,</l>
            <l>When he intended foolishnesse and treason:</l>
            <l>SAUL did pretend great love to DAVID, but</l>
            <l>He did intend how he his throat might cut:</l>
            <l>JOAB pretended to be ABNERS friend,</l>
            <l>When (with a stab) he brought him to his end:</l>
            <l>The wicked Jewes (with noyse) HOSANNA cri'd</l>

And JUDAS sayd, haile Master, when he meant</l>
            <l>Foule treason, to betray the Innocent:</l>
            <l>Thus in all Ages, since the Worlds Creation,</l>
            <l>Both Devils and men have us'd Equivocation:</l>
            <l>For as a cunning Fencer, looking down,</l>
            <l>Aymes at the foot, but means to crack the crown</l>
            <l>So squint eyd, true, false friendship, seems to see,</l>
            <l>But ne're intends, what it pretends to bee:</l>
            <l>We're too much leavend, like the Pharisees,</l>
            <l>And to all goodnesse meere Antipodes:</l>
            <l>He's counted the best man, that best can prate,</l>
            <l>Though's deeds and words be illegitimate.</l>
            <l>If our good words with good works could agree,</l>
            <l>The world no better people had then we:</l>
            <l>Yet too too many this bad time affords</l>
            <l>That cannot give to God or man good words;</l>
            <l>Nor for themselves, or of themselves can they</l>
            <l>Speak one good word in any thing they say.</l>
            <l>Their speech to God (or of God) is most base,</l>
            <l>To curse or sweare are th' only garbs of grace:</l>
            <l>Their prayers unto God are, God dam, forsake 'em,</l>
            <l>Renounce, confound, consume, the Devill take 'em;</l>
            <l>Sink, rot their soules, for evermore renounce 'em,</l>
            <l>Consume them, or in hell to powder pounce 'em:</l>
            <l>These, with some prayers like these, they night and da</l>
            <l>With great devotion fervently do pray.</l>
            <l>To God they speak thus, but when they speak of him,</l>
            <l>'Tis either to blaspheam, deride, or scoffe him;</l>
            <l>With cursed tongues, and teeth, to rend and teare</l>
            <l>His dreadfull name when they forsweare and sweare.</l>
            <l>Too oft these wretched Imps these oaths afford,</l>
            <l>By God, Christ Jesus; by the living Lord,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35135:14"/>
By God Almighty, by th' eternall God,</l>
            <l>Thus under foot his glorious name is trod</l>
            <l>By godlesse Villains, who will brag and boast</l>
            <l>That He's the bravest man that sweareth most.</l>
            <l>God is no God to them, they do reject him,</l>
            <l>Like skild Anatomists they will dissect him;</l>
            <l>They rip him up with Oaths from foot to head,</l>
            <l>His wounds, blood, heart, nailes, body, soule, and bread,</l>
            <l>His blessed and soule saving life, his death,</l>
            <l>These cursed oaths are belch'd with th' odious breath</l>
            <l>Of Hels dear hel-hounds, who to practise these,</l>
            <l>They lie and study on their beds of ease.</l>
            <l>To flourish their discourse, their brains are framing</l>
            <l>New coyned oaths, to grace pots, pipes, and gaming</l>
            <l>Sure these good fellows have some friends in hell,</l>
            <l>And with them they desire to be and dwell;</l>
            <l>Or ese they have a great desire to see</l>
            <l>Hels Kingdome, and what things the Devils bee.</l>
            <l>And as men that would travell, would attaine</l>
            <l>Some knowledge in the tongues of France, or Spaine,</l>
            <l>Th' Italian, or the High, Low, spacious Dutch,</l>
            <l>The Russe, Shavonian, Latine, Greeke, or such</l>
            <l>As is the language where they mean to go,</l>
            <l>Each Traveller these tongues would gladly know,</l>
            <l>That when they came to any forraine Land,</l>
            <l>They might the peoples speeches understand:</l>
            <l>So swearers will to hell a voyage make,</l>
            <l>And therefore they most studious pains do take</l>
            <l>To learn hels language, to blaspheam and sweare,</l>
            <l>That all their friends may understand them there:</l>
            <l>These men in their mad furies do suppose</l>
            <l>That Hel's a Kingdome where all pleasure grows;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:35135:15"/>
And that Elyzium is a pleasant place,</l>
            <l>Where soules immortall dance the wild-goose chase:</l>
            <l>Their stupid brains the Devill hath so possest,</l>
            <l>That Hel's a place of wealth, joy, peace, and rest;</l>
            <l>That Heaven's a fiction, and no place of pleasure,</l>
            <l>That to be damn'd is everlasting treasure:</l>
            <l>This is the cause they scorne to aske salvation,</l>
            <l>And pray God dam'em, and beg for damnation.</l>
            <l>'Tis wonder to see mad men beat their brains</l>
            <l>To gain perdition, and eternall pains:</l>
            <l>Of God they (like the foole) do think there's none,</l>
            <l>Or that he is a weake and simple one;</l>
            <l>One that regards not what men do below,</l>
            <l>Or sees not, knows not, how the world doth go;</l>
            <l>This is the swearers faith, his mirth, his game,</l>
            <l>Else he durst ne're blaspeam th' Almighties name,</l>
            <l>PLUTO's an asse, and BELZEBUB's a foole,</l>
            <l>And LUCIFER himselfe may go to schoole;</l>
            <l>For all the Conclave of the Devils in Hell</l>
            <l>Cannot a cursed swearer parallell:</l>
            <l>Sometimes of Christianity they'l prate,</l>
            <l>Yet live a life, abhord and reprobate.</l>
            <l>'Tis sayd, that charity at home begins,</l>
            <l>And that love hids a multitude of sins;</l>
            <l>Subjection to high Powers we are enjoynd,</l>
            <l>Obedience unto all of every kind,</l>
            <l>Of these rare vertues, swearers have no share;</l>
            <l>To no body they charitable are;</l>
            <l>I truely think he loves himselfe not well,</l>
            <l>That prayes God dam him, and doth wish for Hell:</l>
            <l>Want of selfe love and charity do prove</l>
            <l>He beares to no man charity or love.</l>

If to himselfe his love no better be,</l>
            <l>His charity and love is not for me:</l>
            <l>Can they do service to an earthly King,</l>
            <l>That oaths and curses against God dare fling?</l>
            <l>No, those as dare the heavenly power blaspheam</l>
            <l>Are no good servants for power lesse supream:</l>
            <l>The wrath of God is hot, his anger burns,</l>
            <l>And for vain swearing, the whole Land now mourns;</l>
            <l>This Nation, and the people at division,</l>
            <l>No peace but by the sanguine swords decision.</l>
            <l>The Land's o'respread with leprosie of swearing,</l>
            <l>And Gods great patience weary of forbearing;</l>
            <l>For which his plagues of slaughtering sword we find,</l>
            <l>And 'tis much fear'd famine's not far behind:</l>
            <l>Yet swearers to be Christians do pretend,</l>
            <l>Though (worse then Atheists) they their lives do spend;</l>
            <l>That Pagans, Heathens, Infidels, Jewes, Turkes,</l>
            <l>Sweare lesse, and use better words and workes.</l>
            <l>Time was, that Justice did the sword unsheath,</l>
            <l>That the blaspheamer strait was ston'd to death;</l>
            <l>And in this wicked wretched Generation,</l>
            <l>Swearing is counted manly reputation,</l>
            <l>Or recreation, or the Gentile grace</l>
            <l>Of speeches fine Embrodery, like gold lace</l>
            <l>Upon a saddle, which a sow must weare,</l>
            <l>So it becomes a Gentleman to sweare:</l>
            <l>The Devill is bad, but sure the swearer's worse,</l>
            <l>For I ne're heard the Devill did sweare or curse.</l>
            <l>What execrable creatures are they then,</l>
            <l>But Hell-hounds, and the Devils Journy-men?</l>
            <l>Himselfe doth scorn to do a worke so base,</l>

How can these men plead Christianity,</l>

            <l>Mad fooles, who every day do beg and crave</l>

            <l>Of their dear Country, and rip, rend, and tear</l>
            <l>Their mothers womb, which did such bastards bear.</l>
