         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT hath pleased Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> in
Answer to the <hi>Reasonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. and its <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
to turn one of the most
weighty and important Points that
can come into Question (Even no
less than the very Fundamentals
of the Christian Religion) into a
meer Quarrel against the Author; as
every one, with Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
In my Reply to him, I have
<pb facs="tcp:107142:3"/>
endeavour'd, as much as his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
would allow me, to bring
him to the Subject matter of my
Book, and the merits of the Cause;
Though his peculiar way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Controversie has made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for me in following him step
by step, to wipe off the Dirt he
has thrown on me, and clear my
self from those Falshoods he has
filled his Book with. This I could
not but do, in dealing with such
an Antagonist; that by the Vntruths
I have proved upon him, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may judge of those other Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of his, whereof the Proof
lying on his side, the bare Denial
is enough on mine, and indeed, are
wholly nothing to the Truth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of what is contain'd in my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
To which I shall desire the Reader
to add this further Consideration
<pb facs="tcp:107142:3"/>
from his way of Writing, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my Book, but against me
for writing it, That if he had had
a Real concern for Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in this Dispute, he would
have treated it after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
And we should have had
from him more Argument, Reasoning
and Clearness, and less Boasting,
Declamation and Railing. It has
been unavoidable for me to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of a great deal of this sort of
Stuff, in answering a Writer who
has very little else to say in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
and places his strength in
things besides, the Question: But
yet I have been so careful to take
all Occasions to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lain the Doctrine
of my Book, that I hope the Reader
will not think his Pains wholly lost
labour in perusing this Reply, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he will find some further, and
I hope satisfying, Account concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:107142:4"/>
the Writings of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi>
and the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>
contained in it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s ill Language, which
I thought personally to me (though
I knew not how I had Provoked a
Man whom I had never had to
do with) I am now satisfied by
his Rude and Scurrilous treating
of Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> is his Way and
Strength in Management of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
And therefore requires a
little more Consideration in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputant
than otherwise it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.
Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> with the Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a Christian, the Gravity
of a Divine, the Clearness of a
Man of Parts, and the Civility of
a well bred Man, made some <hi>Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversions</hi>
on his <hi>Socinianism Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd;</hi>
Which with a Sermon
Preach'd on the same Subject with
my <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107142:4"/>
he Published: And how he has
been used by Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> let the
World judge.</p>
            <p>I was extreamly surprized with
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Book, at a time when
there was so great an Outcry against
mine on all hands. But it seems
he is a Man that does not take up
things upon Hearsay; nor is afraid
to own Truth, whatever Clamor or
Calumny it may lie under. Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
confidently tells the World,
that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> has been drawn in to
espouse this Cause, upon base and
mean Considerations. Whose Picture
of the two, such a Description is
most likely to give us, I shall leave
to the Reader to judge, from what
he will find in their Writings on
this Subject. For as to the Persons
themselves, I am equally a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to them both: I know not the
Face of either of them: And having
<pb facs="tcp:107142:5"/>
hitherto never had any Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> I shall begin
with him, as I did with Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
in Print; and here publickly
return him this following Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
for what he has Printed in
this Controversie.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To Mr. Bold.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THough I do not think I
ought to return Thanks to
any one for being of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
any more than to fall out
with him for differing from me;
Yet I cannot but own to all the
World the Esteem that I think
is due to you, for that Proof
you have given of a Mind and
Temper becoming a true Minister
of the Gospel, in appearing as you
<pb facs="tcp:107142:5"/>
have done, in the Defence of a
point, a great point of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which it is evident you could
have no other temptation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declare
for, but the love of Truth.
It has fared with you herein no
better than with me. For Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
not being able to Answer
your Arguments, has found out
already that you are a <hi>Mercenary,</hi>
defending a Cause against your
<hi>Perswasion</hi> for <hi>hire;</hi> and that you
<hi>are sailing to</hi> Racovia <hi>by a side
Wind:</hi> Such Inconsistencies can
one (whose Business it is to Rail
for a Cause he cannot defend)
put together to make a noise with:
And he tells you plainly what you
must expect, if you write any
more on this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> to
be pronounced a downright <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi>
and <hi>Renegado.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:107142:6"/>
As soon as I saw your <hi>Sermon</hi>
and <hi>Animadversions,</hi> I wonder'd
what Scare-Crow Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
would set up, wherewith he
might hope to deterr Men of
more Caution than Sense from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them: Since <hi>Socinianism,</hi>
from which you were known to
be as remote as he, I concluded
would not do. The unknown
Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> he might make a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,
Mahometan, Atheist,</hi> or
what sort of <hi>Raw-head</hi> and <hi>Bloody-bones</hi>
he pleased. But I imagined
he had had more sence than to
venture any such Aspersions on a
Man whom, though I have not
yet the Happiness personally to
know; yet I know hath justly
a great and settled Reputation
amongst worthy Men: And I
thought that that Coat which you
<pb facs="tcp:107142:6"/>
had worn with so much Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
might have preserved you
from the bespatterings of Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
Dunghil. But what is to
be expected from a Warrier that
hath no other Ammunition, and
yet ascribes to himself Victory from
hence, and with this Artillery
imagines he carries all before
him? And so <hi>Skimmington</hi> Rides
in Triumph, driving all before
him by the Ordures that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
on those that come in his
way. And were not Christianity
concerned in the case, a Man
could scarce excuse to himself the
Ridiculousness of entering into
the List with such a Combatant.
I do not therefore wonder that
this mighty Boaster, having no
other way to Answer the Books
of his Opponents, but by popular
Calumnies, is fain to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb facs="tcp:107142:7"/>
to his only Refuge, and
lay out his natural Talent in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
and Slandering the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
But I see, by what you
have already writ, how much
you are above that; and as you
take not up your Opinions from
Fashion or Interest, so you quit
them not to avoid the malicious
Reports of those that do: Out
of which number, they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be left, who (unprovoked) mix
with the management of their
Cause, Injuries and ill Language
to those they differ from. This,
at least I am sure, Zeal or Love
for Truth, can never permit Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to be used in the Defence
of it.</p>
                  <p>Your Mind I see prepar'd for
Truth, by resignation of it self
not to the Traditions of Men,
but the Doctrine of the Gospel,
<pb facs="tcp:107142:7"/>
has made you more readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain,
and more easily enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the meaning of my Book,
than most I have heard speak of
it. And since you seem to
me to comprehend, what I have
laid together, with the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Mind, and in the
same Sence that I received it,
from the Holy Scriptures, I shall
as a mark of my respect to you,
give you a particular Account of
the Occasion of it.</p>
                  <p>The Beginning of the Year in
which it was Published, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
that made so much noise
and heat amongst some of the
Dissenters, coming one Day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
into my Mind, drew
me by degrees into a stricter and
more through Enquiry into the
Question about Justification. The
Scripture was direct and plain,
<pb facs="tcp:107142:8"/>
that 'twas Faith that justified,
The next Question then, was what
Faith that was that justified;
What it was which, if a Man
believed, it should be imputed to
him for Righteousness. To find
out this, I thought the right way
was to Search the Scriptures;
and thereupon betook my self
seriously to the Reading of the
New Testament, only to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
What that produced, you
and the World have seen.</p>
                  <p>The first View I had of it seem'd
mightily to satisfie my mind, in
the Reasonableness and Plainness
of this Doctrine; But yet the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Silence I had in my little
Reading met with, concerning
any such thing, awed me with
the Apprehension of Singularity;
Till going on in the Gospel Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
the whole tenour of it
<pb facs="tcp:107142:8"/>
made it so clear and visible, that
I more wonder'd that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
did not see and imbrace it;
than that I should assent to what
was so plainly laid down, and so
frequently inculcated in Holy
Writ, though Systems of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
said nothing of it. That
which added to my Satisfaction,
was, that it led me into a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the marvellous and
divine Wisdom of our Saviour's
Conduct, in all the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his promulgating this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
as well as of the necessity
that such a Law-giver should be
sent from God for the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Morality of the World;
Two Points that I must confess,
I had not found so fully and
advantageously explain'd in the
Books of Divinity I had met
with, as the History of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<pb facs="tcp:107142:9"/>
seem'd to me, upon an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
Perusal, to give Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Matter for. But the
Necessity and Wisdom of our
Saviour's opening the Doctrine
(which he came to publish) as
he did in Parables and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ways of speaking, carries
such a Thread of Evidence
through the whole History of
the Evangelists, as I think is
impossible to be resisted; and
makes it a Demonstration, that
the Sacred Historians did not
write by concert as Advocates,
for a bad Cause, or to give
Colour and Credit to an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
they would Usher into the
World; Since they, every one of
them, in some place or other,
omit some Passages of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Life, or Circumstances of
his Actions; which shew the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:107142:9"/>
and Wariness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
and which even those of
the Evangelists, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
do barely and transient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mention, without laying any
Stress on them, or making the
least remark of what Consequence
they are to give us our Saviour's
true Character, and to prove the
Truth of their History. These are
Evidences of Truth and Sincerity,
which result alone from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, and cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by any Art or Contrivance.</p>
                  <p>How much I was pleased with
the growing Discovery, every Day,
whilst I was employed in this
search, I need not say. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Harmony, that the farther I
went, disclosed it self, tending to
the same Points, in all the parts of
the sacred History of the Gospel,
was of no small Weight with me
<pb facs="tcp:107142:10"/>
and another Person, who every
Day, from the beginning to the
end of my search, saw the Progress
of it, and knew at my first setting
out, that I was ignorant whither it
would lead me; and therefore,
every Day, asked me what more
the Scripture had taught me. So
far was I from the thoughts of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism,</hi>
or an Intention to write
for that or any other Party, or to
publish any thing at all. But when
I had gone through the whole, and
saw what a plain, simple, reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing Christianity was, suited
to all Conditions and Capacities;
and in the Morality of it now,
with divine Authority, established
into a legible Law, so far surpassing
all that Philosophy and humane
Reason had attain'd to, or could
possibly make effectual to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Mankind; I was flatter'd
<pb facs="tcp:107142:10"/>
to think it might be of some use
in the World; especially to those
who thought either that there was
no need of Revelation at all, or
that the Revelation of our Saviour
required the Belief of such Articles
for Salvation, which the settled
Notions and their way of reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in some, and want of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in others, made impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them. Upon these two
Topicks the Objections seemed to
turn, which were with most As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
made by <hi>Deists</hi> against
<hi>Christianity;</hi> But against <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
misunderstood. It seem'd to
me, that there needed no more to
shew them the Weakness of their
Exceptions, but to lay plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them the Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles, as deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scriptures, and not as
taught by the several Sects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
<pb facs="tcp:107142:11"/>
This tempted me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it, not thinking it deserved an
Opposition from any Minister of
the Gospel; and least of all, from
any one in the Communion of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> But so it is,
that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Zeal for he
knows not what (for he does not
yet know his own Creed, nor
what is required to make him a
Christian) could not brook so
plain, simple, and intelligible a
Religion: But yet not knowing
what to say against it, and the
Evidence it has from the Word of
God, he thought fit to let the Book
alone, and fall upon the Author.
What great Matter he has done in
it I need not tell you, who have
seen and shew'd the Weakness of
his Wranglings. You have here,
Sir, the true History of the Birth of
my <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity, as
<pb facs="tcp:107142:11"/>
delivered in the Scriptures,</hi> and
my Design in publishing it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
What it contains, and how much
it tends to Peace and Union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Christians, if they would
receive Christianity as it is, you
have discovered. I am,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <p>My Readers will pardon me that
in my Preface to them I make this
particular Address to Mr. <hi>Bold.</hi>
He hath thought it worth his while
to defend my Book. How well he
has done it, I am too much a Party
to say: I think it so sufficient to
Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> that I needed not
have troubled my self any further
about him on the account of any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that remains in his Book to
be Answer'd. But a great part of the
<pb facs="tcp:107142:12"/>
World judging of Contests about Truth,
as they do of popular Elections, that
the Side carries it where the greatest
Noise is; 'twas necessary they should
be undeceived, and be let see, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
such Writers may be let alone,
not because they cannot, but because
they deserve not to be answer'd.</p>
            <p>This farther I ought to Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> and own to the
World, that he hath entered into the
true sence of my Treatise, and his
Notions do so perfectly agree with
mine, that I shall not be afraid by
Thoughts and Expressions very like
his in this my Second Vindication,
to give Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> (who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
quick-sighted and positive in
such Matters) a handle, to tell the
World, that either I borrowed this
my <hi>Vindication</hi> from Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> or
writ his <hi>Animadversions</hi> for him.
The former of these I shall count no
discredit, if Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> think fit
<pb facs="tcp:107142:12"/>
to charge me with it: And the latter
Mr. <hi>Bold's</hi> Character, is Answer
enough to. Though the Impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I doubt not, will find that the same
Vniform Truth consider'd by us, sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
the same Thoughts to us both,
without any other Communication.</p>
            <p>There is another Author, who in
a Civiller Stile hath made it necessary
for me to Vindicate my Book from a
Reflection or two of his, wherein he
seems to come short of that Candor
he Professes. All that I shall say on
this Occasion here is, that it is a
wonder to me, that having published
what I thought the Scripture told me
was the Faith that made a Christian,
and desired that if I was mistaken,
any one that thought so, would have
the goodness to inform me better; so
many with their Tongues, and some
in Print, should intemperately find
fault with a poor Man out of his
Way, who desires to be set right;
<pb facs="tcp:107142:13"/>
and no one who blames his Faith,
as coming short, will tell him what
that Faith is which is required to
make him a Christian. But, I hope,
that amongst so many Censurers, I
shall at last find one, who knowing
himself to be a Christian upon other
Grounds than I am, will have so
much Christian Charity as to shem
me what more is absolutely necessary
to be believed by me, and every Man,
to make him a Christian.</p>

            <head>A Second Vindication of the
Reasonableness of Christianity, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A Cause that stands in need of
Falshoods to support it, and an
Adversary that will make use
of them deserve nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
which I doubt not but every
considerate Reader thought Answer
enough to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s <hi>Socinianism
Unmask'd.</hi> But since in his late <hi>Socinian
Creed,</hi> he says, <hi>I would</hi> have answer'd
him <hi>if I could,</hi> That the Interest of
Christianity may not suffer by my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
nor the contemptibleness of his
Treatise afford him matter of Triumph
amongst those who lay any weight
on such boasting, 'tis fit it should be
shewn what an Arguer he is, and how
well he deserves for his Performance to
be dubb'd by himself <hi>Irrefragable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those, who like Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> dare
to publish Inventions of their own for
Matters of Fact, deserve a name so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd,
that it finds not room in civil
Conversation. This secures him from
the proper Answer due to his Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107142:14"/>
to me in Print of Matters of Fact
utterly false, which without any Reply
of mine, fix upon him that Name
(which without a profligate Mind, a
Man cannot expose himself to) till he
hath proved them. Till then he must
wear what he has put upon himself.
This being a Rule which common Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
hath prescribed to the private
Judgments of Mankind, as well as to the
publick Judicatures of Courts, That all
Allegations of Fact brought by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Parties should be presum'd to be
false till they are proved.</p>
            <p>There are two ways of making a
Book unanswerable. The one is by the
clearness, strength and fairness of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation.
Men who know how to
write thus, are above bragging what
they have done, or boasting to the
World that their Adversaries are
<hi>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>led.</hi> Another way to make a
Book unanswerable, is to lay stress
on Matters of Fact foreign to the
Question, as well as to Truth; and to
stuff it with Scurrility and Fiction.
This hath been always so evident to
common sense, that no Man who
had any regard to Truth or Ingenuity,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107142:14"/>
ever thought Matters of Fact besides
the Argument, and Stories made at
pleasure, the way of managing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.
Which shewing only the
want of Sense and Argument, could,
if used on both sides, and in nothing
but downright railing: And he must
always have the better of the Cause,
who has Lying and Impudence on his
side.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi> in the Entrance of
his Book, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts a great distance between
his and my way of Writing. I am
not sorry that mine differs so much as
it does from his. If it were like his,
I should think, like his, it wanted the
Author's Commendations. For, in
his first Paragraph, which is all laid
out in his own Testimony of his own
Book, he so earnestly bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaks an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Mastery in Politeness, Order,
Coherence, Pertinence, Strength, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness,
Temper, and all the good
Qualities requisite in Controversie, that
I think, since he pleases himself so much
with his own good opinion, one in pity
ought not to go about to rob him of
so considerable an Admirer. I shall
not therefore contest any of those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107142:15"/>
he ascribes to himself, or
Faults he blames in me in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of the Dispute between us,
any further than as particular Passages
of his Book, as I come to examine
them, shall suggest unavoidable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
to me. I think the World does
not so much concern it self about him
or me, that it need be told, in that
Inventory he has given of his own
good Parts in his first Paragraph, which
of us two has the better hand at <hi>Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
Iesting, and Common-Places;</hi> If
I am, as he says, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. troubled with
<hi>angry Fits and passionate Ferments, which
though I strive to palliate, are easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable,</hi>
&amp;c. and he be more lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
Ingenuous in the openness of that
Temper, which he shews in every
Leaf, I shall leave to him the entire
glory of boasting of it. Whatever we
brag of our Performances, they will
be just as they are, however he may
think to add to his by his own Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums
of them. The difference in
Stile, Order, Coherence, good Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
(for all those amongst others the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> mentions) the Reader will
observe, whatever I say of them: and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107142:15"/>
at best they are nothing to the question
in hand. For, though I am a <hi>Tool,
Pert, Childish, Starch'd, Impertinent,
Incoherent, Trifling, Weak, Passionate,</hi> &amp;c.
Commendations I meet with before I
get to the 4th. Page, besides what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
as <hi>Upstart Racovian,</hi> p. 24. <hi>Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scribler,</hi> p. 41. <hi>Dissembler, 106. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick,</hi>
107. I say, although I am
all this, and what else he liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
on me in the rest of his Book,
I may have truth on my side, and that
in the present case serves my turn.</p>
            <p>Having thus placed the Laurels upon
his own Head, and sung Applause to
his own Performance, he, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as he thinks, upon his Business,
which ought to be, as he confesses,
<hi>pag. 3. to make good his former charges.</hi>
The first whereof he sets down in these
words. That <hi>I unwarrantably crowded
all the necessary Articles of Faith into
one, with a design of favouring Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it may be permitted to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
to be so bold with one, who is
already Conqueror, I desire to know,
where that Proposition is laid down in
these terms as laid to my Charge.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107142:16"/>
Whether it be true, or false, shall, if
he pleases, be hereafter examined: But
it is not at present the Matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
There are certain Propositions,
which he having affirm'd and I denied,
are under debate between us: And
that the Dispute may not run into an
endless ramble by multiplying of new
before the Points in contest are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
those ought first to be brought
to an issue.</p>
            <p>To go on therefore in the order of
his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd</hi> (for <hi>p.</hi> 3. he
has out of the Mishna taught me good
Breeding, <hi>to answer the First first, and
so in order)</hi> the next thing he has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, is <hi>p.</hi> 5. which, that the
Reader may understand the force of,
I must inform him, that in the 105. <hi>p.</hi>
of his <hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of
Atheism,</hi> he said, that I <hi>give this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
conceit,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>over and over
again in these formal words,</hi> viz. <q>
                  <hi>That
nothing is required to be believed by
any Christian man but this, that Iesus

that this guilty Man would be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107142:16"/>
shifting off the Indictment, by excepting
against the formality of Words, as if
such were not to be found in his Book:
But when doth he do this? in the close of
it, when his Matter was exhausted, and
he had nothing else to say,</hi> Vind. <hi>p. 38.
then he bethinks himself of this salvn,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Answ.</hi> As if a Falshood were ever the
less a Falshood, because it was not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
or would grow into a Truth
if it were not taken notice of, before
the 38th. Page of the Answer. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to shew me these <hi>formal words
over and over again</hi> in my <hi>Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christianity:</hi> Nor let him hope
to evade by saying, I would be <hi>shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by excepting against the formality of
the words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To say that <hi>I have over and over
again those formal words</hi> in my Book,
is an Assertion of a Matter of Fact,
let him produce the words, and justifie
his Allegation; or confess, that this is
an Untruth publish'd to the World:
And since he makes so bold with Truth
in a Matter visible to every Body, let
the World be Judge, what Credit is
to be given to his Allegations of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, in things foreign to what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107142:17"/>
I have Printed; and that are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of a Negative Proof. A sample
whereof the Reader has at the entrance

                  </gap>,</hi> Page <hi>A</hi> 4, and the
three or four following Pages. Where
he affirms to the World not only what
I know to be false; but what every
one must see, he could not know to
be true. For he pretends to know
and deliver my Thoughts. And what
the Character is of one that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
affirms what he does not know,
no body need be told.</p>
            <p>But he adds, <hi>I had before Pleaded
to the Indictment, and thereby owned it
to be true.</hi> This is to make good his
Promise, <hi>p.</hi> 3. to keep at a distance
from <hi>my feeble strugglings.</hi> Here this
strong Arguer must prove, that what
is not answer'd or deny'd in the very
beginning of a Reply, or before the
38th. Page, <hi>is owned to be true.</hi> In
the mean time till he does that, I shall
desire such of my Readers as think
the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Veracity worth the
examining to see in my <hi>Vindication,</hi>
from <hi>p.</hi> 26. to 31. wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
what I have said about <hi>one
Article,</hi> whether I have <hi>owned,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107142:17"/>
what he charged me with, on that
Subject.</p>
            <p>This Proposition then remains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him still to be proved, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I.</head>
               <p>That I have over and over again
these formal words in my <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of Christianity,</hi> viz.
That nothing is required to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by any Christian Man, but
this, That Iesus is the Messiah.</p>
               <p>He goes on <hi>pag. 5. And indeed he
could do no other, for it was the main
Work he set himself about to find but
one Article of Faith in all the Chapters
of the four Evangelists, and the Acts of
the Apostles.</hi> This is to make good
his Promise, <hi>pag. 3. To clear his Book
from those sorry Objections and Cavils I
had raised against it.</hi> Several of my
<hi>sorry Objections and Cavils</hi> were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to the Reader, that a great
part of what he said was nothing but
<hi>Suspicions</hi> and <hi>Conjectures,</hi> and such he
could not but then own them to be.
But now he has rid himself of all his
<hi>Conjectures,</hi> and has raised them up
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107142:18"/>
into direct positive Affirmations, which
being said with Confidence without
Proof, who can deny, but he has clear'd,
throughly clear'd that part from my
<hi>sorry Objections and Cavils?</hi> He says <hi>it
was the main Work I set my self about to
find but one Article of Faith.</hi> This I must
take the liberty to deny: And I desire
him to prove it. A Man may <hi>set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to find two,</hi> or as many as there be,
and yet find but one: Or a Man may
<hi>set himself to find but one,</hi> and yet
find two or more. It is no Argument
from what a Man has found, to prove
what was his <hi>main Work</hi> to find, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
where his aim was only to find
what there was, whether more or less.
For a Writer may find the Reputation
of a poor contemptible Railer; Nay,
of a downright impudent Lyar, and
yet no body will think it was his
main work to find that. Therefore
Sir, if you will not find what 'tis
like you did not seek, you must prove
those many confident Assertions, you
have published, which I shall give
you in tale whereof this is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

               <p>In the following part of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
he quotes my own words, with
the Pages where they are to be found;
The first time, that, in either of his
two Books against me, he has vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to do so, concerning <hi>one Article,</hi>
wherewith he has made so much noise.
My words in <hi>pag.</hi> 192. of my <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness
of Christianity,</hi> stand thus;
<q>
                     <hi>For that this is the sole Doctrine
pressed and required to be believed
in the whole tenor of our Saviour's and
his Apostles preaching, we have shew'd
through the whole History of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
and Acts, and I challenge them to
shew that there was any other Doctrine
upon their assent to which, or disbelief
of it, Men were pronounced Believers
or Unbelievers, and accordingly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the Church of Christ, as
Members of his Body, as far as mere
Believing could make them so; or
else kept out. This was the only Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107142:19"/>
Article of Faith which was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to them.</hi>
                  </q> Out of this Passage,
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> sets down these words,
<q>
                     <hi>This is the SOLE Doctrine pressed
and required to be believed in the
whole tenor of our Saviour's and his
Apostles preaching,</hi> p. 129. <hi>this was
the ONLY Gospel Article of Faith
which was preach'd to them.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I shall pass by all other Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that this way of citing these
words would suggest, and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that if he brought these words
to prove the immediately preceding
Assertion of his, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>to find but
one Article of Faith was the main Work
I set my self about.</hi> This Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into form will stand thus.</p>
               <p>He who says, that this is the sole
Doctrine pressed and required to be
believed, in the whole tenor of our
Saviour's and his Apostles Preaching,
upon their assent to which, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of it, Men were pronounced
Believers or Unbelievers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
received into the Church
of Christ, as Members of his Body,
as far as mere believing could make
them so, or else kept out, sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107142:19"/>
to find out but One Article of
Faith, as his main Work. But the
Vindicator did so: <hi>Ergo:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this were the use he would make
of those words of mine cited, I must
desire him to prove the <hi>major.</hi> But
he talks so freely, and without book,
every where, that I suppose he thought
himself, by the Privilege of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer,
exempt from being called
strictly to an Account for what he so
loosely says, and from proving what
he should be called to Account for.
Rail lustily, is a good Rule, something
of it will stick, true or false, proved
or not proved.</p>
               <p>If he alledges these words of mine,
to answer my Demand, <hi>Vind. p.</hi> 27.
where he found that <hi>I contended for
one single Article of Faith, with the
exclusion and defiance of all the rest</hi>
which he had charged me with. I
say, it proves this as little as the
former. For to say, <q>That I had
shew'd through the whole History
of the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and the <hi>Acts,</hi>
that this is the sole Doctrine, or
only Gospel-Article pressed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believed in the whole
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107142:20"/>
Tenor of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Preaching; upon their assent
to which, or disbelieving of it,
Men were pronounced Believers or
Unbelievers, and accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Church of Christ,
or kept out;</q> is the simple Assertion
of a positive Matter of Fact, and so
carries in it no <hi>defiance,</hi> no, nor <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of any oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Doctrinal or Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Truth contained in the Scripture:
And therefore it remains still on the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> to shew where 'tis I express
any <hi>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iance</hi> of any other Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Word of God; or where
I exclude any one Doctrine of the
Scriptures. So that if it be true, that
I <hi>contend for one Article,</hi> my Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be without any <hi>defiance,</hi> or
so much as <hi>exclusion</hi> of any of the rest,
notwithstanding any thing contained
in these words. Nay, if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that I am in a mistake, and that
this was not the sole Doctrine which
our Saviour and his Apostles preached,
and upon their assent to which, Men
were admitted into the Church; yet
the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Accusation would be
never the truer for that, unless it be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107142:20"/>
necessary, that he that mistakes in one
Matter of Fact, should be at <hi>defiance</hi>
with all other Truths; or, that he
who erroneously says, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles admitted Men
into the Church upon the believing
him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> does thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all other Truths published to the
Jews before, or to Christian Believers
afterwards.</p>
               <p>If these words be brought to prove,
that I contended for <hi>one Article,</hi> barely
<hi>one Article,</hi> without any <hi>defiance</hi> or
<hi>exclusion</hi> annext to that Contention;
I say, neither do they prove that, as
is manifest from the words themselves,
as well as from what I said elsewhere
concerning the Article of One God.
For here, I say, this is the only <hi>Gospel</hi>-Article,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which Men were
pronounced Believers; which plainly
intimates some other Article known
and believed in the World before, and
without the Preaching of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>To this the <hi>Unmasker</hi> thinks he has
provided a <hi>Salvo</hi> in these words, <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism
Unmask'd,</hi> pag. 6. <hi>And when I
told him of this one Article, he knew
well enough that I did not exclude the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107142:21"/>
Article of the Deity, for that is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Natural Religion.</hi> If it be fit
for an <hi>Unmasker</hi> to perceive what is in
debate, he would know, that the
Question is not, what he <hi>excluded</hi> or
<hi>excluded not,</hi> but what Articles he
charged me to have <hi>excluded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Taking it therefore to be his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(which it must be, if he meant
any thing to the purpose,) <hi>viz.</hi> That
when he charged me so often and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
for contesting for <hi>one Article,
viz.</hi> that <hi>Iesus was the Messiah,</hi> he did
not intend to accuse me for excluding
<hi>the Article of the Deity.</hi> To prove
that he did not so intend it, he tells
me, that I <hi>knew that he did not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> How should I know it? he
never told me so either in his Book,
or otherwise. This I know, that he
said, <hi>pag.</hi> 115. That I <hi>contended for
one Article, with the exclusion of all the
rest.</hi> If then the belief of the Deity,
be an Article of Faith, and be not the
Article of <hi>Iesus</hi> being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> it is
one <hi>of the rest;</hi> and if <hi>all the rest</hi> were
excluded, certainly that being one of
<hi>All the rest,</hi> must be excluded. How
then he could say, I <hi>knew that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107142:21"/>
it not, i. e.</hi> meant not that I
<hi>excluded</hi> it, when he positively says
I did <hi>exclude</hi> it, I cannot tell, unless
he thought that I knew him so well,
that when he said one thing, I knew
that he meant another, and that the
quite contrary.</p>
               <p>He now it seems acknowledges that
I affirmed, that the Belief of the Deity,
as well as of <hi>Iesus</hi> being the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
was required to make a Man a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.
The Believing in <hi>one God the
Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and
Earth,</hi> is one Article; and in <hi>Iesus
Christ his only Son our Lord,</hi> is another
Article. These therefore being <hi>two
Articles,</hi> and both asserted by me to
be required to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
let us see with what truth or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> could apply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that above-mention'd, these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Expressions to me, as he does
without any exception. <hi>Why then
must there be</hi> one <hi>Article, and</hi> no more?
<hi>pag. 115. Going to make a Religion for
his Mermidons, he contracts all into</hi> one
<hi>Article, and will trouble them with</hi> no
more, <hi>pag. 117. Away with Systems,
away with Creeds, let us have but</hi> one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107142:22"/>
Article, <hi>though it be</hi> with the defiance
of all the rest, <hi>pag. 118. Thus we see
why he reduces</hi> all Belief <hi>to that</hi> one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
before rehearsed,</hi> pag. 120. And
all this without any the least Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Article of a Deity,</hi> as he now
pretends. Nor could he indeed, as is
evident from his own words, <hi>pag. 121,
122. To conclude, This Gentleman and
his Fellows are resolved to be</hi> Unitarians,
<hi>they are for</hi> one <hi>Article of Faith, as
well as</hi> one <hi>Person in the Godhead:—
But if these learned Men were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced—
they would perceive, that
when the</hi> Catholick Faith <hi>is thus brought
down to</hi> one single Article, <hi>it will soon
be reduced to</hi> none, <hi>the</hi> Unite <hi>will
dwindle into a</hi> Cypher. By which
the Reader may see, that his Intention
was, to persuade the World, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<hi>ALL BELIEF,</hi> the <hi>CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK
FAITH</hi> (they are his own
words) <hi>to One Single Article and no
more.</hi> For if he had given but the
least hint, that I allowed of <hi>Two,</hi> all
the wit and strength of Argument
contained in <hi>Unitarians, Unite,</hi> and
<hi>Cypher,</hi> with which he winds up all,
had been utterly lost, and dwindled
into palpable Nonsence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:107142:22"/>
To demonstrate that this was the
sence he would be understood in, we
are but to observe what he says again,
<hi>pag.</hi> 50. of his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi>
where he tells his Readers, That <hi>I, and
my Friends, have new-modell'd the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
Creed; yea indeed, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
them with ONE Article, instead
of TWELVE.</hi> And hence we may
see what Sincerity there is in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he brings to prove that he did not
exclude the <hi>Article of the Deity. For,</hi>
says he, <hi>p. 6. That is a Principle of
Natural Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Ergo, He did not in positive
words, without any exception, say,
I reduced <hi>All Belief, the Catholick
Faith, to one single Article, and no
more.</hi> But to make good his Promise,
<hi>not to resemble me in the little Artifices
of Evading,</hi> he wipes his Mouth, and
says at the bottom of this Page, <hi>But
the Reader sees his</hi> [the Vindicator's]
<hi>shuffling.</hi> Whilst the Article of <hi>One
God</hi> is a part of <hi>ALL Belief, a part of the
Catholick Faith,</hi> ALL which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
I excluded, but the one Article
concerning the <hi>Messiah,</hi> every one
will see where the <hi>shuffling</hi> is: And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107142:23"/>
if it be not clear enough from those
words themselves, let those above
quoted out of <hi>pag.</hi> 50. of his <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
Unmask'd,</hi> where he says, That
<hi>I have new-modell'd the Apostles Creed,
and presented the World with ONE Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
instead of TWELVE,</hi> be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of them. For if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of <hi>One Eternal God, Maker of
Heaven and Earth,</hi> be one of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Apostles Creed, and the one
Article I <hi>presented</hi> them with be not
that, 'tis plain, he did and would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to mean, that by my one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
I excluded that of the One Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God, which Branch soever of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
either Natural or Revealed, it
belongs to.</p>
               <p>I do not endeavour to <hi>persuade the
Reader,</hi> as he says, <hi>p. 6. that he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood
me;</hi> but yet every body
will see, that he mis-represented me.
And I challenge him to say, that
those Expressions above quoted out of
him, concerning <hi>One Article,</hi> in the
obvious sence of the words, as they
stand in his Accusation of me, were
true?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:107142:23"/>
This flies so directly in his Face,
that he labours mightily to get it off,
and therefore adds these words, <hi>My
Discourse did not treat (neither doth
his Book run that way) of Principles of
Natural Religion, but of the Revealed,
and particularly the Christian: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
this was it which I taxed him
with, That of all the Principles and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Christianity, he chose out but
One as necessary to be believed to make
a Man a Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> His Book was of—<hi>Atheism,</hi>
which one may think should make his
<hi>Discourse treat of Natural Religion.</hi>
But I pass by that, and bid him tell
me where he ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed me, <hi>That of all
the Principles and Articles of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
I chose out but One:</hi> Let him shew
in all his Discourse but such a word,
or any thing said like <hi>one Article of
Christianity,</hi> and I will grant that he
meant particularly, but spoke general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
misled his Reader, and left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Subterfuge. But if there be no
Expression to be found in him tending
that way, all this is but the covering
of one Falshood with another, which
thereby only becomes the grosser<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:107142:24"/>
Though if he had in express words
taxed me, <hi>That of all the Principles and
Articles of the Christian Religion, I chose
out but one,</hi> that would not at all help
him, till he further declares, that the
Belief of One God is not an <hi>Article of
the Christian Religion.</hi> For of <hi>ALL
the Articles of the Christian Religion,</hi> he
says, <hi>I chose but One;</hi> which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that of a Deity, his words plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
import, that that was left out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest, unless it be possible for
a Man to chuse but One Article of the
Christian Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iesus is
the Messiah;</hi> and at the same time to
chuse Two Articles of the Christian
Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is One E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
God, and that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
If he had spoken clearly, and
like a fair Man, he should have said,
That he taxed me with chusing but
One Article of Revealed Religion.
That had been plain and direct to his
purpose: But then he knew the
Falshood of it would be too obvious:
for in the seven Pages wherein he
taxes me so much with <hi>One Article,</hi>
Christianity is several times named,
though not once to the purpose
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107142:24"/>
he here pretends. But Revelation is
not so much as once mentioned in
them, nor, as I remember, in any of
the Pages he bestows upon me.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the several Passages
above quoted out of him, concerning
<hi>one sole Article,</hi> are all in general
terms, without any the least limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or restriction; and as they stand
in him, fit to persuade the Reader that
I excluded all other Articles whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but that one of <hi>Iesus the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>
And if in that sence they are
not true, they are so many Falshoods
of his repeated there, to mislead others
into a wrong Opinion of me. For if
he had had a mind his Readers should
have been rightly informed, why was
it not as easie once to explain himself,
as so often to affirm it in general and
unrestrained terms? This all the
boasted strength of the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will
not be able to get him out of. This
very well becomes one who so loudly
charges me with <hi>Shuffling.</hi> Having
repeated the same thing over and over
again, in as general terms as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
without any the least limitation
in the whole Discourse, to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107142:25"/>
else to plead when required to
prove it, but that it was meant in a
limited sence, in an <hi>Unmasker,</hi> is not
<hi>shuffling.</hi> For by this way he may have
the convenience to say and unsay what
he pleases; to vent what stuff he
thinks for his turn; and when he is
called to an Account for it, reply, He
meant no such thing. Should any
one publish, that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> had
but <hi>One Article of Faith, and no more,
viz.</hi> That the Doctrines in fashion,
and likely to procure Preferment, are
alone to be received; That <hi>all his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
was comprised in this <hi>one single Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle:</hi>
And when such a Talker was
demanded to prove his Assertion,
should he say, he meant, to except his
Belief of the Apostles Creed: Would
he not, notwithstanding such a Plea,
be thought a shuffling Lyar? And if
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> can no otherwise prove
those universal Propositions above-cited,
but by saying, he meant them
with a tacit restriction, (for none is
expressed) they will still and for
ever remain to be accounted for by
his Veracity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:107142:25"/>
What he says in the next Paragraph,
<hi>p.</hi> 7. of my <hi>splitting One</hi> Article <hi>into
Two,</hi> is just of the-same force, and
with the same ingenuity. I had said,
That the Belief of One God was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
which is not now denied:
I had also said, <q>That the Belief of
<hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
together with those concomitant
Articles of his Resurrection, Rule,
and coming again to Judge the
World, was necessary, <hi>p.</hi> 291. And
again, <hi>p.</hi> 301. That God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
whoever would believe <hi>Iesus</hi>
to be the Saviour promised, and
take him now raised from the Dead,
and constituted the Lord and Judge
of all Men, to be their King and
Ruler, shall be saved.</q> This made
me say <hi>These</hi> and <hi>Those Articles</hi> (in
words of the plural number) more
than once; Evidence enough to any
but a Caviller, that I <hi>contended</hi> not
<hi>for one single Article and no more.</hi> And
to mind him of it, I in my <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
reprinted one of those places
where I had done so; and that he
might not, according to his manner,
overlook what does not please him,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107142:26"/>
the words, THESE ARE ARTICLES,
were printed in great Characters.
Whereupon he makes this Remark,
<hi>p. 7. And though since he has tried to
split this One into Two,</hi> pag. 28. <hi>yet he
labours in vain: For to believe Iesus
to be the Messiah, amounts to the same
with believing him to be King and Ruler;
his being Anointed</hi> (i. e. <hi>being the</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah)
<hi>including that in it: Yet he has
the vanity to add in great Characters,
THESE ARE ARTICLES; as if the
putting them into these great letters,
would make One Article Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though no Letters will
make One Article Two; yet
that there is One God, and Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, who
rose again from the Dead, ascended
into Heaven, and sitteth at the Right-Hand
of God, shall come to judge the
Quick and the Dead, are more than
One Article, and may very properly
be called THESE ARTICLES, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
splitting One into Two.</p>
               <p>What, in my <hi>Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
I have said of <hi>One Article,</hi> I
shall always own; and in what sence
I said it, is easie to be understood; and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107142:26"/>
with a Man of the least Candour,
whose Aim was Truth, and not Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
it would not have occasion'd one
word of Dispute. But as for this <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker,</hi>
who made it his business not
to convince me of any Mistakes in my
Opinion, but barely to mis-represent
me; my business at present with him,
is, to shew the World, that what he
has captiously and scurrilously said of
me relating to <hi>One Article,</hi> is false;
and that he neither has nor can prove
one of those Assertions concerning it,
above-cited out of him in his own
words. Nor let him pretend a Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against his direct Words: Such a
Caviller as he, who would shelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under the pretence of a Meaning,
whereof there are no Footsteps, whose
Disputes are only Calumnies directed
against the Author, without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Truth of Falshood of what I
had published, is not to expect the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances
one would make to a fair and
ingenuous Adversary, who shew'd so
much Concern for Truth, that he
treated of it with a Seriousness due to
the weightiness of the Matter, and
used other Arguments besides Obloquy,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107142:27"/>
Clamour and Falshoods, against what
he thought Error. And therefore I
again positively demand of him to
prove these words of his to be true,
or confess that he cannot: <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This at least is <hi>manifest</hi> from
hence, that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> knows not,
or cares not what he says. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107142:28"/>
but he, thought that a bare <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>

If he understands it so, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
him not to seek Preferment. For
Exclusions will happen; and if every
<hi>Exclusion</hi> be <hi>Defiance,</hi> a Man had need
be well assured of his own good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
who shall not think his Peace and
Charity in danger, amongst so many
Enemies that are at <hi>defiance</hi> with him?
<hi>Defiance,</hi> if with any propriety it can
be spoken of an Article of Faith, must
signifie a professed Enmity to it. For
in its proper use, which is to Persons,
it signifies an open and declared En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
raised to that height, that he in
whom it is, challenges the Party <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
to Battle, that may there wreek
his hatred on his Enemy in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
So that <hi>my Defiance of all

               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is another

                  </gap>ansying what would be
for his turn, and then confidently
fathering it upon me. It never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into my Thoughts, nor, I think,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107142:28"/>
into any body's else, (I must always
except the acute <hi>Unmasker,</hi> who
makes no difference between <hi>Useful</hi>
and <hi>Necessary</hi>) that all but the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles of the Christian Faith
were <hi>useless</hi> to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
though, if it be true, that the

to his being made a Christian,
all that may any way persuade him to
believe them, may certainly be useful
towards the making him a Christian:

               <p>I have represented all the rest as

<hi>And, How it appears,</hi> that
this is the design of my whole Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking?</p>
               <p>In his Thoughts concerning the
Causes of Atheism, he says, <hi>pag. 115.
what makes him contend for one single
Article with the exclusion of all the rest?
He pretends it is this, that all Men ought
to understand their Religion.</hi> This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107142:29"/>
I disowned <hi>p.</hi> 26. of my <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
and intimated <hi>p.</hi> 27. that he
should have quoted the Page where I
so <hi>pretended.</hi> To this <hi>p.</hi> 26. he tells
me with great confidence, and in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of words, as we shall see by and
by, that I had done so: As if repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
were a Proof. He had done
better to have quoted one place, where
I so pretend. Indeed <hi>p.</hi> 27. for want
of something better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he quotes these
words of mine out of <hi>p.</hi> 301. of the
<hi>Reasonableness of Christianity. The all
merciful God seems herein to have consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the poor of this World, and the bulk of
Mankind. THESE ARE ARTICLES
that the labouring and illiterate Man
may comprehend.</hi> I ask whether it be
possible for one to bring any thing
more direct against himself? The thing
he was to prove was, That <hi>I contended
for one single Article with the exclusion
of all the rest, because I pretended, that
all Men ought to understand their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
i. e. The Reason I gave, why
there was to be <hi>but one single Article
in Religion with the exclusion of all the
rest,</hi> was, because Men ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their Religion, and the place he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107142:29"/>
brings to prove my <hi>contending</hi> upon
that ground <hi>for one single Article with
the exclusion of all the rest,</hi> is a passage
wherein I speak of more than one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
and say <hi>these Articles.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I said <hi>These Articles</hi> properly or
improperly, it matters not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case (and that we have examin'd
in another place) 'tis plain, I meant
more than one Article, when I said
<hi>these Articles;</hi> and did not think, that
the labouring and illiterate Man could
not understand them, if they were
more than one: And therefore I <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
not, that there must be but one,
because by illiterate Men more than
one could not be understood. The
rest of this Paragraph is nothing but
a repetition of the same Assertion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Proof, which with the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
often passes for a way of proving, but
with no body else.</p>
               <p>But, that I may keep that distance,
which he boasts there is betwixt his
and my way of writing, I shall not
say this without Proofs. One instance
of his repetition, of which there is
such plenty in his Book, pray take
here. His Business <hi>p.</hi> 26. is to prove,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107142:30"/>
that I <hi>pretended that I contended for
one single Article with the exclusion of
all the rest, because all Men ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their Religion.</hi> Pag. 27. of my

               <p>Unm. <hi>Good Sir, let me be permitted
to acquaint you, that your Memory is as
defective as your Iudgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I thank you for the regard
you have had to it; for often repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a good help to a bad memory.
In requital, I advise you to have some
eye to your own <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
too. For one or both of them
seem a little to blame in the reason
you subjoyn to the foregoing words,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unm. <hi>For in the very</hi> Vindication
<hi>you attribute it to the goodness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
of the Almighty, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing as absolutely necessary to
be believed, but what is suited to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
capacities, and the comprehension of
illiterate Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:107142:32"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I will for the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s sake
put this Argument of his into a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism.
If the <hi>Vindicator</hi> in his <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
attributes it to the goodness and
condescenssion of the Almighty, that
he requires nothing to be believed, but
what is suited to vulgar Capacities,
and the comprehension of illiterate
Men, then he did in his <hi>Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christianity</hi> pretend, that the
reason why he contended for <hi>one</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
with the exclusion of all the rest
was, because all Men ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their Religion.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Vindicator</hi> in his <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
attributes it to the goodness and
condescention of Almighty God, that
he requires nothing to be believed, but
what is suited to vulgar Capacities,
and the comprehension of illiterate
Men.</p>
               <p>Ergo in his <hi>Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
he pretended, that the reason
why he contended for one Article
with the exclusion of all the rest was
because all Men ought to understand
their Religion.</p>
               <p>This was the Proposition to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and which as he confesses here
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107142:33"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 26. I denied to remember to be in
my <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity.</hi> Who
can but admire his Logick!</p>
               <p>But besides the strength of <hi>Iudgment,</hi>
which you have shew'd in this clear &amp;
cogent reasoning, does not your <hi>Memory</hi>
too deserve its due applause? You tell
me in your <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> that
in <hi>p.</hi> 29. of my <hi>Vindication,</hi> I desired
to know <hi>when</hi> I said so. To which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of mine you reply in these words
before cited, <hi>Good Sir, Let me be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to acquaint you that your Memory
is as defective as your Iudgment; for
in the very Vindication you attribute it
to the goodness and condescention of the
Almighty, that he requires nothing as
absolutely necessary to be believed, but
what is suited to vulgar Capacities,
and the comprehension of illiterate Men,</hi>
p. 30.</p>
               <p>Sure the <hi>Unmasker</hi> thinks himself
at cross questions. I ask him in the
29th. Page of my <hi>Vindication, WHEN</hi>
I said so: And he answers, that I had
said so in the 30th. Page of my <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
i. e. when I writ the 29th.
Page, I asked the question <hi>when</hi> I had
said what he charg'd me with saying,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107142:33"/>
and I am answer'd, I had said it in
the 30th. Page, which was not yet
written, <hi>i. e.</hi> I ask the question to day
<hi>WHEN</hi> I had said so: and I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
I had said it to Morrow. As
apposite, and convincing an Answer
to make good his charge, as if he had
said to Morrow I found a Horse-shooe.
But perhaps this judicious Disputant
will ease himself of this difficulty by
looking again into the 29th. <hi>p.</hi> of my
<hi>Vindication,</hi> out of which he cites
these words for mine, <hi>I desire to know
WHEN I said so.</hi> But my words
in that place, are <hi>I desire to know
WHERE I said so;</hi> a mark of his
exactness in quoting, when he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safes
to do it. For <hi>Unmaskers,</hi> when
they turn Disputants, think it the best
way to talk at large, and charge home
in generals. But do not often find it
convenient to quote Pages, set down
words, and come to particulars. But
if he had quoted my words right, his
Answer had been just as pertinent.
For I ask him <hi>WHERE</hi> in my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity</hi> I had said so:
And he answers, I had said so in my
<hi>Vindication.</hi> For <hi>where</hi> in my question
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107142:34"/>
refers to my <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
which the <hi>Unmasker</hi> had seen,
and charged with this saying; and could
not referr to my <hi>Vindication,</hi> which
he had not yet seen; nor to a passage
in it which was not then written.
But this is nothing with an <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
therefore what is yet worse, those
words of mine, <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 29. relate
not to the passage he is here proving
I had said; but to another different
from it, as different as it is to say,
<hi>that because all Men are to understand
their Religion, therefore there is to be
but One Article in it;</hi> And to say <hi>that
there must be nothing in Christianity,
that is not plain and exactly levell'd to
all Mens Mother Wit:</hi> Both which he
falsly charges on me, but 'tis only to
the latter of them, that my words <hi>I
desire to know where I said so</hi> are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the well-meaning Man sees
no difference between these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
yet I shall take the liberty
to ask him again, <hi>where</hi> I said either
of them, as if they were two: although
he should accuse me again of <hi>excepting
against the formality of words,</hi> and doing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107142:34"/>
so foolish a thing as to expect, that
a disputing <hi>Unmasker</hi> should account
for his words, or any Proposition he
advances. 'Tis his privilege to plead
he did not mean as his words import,
and without any more ado he is
assoil'd; and he is the same <hi>Unmasker</hi>
he was before. But let us hear him
out on the Argument he was upon,
for his repetitions on it are not yet
done. His next words are,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unm.</hi> It is clear then, that you found
your ONE Article on this, that it is
suited to the vulgar Capacities: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the other Articles, mentioned by me,
are obscure and ambiguous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surpass the comprehension of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The latter part indeed is now
the first time imputed to me. But all
the rest is nothing but an unproved
repetition, though usher'd in with <hi>it
is clear then;</hi> words that should have
a Proof going before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unm.</hi> But yet you pretend, that you
have forgot, that any such thing was said
by you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I have indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orgot, and
notwithstanding all your pains by so
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107142:35"/>
many repetitions to beat it into my
Head, I fear I shall never remember it.</p>
               <p>Unm. <hi>Which shews that you are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of your words, and that you forget
what you write.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So you told me before, and
this repeating of it does no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me, than that did.</p>
               <p>Unm. <hi>What shall we say to such an
oblivious Author?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Shew it him in his Book, or
else he will never be able to remember,
that it is there, nor any body else b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
able to find it.</p>
               <p>Unm. <hi>He takes no notice of what falls
from his own Pen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So you have told him more
than once. Try him once with shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it him amongst other things which
fell from his own Pen, and see what
then he will say: That perhaps may
refresh his Memory.</p>
               <p>Unm. <hi>And therefore within a Page
or two he confutes himself, and gives
himself the Lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis a Fault he deserves to
be told of over and over again. But
he says, he shall not be able to find
the two Pages, wherein he <hi>gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107142:35"/>
the Lye,</hi> unless you set down their
Numbers, and the words in them,
which confute, and which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suted.</p>
               <p>I beg my Reader's pardon for laying
before him so large a pattern of our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
new fashioned Stuff; his fine
Tissue of argumentation not easily to
be match'd, but by the same Hand. But
it lay altogether in <hi>p.</hi> 26, 27, &amp; 28. and
it was fit the Reader should have this
one instance of the Excellencies, he
promises in his first Paragraph in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to my <hi>Impertinencies, Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencies,
weak and feeble struglings.</hi>
Other Excellencies he there promised
upon the same ground, which I shall
give my Reader a tast of, in fit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Not but that the whole is of a
piece, and one cannot miss some of
them in every Page: But to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them all, would be more than
they are worth. If any one desires
more plenty, I send him to his Book
it self. But saying a thousand times
not being proving once, it remains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him still to shew,</p>

               <p>Let us now return to his 8th. Page.
For the bundling together, as was fit,
all that he has said in distant places
upon the Subject of <hi>One Articl.</hi> has
made me trespass a little against the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Character of a <hi>well-bred Man,</hi>
recommended by him to me out of
the <hi>Mishna.</hi> Though I propose to my

               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:107142:36"/>
In the 110th. and 111th. Pages of his
<hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi>
he gave us a List of his <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles:</hi> Upon which I thus
applied my self to him, <hi>Vind.</hi> p. 5.
<q>Give me leave now to ask you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
whether these you have
here set down under the title of
<hi>Fundamental Doctrines</hi> are such
(when reduced to Propositions)
that every one of them is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make a Man a Christian,
and such as without the actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
thereof, he cannot be saved? If
they are not so every one of them,
you may call them <hi>Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi>
as much as you please, they
are not of those Doctrines of Faith,
I was speaking of; which are only
such as are required to be actually
believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
And again, <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 18. I
asked him whether just these nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more nor less were those ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which we have his Answer, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism
Unmask'd,</hi> p. 8, &amp;c. From
<hi>p.</hi> 8. to 20. he has quoted near Forty
Texts of Scripture, of which he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107142:37"/>
saith, <hi>p. 21. Thus I have briefly set
before</hi> the Reader those <hi>Evangelical
Truths, those Christian Principles which
belong to the very Essence of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
I have proved them to be such,
and I have reduced most of them to
certain Propositions, which is a thing
the Vindicator called for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes; But that was not all
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> called for, and had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to expect. For I asked, <q>whether
those the <hi>Unmasker</hi> gave us in his
<hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi>
were the Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
without an actual Belief
whereof a Man could not be a
Christian, just all neither more nor
less?</q> This I had reason to demand
from him, or from any one, who
questions that part of my Book, and
I shall insist upon till he does it, or
confesses he cannot. For having set
down the Articles, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon a diligent search seem'd to
me to require as necessary, and only
necessary, I shall not lose my time in
examining, what another says against
those Fundamentals, which I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
out of the Preachings of our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107142:37"/>
Saviour and his Apostles, till he gives
me a List of his Fundamentals, which
he will bide by; that so by comparing
them together, I may see which is the
true Catalogue of Necessaries. For after
so serious and diligent a search, which
has given me Light and Satisfaction in
this great Point, I shall not quit it,
and set my self on float again, at the
demand of any one who would have
me be of his Faith, without telling me
what it is. Those Fundamentals, the
Scripture has so plainly given, and so
evidently determin'd, that it would be
the greatest folly imaginable to part
with this Rule for asking; and give up
my self blindly to the Conduct of one,
who either knows not, or will not tell
me, what are the Points necessary to
be believed to make me a Christian.
He that shall find fault with my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Fundamentals only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle
me, and not to give me a better
of his own, I shall not think worth
minding, till, like a fair Man, he puts
himself upon equal terms, and makes
up the Defects of mine by a compleat
one of his own. For a deficiency or
error in one necessary is as fatal, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107142:38"/>
as certainly excludes a Man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Christian, as in an hundred.
When any one offers me a compleat
Catalogue of his Fundamentals, he
does not unreasonably demand me to
quit mine for nothing: I have then
one, that being set by mine, I may
compare them; and so be able to chuse
the true and perfect one, and relinquish
the other.</p>
               <p>He that does not do this, plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that (without shewing me the
certain way to Salvation) he expects
that I should depend on him with an
implicit Faith, whilst he reserves to
himself the liberty to require of me
to believe, what he shall think fit, as
he sees Occasion; and in effect, says
thus, <q>Distrust those Fundamentals
which the Preaching of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and his Apostles, have shew'd
to be all that is necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian,
and though I cannot tell you, what
are those other Articles, which are
necessary and sufficient to make a
Man a Christian, yet take me for
your Guide, and that is as good, as
if I made up, in a compleat List, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107142:38"/>
Defects of your Fundamentals.</q>
To which this is a sufficient Answer,
<hi>Si quid novisti rectius imperti, si non, his
ut ere mecum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi> of his own accord,
<hi>p.</hi> 110. of <hi>his Thoughts concerning the
Causes of Atheism,</hi> sets down several,
which he calls <hi>Fundamental Doctrines.</hi>
I ask him, whether those be all? For
answer he adds more to them in his
<hi>Socinianism Unmask'd:</hi> But in a great
pet refuses to tell me, whether this
Second List of Fundamentals be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat:
And instead of answering so
reasonable a Demand, pays me with
ill Language, in these words, <hi>pag.</hi> 22.
subjoyn'd to those last quoted, <hi>If what
I have said will not content him, I am
sure I can do nothing that will, and
therefore if he should Capriciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
any thing more, it would be as
great folly in me to comply with it, as
it is in him to move it.</hi> If I did ask a
Question which troubles you, be not
so angry; you your self were the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of it. I proposed my Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Fundamentals, which I had
with great care sought; and thought
I had found clear in the Scripture;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107142:39"/>
you tell me no, it is imperfect, and offer
me one of your own. I ask whether
that be perfect? Thereupon you grow
into Choler, and tell me 'tis a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Question. Why! then I think it
was not very wise in you so forwardly
to offer one, unless you had had one
ready, not liable to the same exception.
Would you have me so foolish to take
a List of Fundamentals from you, who
have not yet one for your self? nor
are yet resolved with your self, what
Doctrines are to be put in, or left out
of it? Farther, pray tell me, if you
had a settled Collection of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
that you would stand to, why
should I take them from you upon
your word, rather than from an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist,</hi>
or a <hi>Quaker,</hi> or an <hi>Arminian,</hi>
or a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> or a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist?</hi>
who, I think, are not perfectly
agreed with you, or one another
in Fundamentals? and yet there is
none amongst them, that I have not
as much reason to believe upon his
bare word, as an <hi>Unmasker,</hi> who to
my certain knowledge will make bold
with Truth. If you set up for Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
you may have some claim to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107142:39"/>
have your bare word taken, before any
other but the Pope. But yet if you
do demand to be an unquestionable
Proposer of what is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be believed to make a Man a
Christian, you must perform it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better, than hitherto you have
done. For it is not enough sometimes
to give us Texts of Scripture; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Propositions of your own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming;
and sometimes Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of which they are to be
framed as <hi>p.</hi> 14. you say, <hi>These and the
like places afford us such Fundamental
and Necessary Doctrines as these:</hi> And
again, <hi>p.</hi> 16. after the naming several
other Texts of Scripture, you add
<hi>which places yield us such Propositions
as these,</hi> and then in both places set
down, what you think fit to draw
out of them. And Page 15. you have
these words: <hi>And here likewise it were
easie to shew that Adoption, Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Pardon of Sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are
Privileges and Benefits bestow'd upon us
by the Messiah, are Necessary Matters
of our Belief.</hi> By all which, as well
as the whole frame, wherein you
make shew of giving us your Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107142:40"/>
Articles, it is plain, that what
you have given us there, is nothing
less than a compleat Collection of
Fundamentals, even in your own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it.</p>
               <p>But Good Sir, why is it a <hi>foolish</hi>
Question in me? you have found fault
with my Summary for being short:
The defect in my Collection of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles has raised your Zeal
into so severe Censures, and drawn
upon me from you so heavy a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
that if half that you have
said of me be true, I am in a very ill
case, for having so curtailed the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Doctrines of Christianity. Is
it <hi>folly</hi> then for me to ask from you a
compleat Creed? If it be so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
(as certainly it is) to fail in any
necessary Article of Faith, why is it
<hi>folly</hi> in me to be instant with you to
give me them all? Or why is it <hi>folly</hi>
in you to grant so reasonable a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand?
a short Faith, defective in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
is no more tolerable in you,
than in me; nay, much more inexcuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
if it were for no other reason,
but this, that you rest in it your self,
and would impose it on others; and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107142:40"/>
yet do not your self know or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be compleat. For if you
do, why dare you not say so, and
give it us all entire in plain Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
and not, as you have in great
measure done here, give only the Texts
of Scripture, from whence, you say,
necessary Articles are to be drawn;
which is too great an uncertainty for
Doctrines absolutely necessary. For
possibly all Men do not understand
those Texts alike, and some may draw
Articles out of them quite different
from your Systeme; and so though
they agree in the same Texts, may
not agree in the same Fundamentals:
and till you have set down plainly
and distinctly your Articles, that you
think contain'd in them, cannot tell
whether you will allow them to be
Christians, or no. For you know, Sir,
several Inferences are often drawn
from the same Text; and the different
Systems of dissenting (I was going
to say Christians, but that none must
be so, but those who receive your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Fundamentals, when you
please to give it them) Professors, are
all founded on the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107142:41"/>
Why, I beseech you, is mine a
<hi>foolish</hi> Question to ask, What are the
necessary Articles of Faith? 'Tis of
no less consequence than, nor much
different from the Jaylor's Question
in the 16th. of the Acts, <hi>What shall I
do to be saved?</hi> and that was not, that
ever I heard counted by any one a
<hi>foolish Question.</hi> You grant there are
Articles necessary to be believed for
Salvation: would it not then be Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to know them? nay, is it not
our Duty to know and believe them?
If not, why do you with so much
outcry reprehend me, for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them? why do you fill your Books
with such variety of Invectives, as if
you could never say enough, nor bad
enough, against me, for having left
out some of them? And if it be so
dangerous, so criminal to miss any of
them, why is it a <hi>folly</hi> in me to <hi>move</hi>
you to give me a compleat List?</p>
               <p>If Fundamentals are to be known,
easie to be known (as without doubt
they are) then a Catalogue may be
given of them. But if they are not,
if it cannot certainly be determin'd
which are they; but the doubtful
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107142:41"/>
knowledge of them depends upon
guesses, why may not I be permitted
to follow my guesses, as well as you
yours? Or why, of all others, must
you prescribe your guesses to me,
when there are so many, that are as
ready to prescribe as you, and of as
good Authority? The pretence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and clamour is Religion, and
the Saving of Souls: But your Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
'tis plain is nothing, but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule,
and prescribe, and be hearken'd
to as a Dictator; and not to inform,
teach and instruct in the sure way to
Salvation. Why else do you so start
and fling, when I desire to know of
you, what is necessary to be believed
to make a Man a Christian, when this
is the only material thing in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
between us, and my Mistakes
in it has made you begin a quarrel
with me, and let loose your Pen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me in no ordinary way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension?</p>
               <p>Besides in this way which you take,
you will be in no better a case than I.
For another having as good a claim to
have his guesses give the rule, as you
yours; or to have his System recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107142:42"/>
as well as you yours, he will
complain of you, as well, and upon as
good grounds, as you do of me, and
(if he have but as much Zeal for his
Orthodoxy as you shew for yours) in
as civil, well-bred and Christian-like
Language.</p>
               <p>In the next place, pray tell me, why
would it be <hi>folly</hi> in you to comply
with what I require of you? Would
it not be useful to me to be set right
in this Matter, if so, why is it <hi>folly</hi>
in you to set me right? Consider me,
if you please, as one of your Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who (after you have resolv'd
which Catalogue of Fundamentals to
give him, either that in your <hi>Thoughts
of the Causes of Atheism;</hi> or this other
here in your <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> for
they are not both the same, nor ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them perfect) asked you, are
these all Fundamental Articles necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to make a Man a
Christian; and are there no more but
these? would you answer him, that
it was <hi>folly</hi> in you to comply with
him, in what he desired? Is it of no
moment to know, what is required of
Men to be believed; without a belief
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107142:42"/>
of which they are not Christians, nor
can be saved? And is it <hi>folly</hi> in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel to inform one
committed to his Instruction in so
material a Point as this, which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
Believers from Unbelievers? Is
it <hi>folly</hi> in one whose Business it is to
bring Men to be Christians, and to
Salvation, to resolve a Question by
which they may know, whether they
are Christians or no, and without a
resolution of which they cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know their Condition and the
state they are in? Is it besides your
Commission and Business, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>folly</hi> to extend your care of
Souls so far as this, to those who are
committed to your Charge?</p>
               <p>Sir, I have a Title to demand this
of you, as if I were your Parishioner:
You have forced your self upon me
for a Teacher in this very Point, as
if you wanted a Parishioner to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct:
and therefore I demand it of
you, and shall insist upon it, till you
either do it, or confess you cannot.
Nor shall it excuse you to say it is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciously</hi>
required. For this is no
otherwise <hi>capricious,</hi> than all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107142:43"/>
are <hi>capricious</hi> to a Man that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
answer them: and such an one I
think this is to you. For if you could
answer it, no body can doubt, but
that you would; and that with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence:
For no body will suspect 'tis
the want of that makes you so reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
This is indeed a frequent way
of answering Questions by men, that
cannot otherwise cover the Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Opinions, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
of expecting to be believed
upon their bare words, by saying they
are <hi>capriciously</hi> asked, and deserved no
other Answer.</p>
               <p>But how far soever <hi>Capriciousness</hi>
(when proved, for saying is not
enough) may excuse from answering
a material Question, yet your own
words here will clear this from being
a <hi>capricious</hi> Question in me. For that
those Texts of Scripture, which you
have set down, do not upon your
own Grounds contain all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Doctrines of Religion; all that
is necessary to be believed to make a
Man a Christian, what you say a
little lower, in this very Page, as well
as in other places, does demonstrate,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107142:43"/>
Your words are, <hi>I think I have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved, that there are other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
besides that</hi> [Jesus is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah]
<hi>which are required to be believed
to make a Man a Christian; why did
the Apostles write these Doctrines? was
it not that those they writ to, might
give their assent to them?</hi> This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the necessity of believing
the Texts you cite, from their being
set down in the New Testament you
urged thus, <hi>p. 9. Is this set down to no
purpose in these inspired Epistles? Is it
not requisite that we should know it and
believe?</hi> And again <hi>p. 29. They are
in our Bibles to that very purpose to be
believed.</hi> If then it be necessary to
know, and believe those Texts of
Scripture, you have collected, because
the Apostles <hi>writ them,</hi> and they were
not <hi>set down to no purpose.</hi> And <hi>they
are in our Bibles on purpose to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
I have reason to demand of you
other Texts, besides those you have
enumerated, as containing Points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed: because there
are other Texts which the <hi>Apostles
writ,</hi> and were not <hi>set down to no
purpose,</hi> and <hi>are in our Bibles on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107142:44"/>
to be believed,</hi> as well as those
which you have cited.</p>
               <p>Another reason of doubting, and
consequently of demanding, whether
those Propositions, you have set down
for Fundamental Doctrines, be every
one of them necessary to be believed,
and all that are necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make a Man a Christian, I
have from your next Argument which
join'd to the former stands thus, <hi>p. 22.
Why did the Apostles write these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?
Was it not that those they
writ to might give their assent to them?
nay, did they not require assent to them?
Yes verily, for this is to be proved from
the Nature of the things contained in
those Doctrines which are such as had</hi>
immediate respect <hi>to the Occasion, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
Way, Means and Issue of their
Redemption and Salvation.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all <hi>things which have an</hi> immediate
<hi>respect to the Occasion, Author, Way,
Means, and Issue of Mens Redemption
and Salvation</hi> are those, and those only
which are necessary to be believed to
make a Man a Christian, may a Man
not justly doubt, whether those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
which the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has set
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107142:44"/>
down, contain all those things, and
whether there be not other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in other Texts of Scripture, or
in some of those cited by him, but
otherwise understood, that <hi>have as</hi>
immediately <hi>a respect to the Occasion,
Author, Way, Means, and Issue of Mens
Redemption and Salvation,</hi> as those he
has set down? And therefore I have
reason to demand a compleater List.
For at best, to tell us, that <hi>all things
that have an immediate respect to the
Occasion, Author, Way, Means, and Issue
Issue of Mens Redemption and Salvation,</hi>
is but a general Description of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
with which some may think
some Articles agree, and others others:
And the terms <hi>immediate respect</hi> may
give ground enough for difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them to those, who agree, that
the rest of your Description is right.
My demand therefore is not a general
Description of Fundamentals, but for
the Reasons abovementioned, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Articles themselves, which are
necessary to be believed to make a Man
a Christian.</p>
               <p>It is not my Business at p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sent to
examine the validity of these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107142:45"/>
of his, to prove all the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to be necessary to be believed,
which he has here in his <hi>Socinianism
Unmask'd,</hi> set down as such. The use
I make of them now, is to shew the
reason, they afford me to doubt, that
those Propositions, which he has given
us for Doctrines necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
are either not all such, or more
than all, by his own rule: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I must desire him to give us a
compleater Creed, that we may know,
what in his sense is necessary, and
enough to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>Nor will it be sufficient in this case
to do, what he tells us, that he has
done, in these words, <hi>p. 21. I have
briefly set before the Reader, these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Truths, Those Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which belong to the very Essence
of Christianity—</hi> and <hi>I have reduced
most of them to certain Propositions,
which is a thing the Vindicator called
for,</hi> p. 16. With Submission, I think,
he mistakes the <hi>Vindicator.</hi> What I
called for was, not that <hi>most of them,</hi>
should be <hi>reduced to certain Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
but that all of them should: and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107142:45"/>
the reason of my demanding that
was plain, <hi>viz.</hi> that then having
the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Creed in clear and
distinct Propositions, I might be
able to examine, whether it was,
what God in the Scriptures indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly
required of every Man
to make him a Christian, that so
I might thereby correct the Errors
or Defects of what I at present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the Scripture taught me
in the case.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi> endeavours to excuse
himself from answering my Question
by another exception against it, <hi>p.</hi> 24.
in these words. <hi>Surely none but this
Upstart Racovian will have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to deny that these Articles of
Faith are such as are necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
a Christian, as to the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
and Doctrinal part of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
such as must IN SOME MEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SURE
be known and assented to by him.
Not that a Man is supposed every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to</hi> actually <hi>exert his assent and
belief for none of the Moral Vertues,
none of the Evangelical Graces are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
thus always. Wherefore that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
in <hi>p. 16. (though he says he asks
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107142:46"/>
it</hi> seriously) <hi>might have been spared,</hi>
                  <q>Whether every one of these Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
is required to be believed
to make a Man a Christian, and
such as without the actual belief
thereof he cannot be saved?</q>
                  <hi>Here is</hi> seriousness <hi>pretended when
there is none, for the Design is only
to Cavil, and (if he can) to expose my
Assertion. But he is not able to do it,
for all his Critical Demands are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
in these few words,</hi> viz. <hi>That in
the Intellectual (as well as Moral En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments)
are never supposed to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in act: They are exerted upon
Occasion, not all of them at a time. And
therefore he mistakes if he thinks, or
rather as he Objects without thinking,
that these Doctrines if they be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
and Necessary, must be</hi> always
actually <hi>believed. No Man besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
ever started such a thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This terrible long Combate has the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> managed with his own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
to confound the <hi>Seriousness</hi> of
my Question, and as he says himself,
is come off not only safe and sound,
but triumphant. But for all that, Sir,
may not a Man's Question be <hi>serious,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:107142:46"/>
though he should chance to express it
ill? I think you and I were not best to
set up for Criticks in Language, and
Nicety of Expression, for fear we should
set the World a Laughing. Yet for
this once, I shall take the liberty to
defend mine here. For I demand in
what Expression of mine, I said or
<hi>supposed,</hi> that a man should <hi>every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
actually <hi>exert his assent</hi> to any
Proposition required to be believed?
Cannot a Man say, that the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
cannot be admitted to any Preferment
in the Church of <hi>England</hi> without an
<hi>actual assent to,</hi> or Subscribing of the
39 Articles, unless it be <hi>suppos'd</hi> that
he must <hi>every moment</hi> from the time
he first read, assented to, and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
those Articles, till he received
Institution and Induction, <hi>actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert
his assent</hi> to every one of them,
and repeat his Subscription? In the
same sense it is literally true, that a
Man cannot be admitted into the
Church of Christ or into Heaven,
without <hi>actually</hi> believing all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
necessary to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
without supposing, that he must
<hi>actually exert that assent every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:107142:47"/>
from the time, that he first gave
it, till the moment that he is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into Heaven. He may Eat, Drink,
make Bargains, study <hi>Euclid,</hi> and think
of other things between; nay, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Sleep, and neither think of those
Articles nor any thing else, and yet
it be true, that he shall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Church, or Heaven,
without an <hi>actual assent</hi> to them:
That Condition of an <hi>actual assent</hi> he
has perform'd, and until he recall that
assent by actual Unbelief it stands good,
and though a Lunacy or Lethargy
should seize on him presently after,
and he should never think of it again
as long as he lived, yet it is literally
true, he is not saved without an <hi>actual
assent.</hi> You might therefore have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
your pains in saying, <hi>That none of
the Moral Virtues, none of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,
Graces are exerted THUS al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi>
till you had met with some body
who had said <hi>THUS,</hi> That I did so
I think would have enter'd into no
bodies thoughts but yours, it being
evident from <hi>p.</hi> 298, and 300. of my
Book, that by <hi>Actual</hi> I meant <hi>Explicit.</hi>
You should rather have given a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107142:47"/>
direct Answer to my Question, which
I here again <hi>seriously ask</hi> you, <hi>viz.</hi>
Whether,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="part">

in your <hi>Thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Causes of Atheism,</hi> or
those <hi>Christian Principles which
belong to the very Essence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
so many as you have

to make a Man a Christian,
and such, as without the actual
or (since that word displeases
you) the explicit belief whereof
he cannot be saved.</p>
               <p>When you have answer'd this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
we shall then see which of us
two is nearest the right? But if you
shall forbear Railing, which I fear
you take for arguing, against that
Summary of Faith, which our Saviour
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107142:48"/>
and his Apostles taught, and which
only they propos'd to their Hearers to
be believed to make them Christians,
till you have found another perfect
Creed of only necessary Articles, that
you dare own for such; you are like
to have a large time of Silence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I leave the Passage above cited, I
must desire the Reader to take notice
of what he says concerning his List of
Fundamentals, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>these his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith necessary to constitute a
Christian, are such as must IN SOME
MEASURE be known and assented
to by him.</hi> A very wary Expression
concerning Fundamentals. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is about Articles necessary to be
explicitly believed to make a Man a
Christian. These in his List the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
tells us are <hi>necessary to consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a
Christian, and must IN SOME
MEASURE be known and assented
to,</hi> I would now fain know of the
Reader whether he understands here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> means, that
these his necessary Articles must be
explicitly believed or not! If he means
an explicit Knowledge and Belief,
why does he puzzle his Reader by so
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107142:48"/>
improper a way of speaking? for what
is as compleat and perfect as it ought
to be, cannot properly be said to be
<hi>in some Measure.</hi> If his <hi>in some Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
falls short of explicitly
knowing and believing his Fundamentals, his
necessary Articles are such as a Man
may be a Christian without explicitly
knowing and believing, <hi>i. e.</hi> are no
Fundamentals, no necessary Articles
at all. Thus Men, uncertain what to
say, betray themselves by their great
Caution.</p>
               <p>Having pronounced it <hi>Folly</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to make up the defects of my
short, and therefore so much blam'd
Collection of Fundamentals, by a full
one of his own, though his Attempt
shews he would if he could, he goes
on thus, <hi>p. 22. From what I</hi> [the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker]
<hi>have said it is evident, that
the Vindicator is grosly mistaken when
he saith, </hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Whatever Doctrine the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
required to be believed to make
a Man a Christian, are to be found
in those places of Scripture which
he has quoted in his Book.</hi>
                  </q> And
a little lower, <hi>I think I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
proved that there are other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107142:49"/>
besides that, which are required
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
Answ.</hi> Whatever you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or (as you never fail to do) boast
you have proved, will signifie nothing
till you have proved one of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,

               <p>That what our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

               <p>I say, <hi>any one;</hi> For though it be

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107142:49"/>
Doctrine of Faith, which in all their

drive at: Yet if it were not so,

other things, that would not prove,
that those other things were Articles
of Faith absolutely necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

if it appears, that ever any one
was admitted into the Church by our
Saviour or his Apostles, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Article explicitly laid before
him, and without his explicit assent
to it, you must grant, that an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
assent to that Article is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to make a Man a Christian: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you will say, that our Saviour, and
his Apostles admitted Men into the
Church, that were not qualified with
such a Faith, as was absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to make a Man a Christian, which
is as much as to say, that they allow'd,
and pronounced Men to be Christians,
who were not Christians. For he,
that wants what is necessary to make
a Man a Christian, can no more be a
Christian, than he, that wants what
is necessary to make him a Man, can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107142:50"/>
be a Man. For what is necessary to
the being of any thing is Essential to
its being; and any thing may be as
well without its Essence, as without
any thing that is necessary to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and so a Man be a Man without
being a Man, and a Christian a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
without being a Christian; and
an Unmasker may prove this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proving it. You may therefore
set up, by your unquestionable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
what Articles you please, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make a Man
a Christian; If our Saviour, and his
Apostles admitted Converts into the
Church without preaching those your
Articles to them; or requiring an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
assent to what they did not
Preach, and explicitly lay down, I
shall prefer their Authority to yours;
and think it was rather by them, than
by you, that God promulgated the
Law of Faith; and manifested, what
that Faith was, upon which he would
receive penitent Converts.</p>
               <p>And though by his Apostles our
Saviour taught a great many other
Truths, for the explaining this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article of the Law of Faith,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107142:50"/>
that Jesus is the Messiah; some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
have a nearer, and some a more
remote connexion with it, and so
cannot be deny'd by any Christian,
who sees that connexion, or knows
they are so taught: yet an explicit
belief of any one of them is no more
necessarily required to make a Man a
Christian, than an explicit belief of
all those Truths which have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the being of a God, or
are reveal'd by him, is necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make a Man not to be an
Atheist: Though none of them can
be denied by any one, who sees that
connexion, or acknowledges that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
without his being an Atheist.
All these Truths taught us from God,
either by Reàson, or Revelation, are
of great use, to enlighten our Minds,
confirm our Faith, stir up our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the more we see of
them, the more we shall see, admire,
and magnifie the Wisdom, Goodness,
Mercy, and Love of God in the Work
of our Redemption. This will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
us to search, and study the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherein it is contain'd and laid
open to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107142:51"/>
All that we find in the Revelation
of the New Testament, being the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
Will and Mind of our Lord and
Master the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom we have
taken to be our King, we are bound
to receive as Right and Truth, or
else we are not his Subjects, we do
not believe him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> our
King, but cast him off, and with the
<hi>Iews</hi> say, we will not have this Man
reign over us. But it is still what we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind in the Scripture, not in this or
that System; what we sincerely seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to know the Will of our Lord,
discover to be his Mind. Where it is
spoken plainly we cannot miss it, and
it is evident, he requires our assent:
where there is obscurity either in the
Expressions themselves, or by reason
of the seeming contrariety of other
Passages, there a fair endeavour, as
much as our Circumstances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
secures us from a guilty Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Will, or a sinful Error
in Faith, which way soever our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
resolves the doubt, or perhaps leaves
it unresolved. If he had required
more of us in those Points, he would
have declared his Will plainer to us;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107142:51"/>
and discover'd the Truth contain'd in
those obscure, or seemingly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
places, as clearly, and as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
as he did that Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
that we were to believe him to
be the <hi>Messiah</hi> our King.</p>
               <p>As Men we have God for our King,
and are under the Law of Reason: As
Christians, we have <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi>
for our King, and are under the Law
revealed by him in the Gospel. And
though every Christian, both as a <hi>Deist</hi>
and a <hi>Christian,</hi> be obliged to study
both the Law of Nature and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Law, that in them he may
know the Will of God, and of Jesus
Christ whom he hath sent, yet in
neither of these Laws is there to be
found a Select Set of Fundamentals,
distinct from the rest which are to
make him, a <hi>Deist</hi> or a <hi>Christian.</hi> But
he that believes one Eternal invisible
God, his Lord and King, ceases there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to be an Atheist; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> his King,
ordain'd by God thereby becomes a
Christian, is delivered from the Power
of Darkness, and is Translated into the
Kingdom of the Son of God, is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107142:52"/>
within the Covenant of Grace,
and has that Faith; which shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him for Righteousness, and
if he continues in his Allegiance to
this his King, shall receive the reward,
Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>He that Considers this, will not be
so hot as the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> to contend for
a Number of Fundamental Articles all
necessary every one of them to be
explicitly believed, by every one, for
Salvation, without knowing them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or being able to enumerate them
to another. Can there be any thing
more absurd, than to say, there are
several Fundamental Articles, each of
which every Man must explicitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
upon pain of Damnation, and
yet not to be able to say, which they
be? The <hi>Unmasker</hi> has set down no
small Number; but yet dares not say,
these are all. On the contrary, he
has plainly confessed, there are more:
but will not, <hi>i. e.</hi> cannot tell what
they are, that remain behind. Nay,
has given a general Description of his
Fundamental Articles, by which it is
not evident, but there may be ten
times as many, as those he had named;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107142:52"/>
and amongst them (if he durst or
could name them) probably several,
that many a good Christian, who
died in the Faith, and is now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
never once thought of; and
others, which many, of as good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as he, would from their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Systems, certainly deny and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict.</p>
               <p>This, as great an Absurdity as it is,
cannot be otherwise, whilst Men will
take upon them to alter the terms of
the Gospel; and when it is evident,
that our Saviour, and his Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Men into the Church, and
pronounced them Believers, for taking
him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> their King and
Deliverer sent by God, have the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to say, this is not enough. But
when you would know of them what
then is enough, they cannot tell you.
The reason whereof is visible, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they being able to produce no
other reason for their Collection of
Fundamental Articles to prove them
necessary to be believed, but because
they are of Divine Authority and
contain'd in the Holy Scriptures, and
are, as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> says, <hi>writ there
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107142:53"/>
on purpose to be believed,</hi> they know
not where to stop, when they have
once begun. Those Texts that they
leave out, or from which they deduce
none of them, being of the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority, and so upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
equally Fundamental, with what
they have culled out, though not so
well suited to their particular Systems.</p>
               <p>Hence come those endless and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Contentions about Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
whilst each censures the Defect, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy,
or Falshood of what others
require, as necessary to be believed;
and yet he himself gives not a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of his own Fundamentals, which
he will say is sufficient and compleat.
Nor is it to be wondred, since in this
way it is impossible to stop short of
putting every Proposition divinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
into the List of Fundamentals;
all of them being of Divine, and so
of equal Authority, and upon that
account equally necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by every one who is a Christian;
though they are not all necessary to
be believed to make any one a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
For the New Testament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Laws of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107142:53"/>
in regard of all the Actions both
of Mind and Body of all his Subjects,
every Christian is bound by his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to him, to believe all that he
says in it to be true, as well as to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that all that he commands in it
is just and good: And what Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
Perverseness, or Guilt there is
in his mistaking in the one, or failing
in his obedience to the other, That this
Righteous Judge of all Men, who
cannot be deceived, will at the last day
lay open, and reward accordingly.</p>
               <p>'Tis no wonder therefore, there has
been such fierce Contests, and such
cruel Havock made amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
about Fundamentals: Whilst eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one would set up his System upon
pain of Fire and Faggot in this, and
Hell Fire in the other World; Though
at the same time, whilst he is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the utmost Barbarities against
others to prove himself a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
he professes himself so ignorant
that he cannot tell, or so uncharitable,
that he will not tell, what Articles are
absolutely necessary, and sufficient to
make a Man a Christian. If there
be any such Fundamentals, as 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107142:54"/>
there are, 'tis as certain they
must be very plain. Why then does
every one urge and make a stir about
Fundamentals, and no body give a
List of them? But because, (as I have
said) upon the usual Grounds, they
cannot. For I will be bold to say,
that every one, who considers the
matter, will see, that either only the
Article of his being the <hi>Messiah</hi> their
King, which alone our Saviour and
his Apostles preach'd to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
World, and received those that
believed it into the Church, is the
only necessary Article to be believed
by a <hi>Theist</hi> to make him a Christian;
Or else that all the Truths contain'd
in the New Testament, are necessary
Articles to be believed to make a Man
a Christian; And that between these
two it is impossible any where to
stand. The reason whereof is plain.
Because either the believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to
be the <hi>Messiah, i. e.</hi> the taking him to
be our King, makes us Subjects and
Denizons of his Kingdom, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
Or else an explicit knowledge
of, and actual Obedience to the Laws
of his Kingdom is what is required
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107142:54"/>
to make us Subjects; Which, I think, is
what was never said of any other
Kingdom. For a Man must be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
before he is bound to obey.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose it will be said here,
that an Obedience to the Laws of
Christ's Kingdom, is what is necessary
to make us Subjects of it, without
which we cannot be admitted into it,
<hi>i. e.</hi> be Christians: And if so, this Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
must be Universal; I mean, it
must be the same sort of Obedience to
all the Laws of this Kingdom: Which
since no body says is in any one such
as is wholly free from Error or Frailty,
this Obedience can only lie in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
disposition and purpose of Mind
to obey every one of the Laws of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> deliver'd in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the utmost of our Power.
Now believing right being one part
of that Obedience, as well as acting
right is the other part, the Obedience
of assent must be implicitly to all that
is deliver'd there; That it is true. But
for as much as the particular acts of
an explicit assent cannot go any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than his understanding, who is
to assent, What he understands to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107142:55"/>
be the Truth deliver'd by our Saviour,
or the Apostles commission'd by him,
and assisted by his Spirit, That he must
necessarily believe: It becomes a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article to him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuse his assent to it, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
his Allegiance. For he that
denies any of the Doctrines that Christ
has deliver'd, to be true, denies him to
be sent from God, and consequently
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and so ceases to be
a Christian. From whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that if any more be necessary to
be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
than the believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and thereby taking him
for our King; It cannot be any set
bundle of Fundamentals culled out of
the Scripture, with an omission of the
rest, according as best suits any ones
Fancy, System, or Interest: But it
must be an explicit belief of all those
Propositions, which he according to
the best of his understanding, really
apprehends to be contain'd, and meant
in the Scripture; and an implicit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of all the rest, which he is ready
to believe, as soon as it shall please
God, upon his use of the means, to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107142:55"/>
enlighten him, and make them clear
to his understanding. So that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
almost every particular Man in
this sense has, or may have, a distinct
Catalogue of Fundamentals, each
whereof it is necessary for him expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
to believe, now that he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
whereof if he should disbelieve,
or deny any one, he would cast off
his Allegiance, disfranchise himself,
and be no longer a Subject of Christ's
Kingdom. But in this sense no body
can tell what is Fundamental to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
what is necessary for another
Man to believe. This Catalogue of
Fundamentals every one alone can
make for himself: No body can fix it
for him; no body can collect or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it to another: But this is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as God has dealt to every one
the measure of Light and Faith; and
hath open'd each Man's Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he may understand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Whoever has used wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> means
he is capable of, for the informing of
himself, with a readiness to believe
and obey what shall be taught and
prescrib'd by <hi>Iesus</hi> his Lord and King,
is a true and faithful Subject of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107142:56"/>
Kingdom; and cannot be thought to
fail in any thing necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Supposing a Man and his Wife,
barely by seeing the wonderful things
that <hi>Moses</hi> did, should have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themselves under his
Government; Or by reading his Law,
and liking it; or by any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
had been prevail'd on sincerely
to take him for their Ruler and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
and accordingly (renouncing
their former Idolatry and Heathenish
Pollutions) in token thereof had by
Baptism and Circumcision, the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Ceremonies, solemnly enter'd
themselves into that Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> had they not
thereby been made Denizons of the
Commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and invested
with all the Privileges and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of true Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
leaving to their Posterity a right to
their share in the Promis'd Land,
though they had died before they had
performed any other Act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to that Law; nay, though they
had not known whose Son <hi>Moses</hi> was,
nor how he had deliver'd the Children
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107142:56"/>
of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor whither he
was leading them? I do not say it is
likely they should be so far ignorant:
But whether they were or no, 'twas
enough, that they took him for their
Prince and Ruler, with a purpose to
obey him, to submit themselves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to his Commands and Conduct;
And did nothing afterwards, whereby
they disowned or rejected his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them. In that respect, none
of his Laws were greater, or more
necessary to be submitted to one than
another, though the matter of one
might be of much greater Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
than of another. But a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to any Law of the least Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
if it carry with it a disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Authority that made it,
forfeits all, and cuts off such an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
from that Commonwealth, and
all the Privileges of it.</p>
               <p>This is the case, in respect of other
Matters of Faith, to those who believe
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and take him
to be their King sent from God, and
so are already <hi>Christians.</hi> 'Tis not the
opinion, that any one may have of
the weightiness of the Matter, (if they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107142:57"/>
are, without their own fault ignorant
that our Saviour hath revealed it) that
shall disfranchise them, and make them
forfeit their Interest in his Kingdom:
they may be still good Subjects, though
they do not believe a great many
things, which Creed-makers may think
necessary to be believed. That which
is required of them is a sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to know his Mind declared in
the Gospel, and an explicit belief of
all that they understand to be so.
Not to believe what he has reveal'd,
whether in a lighter or more weighty
Matter, calls his veracity into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
destroys his Mission, denies his
Authority, and is a flat disowning him
to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> And so overturns
that Fundamental, and Necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
whereby a Man is a Christian.
But this cannot be done by a Man's
Ignorance, or unwilful Mistake of any
of the Truths published by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself, or his authorized and
inspired Ministers in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whilst a Man knows not that
it was his Will or Meaning, his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
is safe, though he believe the
contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:107142:57"/>
If this were not so, it is impossible,
that any one should be a Christian.
For in some things we are ignorant,
and err all, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For the holy inspired Writings,
being all of the same Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
must all equally in every Article
be Fundamental and necessary to be
believed; if that be a reason, that makes
any one Proposition in it necessary to
be believed. But the Law of Faith,
the Covenant of the Gospel, being a
Covenant of Grace, and not of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Right or Debt, nothing can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be believed, but
what by this new Law of Faith God
of his good pleasure hath made to be
so. And this 'tis plain by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Saviour and his Apostles,
to all that believed not already in
him, was only the believing the only
true God, and <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
whom he hath sent. The performance
of this puts a Man within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and is that which God will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to him for Righteousness. All
the other acts of assent to other
Truths, taught by our Saviour, and
his Apostles, are not what make a Man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107142:58"/>
a Christian; but are necessary acts of
Obedience to be performed by one,
who is a Christian; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Christian, ought to live by the
Laws of Christ's Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Nor are we without some glimpse
of Light, why it hath pleased God of
his Grace, that the believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to
be the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be that Faith
which he would impute to Men for
Righteousness. 'Tis evident from the
Scripture, that our Saviour despised
the Shame and endured the Cross for
the Joy that was set before him; Which
joy, 'tis also plain, was a Kingdom,
But in this Kingdom which his Father
had appointed to him, he could have
none but voluntary Subjects, such as
leaving the Kingdom of Darkness,
and of the Prince of this World, with
all the Pleasures, Pomps and Vanities
thereof, would put themselves under
his Dominion, and translate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into his Kingdom; which they
did by believing and owning him to
be the <hi>Messiah</hi> their King, and thereby
taking him to rule over them. For
the Faith for which God justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ieth,
is not an empty Speculation, but a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107142:58"/>
Faith joyn'd with Repentance, and
working by Love. And for this,
which was in effect to return to God
himself, and to their natural Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
due to him, and advance as
much as lay in them the Glory of the
Kingdom, which he had promised his
Son, God was pleased to declare he
would accept them, receive them to
Grace, and blot out all their former
Transgressions.</p>
               <p>This is evidently the Covenant of
Grace as deliver'd in the Scriptures:
And if this be not, I desire any one to
tell me what it is, and what are the
terms of it. 'Tis a Law of Faith,
whereby God has promised to forgive
all our Sins upon our Repentance, and
believing something; and to impute
that Faith to us for Righteousness,
Now I ask what 'tis by the Law of
Faith we are required to believe? for
till that be known, the Law of Faith
is not distinctly known, nor the terms
of the Covenant upon which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
God graciously offers us Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And if any one will say this
is not known, nay, is not easily, and
certainly to be known under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107142:59"/>
I desire him to tell me what the
greatest Enemies of Christianity can
say worse against it? For a way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to Salvation, that does not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
lead thither, or is propos'd so
as not to be known, are very little
different as to their consequence; and
Mankind would be left to wander in
darkness and uncertainty with the one
as well as the other.</p>
               <p>I do not write this for Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
sake; for had I minded Victory,
I would not have given the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
this new Matter of exception. I know
whatever is said, he must be bawling
for his fashionable and profitable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy,
and cry out against this too
which I have here added, as <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
and cast that Name upon all
that differs from what is held by
those, he would recommend his Zeal
to in Writing. I call it <hi>bawling,</hi> for
whether what he has said be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
I shall referr to those of his
own Brotherhood, if he be of any
Brotherhood, and there be any that
will joyn with him in his Set of
Fundamentals, when his Creed is
made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:107142:59"/>
Had I minded nothing but how to
deal with him, I had tied him up
short to his List of Fundamentals,
without affording him Topicks of
declaiming against what I have here
said. But I have enlarged on this point,
for the sake of such Readers, who
with a love of truth read Books of
this kind, and endeavour to inform
themselves in the things of their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
concernment: It being of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consideration with me, to give
any light and satisfaction to one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Person, who is really concerned
to understand, and be convinced of
the Religion he professes, than what a
Thousand fashionable or titular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of any sort of Orthodoxy shall
say or think of me, for not doing as
they do, <hi>i. e.</hi> for not saying after others,
without understanding what is said,
or upon what Grounds; or caring to
understand it.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider his Argument,
to prove the Articles he has given us
to be Fundamentals. In his <hi>Thoughts
concerning the Causes of Atheism,</hi> p. 119.
he argues from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16. where,
he says, <hi>Christianity is called a Mystery,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:107142:60"/>
that <hi>all things in Christianity are not
plain, and exactly level to every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
apprehension; that every thing in
Christianity is not clear, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and comprehensible by the weakest
Noddle.</hi> Let us take this for proved,
as much as he pleases, and then let us
see the force of this subtle Disputant's
Argument, for the necessity there is,
that every Christian Man should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
those, which he has given us for
Fundamental Articles out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
The Reason of that Obligation,
and the Necessity of every Man and
Woman's believing them, he has laid
in this, that they are to be found in
the <hi>Epistles,</hi> or in the <hi>Bible.</hi> This
Argument for them we have over
and over again in his <hi>Socinianism Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd,</hi>
as here, <hi>p.</hi> 9. thus; <hi>Are they
set down to no purpose in these inspired
Epistles. Why did the Apostles write
these Doctrines, was it not, that those
they writ to, might give their assent to
them?</hi> P. 22. <hi>They are in our Bibles
for that very purpose to be believed.</hi>
p. 25. Now I ask, can any one more
directly invalidate all he says here for
the necessity of believing his Articles?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107142:60"/>
Can any one more apparently write
booty than by saying that <hi>these his
Doctrines, these his Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
(which are after his fashion set
down between the 8. and 20. Pages
of this his First Chapter) are of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to be believed by every one,
before he can be a Christian, because
they are in the <hi>Epistles</hi> and in the
<hi>Bible;</hi> and yet to affirm that in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<hi>i. e.</hi> in the Epistles and in the
Bible there are <hi>Mysteries,</hi> there are
things <hi>not plain, not clear, not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
to common apprehensions.</hi> If his
Articles, some of which contain
Mysteries, are necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian,
because they are in the Bible; than
according to this rule it is necessary
for many Men to believe, what is not
<hi>intelligible</hi> to them; what their <hi>Nod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi>
cannot apprehend (as the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
is pleased to turn the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of vulgar Peoples understanding
the Fundamentals of their Religion
into ridicule) <hi>i. e.</hi> it is necessary for
many Men to do, what is impossible
for them to do, before they can be
Christians. But if there be several
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107142:61"/>
things in the Bible, and in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that it is not necessary for Men
to believe to make them Christians;
then all the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Arguments
from their being in the <hi>Epistles</hi> is no
Proof, that all his Articles are necessary
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
because they are set down in the
Epistles; much less, because he thinks
they may be drawn according to his
Sys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>em out of what is set down in
the Epistles. Let him therefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confess these and the like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<hi>Why did the Apostles write
these? was it not that those they writ
to, might give their assent to them?
Why should not every one of these Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Truths be believed and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?
They are in our Bibles for that
very purpose,</hi> and the like, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
and ridiculous: Let him
cease to propose them with so much
ostentation, for they can serve only to
mislead unwary Readers: Or let him
unsay what he has said of things <hi>not
plain</hi> to <hi>common apprehensions,</hi> not <hi>clear</hi>
and <hi>intelligible.</hi> Let him recant what
he has said of <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Christianity.
For I ask with him, <hi>p. 8. where can
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107142:61"/>
we be informed but in the sacred and
inspired writings?</hi> It is ridiculous to
urge, that any thing is necessary to
be explicitly believed to make a Man
a Christian, because it is writ in the
<hi>Epistles</hi> and <hi>in the Bible;</hi> Unless he
confess that there is no <hi>Mystery,</hi> no
thing not <hi>plain</hi> not <hi>intelligible</hi> to Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
understanding, in the Epistles or in
the Bible.</p>
               <p>This is so evident, that the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
himself, who <hi>p.</hi> 119. of his
<hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi>
thought it ridiculous to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that the Vulgar should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Christianity, is here of another
Mind: And, <hi>p.</hi> 30. says of his Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Doctrines and Articles necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be assented to, that they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi>
and <hi>plain;</hi> There is no <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity
and Doubtfulness in them; They
shine with their own light, and to an
unprejudiced eye are plain, evident and
illustrious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To draw the <hi>Unmasker</hi> out of the
Clouds, and prevent his hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the doubtfulness of his Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
I shall desire him to say directly,
whether the Articles, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107142:62"/>
to be believed, to make a Man
a Christian, and particularly those he
has set down for such, are all plain
and intelligible, and such as may be
understood and comprehended (I will
not say in the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s ridiculous
way, by <hi>the weakest Noddles,</hi> but)
by every illiterate Countryman and
Woman capable of Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
               <p>If he says yes; Then all Mysteries
are excluded out of his Articles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make a Man
a Christian. For that which can be
comprehended by every Day-Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
every poor Spinster, that is a
Member of the Church, cannot be
a Mystery. And if what such illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
People cannot understand, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to be believed to make them
Christians, the greatest part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
are shut out from being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Unmasker <hi>has provided an
Answer in these words,</hi> p. 31. There is,
<hi>says he,</hi> a difficulty in the Doctrine of
the Trinity, and several Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as to the exact manner of the things
themselves, which we shall never be able
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107142:62"/>
to comprehend, at least on this side of
Heaven: But there is no difficulty as
to the reality and certainty of them,
because we know they are revealed to us
by God in the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>Which Answer of <hi>difficulty in the
manner,</hi> and no <hi>difficulty in the reality,</hi>
having the appearance of a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
looks like Learning; but when
it comes to be applied to the case in
hand will scarce afford us sense.</p>
               <p>The Question is about a Proposition
to be believed, which must first ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be understood. For a Man
cannot possibly give his assent to any
Affirmation or Negation, unless he
understand the terms as they are joyn'd
in that Proposition, and has a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the thing affirm'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd,
and also a Conception of the
thing concerning which it is affirm'd
or deny'd as they are there put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But let the Proposition be what
it will, there is no more to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
than is expressed in the terms
of that Proposition. If it be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
concerning a Matter of Fact,
'tis enough to conceive, and believe
the Matter of Fact. If it be a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107142:63"/>
concerning the manner of the
Fact, the manner of the Fact must
also be believed, as it is intelligibly
expressed in that Proposition, <hi>v. g.</hi>
should this Proposition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
be offer'd as an Article of Faith to an
illiterate Countryman of <hi>England,</hi> he
could not believe it: Because, though
a true Proposition, yet it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in words whose meaning he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
not, he could not give any
assent to it. Put it into English, he
understands what is meant by the
<hi>Dead shall rise.</hi> For he can conceive,
that the same Man, who was dead
and senseless, should be alive again; As
well as he can, that the same Man,
who is now in a Lethargy, should
awake again; or the same Man that
now is out of his sight, and he knows
not whether he be alive or dead, should
return, and be with him again: And
so he is capable of believing it, though
he conceives nothing of the manner
how a Man revives, wakes, or moves.
But none of these manners of those
actions being included in those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
the Proposition concerning
the Matter of Fact (if it imply no
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107142:63"/>
contradiction in it) may be believed;
and so all that is required may be done,
whatever difficulty may be <hi>as to the</hi>
exact manner how it is brought
about.</p>
               <p>But where the Proposition is about
the manner, the belief too must be
of the manner. <hi>v. g.</hi> The Article is,
<hi>The Dead shall be raised with spiritual
Bodies.</hi> And then the belief must be
as well of this manner of the Fact, as
of the Fact it self. So that what is
said here by the <hi>Unmasker</hi> about the
<hi>manner</hi> signifies nothing at all in the
case. What is understood to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in each Proposition, whether
it be of the manner, or not of the
manner, is (by its being a Revelation
from God) to be believed, as far as it
is understood: But no more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be believed concerning any
Article, than is contain'd in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Difficulties, adds farther in
these words, <hi>But there is no difficulty
as to the reality and certainty of the
truths of the Gospel. Because we know,
they are revealed to us by God in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107142:64"/>
Holy Scripture,</hi> is yet farther from
signifying any thing to the purpose,
than the former. The Question is
about understanding; And, in what
sense they are understood, believing
several Propositions, or Articles of
Faith, which are to be found in the
Scripture. To this, the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
says, there can be <hi>no difficulty</hi> at all
<hi>as to their reality and certainty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are revealed by God.</hi> Which
amounts to no more but this, That
there is no difficulty at all in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and believing this Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that whatever is revealed by God
is really and certainly true.</hi> But is the
understanding and believing this single
Proposition, the understanding and
believing all the Articles of Faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed? Is this all the
explicit Faith a Christian need have?
If so, then a Christian need explicitly
believe no more but this one Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>viz.</hi> That all the Propositions
between the two Covers of his Bible
are certainly true. But I imagine the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> will not think the believing
this one Proposition is a sufficient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of all those Fundamental Articles,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107142:64"/>
which he has given us as necessary to
be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
For if that will serve the turn,
I conclude he may make his Set of
Fundamentals as large and express to
his System as he pleases; <hi>Calvinists,
Arminians, Anabaptists, Socinians,</hi> will
all thus own the belief of them; <hi>viz.</hi>
That all that God has revealed in
the Scripture is really and certainly
true.</p>
               <p>But if believing this Proposition,
that all that is reveal'd by God in the
Scripture is true, be not all the Faith
which the <hi>Unmasker</hi> requires, what
he says about the <hi>reality</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi>
of all Truths reveal'd by God removes
nothing of the difficulty. A Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Divine Authority is found in
the Scripture: 'tis agreed presently
between him and me, that it contains
a <hi>real certain</hi> truth: But the difficulty
is, what is the Truth it contains, to
which he, and I must assent. <hi>v. g.</hi> The
Profession of Faith made by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
in these words, <hi>Iesus Christ is
the Son of God,</hi> upon which he was
admitted into the Church as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
I believe contains a <hi>real and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107142:65"/>
Truth.</hi> Is that enough? no says
the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> p. 87. it <hi>includes in it
that Christ was God;</hi> and therefore it
is not enough for me to believe, that
these words contain a <hi>real certain</hi> truth;
But I must believe they contain this
truth, that Jesus Christ is God; That
the Eunuch spoke them in that sense,
and in that sense I must assent to them:
Whereas they appear to me to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and meant here, as well as in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
other places of the New Testament,
in this sense, <hi>viz. That Iesus Christ is
the Messiah,</hi> and in that sense in this
place I assent to them. The meaning
then of these words as spoken by the
Eunuch is the difficulty: And I desire
the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> by the Application of
what he has said here, to remove that
difficulty. For granting all Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God to be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi>
true (as certainly it is) how
does the believing that general truth
remove any difficulty about the sense
and interpretation of any particular
Proposition found in any passage of the
Holy Scriptures? Or is it possible for
any Man to understand it in one sense,
and believe it in another; because it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107142:65"/>
is a Divine Revelation, that has <hi>reallity</hi>
and <hi>certainty</hi> in it? Thus much as to
what the <hi>Unmasker</hi> says of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
he has given us, <hi>p. 30. viz.</hi>
That <hi>No true Lover of God and Truth
need doubt of any of them: For there is
no ambiguity and doubtfulness in them.</hi>
If the distinction he has used <hi>of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as to the exact manner, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as to the reality and certainty of
Gospel Truths,</hi> will remove all <hi>ambiguity
and doubtfulness</hi> from all those Texts of
Scripture, from whence he and others
deduce Fundamental Articles, so that
they will be <hi>plain and intelligible</hi> to
every Man in the sense he understands
them, he has done great Service to
Christianity.</p>
               <p>But he seems to distrust that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in the following words. <hi>They shine,</hi>
says he, <hi>with their own light, and to
an unprejudiced eye are plain evident
and illustrious, and they would always
continue so, if some ill minded Men did
not perplex and entangle them.</hi> I see
the Matter would go very smooth, if
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> might be the sole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Interpreter of Scripture. He
is wisely of that Judge's Mind, who
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107142:66"/>
was against hearing the Counsel on
the other side, because they always
<hi>perplexed</hi> the Cause.</p>
               <p>But if those who differ from the
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> shall in their turns call him
the <hi>Prejudiced</hi> and <hi>Ill-minded Man,</hi>
who <hi>perplexes</hi> these Matters (as they
may with as much Authority as he) we
are but where we were; Each must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
for himself the best he can;
till the <hi>Unmasker</hi> be received as the
only <hi>unprejudiced</hi> Man, to whose Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
every one without Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is with an implicit Faith to
submit.</p>
               <p>Here again, <hi>p.</hi> 32. The <hi>Unmasker</hi>
puts upon me, what I never said, and
therefore I must desire him to shew,
where it is, that I pretend,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="part">
               <head>XI.</head>
               <p>That this <hi>Proposition,</hi> that Jesus is
the Messiah, <hi>is more intelligible
than any of those he has named.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his <hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes
of Atheism,</hi> p. 120. he argues that
this Proposition [<hi>Iesus is the Messiah</hi>]
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107142:66"/>
has more difficulty in it than the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the Holy Trinity. And his
Proofs are worthy of an <hi>Unmasker.
For,</hi> says he, <hi>Here is an Hebrew word
first to be explain'd,</hi> or (as he has this
strong Argument again, <hi>Socinianism
Unmask'd,</hi> p. 32.) <hi>Here first the Name
Iesus, which is of Hebrew extraction,
though since Grecized must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>Iesus</hi> being a proper Name,
only denoting a certain Person, needs
not to be expounded, of what <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
soever it be. Is this Proposition,
<hi>Ionathan</hi> was the Son of <hi>Saul</hi> King of
<hi>Israel,</hi> any thing the harder, because
the three proper Names in it, <hi>Ionathan,
Saul</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> are of <hi>Hebrew extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi>
And is it not as easie and as
<hi>level to the understanding of the Vulgar</hi>
as this, <hi>Arthur</hi> was the Son of <hi>Henry</hi>
King of <hi>England,</hi> though neither of
these Names be of <hi>Hebrew extraction?</hi>
Or cannot any <hi>Vulgar Capacity</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Proposition, <hi>Iohn Edwards
writ a Book, Intituled,</hi> Socinianism
Unmask'd, till the Name <hi>Iohn,</hi> which
is of <hi>Hebrew extraction,</hi> be explained
to him? If this be so, Parents were
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107142:67"/>
best beware how hereafter they give
their Children Scripture Names, if
they cannot understand what they say
to one another about them, till these
Names <hi>of Hebrew extraction</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them; And every Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that is in Writings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
made concerning Persons, that
have Names of <hi>Hebrew extractions,</hi>
become thereby as hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
as the Doctrine of the Holy
Trinity.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is just of the
same size. The word <hi>Messias</hi> must,
he says, be explained too. Of what
Extraction soever it be, there needs no
more Explication of it than what our
English Bible gives of it, where it is
plain to any <hi>vulgar capacity,</hi> that it
was used to denote that King and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer
whom God had promised. So
that this Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messiah,</hi>
has no more difficulty in it, than this,
<hi>Iesus</hi> is the promised <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer;</hi>
Or than this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was King
and Deliverer of <hi>Persia:</hi> Which I think
requires not much depth of <hi>Hebrew</hi>
to be understood. He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
this Proposition, and took <hi>Cyrus</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:107142:67"/>
for his King, was a Subject and a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of his Kingdom; And he that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
the other, and takes <hi>Iesus</hi> to
be his King, is his Subject and a
Member of his Kingdom. But if
this be as hard as it is to some Men to
understand the Doctrine of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
I fear many of the Kings in the
World have but few true Subjects.
To believe Jesus to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is (as
he has been told over and over again)
to take him for our King and Ruler,
promised and sent by God. This is
that, which will make any one from
a <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> to be a <hi>Christian.</hi>
In this sense it is very intelligible to
<hi>vulgar Capacities.</hi> Those who so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and believe it, are so far from
<hi>pronouncing those words as a spell</hi> (as
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> ridiculously suggests,
<hi>p.</hi> 33.) that they thereby become
Christians.</p>
               <p>But what if I tell the <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
that there is one Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who
(when he speaks his Mind, without
considering how it will make for or
against him) in another place, thinks
this Proposition, <hi>Iesus is the Messias,</hi>
very easie and intelligible? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107142:68"/>
him of it, I shall desire him to
turn to the 74th. Page of his <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism
Unmask'd,</hi> where he will find
that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> without any great
search into Hebrew Extractions, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
<hi>Iesus the Messiah</hi> to signifie this,
<hi>That Iesus of Nazareth was that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and extraordinary Person prophesied
of long before, and that he was sent and
commissioned by God:</hi> Which I think
is no very hard Proposition to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
But it is no strange thing,
that that which was very easie to an
<hi>Unmasker</hi> in one place, should be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
hard in another; where want
of something better requires to have
it so.</p>
               <p>Another Argument that he uses to
prove the Articles he has given us
to be necessary to Salvation, (<hi>p.</hi> 22.)
is because they are Doctrines which
contain things that in their Nature
have an <hi>immediate respect to the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
Author, Way, End, Means and
Issue of Mens Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
And here I desire him to
prove,</p>

            <div n="12" type="part">
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:107142:68"/>
               <head>XII.</head>
               <p>That every one of his Articles
contains things so immediately
relating to the <hi>Occasion, Author,
Way, Means and Issue of our
Redemption and Salvation,</hi> that
no body can be saved without
understanding the Texts from
whence he draws them, in the
very same sense that he does;
And explicitly believing all these
Propositions that he has deduced,
and all that he will deduce from
Scripture, when he shall please to
compleat his Creed.</p>
               <p>Pag. 23. <hi>He says of his Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
not without good reason THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE
I called them Essential and
Integral parts of our Christian and
Evangelical Faith: And why the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator
fleers at these terms, <hi>p.</hi> 18.
I know no reason, but that he cannot
confute the Application of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> One would think by the
word <hi>therefore,</hi> which he uses here,
that in the precedent Paragraph, he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107142:69"/>
had produced some reason to justifie
his ridiculous use of those terms in his
<hi>Thoughts concerning Atheism,</hi> p. 111.
But nothing therein will be found
tending to it. Indeed the foregoing
Paragraph begins with these words,
<hi>Thus I have briefly set before the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those Evangelical Truths, those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Principles, which belong to the very
essence of Christianity.</hi> Amongst these
there is the word <hi>Essence:</hi> But that
from thence, or any thing else in that
Paragraph, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> could with
good sense, or any sense at all, inferr
as he does, <hi>not without good reason,
THEREFORE, I called them the
ESSENTIAL and INTEGRAL
parts of our Christian and Evangelical
Faith,</hi> requires an extraordinary sort
of Logick to make out. What, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, is your <hi>good reason</hi> too
here, upon which you inferr <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
&amp;c? For it is impossible for any
one but an <hi>Unmasker,</hi> to find one word
justifying his use of the terms <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
and <hi>Integral.</hi> But it would be a
great restraint to the running of the
<hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Pen, if you should not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him the free use of illative Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107142:69"/>
where there are no Promises to
support them: And if you should not
take Affirmations without Proof for
reasoning, you at once strike off above
three quarters of his Book; and he
will often, for several Pages toget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have nothing to say. As for Example,
from <hi>p.</hi> 28. to <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>
               <p>But to shew, that I did not without
reason say his use of the terms <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
and <hi>Integral,</hi> in the place before
quoted, was ridiculous, I must mind
my Reader, that <hi>pag.</hi> 109. of his
<hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi>
he having said that <hi>the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolary
Writings are fraught with other
Fundamentals besides that one which I
mention,</hi> and then having set them
down, he closes his Catalogue of them
thus: <hi>These are Matters of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Epistles, and they are Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
and Integral parts of the Gospel
it self,</hi> p. 111. Now what could be
more ridiculous, than where the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is about Fundamental Doctrines,
which are the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Christian
Religion, without an assent to which
a Man cannot be a Christian, and so
he himself calls them, <hi>p.</hi> 21. of his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107142:70"/>
                  <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> that he should
close the List he had made of <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Doctrines,</hi> i. e. Essential Points
of the Christian Religion, with tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Reader, <hi>These are Essential and
Integral parts of the Gospel it self?</hi> i. e.
these which I have given you for
<hi>Fundamental,</hi> for <hi>Essential</hi> Doctrines of
the Gospel are the <hi>Fundamental</hi> and
not <hi>Fundamental, Essential</hi> and not <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi>
parts of the Gospel mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
For <hi>integral</hi> parts, in all the
Writers I have met with, besides the
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> are contra-distinguished to
<hi>Essential;</hi> and signifie such parts as the
thing can be without, but without
them will not be so compleat and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
as with them. Just such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness
as our <hi>Unmasker</hi> would any
one shew, who taking upon him to
set down the parts <hi>Essential</hi> to a Man,
without the having of which he could
not be a Man, should name the Soul,
the Head, the Heart, Lungs, Stomach,
Liver, Spleen, Eyes, Ears, Tongue,
Arms, Legs, Hair and Nails; and to
make all sure, should conclude with
these words, <hi>these are Parts contain'd</hi>
in a Man, <hi>and are Essential and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107142:70"/>
Parts of a Man himself,</hi> i. e. they
are Parts, some without which he
cannot be a Man, and others which
though they make the Man entire,
yet he may be a Man without them;
As a Man ceases not to be a Man,
though he want a Nail, a Finger, or
an Arm, which are <hi>Integral Parts</hi> of
a Man. <hi>Risum teneatis?</hi> If the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
can make any better sence of
his <hi>Essential and Integral Parts of the
Gospel it self;</hi> I will ask his Pardon for
my Laughing: Till then he must not
be angry, if the Reader and I laugh
too. Besides I must tell him, That those
which he has set down are not the
<hi>Integral Parts of the Christian Faith;</hi>
any more than the Head, the Trunk,
and the Arms, Hands and Thighs are
the Integral Parts of a Man: For a Man
is not entire without the Legs and
Feet too. They are some of the <hi>Integral
Parts</hi> indeed; But cannot be called the
<hi>Integral Parts,</hi> where any that go to
make up the whole Man are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ft out.
Nor those the <hi>Integral,</hi> but some of
the <hi>Integral Parts</hi> of the Christian
Faith, out of which any of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
proposed in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107142:71"/>
are omitted: For whatever is there
proposed, is proposed to be believed,
and so is a part of the Christian
Faith.</p>
               <p>Before I leave his Catalogue of the
<hi>Essential and Integral Parts</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
which he has given us, instead of
one containing the Articles necessary
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
I must take notice of what he
says, whilst he is making it, <hi>p. 9. Why
then is there a Treatise publish'd to tell
the World that the bare belief of a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
is all that is required of a Christian.</hi>
As if there were no difference between
believing a <hi>Messiah,</hi> and believing <hi>Iesus</hi>
to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> No difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>required of a Christian,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to make a Man a Christian.
As if you should say, renouncing his
former Idolatry, and being Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
and Baptized into <hi>Moses,</hi> was
all that was required to make a Man
an Israelite; Therefore it was all that
was required of an Israelite. For
these two Falshoods has he in this
one short Sentence, thought fit slily
to Father upon me the <hi>humble imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
of the Iesuits,</hi> as he is pleased
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107142:71"/>
to call me. And therefore I must

about the Epistles. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
thus; <hi>The Gentleman is not without
his Evasions, and he sees it is high
time to make use of them. This puts
him in some disorder. For when he
comes to speak of my mentioning his ill
treatment of the Epistles—you may
observe that he begins to grow warmer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107142:72"/>
than before. Now this meek Man is
nettled, and one may perceive he is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Scandal that he hath given
to good People by his slighting the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolary
Writings of the Holy Apostles,
yet he is so cunning as to disguise his
Passion as well as he can.</hi> Let all this
impertinent and inconsistent stuff be
so. I am angry, and cannot disguise
it; I am <hi>cunning</hi> and would disguise it;
But yet the quick-sighted <hi>Unmasker</hi>
has found me out, that I am <hi>nettled.</hi>
What does all this notable Prologue
of <hi>Hictius Doctius,</hi> of a <hi>Cunning Man,</hi>
and in effect <hi>no Cunning Man,</hi> in <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,

publish to the World those Passages
which shew my contempt of the
Epistles</q> are so full of heat and
disorder, that they need no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
But <hi>what need I, good Sir, do
this, when you have done it your self?</hi>
A Reply, I own, very soft, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I may not say, very silly, let the
Reader judge. The <hi>Unmasker</hi> having

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107142:72"/>
my Reply in my <hi>Vindicat.</hi> p. 19.
was thus; <q>Sir, when your Angry
Fit is over, and the abatement of
your Passion has given way to the
return of your Sincerity, I shall beg
you to read this Passage in the
297. <hi>p.</hi> of my Book. These holy
Writers (<hi>viz.</hi> the Penmen of the
Epistles) inspired from above, writ
nothing but Truth; and in most
places very weighty Truths to us
now, for the expounding, clearing
and confirming of the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and establishing those in it,
who had imbraced it. And again,
<hi>p.</hi> 299. the other Parts [<hi>i. e.</hi> besides
the Gospels and the Acts] of <hi>DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE
REVELATION</hi> are
Objects of Faith, and are so to be
received; They are Truths of which
none, that is once known to be such,
<hi>i. e.</hi> revealed, may or ought to be
disbelieved. And if this does not
satisfie you, that I have as high a
Veneration for the Epistles, as you,
or any one can have, I require you
to publish to the World those <hi>PAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAGES,</hi>
which shew my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of them.</q> After such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107142:73"/>
words of mine, expressing my
veneration for that part of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>on,
which is contain'd in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
any one but an <hi>Unmasker</hi> would
blush to charge me with <hi>contempt</hi> of
them, without alledging, when sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
to it, any word in my Book to
justifie that charge.</p>
               <p>If hardness of Forehead, were
strength of Brains, 'twere two to one
of his side against any Man I ever
yet heard of. I require him to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to the World those <hi>Passages,</hi> that
shew my <hi>contempt</hi> of the Epistles, and
he answers me, <hi>he need not do it,</hi> for
<hi>I have done it my self.</hi> Whoever had
common sense would understand, that
what I demanded was, that he should
shew the World where, amongst all I
had published, there were any <hi>Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
that expressed <hi>contempt</hi> of the
Epistles: For it was not expected, he
should quote <hi>Passages</hi> of mine, that I
had never published. And this accute
<hi>Unmasker</hi> (to this) says, I had published
them my self. So that the reason why
he cannot find them is, because I have
published them my self. But, says he,
<hi>I appeal to the Reader, whether (after
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107142:73"/>
your tedious Collections out of the four</hi>
Evangelists) <hi>your passing by the Epistles,
and neglecting wholly what the Apostles
say in them, be not publishing to the
World your contempt of them?</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of him to publish to the World
those <hi>Passages,</hi> which shew my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Epistles: And he answers,
<hi>he need not, I have done it my self.</hi> How
does that appear? I have <hi>passed</hi> by
the Epistles, says he. My passing
them by then, are <hi>Passages published</hi>
against the Epistles? For <hi>publishing of
Passages</hi> is what you said you <hi>need not
do,</hi> and what <hi>I had done.</hi> So that the
<hi>Passages</hi> I have published, containing
a contempt of the Epistles, are extant
in my saying nothing of them? Surely
this same <hi>passing by</hi> has done some
very shrewd displeasure to our poor
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> that he so starts when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is but named, and cannot
think it contains less than <hi>Exclusion,
Defiance</hi> and <hi>Contempt.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Proposition remaining to be
proved by you is,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="part">
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107142:74"/>

               <p>That one cannot pass by any thing
without contempt of it.</p>
               <p>And when you have proved it, I
shall then ask you, what will become
of all those parts of Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; all
those Chapters and Verses, that you
have <hi>passed by</hi> in your Collection of
Fundamental Articles? Those that you
have vouchsafed to set down, you tell
us <hi>are in the Bible on purpose to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi>
What must become of all the
rest, which you have omitted? Are
they there not to be believed? And
must the <hi>Reader</hi> understand your <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them by</hi> to be a publishing to the
World your <hi>contempt</hi> of them? If so,
you have Unmasked your self: If not,
but you may <hi>pass by</hi> some parts of
Scripture, nay whole Epistles, as you
have those of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and St. <hi>Iude,</hi>
without <hi>contempt;</hi> Why may not I
without <hi>contempt</hi> pass by others; But
because you have a liberty to do what
you will, and I must do but what you
in your good pleasure will allow me?
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107142:74"/>
But if I ask you whence you have this
Privilege above others; You will have
nothing to say, except it be according
to your usual Skill in Divining, that
you know my Heart, and the Thoughts
that are in it, which you find not like
yours, right, and orthodox, and good;
But always evil and perverse, such as
I dare not own, but hypocritically ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
say nothing of, or declare against;
But yet with all my cunning I cannot
hide them from you; your all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
penetration always finds them out;
You know them, or you guess at them,
as is best for your turn, and that's as
good: And then presently I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
I doubt whether the World
has ever had any two-eyed Man your
equal for penetration and a quick
sight. The telling by the Spectators
looks, what Card he guesses, is nothing
to what you can do. You take the
heighth of an Author's Parts, by
numbring the Pages of his Book; You
can spy an Heresy in him by his saying
not a syllable of it; Distinguish him
from the Orthodox by his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
places of Scripture, just as several
of the Orthodox do; You can repeat
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107142:75"/>
by heart whole Leaves of what is in
his Mind to say, before he speaks a
word of it; You can discover De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
before they are hatch'd, and all
the Intrigues of carrying them on by
those who never thought of them.
All this, and more you can do, by the
Spirit of Orthodoxy, or which is as
certain, by your own good Spirit of
Invention informing you. Is not this
to be an errant Conjurer?</p>
               <p>But to your Reply. You say, <hi>after
my TEDIOUS Collection out of the
four Evangelists, my passing by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and neglecting wholly what the
Apostles say,</hi> &amp;c. I wondred at first
why you mention'd not the <hi>Acts</hi> here,
as well as the four Evangelists. For I
have not, as you have in other places
observed, been sparing of Collections
out of the Acts too. But there was it
seems a Necessity here for your omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it: For that would have stood too
near what followed, in these words;
and <hi>neglecting wholly what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
say.</hi> For if it appear'd to the
Reader, out of your own Confession,
that I allowed and built upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority of what the Apostles
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107142:75"/>
say in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he could not so easily
be mislead into an Opinion, that I
contemned what they say in their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
But this is but a slight touch of
your Leger-de-main.</p>
               <p>And now I ask the Reader what he
will think of a Minister of the Gospel,
who cannot bear the Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I have produced, nor my Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
out of the four Evangelists?
This which in his <hi>Thoughts of the
Causes of Atheism,</hi> p. 114. was want
of <hi>Vivacity and Elevation of Mind,</hi> want
of <hi>a Vein of Sense and Reason, yea
and of Elocution too,</hi> is here in his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism
Unmask'd,</hi> a <hi>tedious Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
out of the four Evangelists.</hi> Those
places I have quoted, lie heavy it
seems upon his Stomach, and are too
many to be got off. But it was my
business not to omit one of them;
that the Reader might have a full
view of the whole tenour of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to the Unconverted <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles;</hi> and might therein see what
Faith they were Converted to, and
upon their assent to which they were
pronounced Believers and admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107142:76"/>
the Christian Church. But the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> complains there are too
many of them: He thinks the Gospel,
the good News of Salvation <hi>tedious</hi>
from the Mouth of our Saviour and
his Apostles: He is of opinion, That
before the Epistles were writ, and
without believing precisely what he
thinks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it to cull out of them, there
could be no Christians; And if we had
nothing but the four Evangelists, we
could not be saved. And yet 'tis plain,
that every single one of the Four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and at
least they all together contain all that
is necessary to Salvation. If any one
doubt of this, I referr him to Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
for Satisfaction, who hath
abundantly proved it.</p>
               <p>His following words (were he not
the same <hi>Unmasker</hi> all through) would
be beyond Parallel. <hi>But let us hear
why the Vindicator did not attempt to
Collect any Articles out of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
He assigns this as one Reason:</hi>
                  <q>The Epistles being writ to those
who were already Believers, it could
not be supposed that they were writ
to them to teach them Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</q>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107142:76"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 13, 14. Vindic. <hi>Certainly
no Man would have conjectured that he
would have used such an Evasion as
this. I will say that for him, he goes
beyond all surmises, he is above all
Conjectures, he hath a faculty which no
Creature on Earth can ever fathom.</hi>
Thus far the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> in his Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<hi>strain.</hi> In what follows he comes
to his closer reasoning against what
I had said. His words are, <hi>Do we not
know that the four Gospels were writ to
and for Believers, as well as Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
Answ.</hi> I grant it. Now let us
see your Inference: Therefore what
these holy Historians recorded, that
our Saviour and his Apostles said
and preach'd to Unbelievers, was said
and preach'd to Believers. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
which our Saviour had with
the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and her
Townsmen, was addressed to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
because St. <hi>Iohn</hi> writ his Gospel
(wherein it is recorded as a part of
our Saviour's History) for Believers
as well as Unbelievers. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Preaching to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Preaching at <hi>Antioch,</hi> at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi>
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. was not to Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107142:77"/>
for their Conversion; Because
St. <hi>Luke</hi> dedicates his History of the
Acts of the Apostles to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who
was a Christian, as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
proves in this Paragraph.
Just as if he should say, that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
which <hi>Caesar</hi> records he had
upon several Occasions with the <hi>Gauls</hi>
were not addressed to the <hi>Gauls</hi> alone,
but to the <hi>Romans</hi> also; because his
Commentaries were writ for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
as well as others: Or that the
Sayings of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> were not spoke
by them to their Contemporaries on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because they are recorded by him
for the benefit of Posterity.</p>
               <p>I perused the Preachings of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
World, to see what they taught
and required to be believed to make
Men Christians: And these all I set
down, and leave the World to be
judge what they contain'd. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
which were all written to those
who had imbraced the Faith, and were
all Christians already, I thought would
not so distinctly shew, what were
those Doctrines, which were absolutely
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107142:77"/>
necessary to make Men Christians; they
being not writ to convert Unbelievers,
but to build up those, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Believers, in their most holy
Faith. This is plainly expressed in the
Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> V. 11, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Of whom,</hi> i. e. Christ, <hi>we have many
things to say and hard to be utter'd, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ye are all dull of hearing. For
when for the time ye ought to be Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
ye have need that one teach you
again, which be the first Principles of
the Oracles of God; and are become such
as have need of Milk and not of strong
Meat. For every one that useth milk
is unskilful in the word of righteousness;
for he is a Babe: But strong meat belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to him that is of full age, even those
who by reason of use have their senses
exercised, to discern both good and bad.
Therefore leaving the Principles of the
Doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
perfection, not laying again the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Repentance from dead Works,
and of Faith towards God and of the
Doctrine of Baptism, and of laying on
of hands, and of the resurrection of the
Dead, and of eternal Iudgment.</hi> Here
the Apostle shews what was his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107142:78"/>
in writing this Epistle: Not to teach
them the Fundamental Doctrines of
the Christian Religion, but to lead
them on to more Perfection; That is,
to greater degrees of Knowledge of
the wise Design and wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and carrying on of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
and the Evidence of it; which he
makes out in this Epistle, by shewing
its Correspondence with the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and particularly with the
Oeconomy of the Mosaical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Here I might ask the <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
whether those many things which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he had to
say of Christ, (hard to be utter'd to
them, because they were dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
had not an <hi>immediate respect to
the Occasion, Author, Way, Means, or
Issue of their Redemption and Salvation;</hi>
And therefore, <hi>whether they were such
things without the knowledge of which
they could not be saved,</hi> as the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
says of such things, <hi>p.</hi> 23. And
the like I might ask him concerning
those things which the Apostle tells
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Ep. Chap. III. 2. that
they <hi>were not yet able to bear.</hi> For
much to the same purpose, he speaks
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107142:78"/>
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Ep. 1. Ch. III. as in
the above-cited places he did to the
Hebrews; <hi>That he as a wise Master-Builder
had laid the Foundation:</hi> And
that <hi>Foundation,</hi> he himself tells us, is
<hi>Iesus the Messiah,</hi> and that there is no
other Foundation to be laid. And that
in this he laid the Foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> records,
<hi>Act</hi> XVIII. 4. in these words; <hi>Paul</hi> at
Corinth <hi>reason'd in the Synagogue every
Sabbath-day, and testified to the Iews
that Iesus was the Messiah.</hi> Upon which
Foundation he tells them there might
be a Superstructure. But that what is
built on the Foundation is not the
Foundation, I think I need not prove.
He further tells them, that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to build upon this Foundation;
But withal says, he had <hi>fed them</hi> till
then <hi>with Milk, and not with Meat:
because they were Babes, and had not
been able to bear it, neither were they
yet able.</hi> And therefore this Epistle
we see is almost wholly spent in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
of their Miscarriages, and in
Exhortations and Instructions relating
to Practice, and very little said in
it for the explaining any part of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107142:79"/>
great <hi>Mystery</hi> of Salvation contain'd in
the Gospel.</p>
               <p>By these Passages we may see (were
it not evident to common sence it
self from the Nature of things) that
the design of these Epistles was not
to lay the Foundations, or teach the
Principles of the Christian Religion;
they being writ to those who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them, and were Christians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
The same holds in all the
other Epistles: And therefore the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
seem'd not to me the properest
parts of Scripture, to give us that
Foundation distinct from all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructures
built on it; Because in
the Epistles, the latter was the thing
propos'd, rather than the former. For
the main intention of the Apostles in
writing their Epistles, could not be to
do what was done already; to lay
down barely the Foundations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to those who were Christians
already; but to build upon it some
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arther Explication of it, which either
their particular Circumstances, or a
general evidencing of the Truth, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Excellencies, and Privileges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of the Gospel required. This was the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107142:79"/>
reason that perswaded me to take the
Articles of Faith absolutely necessary
to be received to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
only from the Preachings of our
Saviour and his Apostles to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
World, as laid down in the
Historical Part of the New Testament.
And I thought it a good Reason.
It being past doubt, that they in their
Preachings proposed to the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
all that was necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make them Christians. And
also, that that Faith, upon a Profession
whereof any one was admitted into
the Church as a Believer, had all that
was necessary in it to make him a
Christian; because if it wanted any
thing necessary, he had necessarily not
been admitted; unless we can suppose,
that any one was admitted into the
Christian Church by our Saviour, and
his Apostles, who was not yet a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
or pronounced a Believer, who
yet wanted something necessary to
make him a Believer, <hi>i. e.</hi> was a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
and not a Believer at the same
time. But what those Articles were,
which had been Preach'd to those, to
whom the Epistles were writ, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107142:80"/>
upon the Belief whereof they had been
admitted into the Christian Church,
and became as they are called <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Saints, Faithful, Elect,</hi> &amp;c. could
not be collected out of the Epistles.
This, though it were my reason, and
must be a reason to every one, who
would make this Enquiry; and the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> quotes the place where I
told him it was my reason; Yet he
according to his never erring Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
flatly tells me, <hi>p.</hi> 38. that it
was not, and adds, <hi>Here then is want
of Sincerity,</hi> &amp;c. I must desire him
therefore to prove what he says,
<hi>p. 38. viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="15" type="part">
               <head>XV.</head>
               <p>That <hi>by the same Argument that I
would perswade that</hi> the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
<hi>are not to be sought for
in the</hi> Epistles, he can prove <hi>that
they are not to be sought for
in the Gospels and in the Acts;</hi>
because <hi>even these were writ to
those that believed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And next I desire him to prove,
what he also says in the same Page, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="part">
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:107142:80"/>
               <head>XVI.</head>
               <p>That the Epistles being writ to those
that believed, was not an Argument
that I did make use of.</p>
               <p>He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 38. That it is the
Argument whereby I <hi>would perswade,</hi>
and in the very same Page, a few Lines
lower, says, <hi>That it is not the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I did make use of.</hi> Who, but an
arrant <hi>Unmasker,</hi> would contradict
himself so flatly in the same breath?
And yet upon that he raises a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of my <hi>want of Sincerity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>want of Sincerity</hi> in one of us,
we need not go far for an Instance.
The next Paragraph, <hi>p.</hi> 38.—40. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
us a gross one of it; Wherein
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> argues strongly, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any thing I had said, but against
an Untruth of his own setting up.
Towards the latter end of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
<hi>p.</hi> 40. he has these words; <hi>It
is manifest that the Apostles in their
Epistles taught Fundamentals, which is
contrary to what this Gentleman says,
that such a thing could not be suppos'd;</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:107142:81"/>
And therefore the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has taken
a great deal of pains to shew, that
there are Fundamental Doctrines to
be found in the Epistles; as if I had
denied it. And to lead the Reader into
an Opinion, that I had said so, he sets
down these words, <hi>could not be suppos'd,</hi>
as if they were my words. And so
they are, but not to that purpose. And
therefore he did well not to quote
the Page, lest the Reader, by barely
turning to the place, should have a
clear sight of Falshood, instead of that
<hi>Sincerity</hi> which he would make the
Reader believe is wanting in me. My
words, <hi>p. 294. Of the Reasonableness
of Christianity</hi> are, <q>NOR CAN IT
BE SUPPOS'D, that the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such Fundamentals was the
reason of the Apostles writing to
any of them.</q> And a little lower;
<q>The Epistles therefore being all
written to those who were already
Believers and Christians, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and end of writing them could
not be to instruct them in that
which was necessary to make them
Christians.</q> The thing then that
I deny'd, was not, that there were
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107142:81"/>
any Fundamentals in the Epistles. For
<hi>p.</hi> 295. I have these express words;
<q>I do not deny but the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Christian Faith are
dropt here and there, and scatter'd
up and down in most of them.</q>
And therefore he might have spared
his Endeavours in the next Paragraph
to prove, that there may be Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
found in the Epistles, till he
finds some body that denies it. And
here again, I must repeat my usual
Question, that with this sincere Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is so often necessary, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="17" type="part">
               <head>XVII.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where it is that I say</hi> that it cannot
be suppos'd that there are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</p>
               <p>If he hopes to shift it off, by the
word <hi>taught;</hi> which seems fallaciously
put in, as if he meant, that there
were some Fundamental Articles <hi>taught</hi>
necessary to be believed to make them
Christians, in the Epistles, which those
who they were writ to knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107142:82"/>
in this sense I do deny it, and
then this will be the</p>
            </div>
            <div n="18" type="part">
               <head>XVII.</head>
               <p>Proposition remaining upon him to
prove, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there are Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
necessary to be believed to
make a Man a Christian taught
in the Epistles which those, who
they were writ to, knew not
before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The former part of his next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,</hi>
p. 40. <hi>runs thus:</hi> Hear another
feigned Ground of his omitting the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<hi>viz.</hi> Because the Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
are here promiscuously and without
distinction mixt with other Truths. <hi>p.</hi> 14.
But who sees not that this is a mere Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
For on the same account he might
have forborn to search for Fundamental
Articles in the Gospels, for they do not
lie there together, but are dispersed up
and down: The Doctrinal and Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Parts are mix'd with one another, but
he pretends to sever them. Why then
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107142:82"/>
did he not make a Separation between
the Doctrines in the Epistles, and those
other Matters that are treated of there?
He has nothing to reply to this, and
therefore we must again look upon what
he has suggested as a cast of his shuffling
faculty.</p>
               <p>The Argument contain'd in these
words is this. A Man cannot well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
Fundamental from Non-fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Doctrines in the Epistles,
where they are promiscuously mixed
with Non-fundamental Doctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therefore he cannot well distinguish
Fundamental Doctrines from others
in the Gospels, and the Acts, where
they are mixed with Matters of Fact.
As if he should say, one cannot well
distinguish a Batchellour of Divinity
from other Divines, where several of
them stand together promiscuously in
the same Habit; Therefore one cannot
distinguish a Batchellour of Divinity
from a <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Orator, where they
stand together in their distinct habits.
Or that it is as easie to distinguish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine
Gold, from that of a little lower
Allay, where several pieces of each
are mixed together; as it is to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107142:83"/>
pieces of fine Gold from pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Silver, which they are mixed
among.</p>
               <p>But it seems the <hi>Unmasker</hi> thinks it
is as easie to distinguish between Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
and not Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
in a writing of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
where they are promiscuously
mixed together, as it is to distinguish
between a Fundamental Doctrine of
Faith, and a relation of Matter of Fact,
where they are intermixedly reported
in the same History. When he has
proved this, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will have
more reason to tax me with <hi>Elusion,
Shuffling</hi> and <hi>Feigning,</hi> in the reason I
gave for not collecting Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
out of the Epistles. Till then, all
that noise must stand amongst those
ridiculous Airs of Triumph and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
which he so often gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
without the least Advantage to
his Cause, or Edification of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
though he should a thousand
times say <hi>that I have nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter part of this Paragraph,
he says, <hi>That necessary Truths, Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Principles, may be distinguish'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107142:83"/>
from those, that are not such, in the
Epistolary Writings,</hi> by the <hi>Nature
and Importance of them, by their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
respect to the Author, and means
of our Salvation. Answ.</hi> If this be so,
I desire him to give me a definitive
Collection of Fundamentals out of the
Epistles, as I have given one out of
the Gospels and the Acts. If he cannot
do that; 'Tis plain he hath here given
a distinguishing mark of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
by which he himself cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them. But yet I am the
Shuffler.</p>
               <p>The Argument in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
<hi>p.</hi> 41. is this.</p>
               <p>Necessary Doctrines of Faith, such
as God absolutely demands to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
for Justification, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from Rules of Holy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
with which they are mixed in
the Epistles; Therefore Doctrines of
Faith necessary, and not necessary, to
be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may be distinguished, as they
stand mixed in the Epistles. Which is
as good sense as to say, Lambs and
Kids may be easily distinguish'd in the
same Pen, where they are together;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107142:84"/>
by their different Natures: Therefore
the Lambs I absolutely demand of you,
as necessary to satisfie me, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from others in the same
Pen, where they are mix'd without
any distinction. Doctrines of Faith,
and Precepts of Practice, are as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable
as doing and believing:
And those as easily discernible one
from another, as thinking and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But Doctrinal Propositions, all of
them of Divine Revelation, are of the
same Authority, and of the same Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
in respect of the necessity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
them; And will be eternally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguishable
into necessary and not
necessary to be believed, till there be
some other way found, to distinguish
them, than that they are in a Book,
which is all of Divine Revelation.
Though therefore Doctrines of Faith,
and Rules of Practice are very distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable
in the Epistles; yet it does
not follow from thence, that Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
and not Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
Points necessary, and not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make Men
Christians, are easily distinguishable
in the Epistles. Which therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107142:84"/>
to be proved: And it remains
incumbent upon him,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="19" type="part">
               <head>XVIII.</head>
               <p>To set down the Marks, whereby
the Doctrines deliver'd in the
Epistles, may easily and exactly
be distinguished into Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and not Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith.</p>
               <p>All the rest of that Paragraph, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
nothing against me, must be
bound up with a great deal of the like
stuff, which the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has put into
his Book, to shew the World, he does not
<hi>imitate me in Impertinencies, Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi>
and <hi>trifling Excursions,</hi> as he
boasts in his first Paragraph. Only I
shall desire the Reader to take the
whole Passage concerning this Matter,
as it stands in my <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> p. 295. <q>I do not deny,
but the great Doctrines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith are dropt here and there,
and scatter'd up and down in most
of them. But 'tis not in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
we are to learn, what are the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107142:85"/>
Fundamental Articles of Faith, where
they are promiscuously, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction, mixed with other
Truths, and Discourses, which were
(though for Edification indeed yet)
only occasional. We shall find
and discern those great, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Points best in the Preaching
of our Saviour and his Apostles, to
those who were yet Strangers and
ignorant of the Faith, to bring them
in, and convert them to it.</q> And
then let him read these words which
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has quoted out of them,
<hi>It is not in the Epistles that we are to
learn, what are the Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, they were written for the
resolving of Doubts, and reforming of
Mistakes;</hi> With his Introduction of
them in these words, <hi>He commands
the Reader not to stir a jot further than
the Acts.</hi> If I should ask him, where
that Command appears, he must have
recourse to his old shift, that he did
not mean as he said, or else stand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of a malicious Untruth. An
Orator is not bound to speak strict
Truth, though a Disputant be. But
this <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Writing against me,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107142:85"/>
will excuse him from being of the
latter: And then why may not Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
pass for Rhetorical <hi>flourishes,</hi> in
one who hath been used to popular
Haranguing; to which Men are not
generally so severe, as strictly to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them, and expect that they
should always be found to contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but precise Truth, and strict
Reasoning? But yet I must not forget
to put upon his Score, this other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his, which he has, <hi>p.</hi> 42.
and ask him to shew,</p>

               <p>Where it is that I command my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not to stir a jot farther than
the Acts?</p>
               <p>In the next two Paragraphs, <hi>p.</hi> 42.—46.
The <hi>Unmasker</hi> is at his natural
Play of Declaiming without Proving.
'Tis pity the <hi>Mishna,</hi> out of which he
takes his good <hi>breeding,</hi> as it told him
that <hi>a well-bred and well-taught Man
answers to the first in the first place,</hi>
had not given him this Rule too about
Order, <hi>viz.</hi> That Proving should go
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107142:86"/>
before Condemning; Else all the fierce
Exaggerations, ill Language can heap
up, are but empty Scurility. But 'tis
no wonder that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors,
should not provide Rules for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Divine turn'd <hi>Unmasker.</hi> For
where a Cause is to be maintain'd,
and a Book to be writ, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not at hand, yet something
must be found to fill it; Railing in
such cases is much easier than Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
especially where a Man's Parts
lie that way.</p>
               <p>The first of these Paragraphs, <hi>p.</hi> 42.
he begins thus; <hi>But let us hear further
what this</hi> Vindicator <hi>saith to excuse his
rejection of the Doctrines contained in
the Epistles, and his putting us off with
one Article of Faith:</hi> And then he
quotes these following words of mine:
<q>What if the Author designed his
Treatise, as the Title shews, chiefly
for those who were not yet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and firmly Christians, purposing
to work upon those, who either
wholly disbelieved, or doubted of
the Truth of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:107142:86"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This, as he has put it, is a
downright Falshood. For the words he
quotes, were not used by me <hi>to excuse
my rejection of the</hi> Doctrines <hi>contained
in the Epistles,</hi> or to prove there was
but <hi>one Article.</hi> But as a reason why
I omitted the mention of <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To demonstrate this, I shall set
down the whole Passage as it is, <hi>p.</hi> 6.
of my <hi>Vindication;</hi> where it runs
thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But what will become of me that
I have not mention'd Satisfaction!</p>
                  <p>Possibly this Reverend Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would have had Charity
enough for a known Writer of the
Brotherhood to have found it by
an <hi>Innuendo</hi> in those words above
quoted, of laying down his Life
for another. But every thing is to
be strained here the other way. For
the Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. is of necessity to
be represented as a <hi>Socinian;</hi> Or else
his Book may be read; and the
Truths in it, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
likes not, be received; and People
put upon examining. Thus one, as
full of happy Conjectures and Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107142:87"/>
as this Gentleman, might be
apt to argue. But what if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
designed his Treatise, as the
Title shews, chiefly for those who
were not yet throughly or firmly
Christians; Proposing to work on
those who either wholly disbelieved
or doubted of the Truth of the
Christian Religion?</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this he tells me, <hi>p.</hi> 43. that my
<hi>Title says nothing for me,</hi> i. e. shews
not, that I designed my Book for those
that disbelieved or doubted of the
Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I thought that a title that
professed the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
shew'd it was intended for those
that were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully satisfied of the
<hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it; unless Books are
to be writ to convince those of any
thing, who are convinced already. But
possibly this may be the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s
way: And if one should judge by his
manner of treating this Subject, with
Declamation instead of Argument, one
would think, that he meant it for no
body, but those who were of his Mind
already. I thought therefore, <hi>The
Reasonableness of Christianity as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107142:87"/>
in the Scripture,</hi> a proper Title
to signifie whom it was chiefly meant
for: And, I thank God, I can with
satisfaction say it has not wanted its
effect upon some of them. But the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> proves for all that, that I
could not design it chiefly for Disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
or Doubters of the Christian
Religion. <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>p. 43. How
those that wholly disregard and disbelieve
the Scriptures of the New Testament, as
Gentiles, Iews, Mahometans and Atheists
do</hi> (I crave leave to put in Theists in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Atheists, for a reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to be mention'd) <hi>are like to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
as deliver'd in the Scripture is not
to be conceived; And therefore we look
upon this as all meer Sham and Sophistry.
Answ.</hi> Though the <hi>Unmasker</hi> teaches
good breeding out of the <hi>Mishna,</hi> yet
I thought he had been a Minister of
the Gospel, and had taught Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
out of the Scripture. Why!
Good Sir, would you teach <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Mahometans</hi> Christianity out of the
<hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Alcoran;</hi> because they are
the Books, that at present they <hi>attend
to</hi> and believe? Or would you, laying
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107142:88"/>
by the Authority of all Books, Preach
Religion to Infidels in your own Name,
and by your own Authority; laying
aside the Scripture? <hi>Is it not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
no not by a Christian Divine,
that the way to make Unbelievers
Christians, is to shew them the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the Religion contained
in the Scripture? But it seems the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
has a peculiar way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and propagating Christianity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Scripture, as some Men have
a peculiar way of disputing without
Reason.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Paragraph,
<hi>p.</hi> 43. the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> that is always a
fair Interpreter of my meaning, and
never fails to know it better than I do,
tells me, That by those, that wholly
disbelieve, <hi>I must mean Atheists, Turks,
Iews and Pagans;</hi> and by those that
are not firmly Christians, <hi>a few weak
Christians.</hi> But did our <hi>Unmasker</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hear of Unbelievers under a deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
distinct from that of <hi>Atheists,
Turks, Iews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans?</hi> Whilst the
Pulpit and the Press have so often had
up the Name of <hi>Theists</hi> or <hi>Deists,</hi> has
that Name wholly scaped him? 'Twas
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107142:88"/>
these I chiefly designed, and I believe
no body of all that read my Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the <hi>Unmasker</hi> mistook me,
if he did. But there at least, <hi>p.</hi> 9. he
might have found the Name, as of a
sort of Unbelievers not unknown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us. But whatever he thought,
it was convenient and a sort of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
in him (when he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
others, that I had not a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
which I say I had) to lessen as
much as he could, and cover the need
of any such Design, and so make it,
that I could not intend my Book to
work upon those, that disbelieved, or
did not firmly believe; by insinuating
there were <hi>few</hi> or none such amongst
us. Hence he says that by those that
are not throughly and firmly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>I mean a FEW weak Christians;</hi>
as well as under those, who wholly
disbelieve he left the <hi>Theists</hi> out of
my meaning. I am very glad to hear
from the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> that there are but
<hi>few weak Christians,</hi> few that have
Doubts about the Truth of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
amongst us. But if there be not
a great number of <hi>Deists,</hi> and that
the preventing their increase be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:107142:89"/>
worth every true Christian's Care and
Endeavours, those who have been so
loud against them have been much to
blame; and I wish to God there were
no reason for their Complaints. For
these therefore I take the liberty to
say, as I did before, that I chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
my Book; And shall not be
asham'd of this <hi>Sophistry</hi> as you call
it, if it can be <hi>Sophistry</hi> to alledge a
Matter of Fact that I know; Till you
have Arguments to convince me, that
you know my intention in publishing
it, better than I do my self. And I
shall think it still no blameable <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
however you exclaim against
<hi>Prudence,</hi> (as perhaps you have some
reason) that <q>I mention'd only those
Advantages, that all Christians are
agreed in; And that I observed that
command of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 1.
Him that is weak in the Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ye, but not to doubtful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations;
without being a <hi>Socinian.</hi>
I think I did not amiss, that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the belief of those that
stood off, that, and only that, which
our Saviour and his Apostles preach'd
for the reducing the Unconverted
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107142:89"/>
World. And would any one think
he in earnest went about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
Men to be Christians, who
should use that as an Argument to
recommend the Gospel, which he
has observed Men to lay hold on as
an Objection against it? To urge
such Points of Controversie as Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Faith, when we
see our Saviour and the Apostles
urged them not as necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians,
is (by our own Authority) to add
Prejudices to Prejudices, and to
block up our own way to those
Men, whom we would have access
to, and prevail upon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have repeated this again out of
the 7th. Page of my <hi>Vindication,</hi>
where there is more to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
That the Reader may see how
fully the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has answer'd it.</p>
               <p>Because I said, <q>Would any one
blame my Prudence if I mention'd
only those Advantages, which all
Christians are agreed in.</q> The <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
adds, <hi>p. 44. Socinian Christians,</hi>
and then as if the naming of that
had gained him his Point, he goes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107142:90"/>
on victoriously thus, <hi>He has bethought
himself better since he first. Publish'd his
Notions, and (as the result of that) he
now begins to resolve, what he writ, into
Prudence. I know whence he had this
Method (and 'tis likely he has taken
more than this from the same hands)</hi>
viz. <hi>from the Missionary Iesuits, that
went to Preach the Gospel to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of</hi> China. <hi>We are told, that they
instructed them in some Matters relating
to our Saviour; they let them know that
Iesus was the Messias, the Person pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be sent into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the World; But
they conceal'd his Sufferings and Death,
and they would not let them know any
thing of his Passion and Crucifixion. So
our Author (their humble Imitator)
undertakes to instruct the World in
Christianity, with an omission of its
Principal Articles, and more especially
that of the Advantage we have by
Christ's Death, which was the prime
thing design'd in his coming into the
World. This he calls Prudence: So
that to hide from the People the main
Articles of the Christian Religion, to
disguise the Faith of the Gospel, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
Christianity it self, is according
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107142:90"/>
to this excellent Writer, the Cardinal
Virtue of Prudence. May we be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
then, say I, from a Prudential
Racovian.</hi> And there ends the ratling
for this time; not to be outdone by
any Piece of Clock-work in the Town.
When he is once set a going, he runs
on like an Alarm, always in the same
strain of noisy empty Declamation
(wherein every thing is suppos'd and
nothing prov'd) till his own weight
has brought him to the Ground? And
then, being wound up with some new
Topick, takes another run, whether
it makes for or against him it matters
not; he has laid about him with ill
Language, let it light where it will,
and the <hi>Vindicator</hi> is paid off.</p>
               <p>That I may keep the due distance
in our different ways of Writing, I
shall shew the Reader, that I say not
this at random; but that the place
affords me occasion to say so. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
this Paragraph with these words,
p. 42. <hi>Let us hear farther what this
Vindicator says to excuse his rejection
of the Doctrines contain'd in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi>
This <hi>rejection of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
contain'd in the Epistles,</hi> was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107142:91"/>
the not mentioning the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of
Christ, amongst those Advantages I
shew'd, that the World received by
his coming. This appears by the
words he here quotes, as my excuse
for that omission. In which place, I
also produced some Passages in my
Book which <hi>sounded like it,</hi> some words
of Scripture that are used to prove it;
But this will not content him: I am
for all that, a <hi>Betrayer of Christianity
and Contemner of the Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>les.</hi> Why?
Because I did not out of them name
<hi>Satisfaction.</hi> If you will have the
truth of it, Sir, there is not any such
word in any one of the Epistles, or
other Books of the New Testament, in
my Bible, as <hi>Satisfying</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction</hi>
made by our Saviour; and so I could
not put it into my <hi>Christianity as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
in the Scripture.</hi> If mine be
not a true Bible, I desire you to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
me with one that is more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox;
or if the Translators have <hi>hid
that main Article of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
they are <hi>the betrayers of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and Contemners of the Epistles,</hi>
who did not put it there; and not I,
who did not take a word from thence,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107142:91"/>
which they did not put there. For
truly, I am not a Maker of Creeds;
nor dare add either to the Scripture,
or to the Fundamental Articles of the
Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>But you will say <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> though
not named in the Epistles, yet may
plainly be collected out of them.
<hi>Answ.</hi> And so it may out of several
places in my <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
some whereof, which I took out
of the Gospels, I mention'd in my
<hi>Vindication,</hi> p. 5. and others of them
which I took out of the Epistles,
which I shall point out to you now:
As <hi>p.</hi> 74. I say the Design of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
coming was to be <hi>OFFERED</hi>
up; And <hi>p.</hi> 158. I speak of the Work
of our <hi>REDEMPTION;</hi> words which
in the Epistles are taken to imply <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</hi>
And therefore if that be
enough, I see not, but I may be free
from <hi>betraying Christianity;</hi> But if it
be necessary to Name the word <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi>
and he that does not so is a
<hi>Betrayer of Christianity,</hi> you will do
well to consider how you will acquit
the Holy Apostles, from that bold
Imputation; which if it be extended
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107142:92"/>
as far as it will go, will scarce come short
of Blasphemy; For I do not remember
that our Saviour has any where named
<hi>Satisfaction,</hi> or implied it plainer in any
words than those I have quoted from
him. And he, I hope, will scape the
Intemperance of your Tongue.</p>
               <p>You tell me, I had my <hi>Prudence</hi>
from <hi>the Missionary Iesuits in</hi> China<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>who conceal'd our Saviour's Suffering
and Death;</hi> because <hi>I undertake to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instruct
the World in Christianity, with
an omission of its Principal Articles.</hi> And
I pray, Sir, from whom did you learn
your <hi>Prudence,</hi> when taking upon you
to teach the Fundamental <hi>Doctrines of
Christianity,</hi> in your <hi>Thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Causes of Atheism,</hi> you left out
several, that you have been pleased
since to add in your <hi>Socinianism Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd?</hi>
Or if I, as you say here, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
Christianity</hi> by this <hi>Omission</hi> of <hi>this
Principal Article;</hi> What do you, who
are a Professed Teacher of it, if you
omit any principal Article; Which your
<hi>Prudence</hi> is so wary in, that you will
not say you have given us all that are
necessary to Salvation, in that List
you have last published? I pray who
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107142:92"/>
acts best the Jesuit (whose <hi>humble Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi>
you say I am) you or I; when
pretending to give a Catalogue of
Fundamentals, you have not reduced
them to direct Propositions; but have
left some of them indefinite, to be
collected as every one pleases; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of telling us it is a perfect Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of Fundamentals, plainly shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
it off, and tell me, <hi>p. 22. If that
will not content me, you are sure you
can do nothing that will; If I require
more, it is Folly in you to comply with
me?</hi> One part of what you here say,
I own to you, savours not much of
the Skill of a Jesuit. You confess
your inability, and I believe it to be
perfectly true; That if what you
have done already (which is nothing
at all) <hi>will not content me, you are sure,
you can do nothing that will content me,</hi>
or any reasonable Man, that shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of you a compleat Catalogue
of Fundamentals. But you make it
up pretty well, with a Confidence
becoming one of that Order. For he
must have rub'd his Forehead hard,
who in the same Treatise, where he
so severely condemns the Imperfection
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107142:93"/>
of my List of Fundamentals, confesses
that he cannot give a compleat Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You publish to the World in this

Unmask'd,</hi> in these words:
<hi>These Articles</hi> (meaning those which
you had before enumerated as Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107142:93"/>
                  <hi>of Faith, are such as must IN
SOME MEASURE be known and
assented to by a Christian, such as must
GENERALLY be received, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by him?</hi> You will do well the
next time to set down, how far your
Fundamentals must <hi>be known, assented
to,</hi> and <hi>received;</hi> to avoid the suspicion,
that there is a little more of Jesuitism
in these Expressions, <hi>in some measure
known and assented to, and generally
receiv'd and imbraced,</hi> than what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a sincere Protestant Preacher of
the Gospel. For your speaking so
doubtfully of knowing and assenting
to those, which you give us for Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Doctrines, which belong
(as you say) to the very <hi>essence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
will hardly scape being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to your want of Knowledge, or
want of Sincerity. And indeed the
word <hi>General</hi> is in familiar use with
you, and stands you in good stead,
when you would say something, you
know not what, as I shall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to remark to you when I come
to your 91 Page.</p>
               <p>Further, I do not remember where
it was, that I mention'd or undertook
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107142:94"/>
to set down all the <hi>principal</hi> or <hi>main
Articles of Christianity.</hi> To change
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rms of the Question from Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
necessary to be believed to make
a Man a Christian, into <hi>principal</hi> or
<hi>main Articles,</hi> looks a little Jesuitical.
But to pass by that; The Apostles
when they <hi>went to preach the Gospel to
People</hi> as much Strangers to it, as the
<hi>Chineses</hi> were, when the <hi>Europeans</hi>
came first amongst them, <hi>Did they
hide from the People the main Articles
of the Christian Religion, disguise the
Faith of the Gospel, and betray Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
it self?</hi> If they did not, I am
sure I have not: For I have not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any of the <hi>main Articles</hi> which
they Preached to the Unbelieving
World. Those I have set down, with
so much care not to omit any of them,
that you blame me for it more than
once, and call it <hi>tedious.</hi> However
you are pleased to acquit or condemn
the Apostles in the case by your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Determination, I am very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
If you think fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them for <hi>disguising</hi> or <hi>betraying
the Christian Religion,</hi> because they said
no more of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> than I have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107142:94"/>
done, in their Preaching at first to
their Unbelieving Auditors, <hi>Iews</hi> or
<hi>Heathens,</hi> to make them as I think
Christians (for that I am now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of) I shall not be sorry to be found
in their Company under what censure
soever. If you are pleased graciously
to take off this your censure from them,
for this <hi>omission,</hi> I shall claim a share in
the same Indulgence.</p>
               <p>But to come to what perhaps you
will think your self a little more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
not to censure, than what the
<hi>Apostles</hi> did so long since; for you
have given instances of being very
apt to make bold with the Dead; Pray
tell me, does the Church of <hi>England</hi>
admit People into the Church of Christ
at hap-hazard? Or without proposing,
and requiring a Profession of all, that is
necessary to be believed to make a Man
a Christian? If she does not, I desire you
to turn to the Baptism of those of riper
Years in our Liturgy: Where the
Priest asking the Convert particularly,
whether he believes the Apostles
Creed, which he repeats to him; Upon
his Profession that he does, and that
he desires to be baptized into that

are meant for an Answer to something
I had said concerning the Apostles
Creed, upon the occasion of his charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Book with <hi>Socinianism.</hi> They
begin thus.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Author of the New Christianity.
Answ.</hi> This New Christianity is as old
as the Preaching of our Saviour and
his Apostles, and a little older than
the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s System. <hi>Wisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that the Apostles Creed hath none
of those Articles which I mention'd,</hi> p. 12,
13. <hi>Answ.</hi> If that Author <hi>wisely objects,</hi>
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> would have done well
to have replied <hi>wisely.</hi> But for a Man
<hi>wisely</hi> to reply it is in the first place
requisite, that the Objection be truly
and fairly set down in its full force,
and not represented short, and as will
best serve the Answerers turn to reply
to. This is neither <hi>wise</hi> nor honest:
And this first part of a <hi>wise</hi> Reply the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> has failed in. This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from my words and the occasion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107142:96"/>
of them. The <hi>Unmasker</hi> had accused
my Book of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> for omitting
some Points, which he urged as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Faith. To which I
answer'd, That he had done so only
<q>to give it an ill Name, not because
it was <hi>Socinian,</hi> for he had no more
reason to charge it with <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi>
for the Omissions he mentions,
than the Apostles Creed</q>. These
are my words, which he should have
either set down out of <hi>p.</hi> 12. which
he quotes, or at least given the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as I put it, if he had meant to
have clear'd it by a fair Answer. But
he, instead thereof, contents himself
that <hi>I object, that the Apostles Creed
hath none of those Articles and Doctrines
which the</hi> Unmasker <hi>mention'd.</hi> Answ.
This at best is but a part of my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and not to the purpose. I there
meant, without the rest join'd to it;
which it has pleased the <hi>Unmasker</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his laudable way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal.
My Objection therefore stands
thus,</p>
               <p>That the same Articles, for the
Omission whereof the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:107142:97"/>
charges my Book with <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism,</hi>
being also omitted in
the Apostles Creed, he has no
more reason to Charge my Book
with <hi>Socinianism,</hi> for the Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
mention'd, than he hath to
charge the Apostles Creed with
<hi>Socinianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Objection of mine, let us
now see how he answers, <hi>p.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>Nor does any considerate Man wonder at
it <hi>[i. e. That the Apostles Creed hath
none of those Articles and Doctrines
which he had mention'd]</hi> For the Creed
is a form of outward Profession, which
is chiefly to be made in the Publick
Assemblies, when Prayers are put up
in the Church and the Holy Scriptures
are read. Then this Abridgment of Faith
is properly used, or when there is not
generally time or opportunity to make
any Enlargement. But we are not to
think it expresly contains in it all the
necessary and weighty Points, all the
important Doctrines of Belief, it being
only designed to be an Abstract.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:107142:97"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Another indispensible requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in a <hi>wise</hi> Reply is, that it should
be pertinent. Now what can there be
more impertinent, than to confess the
Matter of Fact upon which the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is grounded, but instead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
the Inference drawn from
that Matter of Fact, only amuse the
Reader with wrong Reasons, why that
Matter of Fact was so?</p>
               <p>No <hi>considerate Man,</hi> he says, <hi>doth
wonder</hi> that the Articles and Doctrines
he mentioned, are omitted in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed: Because <hi>that Creed is a
form of outward Profession.</hi> Answ. A <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession!</hi>
of what I beseech you? Is it
a <hi>Form</hi> to be used for Form's sake? I
thought it had been a <hi>Profession</hi> of
something, even of the Christian Faith:
And if it be so, any <hi>considerate Man
may wonder</hi> necessary Articles of the
Christian Faith should be lest out of
it. For how it can be an <hi>outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of the Christian Faith, without
containing the Christian Faith, I do
not see; unless a Man can <hi>outwardly
profess</hi> the Christian Faith in words,
that do not contain or express it, <hi>i. e.</hi>
profess the Christian Faith, when he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107142:98"/>
does not profess it. But he says, <hi>'tis
a Profession chiefly to be made use of in
Assemblies. Answ.</hi> Do those solemn
<hi>Assemblies</hi> privilege it from containing
the necessary Articles of the Christian
Religion? This proves not that it
does not, or was not <hi>designed</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all Articles necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make a Man a Christian; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> can prove that a
<hi>From</hi> of <hi>outward Profession</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, that contains all such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles, cannot be made use
of in the Publick Assemblies. <hi>In the
Publick Assemblies,</hi> says he, <hi>when Prayers
are put up by the Church and the Holy
Scriptures are read, then this Abridgment
of Faith is properly used; or when there
is not generally time or opportunity to
make an Enlargement. Answ.</hi> But
that which contains not what is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to be believed to
make a Man a Christian, can no where
be <hi>properly</hi> used as a <hi>form of outward
Profession</hi> of the Christian Faith, and
least of all in the solemn <hi>Publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</hi>
All the sense I can make of
this is, That <hi>this Abridgment</hi> of the
Christian Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> imperfect Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107142:98"/>
(as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will have it)
of some of the Fundamental Articles
of Christianity in the Apostles Creed,
which omits the greatest part of them,
is made use of <hi>as a form of outward
Profession</hi> of but part of the Christian
Faith in the <hi>Publick Assemblies,</hi> when
by reason of reading of the <hi>Scripture</hi>
and <hi>Prayers,</hi> there is not <hi>time</hi> or <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi>
for a full and perfect Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis strange the Christian Church
should not find <hi>time</hi> nor <hi>opportunity</hi> in
Sixteen hundred Years to make, in any
of her Publick Assemblies, a Profession
of so much of her Faith as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to make a Man a Christian. But
pray tell me, has the Church any such
full and compleat form of Faith, that
hath in it all those Propositions, you
have given us for necessary Articles
(not to say any thing of those which
you have reserved to your self in your
own Breast, and will not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate)
of which the Apostles Creed is
only a scanty <hi>form,</hi> a brief imperfect
<hi>abstract, used</hi> only to save time in the
Croud of other pressing Occasions,
that are always in hast to be dispatch'd?
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107142:99"/>
If she has, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will do
well to produce it. If the Church
has no such compleat form, besides
the Apostle's Creed, any where, of
Fundamental Articles, he will do well
to leave talking idlely of this <hi>Abstract,</hi>
as he goes on to do in the following
words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> says he, <hi>we are not to think that
it expresly contains in it all the necessary
and weighty Points, all the important
Doctrines of our Belief, it being only
designed to be an Abstract. Answ.</hi> Of
what, I beseech you, is it an <hi>Abstract?</hi>
For here the <hi>Unmasker</hi> stops short,
and as one that knows not well what
to say, speaks not out what it is an
<hi>Abstract</hi> of; But provides himself a
Subterfuge in the generality of the
preceding terms of <hi>necessary and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Points,</hi> and <hi>Important Doctrines,</hi>
jumbled together; which can be there
of no other use, but to cover his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
or Sophistry. For the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
being only about <hi>necessary</hi> Points,
to what purpose are <hi>weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Doctrines</hi> join'd to them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he will say, that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>weighty
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107142:99"/>
Points,</hi> Fundamental and <hi>important Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?</hi>
And if so, then the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Points into necessary and not
necessary, will be foolish and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
And all the Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Bible will be absolutely
necessary to be explicitly believed by
every Man to make him a Christian.
But taking it for granted, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Truths contain'd in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
into Points absolutely necessary,
and not absolutely necessary to be
believed to make a Man a Christian, is
good; I desire the <hi>Unmasker</hi> to tell us,
what the Apostles Creed is an Abstract
of. He will perhaps answer, that he
has told us already in this very Page,
where he says it is an <hi>Abridgment of
Faith,</hi> and he has said true in words, but
saying those words by rote after others,
without understanding them, he has
said so in a sense, that is not true. For
he supposes it an <hi>Abridgment of Faith,</hi>
by containing only a few of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Faith, and leaving
out the far greater part of them; And
so takes a part of a thing for an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of it; Whereas an <hi>Abridgment,</hi> or
<hi>Abstract</hi> of any thing, is the whole
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107142:100"/>
in little, and if it be of a Science or
Doctrine, the <hi>Abridgment</hi> consists in
the essent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al or necessary Parts of it;
contracted into a narrower compass,
than where it lies diffus'd in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of delivery, amongst a
great number of Transitions, Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
Illustrations, Proofs, Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Corollaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which, though
they make a part of the Discourse
wherein that Doctrine is deliver'd, are
lest out in the <hi>Abridgment</hi> of it, wherein
all the necessary parts of it are drawn
together into a less room. But though
an <hi>Abridgment</hi> need to contain none
but the essential and necessary parts,
yet all those it ought to contain; Or
else it will not be an <hi>Abridgment</hi> or
<hi>Abstract</hi> of that thing, but an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
only of a part of it. I think it
could not be said to be an <hi>Abridgment</hi>
of the Law contain'd in an Act of
Parliament, wherein any of the things
required by that Act were omitted;
which yet commonly may be reduced
into a very narrow compass, when
strip'd of all the Motives, Ends, Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Forms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expressed in the Act
it self. If this does not satisfie the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107142:100"/>
                  <hi>Unmasker</hi> what is properly an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
I shall referr him to Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi>
who I think will be allow'd
to understand sense, and to speak it
properly, at least as well as the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker.</hi>
And what he says, happens
to be in the very same Question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Knot</hi> the Jesuit, and him; that
is here between the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> and me:
'Tis but putting the <hi>Unmasker</hi> in the
Jesuit's place, and my self (if it may
be allow'd me without Vanity) in
Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s the Protestants,
and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s very words,
<hi>Chap.</hi> IV. §. 65. will exactly serve for
my Answer. <q>You trifle affectedly,
confounding the Apostles Belief of
the whole Religion of Christ, as it
comprehends both what we are to
do, and what we are to believe, with
that part of it which contains not
Duties of Obedience, but only the
necessary Articles of simple Faith.
Now, though the Apostles Belief be
in the former sense, a larger thing
than that which we call the Apostles
Creed; Yet in the latter sense of
the word, the Creed (I say) is a full
Comprehension of their Belief, which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107142:101"/>
you your self have formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
though somewhat fearfully
and inconstantly. And here again
unwillingness to speak the Truth
makes you speak that which is
hardly sense, and call it <hi>an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of some Articles of Faith.</hi> For
I demand those <hi>some Articles</hi> which
you speak of, which are they? Those
that are out of the Creed, or those
that are in it? Those that are in it,
it comprehends at large, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not an Abridgment of them.
Those that are out of it, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
not at all, and therefore
it is not an <hi>Abridgment</hi> of them.
If you would call it now an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of Faith, this would be sense;
and signifie thus much; That all the
necessary Articles of the Christian
Faith are comprised in it. For this
is the proper Duty of <hi>Abridgments,</hi>
to leave out nothing necessary.</q> So
that in Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s judgment
of an <hi>Abridgment,</hi> it is not sense to say
as you do, <hi>p.</hi> 47. That <hi>we are not to
think that the Apostles Creed expresly
contains in it all the necessary Points of
our Belief, it being only designed to be
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107142:101"/>
an Abstract, or an Abridgment of Faith.</hi>
But on the contrary, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it contains in it all the necessary
Articles of Faith, for that very reason,
because it is an <hi>Abridgment of Faith,</hi>
as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> calls it. But whether
this, that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> has given
us here, be the nature of an <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or no; this is certain, that the
Apostles Creed cannot be a <hi>form of
Profession</hi> of the Christian Faith, if
any part of the Faith necessary to
make a Man a Christian be left out of
it: And yet such a <hi>Profession</hi> of Faith
would the <hi>Unmasker</hi> have this <hi>Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of Faith to be. For a little lower
in the 47. <hi>p.</hi> he says in express terms,
That <hi>if a Man believe no more than is
in express terms in the Apostles Creed,
his Faith will not be the Faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
Wherein he does great Honour
to the Primitive Church, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
The Primitive Church admitted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Heathens to Baptism, upon the
Faith contain'd in the Apostles Creed:
A bare Profession of that Faith, and no
more, was required of them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Church and made
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107142:102"/>
Members of Christ's Body. How little
different the Faith of the Ancient
Church was from the Faith I have
mentioned, may be seen in these words
of <hi>Tertullian; Regula fidei una omnino
est,</hi> sola, immobilis, <hi>irreformabilis, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi
scilicet in unicum deum omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem
Mundi conditorem, &amp; filium
ejus Iesum Christum, natum ex Virgine
Maria, Crucifixum sub Pontio Pilato,
tertia die resuscitatum à Mortuis, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum
in Coelis, Sedentem nunc ad dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram
Patris, Venturum judicare vivos
&amp; Mortuos per carnis etiam resurrectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.
Hâc lege fidei manente, caetera
jam disciplinae &amp; conversationis admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunt
novitatem correctionis,</hi> Tert. de
Virg. Velan, in Principio. This was
the Faith that in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to make a Christian. And the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as I have remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
already, only proposes the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Apostles Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to be baptized, and upon his
Professing a Belief of them, asks whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will be Baptized in <hi>THIS
FAITH,</hi> which (if we will believe
the <hi>Unmasker) is not the Faith of a
Christian.</hi> However the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107142:102"/>
any more ado, upon the Profession
of <hi>THIS FAITH,</hi> and no other,
Baptizes them into it. So that the
Ancient Church, if the <hi>Unmasker</hi> may
be believed, baptized Converts into
that Faith which <hi>is not the Faith of a
Christian.</hi> And the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
when she Baptizes any one, makes
him not a Christian. For he that is
Baptized only into a Faith that <hi>is not
the Faith of a Christian,</hi> I would fain
know how he can thereby be made a
Christian? So that if the Omissions,
which he so much blames in my Book,
make me a <hi>Socinian,</hi> I see not how the
Church of <hi>England</hi> will escape that
Censure; Since those Omissions are in
that very Confession of Faith, which
she proposes, and upon a Profession
whereof she Baptizes those whom she
designs to make Christians. But it
seems that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> (who has
made bold to Unmask her too) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
right, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is mistaken, and makes none but
<hi>Socinian Christians,</hi> or (as he is pleased
now to declare) no Christians at all.
Which if true, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> were
best look to it, whether he himself be
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107142:103"/>
a Christian, or no: For 'tis to be fear'd,
he was baptized only into that Faith,
which he himself confesses <hi>is not the
Faith of a Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he brings himself off in these
following words; <hi>All matters of Faith
in some manner may be reduced to this
brief Platform of Belief. Answ.</hi> If that
be enough to make him a true and an
Orthodox Christian, he does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whom in this way he brings off
with him: For I think he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that all Matters of Faith in some
manner may be reduced to that <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi>
of Faith which I have given, as
well as to that brief <hi>Platform</hi> in the
Apostles Creed. So that for ought I
see, by this rule, we are Christians, or
not Christians; Orthodox or not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,
equally together.</p>
               <p>But yet he says in the next words,
<hi>When he calls it an Abstract or Abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viature,
it is implied, that there are
more Truths to be known and assented to
by a Christian in order to making him
really so, than what we meet with here.</hi>
The quite contrary whereof (as has
been shewn) is implied by its being
called an <hi>Abstract.</hi> But what is that to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107142:103"/>
the purpose? 'Tis not sit <hi>Abstracts</hi> and
<hi>Abbreviatures</hi> should stand in <hi>Unmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s
way. They are Sounds Men have
used for what they pleased, and why
may not the <hi>Unmasker</hi> do so too;
And use them in a Sense, that may
make the Apostles Creed be only a
broken scrap of the Christian Faith?
However in great Condescention, being
willing to do the Apostles Creed what
honour he could, he says, That <hi>all
Matters of Faith in some manner may
be reduced to this brief Platform of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi>
But yet when it is set in
competition with the Creed, which he
himself is making (for it is not yet
finish'd) it is by no means to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
as sufficient to make a Man a
Christian. <hi>There are more Truths to be
known and assented to in order to make
a Man really a Christian.</hi> Which what
they are, the Church of <hi>England</hi> shall
know, when this new Reformer thinks
fit: And then she may be able to
propose to those, who are not yet so,
a Collection of Articles of Belief, and
Baptize them anew into a Faith,
which will really make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
But hitherto, if the <hi>Unmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:107142:104"/>
may be credited, she has failed
in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet he craves leave to tell me</hi> in the
following words, <hi>p. 48. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed hath more in it than I or my
Brethren will subscribe to.</hi> Were it not
the Undoubted Privilege of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
to know me better than I do
my self, (for he is always telling me
something of my self which I did not
know) I would in my turn crave
leave to tell him, that this is the Faith
I was baptized into, no one tittle
whereof I have renounced, that I know;
And that I heretofore thought, that
gave me title to be a Christian. But
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> hath otherwise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd:
And I know not now where
to find a Christian. For the Belief of
the Apostles Creed will not it seems
make a Man one: And what other
Belief will, it does not yet please the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> to tell us. But yet as to the
<hi>Subscribing to</hi> the Apostles Creed, I
must take leave to say, however the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> may be right in the Faith,
he is out in the Morals of a Christian;
It being against the Charity of one,
that is really so, to pronounce, as he
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107142:104"/>
does, peremptorily in a thing, that he
cannot know; and to affirm positively
what I know to be a downright False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
But what others will do it is
not my talent to determine: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the <hi>Unmasker.</hi> Though as
to all that are my <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, I may answer for them too,
that they will also with me do that
without which in that sense they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be my Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 49. The <hi>Unmasker</hi> smartly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
me of no small Blunder in these
words. <hi>But was it not judiciously said
by this Writer, that</hi> 
                  <q>it is well for
the Compilers of the Creed, that they
lived not in my days</q>. <hi>P. 12. I tell
you Friend, it was impossible they should,
for the Learned</hi> Usher, <hi>and</hi> Vossius, <hi>and
others, have proved that that Symbol
was drawn up not at once, but that some
Articles of it were adjoyn'd many years
after, far beyond the extent of any
Man's Life, and therefore the Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Creed could not live in
my days, nor could I live in theirs.
Answ.</hi> But it seems that had they liv'd
altogether, you could have liv'd in
their days. <hi>But,</hi> says he, <hi>I let this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107142:105"/>
pass, as one of the Blunders of our
thoughtful and musing Author. Answ.</hi> And
<hi>I tell you Friend, that</hi> unless it were
to shew your reading in <hi>Usher</hi> and
<hi>Vossius,</hi> you had been better let this
<hi>Blunder of mine</hi> alone. Does not the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> give here a clear Proof, that
he is no Changeling? Whatever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
he takes in hand, weighty or
trivial, material or not material to
the thing in question, he brings it to
the same sort of sense and force. He
would shew me guilty of an absurdity
in saying, <q>It was well for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
of the Creed, that they lived
not in his days</q>. This he proves
to be a <hi>Blunder;</hi> because they all lived
not in one anothers days; Therefore
it was an absurdity to suppose they
might all live in his days. As if there
were any greater absurdity to bring
the Compilers, who lived possibly
within a few Centuries of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a Supposition into one time,
than it is to bring the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> and
any one of them who lived a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years distant one from another,
by a Supposition to be Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
For 'tis by reason of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107142:105"/>
living at a distance one from
another, that he proves it impossible
for him to be their Contemporary.
As if it were not as impossible in Fact
for him who was not born till above a
Thousand Years after to live in any
of their Days, as it is for any one of
them to live in either of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
days that died before him. The
Supposition of their living together is
as easie of one as the other, at what
distance soever they lived, and how
many soever there were of them.
This being so, I think it had been
better for the <hi>Unmasker</hi> to have let
alone the <hi>Blunder,</hi> and shew'd (which
was his Business) that he does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the Compilers of the Creed of
being <hi>all over Socinianized,</hi> as well as
he does me, since they were as guilty
as I of the omission of those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
(viz. <hi>That Christ is the Word of
God. That God was incarnate. The
eternal and ineffable Generation of the
Son of God. That the Son is in the
Father, and Father in the Son, which
expresses their Unity</hi>) for the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> laid <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism</hi>

it remains still upon his Score to

               <p>To shew our <hi>Vnmasker</hi>'s Veracity in

with some Passages out of my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> pag. 61.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107142:107"/>
                  <q>When we consider that he was to
fill out the time foretold of his
Ministry, and after a life Illustrious
in Miracles, and good Works, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with Humility, Meekness,
Patience and <hi>SVFFERING,</hi> and
every way conformable to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of him, should be led as a
Sheep to the <hi>Slaughter;</hi> and with
all quiet and submission be brought
to the <hi>CROSS,</hi> though there
were no Guilt or Fault found in
him</q>. And <hi>p.</hi> 74. <q>Contrary to
the design of his coming, which
was to be <hi>OFFER'D</hi> up a Lamb
blameless and void of offence.</q> And
<hi>p. 116. Laying down his life,</hi> both for
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> P. 178. Given up to
<hi>Contempt, Torment</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> But say
what I will, when the <hi>Vnmasker</hi> thinks
fit to have it so, it is speaking out of
<hi>the Mahometan Bible,</hi> That <hi>Christ did
not suffer on the Cross, did not Die;</hi>
or at least, is <hi>speaking as meanly of
these Articles, as if no such thing had
been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Slander is, <hi>p.</hi> 55. in these
words; <hi>This Gentleman presents the
World with a very ill notion of Faith,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107142:108"/>
for the very Devils are capable of all
that Faith, which he says makes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
It is not strange, that the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
should misrepresent the Faith,
which I say makes a Christian; when
it seems to be his whole Design to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent
my meaning every where.
The frequency of his doing it, I have
shew'd in abundance of instances, to
which I shall add an eminent one here;
which shews what a fair Champion he
is for Truth and Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 196. of my <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> I give this account of the
Faith, which makes a Christian; That
it is <q>Mens entring themselves in the
Kingdom of God; owning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
themselves the Subjects of
Jesus, whom they believe to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and receive for their Lord
and King: For that was to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in his Name.</q> This sense of
believing Christ to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that
is to take him for our King and Lord,
who is to be obey'd, I have expressed
over and over again; as <hi>p.</hi> 209. my
words are, <q>That as many of them,
as would believe Jesus the Son of
God (whom he sent into the World)
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:107142:108"/>
to be the Messiah the promised Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
and would receive him for
their King and Ruler, should have
all their past Sins, Disobedience, and
Rebellion forgiven them. And if
for the future they lived in sincere
Obedience to his Law, to the utmost
of their Power, the Sins of humane
frailty for the time to come, as
well as those of their past lives,
should for his Son's sake, because
they gave themselves up to him to
be his Subjects, be forgiven them;
And so their Faith, which made
them be baptized into his Name
(i. e. enroll themselves in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves his Subjects; and
consequently live by the Laws of
his Kingdom) should be accounted
to them for Righteousness.</q>  Which
Account of what is necessary, I close
with these words: <q>This is the
<hi>FAITH</hi> for which God of his
free Grace Justifies sinful Man.</q> And
is this the <hi>Faith</hi> of Devils?</p>
               <p>To the same purpose, <hi>p.</hi> 214. are
these words. <q>The chief End of his
coming was to be a King, and as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107142:109"/>
such to be received by those, who
would be his Subjects in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which he came to erect.</q> And
again, <hi>p.</hi> 212. <q>Only those, who
have believed Jesus to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
and taken him for their King,
with a sincere endeavour after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in obeying his Law, shall
have their past Sins not imputed to
them.</q> And so again, <hi>p.</hi> 213. and
227. and in several other places: Of
which I shall add but this one more,
<hi>p.</hi> 228. <q>'Tis not enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> unless
we obey his Laws, and take him
to be our King to reign over us.</q>
Can the Devils thus believe him to be
the <hi>Messiah?</hi> Yet this is that which
by these, and abundance of other
places, I have shew'd to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of believing him to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, I have expresly distinguish'd
the Faith which makes a Christian,
from that which the Devils have; by
proving, that to the believing Jesus
to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> must be join'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or else it will not make them
true Christians; And what this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107142:109"/>
is, may be seen at large in
<hi>p. 193, &amp;c.</hi> some Expressions whereof
I shall here set down: As <hi>p.</hi> 198.
<q>Repentance does not consist in one
single Act of Sorrow (though that
being first, and leading, gives Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the whole), but in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Works meet for Repentance; in
a sincere Obedience to the Law of
<hi>Christ</hi> the remainder of our Lives.</q>
Again: To distinguish the Faith of a
<hi>Christian</hi> from that of Devils, I say ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistle to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> 
                  <q>That which availeth is
<hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> working by <hi>Love;</hi>
and that <hi>Faith</hi> without Works, <hi>i. e.</hi>
the Works of sincere Obedience to
the Law and Will of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not
sufficient for our Justification.</q>
And <hi>p.</hi> 222. <q>That to inherit eternal
Life, we must love the Lord our
God, with all our Heart, with all
our Soul, with all our Strength,
and with all our Mind; An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 230.
Love <hi>Christ</hi> in keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, and a great deal more to this
purpose, may be seen in my <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Christianity;</hi> particularly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107142:110"/>
where I answer that Objection about
the Faith of Devils, which I handle
from <hi>p.</hi> 193. to <hi>p.</hi> 251. and therein at
large shew wherein the Faith of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
comes short of the Justifying
Faith, which makes a Christian. And
yet the good, the sincere, the candid
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> with his becoming Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
tells his Readers here, <hi>p.</hi> 55.
<hi>That I present the World with a very
ill notion of Faith: For the very Devils
are capable of all that Faith, which I
say makes a Christian Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prevent this Calumny, I in
more places than one distinguished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Faith in a strict sense, as it is a
bare assent to any Proposition, and
that which is called Evangelical Faith,
in a larger sense of the word; which
comprehends under it something more
than a bare simple assent, as <hi>p.</hi> 43.
<q>I mean this is all is required to be
<hi>believed</hi> by those who acknowledge
but one Eternal invisible God, the
Maker of Heaven and Earth: For
that there is something more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Salvation, besides <hi>believing</hi>
we shall see hereafter.</q> P. 47. <q>All
I say that was to be believed for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107142:110"/>
Justification. For that this was not
all that was required to be done for
Justification, we shall see hereafter.</q>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 92. <q>Obeying the Law of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> their King being no less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
than their <hi>believing</hi> that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the King and
Deliverer, that was promised them,</q>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. <q>As far as <hi>meer believing</hi>
could make them Members of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Body.</q> By these, and more
the like Passages in my Book, my
meaning is so evident, that no body,
but an <hi>Unmasker,</hi> would have said, that
when I spoke of <hi>believing</hi> as a bare
Speculative assent to any Proposition
as true, I affirm'd that was all that
was required of a Christian for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
Though that in the strict sense
of the word is all that is done in <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi>
And therefore, I say, as far
<hi>as meer believing</hi> could make them
Members of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body; plainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
as much as words can, that
the <hi>Faith,</hi> for which they were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
included something more than
a bare assent. This appears not only
from these words of mine, <hi>p.</hi> 196.
<hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>often in his Epistles, puts</hi> Faith
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107142:111"/>
                  <hi>for the whole Duty of a Christian;</hi> but
from my so often, and almost every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
interpreting <hi>believing him to
be the Messiah,</hi> by <hi>taking him to be our
King;</hi> whereby is meant not a bare
idle Speculation, a bare notional per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of any truth whatsoever float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our Brains; but an active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Life, a <hi>Faith</hi> working by
Love and Obedience. <hi>To take him to
be our King,</hi> carries with it a right
disposition of the will to honour, and
obey him, joyn'd to that assent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Believers imbrace this Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Truth, that Jesus was the Person,
who was by God sent to be their King;
he that was promis'd to be their Prince
and Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But for all this, the</hi> Unmasker, p. 56.
<hi>Confidently tells his Reader that I say
no such thing. His words are,</hi> But
besides this Historical Faith (as it is
generally call'd by Divines) which is
giving Credit to Evangelical Truths, as
barely reveal'd, there must be something
else added to make up the true Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Faith of a Christian. With the
assent of the Understanding, must be
joyn'd the consent or approbation of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107142:111"/>
Will. All those Divine Truths, which
the Intellect assents to must be allow'd
of by this Elective Power of the Soul.
True Evangelical Faith is a hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Messias, as he is offer'd
in the Gospel. It is a sincere and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
submission to all things requir'd
by the Evangelical Law which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Epistles as well as the
other Writings. And to this practical
assent and choice there must be added
likewise a firm Trust and reliance in
the blessed Author of our Salvation. But
this late Undertaker who attempted to
give us a more perfect account than
ever was before of Christianity, as it is
deliver'd in the Scriptures, brings us no
tidings of any such Faith belonging to
Christianity, or discover'd to us in the
Scriptures. Which gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that he verily believes there is
no such Christian Faith, for in some of
his numerous Pages (especially 191. and
192, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> where he speaks so much of
Belief and Faith, he might have taken
occasion to insert one word about this
compleat Faith of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Though the places above quoted
out of my <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>

and the whole tenor of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of it, shew the falshood of
what the <hi>Unmasker</hi> here says; Yet I
will set down one Passage more out
of it, and then ask our <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
when he hath read them, whether he
hath the brow to say again, that <hi>I
bring no tidings of any such Faith?</hi> My
words are <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi>
p. 244. <q>Faith in the Promises of
God, relying and acquiescing in his
Word and Faithfulness, the Almighty
takes well at our hands, as a great
mark of Homage, paid by us poor
frail Creatures to his Goodness and
Truth, as well as to his Power and
Wisdom; and accepts it as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and Benignity to us. And
therefore our Saviour tells us, <hi>Iohn</hi>
XII. 44. <hi>He that believes on me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
not on me, but on him that sent
me.</hi> The Works of Nature shew
his Wisdom and Power: But 'tis
his peculiar care of Mankind, most
eminently discover'd in his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to them, that shews his Bounty
and Goodness: And consequently
engages their Hearts in Love and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107142:112"/>
Affection to him. This oblation of
an heart fixed with dependance and
affection on him, is the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Tribute we can pay him;
the Foundation of true Devotion;
and Life of all Religion. What a
Value he puts on this depending on
his Word, and resting satisfied on
his Promises, we have an example
in <hi>Abraham;</hi> whose Faith was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him for Righteousness; As
we have before remarked out of
<hi>Rom.</hi> IV. and his relying firmly on
the Promise of God, without any
doubt of its Performance; gave
him the Name, of the Father of
the Faithful; And gained him so
much favour with the Almighty,
that he was called the Friend of
God: The Highest and most Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Title can be bestowed on a
Creature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The great out-cry he makes against
me in his two next Sections, <hi>p.</hi> 57.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as if I intended to introduce Ignorance
and Popery, is to be entertain'd rather
as the noise of a petulant Scold, saying
the worst things she could think of,
than as the arguing of a Man of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107142:113"/>
sense or sincerity. All this mighty
Accusation is grounded upon these
Falshoods, That <hi>I make it my great
business to beat Men off from Divine
Truths;</hi> That <hi>I cry down all Articles
of the Christian Faith but one;</hi> That <hi>I
will not suffer Men to look into Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>

I shall add no more to what I
have already said about the Epistles,
but those few words out of my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> p. 295. <q>The
Epistles resolving Doubts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Mistakes, are of great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to our Knowledge and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</q>
And <hi>p.</hi> 229. <q>An explicit
belief of what God requires of those,
who will enter into, and receive the
benefits of the New Covenant, is
absolutely required. The other parts
of Divine Revelation are Objects of
Faith, and are so to be received.
They are Truths whereof none
that is once known to be such [<hi>i. e.</hi>
of Divine Revelation] may or ought
to be disbelieved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And as for that other Saying of his,
<hi>That I will not suffer Men to look into
Christianity;</hi> I desire to know where
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107142:113"/>
that Christianity is locked up, which
<hi>I will not suffer Men to look into.</hi> My
Christianity, I confess, is contain'd in
the written Word of God: And that
I am so far from hindring any one to
look into, that I every where appeal
to it, and have quoted so much of it,
that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> complains of being
overlaid with it, and tells me 'tis <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</hi>
                  <q>All Divine Revelation, I say,
<hi>p.</hi> 300. requires the Obedience of
Faith; And that every one is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all the parts of it, with a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
and disposition prepar'd to
imbrace and assent to all Truths
coming from God; and submit his
Mind to whatever shall appear to
him to bear that Character.</q> I
speak in the next Page of Mens <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring</hi>
to understand it, and of
their <hi>interpreting</hi> one place by another.
This and the whole Design of my
Book shews, That I think it every
Christian's Duty to read, search, and
study the Holy Scriptures: and make
this their great Business: And yet the
good <hi>Unmasker</hi> in a fit of Zeal displays
his Throat, and crys out, <hi>p. 59. Hear
O ye Heavens, and give ear, O Earth,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107142:114"/>
judge whether this be not the way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Darkness and</hi> Ignorance <hi>into
Christendom; whether this be not blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mens Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. For this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Pathos</hi> ends not there. And all
things consider'd, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had not reason, in his want of
Arguments, this way to pour out his
concern. For neither the Preaching
of our Saviour and his Apostles, nor
the Apostles Creed, nor any thing else
being with him the Faith of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<hi>i. e.</hi> sufficient to make a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
but just his set of Fundamental
Articles (when he himself knows what
they be) In fine, nothing being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
but just his System, 'tis time
to cry out, Help Neighbours, hold fast
Friends; Knowledge, Religion, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is gone, if this be once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that the People should read
and understand the Scripture for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as God shall enlighten their
Understandings in the use of the
means; and not be forced to depend
upon me, and upon my choosing, and
my Interpretation, for the necessary
Points they are to believe to make
them Christians: If I the great <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker,</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:107142:114"/>
have not the sole Power to
decree, what is, or is not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and People be not bound to receive
it for such, Faith and the Gospel are
given up; <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Barbarism</hi> will
be brought in upon us by this <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
Contrivance.</hi> For, <hi>he is an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
Factor for that Communion, which
cries up ignorance for the Mother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
and Religion,</hi> i. e. in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
for Popery. For to this and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else tends all that sputter he
makes in the Sections before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
               <p>I do not think there was ever a
more through-paced Declaimer than
our <hi>Unmasker.</hi> He leaves out nothing
that he thinks will make an affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
noise in the Ears of his Orthodox
Hearers, though all the blame and
censure he pours out upon others,
light only on himself. For let me ask
this Zealous Upholder of Light and
Knowledge, does he think it reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that any one, who is not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
should be suffer'd to be undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd
in his Parish? Nay, does he
think fit, that any such should live
free from the <hi>Lash of the Magistrate,</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:107142:115"/>
or from the Persecution of the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Power?</hi> He seems to talk with
another Air, <hi>p.</hi> 65. In the next place,
I ask, whether any one is a Christian
who hath not the Faith of a Christian?
Thirdly, I ask, whether he has the
Faith of a Christian, who does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
believe all the Fundamental
Articles of Christianity? And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I ask him, whether all those
that he has set down are not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
necessary Articles? When the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> has fairly answer'd these
Questions, it will be seen who is for
Popery, and the Ignorance and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
that accompanies it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi> is for making and
imposing Articles of Faith: But he is
for this Power in himself. He likes not
Popery (which is nothing but the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and imposing upon Mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
Faith, and Consciences)
in the hands of the old Gentleman at
<hi>Rome:</hi> But it would, he thinks, do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
well in his own hands. And
who can blame him for it? Would not
that be an excellent way to propagate
<hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> by tying up all
Men to a bundle of Articles of his own
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107142:115"/>
culling? Or rather to the Authority of
Christ and his Apostles residing in him?
For he does not, nor ever will, give us
a full view of Fundamentals of his
Christianity: But like the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to secure our Dependance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to himself a Power of declaring
others, and defining what is Matter of
Faith, as he shall see occasion.</p>
               <p>Now therefore vail your Bonnets to
the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> all you that have a
Mind to be Christians: Break not
your Heads about the Scriptures, to
examine what they require of you:
Submit your Faith implicitly to the
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> he will understand and
find out the necessary Points for you
to believe. Take them, just so many
as he thinks fit to deliver them to you:
This is the way to be knowing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
But be sure, ask not whether
those he is pleas'd to deliver be every
one of them Fundamental, and all the
fundamental Articles necessary to be
believed to make a Man a Christian:
Such a <hi>capricious</hi> Question spoils all;
Overturns Christianity, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s sole keeping,
to be dispensed out as he thinks fit. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:107142:116"/>
you refuse an implicit Faith to him,
he will presently find you have it for
the whore of <hi>Babylon;</hi> he will smell
out Popery in it immediately: For
he has a very shrewd Scent, and you
will be discover'd to be an <hi>Underhand
Factor</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the <hi>Unmasker</hi> were such an
Enemy, as he pretends, to those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;</hi>
I wonder he should, in what he
has said concerning the Apostles Creed,
so exactly jump with <hi>Knot</hi> the Jesuit.
If any one doubt of this, I desire him
to look into the Fourth Chapter of
<hi>Knot's Charity maintain'd,</hi> and there
he will see, how well our <hi>Unmasker</hi>
and that <hi>Iesuit</hi> agree in Argument;
nay, and Expressions too. But yet I
do not think him so far guilty, as to
be imployed as an <hi>Underhand Factor</hi>
for Popery. Every Body will, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
be ready to pronounce him so
far an Innocent, as to clear him from
that. The Cunning of his Design goes
not beyond the laying out of his
preaching Oratory, for the setting up
his own System; and making that the
sole Christianity. To that end, he
would be glad to have the Power of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:107142:116"/>
interpreting Scripture, of defining and
declaring Articles of Faith, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them. This which makes the
absolute Power of the Pope he would
not I think establish at <hi>Rome;</hi> but 'tis
plain he would have it himself, if he
could get it, for the Support of the
Christianity of his System. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
Faith, if he might have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of it, and the taking Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
upon Trust from his Authority,
would be of excellent Use. Such a
Power in his Hands, would spread <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the World, i. e. his
own Orthodoxy, and Set of Opinions.
But if a Man differs, nay, questions
any thing of that, whether it be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary to make one a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
'tis immediately a <hi>Contrivance</hi>
to let in Popery, and to bring <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Barbarism into the Christian
World.</hi> But I must tell the Innocent
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> whether he designs it or no,
That if his calling his System the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christianity, can bring the World
to receive from him Articles of Faith
of his own chusing, as Fundamentals
necessary to be believed by all Men to
make them Christians, which Christ
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107142:117"/>
and his Apostles did not propose to all
Men to make them Christians, he
does only set up <hi>Popery</hi> in another
Guise, and lay the Foundatians of
<hi>Ignorance, Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Barbarism,</hi> in
the Christian World. For all the <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>
and <hi>Blindness,</hi> that Popery
introduced, was only upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
And if he does not see this
(as there is Reason to excuse his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence)
'twould be no hard matter to
demonstrate it; If that were at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Question between us. But
there are a great many other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to be proved by him, before
we come to that new Matter of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>But before I quit these Paragraphs,
I must go on with our <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s
Account, and desire him to shew

                  <hi>That</hi> I labour industriously to keep

That</hi> there is no necessity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any other Doctrines of the
Bible?</p>
               <p>These and several others of the like
strain, particularly concerning <hi>One Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
and the <hi>Epistles;</hi> (which are his
common places) are to be found in his
59. and 60. Pages. And all this out
of a Presumption, that his System is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107142:118"/>
the only Christianity; And that if
Men were not pressed, and perswaded
to receive that, just every Article of
it, upon pain of Damnation; Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
would be lost: And not to do
this, is to promote <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
the Bible. But he fears where
no fear is. If his Orthodoxy be the
truth, and conformable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
the laying the Foundation only
where our Saviour and his Apostles
have laid it, will not overturn it. And
to shew him, that it is so, I desire him
again to consider what I said in <hi>p.</hi> 8.
of my <hi>Vindication:</hi> Which, because I
do not remember, he any where takes
notice of in his Reply, I will here
offer again to his consideration: <q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
but Men of the Mission of
Jesus Christ; make them but see
the Truth, Simplicity and Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of what he himself hath
taught, and required to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his Followers, and you need
not doubt, but being once fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of his Doctrine and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which all Christians agree
are received by him, such Converts
will not lay by the Scriptures; But
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107142:118"/>
by a constant reading and study of
them, will get all the Light they
can from this Divine Revelation;
and nourish themselves up in the
words of Faith and good Doctrine,
as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If the reading and study of the
Scripture were more pressed than it
is, and Men were fairly sent to the
Bible to find their Religion; and not
the Bible put into their hands only to
find the Opinions of their peculiar
Sect or Party, Christendom would
have more Christians, and those that are,
would be more knowing, and more in
the right than now they are. That
which hinders this, is that select bundle
of Doctrines, which it has pleased every
Sect to draw out of the Scriptures, or
their own inventions, with an Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(and as our <hi>Unmasker</hi> would say,
a <hi>Contempt</hi>) of all the rest. These
<hi>choice</hi> Truths (as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> calls
his) are to be the standing Orthodoxy
of that Party, from which none of
that Church must recede without the
forfeiture of their Christianity, and
the loss of eternal Life. But whilst
People keep firm to these, they are in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107142:119"/>
the Church, and the Way to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which in effect, what is it but
to incourage ignorance, laziness, and
neglect of the Scriptures? For what
need they be at the pains of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
reading the Bible? Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
their Heads with considering and
weighing what is there deliver'd, when
believing as the Church believes, or
saying after, or not contradicting their
<hi>Domine,</hi> or Teacher, serves the turn?</p>
               <p>Further, I desire it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
what Name that meer Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew
of recommending to Men the
study of the Scripture deserves; if,
when they read it, they must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it just as he (that would be, and
they are too apt, contrary to the
Command of Christ, to call their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster)
tells them. If they find any
thing in the Word of God, that leads
them into Opinions, that he does not
allow; If any thing they meet with
in Holy Writ seems to them to thwart
or shake the received Doctrines, the
very proposing of their Doubts ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them suspected: Reasoning about
them, and not acquiescing in what
ever is said to them, is interpreted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107142:119"/>
want of due respect and deference
to the Authority of their Spiritual
Guides: Disrepute and Censures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
And if in pursuance of their
own Light, they persist in what they
think the Scripture teaches them,
they are turn'd out of the Church,
deliver'd to Sathan, and no longer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to be Christians. And is thus
a sincere and rightly directed study of
the Scriptures, that Men may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and profit thereby, incouraged?
This is the Consequence of Mens as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
to themselves a Power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
Fundamentals, <hi>i. e.</hi> of setting
up a Christianity of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
For how else can they turn
Men, of as unblameable Lives as
others of their Members, out of the
Church of Christ (for so they count
their Communion) for Opinions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
those Opinions were concluded
inconsistent with Christianity? Thus
Systems, the Inventions of Men, are
turn'd into so many opposite Gospels;
and nothing is truth in each Sect, but
what just suits with them. So that
the Scripture serves but like a Nose of
Wax, to be turn'd and bent, just as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107142:120"/>
may sit the contrary Orthodoxies of
different Societies. For 'tis these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Systems that to each Party are the
just Standards of Truth, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Scripture is to be measur'd
only by them. Whoever relinquishes
any of those distinguishing Points,
immediately ceases to be a Christian.</p>
               <p>This is the Way that the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
would have Truth and Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
Light and Knowledge propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.
But here too the differing
Sects giving equal Authority to their
own Orthodoxies will be quits with
him. For as far as I can observe, the
same Genius seems to influence them
all; even those who pretend most to
freedom, the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves.
For when it is observed how positive
and eager they are in their Disputes;
how forward to have their Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scripture received for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick,
though to others in several
places they seem very much strain'd;
How impatient they are of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and with what disrespect and
roughness they often treat their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers;
May it not be suspected that
this so visible warmth in their present
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107142:120"/>
Circumstances, and Zeal for their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy,
would (had they the Power)
work in them, as it does in others?
They in their turns would I fear be
ready, with their Set of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;
which they would be as forward
to impose on others, as others have
been to impose contrary Fundamentals
on them.</p>
               <p>This is and always will be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
effect of intruding on our
Saviour's Authority, and requiring
more now as necessary to be believed
to make a Man a Christian, than was
at first required by our Saviour and
his Apostles. What else can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
among Christians, but their tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and being torn in pieces by one
another; whilst every Sect assumes to
it self a Power of declaring Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,
and severally thus narrow
Christianity to their distinct Systems?
He that has a mind to see how Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals

and upon what Motives and
Considerations they are often taken

be suited to their convenience, may

the Life of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Part II. <hi>p.</hi> 197.
—205.</p>
               <p>Whenever Men take upon them to
go beyond those Fundamental Articles
of Christianity, which are to be found
in the Preachings of our Saviour and
his Apostles, where will they stop?
Whenever any Set of Men will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more as necessary to be believed
to make Men of their Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> in
their sense Christians, than what our
Saviour and his Apostles propos'd to
those, whom they made Christians,
and admitted into the Church of
Christ; however they may pretend to
recommend the Scripture to their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in effect no more of it is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, than just comports
with what the Leaders of that Sect
have resolv'd Christianity shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in.</p>
               <p>'Tis no wonder therefore there is so
much Ignorance amongst Christians,
and so much vain outcry against it;
whilst almost every distinct Society
of Christians Magisterially ascribes Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107142:121"/>
to a select Set of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
distinct from those proposed in
the Preaching of our Saviour and his
Apostles, which in no one Point must
be question'd by any of its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
By this means their People
are never sent to the Holy Scriptures,
that true Fountain of Light, but hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink'd:
A Veil is cast over their eyes,
and then they are bid read the Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They must make it all chime to their
Churches Fundamentals, or else they
were better let it alone. For if they
find any thing there against the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Doctrines, though they hold it
and express it, in the very terms the
Holy Ghost has deliver'd it in, that
will not excuse them. Heresie will be
their lot, and they shall be treated
accordingly. And thus we see how,
amongst other good effects, Creed-making
always has, and always will
necessarily produce and propagate Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
in the World, however each
Party blame others for it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I have often wonder'd to hear
Men of several Churches so heartily
exclaim against the implicit Faith of
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> when the same
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107142:122"/>
implicit Faith is as much practised and
required in their own, though not so
openly professed, and ingenuously
owned there.</p>
               <p>In the next Section, the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
questions the Sincerity of mine, and
professes the greatness of his concern
<hi>for the Salvation of Mens Souls.</hi> And
tells me of my <hi>Reflection</hi> on him upon
that account, in the 9th. Page of my
<hi>Vindication. Answ.</hi> I wish he would
for the right Information of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
every where set down, what he
has any thing to say to in my Book,
or my Defence of it, and save me the
Labour of repeating it. My words in
that place are, <q>Some Men will not
bear, that any one should speak of
Religion, but according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
that they themselves have made
of it. Nay, though he proposes it
upon the very terms, and in the
very words, which our Saviour and
his Apostles preach'd it in; yet he
shall not escape Censures and the
severest insinuations. To deviate
in the least, or to omit any thing
contained in their Articles is Heresy,
under the most invidious Names
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107142:122"/>
in fashion; and 'tis well if he escapes
being a downright Atheist. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be the Way for Teachers
to make themselves hearken'd to as
Men in Earnest in Religion, and
really concern'd for the Salvation
of Mens Souls I leave them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.
What Success it has had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
perswading Men of the truth
of Christianity, their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the prevalency of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism
on the one hand, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Deists</hi> on the other sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have set down this Passage at
large, both as a confirmation of what
I said but just now; as also to shew,
that the <hi>Reflection,</hi> I there made, needed
some other Answer than a bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his <hi>regard to the Salvation of
Mens Souls.</hi> The assuming an undue
Authority to his own Opinions, and
using manifest Untruths in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of them, I am sure is no mark
that the directing Men right in the
way to Salvation is his chief aim.
And I wish, that the greater Liberties
of that sort, which he has again taken
in his <hi>Socinianism Vnmask'd,</hi> and which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107142:123"/>
I have so often laid open, had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
that <hi>Reflection.</hi> I should have
been glad, that any thing in my Book
had been fairly controverted, and
brought to the touch, whether it had
or had not been con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uted. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it would have deserved a
serious debate (if any had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary)
in the words of Sobriety and
the Charitable temper of the Gospel,
as I desired in my Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace: And that
would not have mis-become the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
Function. But it did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
it seems, with his Design. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Charity would not have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
those ill-meant Conjectures, and
groundless Censures, which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his purpose; and therefore
he took a shorter course, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
my Book, and thereby convince
me and others. He makes it his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to rail at it, and the Author of it;
that that might be taken for a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
For, by what he has hitherto
done, arguing seems not to be his
Talent. And thus far who can but
allow his Wisdom? But whether it be
that <hi>Wisdom that is from above, first
pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107142:123"/>
intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,
without partiality, and without hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
I shall leave to other Readers to
judge.</p>
               <p>His saying nothing to that other
<hi>Reflection,</hi> which his manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
himself drew from me, would
make one suspect it favoured not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
of the Wisdom of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
nor shew'd an over great Care
of the Salvation of Souls. My Words,
<hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 25. are <q>I know not how
better to shew my Care of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
than by intreating him, that
when he takes next in hand such a
Subject as this, wherein the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Souls is concerned, he would
treat it a little more seriously, and
with a little more Candour; lest
Men should find in his Writings
another Cause of Atheism, which
in this Treatise he has not thought
fit to mention. <hi>Ostentation of Wit</hi>
in General, he has made a Cause of
Atheism, <hi>p.</hi> 28. But the World
will tell him; That frothy light
Discourses concerning the serious
Matters of Religion, and <hi>Ostentation</hi>
of trifling mis-becoming Wit, in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107142:124"/>
those who come as Ambassadors
from God, under the title of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
of the Apostles in the great
Commission of the Gospel, is none
of the least Causes of Atheism.</q>
But this advice I am now satisfied (by
his Second Part of the same Strain)
was very improper for him; and no
more reasonable, than if one should
advise a Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oon to talk gravely; who
has nothing left to draw attention, if
he should lay by his scurrility.</p>
               <p>The remainder of this 4th. Chapter,
<hi>p.</hi> 61.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>67. being spent in shewing,
why the <hi>Socinians</hi> are for a few Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, being a Matter that I
am not concern'd in; I leave to that
forward Gentleman to examine, who
examined Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Exceptions
against the <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
and who, as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
me, <hi>p.</hi> 64. was <hi>chosen to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my attempt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Unmasker</hi> knows that he was
so <hi>Chosen,</hi> it is well. If I had known
of such a choice, I should have desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that somebody should have been
<hi>chosen to Vindicate my attempt,</hi> who
had understood it better. The <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:107142:124"/>
and <hi>Examiner</hi> are each of them
so full of themselves, and their own
Systems, that I think they may be a
fit match one for another; And so I
leave these Cocks of the Game, to try
it out in an endless battle of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(till Death them depart) which
of them has made the true and exact
Collection of Fundamentals; And
whose System of the two ought to be
the prevailing Orthodoxy, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for Scripture. Only I warn
the <hi>Examiner</hi> to look to himself; For
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has the whiphand of
him, and gives him to understand,
<hi>p.</hi> 65. that if he cannot do it himself
by the strength of his Lungs, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency
of his Oratory, and endless
attacks of his Repetitions, the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Power,</hi> and the Civil <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
lash</hi> have in store demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Arguments to convince him that
his [the <hi>Vnmasker</hi>'s] System is the only
true Christianity.</p>
               <p>By the way, I must not forget to
mind the <hi>Unmasker</hi> here again, that
he hath a very unlucky hand at gues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
For, whereas he names <hi>Socinus</hi>
as one from whom I received my
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107142:125"/>
                  <hi>Platform,</hi> and says that <hi>Crellius gave
me my Kue;</hi> it so falls out, that they
are two Authors of whom I never
read a Page. I say not this, as if I
thought it a fault if I had, for I think
I should have much better spent my
time in them, than in the Writings of
our learned <hi>Unmasker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was sure there was no offending
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> without the guilt of
<hi>Atheism;</hi> only he here, <hi>p.</hi> 69. very
mercifully lays it upon my Book, and
not upon my Design. <hi>The tendency
of it to Irreligion and Atheism,</hi> he has
proved in an Eloquent Harangue (for
he is such an Orator he cannot stir a
foot without a Speech) made as he
bids us suppose by the <hi>Atheistical Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
And who can deny, but he has
chose a fit Imployment for himself?
Where could there be found a better
Speech-maker for the <hi>Atheistical Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi>
But let us hear him: For though
he would give the <hi>Atheistical Rabble</hi>
the Credit of it, yet 'tis the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
speaks. And because 'tis pity such a
pattern of Rhetorick and Reason should
be lost, I have for my Reader's Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
set it all down <hi>verbatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:107142:125"/>
                  <q>We are beholding to this worthy
Adventurer for ridding the World
of so great an Incumbrance, <hi>viz.</hi>
That huge Mass and unweildy Body
of Christianity, which took up so
much room. Now we see that it
was this bulk and not that of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
which he had an eye to, when
he so often mention'd this latter.
This is a Physician for our turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
We like this Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
that doth not trouble us with
a parcel of heavy Drugs of no value,
but contracts it all into a few Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
nay doth his business with a
single drop. We have been in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
a long time to Creeds and
Catechisms, Systems and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
we have been plagued with a
tedious Beadroll of Articles, which
our Reverend Divines have told us
we must make the Matter of our
Faith. Yea, so it is, both Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
and Nonconformists (though
disagreeing in some other things)
have agreed in this to molest and
Crucifie us. But this noble Writer
(we thank him) hath set us free;
and eas'd us by bringing down all
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107142:126"/>
the Christian Faith into one Point.
We have heard some Men talk of
Epistolary Composures of the New
Testament, as if great Matters were
contain'd in them, as if the great
Mysteries of Christianity (as they
call them) were unfolded there:
But we could never make any thing
of them; and now we find that this
Writer is partly of our Opinion.
He tells us that these are Letters
sent upon occasion, but we are not
to look for our Religion (for now
for this Gentleman's sake we begin
to talk of Religion) in these places.
We believe it, and we believe that
there is no Religion but in those
very Chapters and Verses, which
he has set down in his Treatise.
What need we have any other part
of the New Testament? That is
Bible enough, if not too much.
Happy, thrice happy shall this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
be perpetually esteemed by us,
we will Chronicle him as our Friend
and Benefactor. It is not our way
to Saint People: Otherwise we
would certainly canonize this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman;
and when our hand is in,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107142:126"/>
his pair of Booksellers for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so Beneficial to the World in
publishing so rich a Treasure. It
was a blessed day when this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Birth saw the Light, for hereby
all the Orthodox Creed-Makers and
Systematick Men are ruined for
ever. In brief, if we be for any
Christianity, it shall be this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's;
for that agrees with us sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
well, it being so short, all
couch'd in four words neither more
nor less. It is a very fine Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
and we are infinitely obliged
to this great Reformer for it. We
are glad at heart that Christianity
is brought so low by this worthy
Pen-man, for this is a good presage
that it will dwindle into nothing.
What! But one Article, and that
so brief too! We like such a Faith,
and such a Religion, because it is so
near to none.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He hath no sooner done, but as it
deserved, he crys out, <hi>Euge Sophos.
And is not the Reader,</hi> quoth he, <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that such Language as this hath
real truth in it? Does not he perceive,
that the discarding all the Articles
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107142:127"/>
but ONE makes way for the casting off
that too? Answ.</hi> 'Tis but supposing
that the Reader is a civil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>entleman,
and answers <hi>Yes,</hi> to these two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
and then 'tis Demonstration,
that by this Speech he has irrefragably
proved the <hi>tendency</hi> of my Book to
<hi>Irreligion and Atheism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Chillingworth</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
puts up this Request to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
<hi>Knot:</hi> 
                  <q>Sir, I beseech you,
when you write again, do us the
favour to write nothing but Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms.
For I find it still an extream
trouble to find out the conceal'd
Propositions, which are to connect
the parts of your Enthymems. As
now for Example, I profess to you
I have done my best endeavour to
find some Glue, or Sodder, or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or Thread, or any thing to
tie the Antecedent and this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
together.</q> The <hi>Unmasker</hi>
agrees so much in a great part of his
Opinion with that Jesuit (as I have
shew'd already) and does so infinitely
out-doe him in spinning Ropes of
Sand, and a course Thread of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies,
which runs quite through
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107142:127"/>
his Book, That 'tis with great justice,
I put him here in the Jesuits place, and
address the same Request to him.</p>
               <p>His very next words give me a fresh
reason to do it: For thus he argues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>p. 72. May we not expect, that those,
who deal thus with the Creed,</hi> i. e. <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
all the Articles of it but one, will
use the same Method in reducing the ten
Commandments and the Lord's Prayer,
Abbreviate the former into one Precept,
and the latter into one Petition?</hi> Answ.
If he will tell me where this <hi>Creed,</hi>
he speaks of, is, it will be much more
easie to answer his Demand. Whilst
his <hi>Creed,</hi> which he here speaks of, is
yet no where, it is ridiculous for him
to ask Questions about it. The Ten
Commandments and the Lord's Prayer,
I know where to find, in express words
set down by themselves, with peculiar
marks of distinction. Which is the
Lord's Prayer we are plainly taught,
by this Command of our Saviour,
<hi>Luk.</hi> XI. 1. <hi>When we pray, SAY, Our
Father,</hi> &amp;c. In the same manner and
words we are taught what we should
believe, to make us his Disciples by
his Command to the Apostles what
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107142:128"/>
they should Preach, <hi>Mat.</hi> X. 7. <hi>As ye
go preach SAYING.</hi> What were
they to say? Only this, <hi>the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Or, as St. <hi>Luke</hi>
expresses it, IX. 2. They were sent <hi>to
preach the Kingdom of God, and to heal
the Sick;</hi> Which, what it was we have
sufficiently explain'd. But this <hi>Creed</hi>
of the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> which he talks of,
where is it? Let him shew it us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
set out from the rest of the
Scripture. If he knows where it is,
let him produce it, or leave talking
of it, till he can. 'Tis not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed, that's evident. For that
Creed he has <hi>discarded</hi> from being
the Standard of Christian Faith, and
has told the World in words at length,
That <hi>if a Man</hi> believes <hi>no more than is
in express terms in the Apostles Creed,
his Faith will not be the Faith of a
Christian.</hi> Nay, 'tis plain, that <hi>Creed</hi>
has in the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Opinion, the
same <hi>tendency to Atheism and Irreligion,</hi>
that my Summary has. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed reducing the Forty, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Four hundred Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of his Christian Creed, to Twelve;
and leaving out the greatest part of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107142:128"/>
those necessary ones which he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and will hereafter in good time
give us, does as much dispose Men to
serve the Decalogue, and the Lord's
Prayer just so; as my reducing those
Twelve to Two. For so many at
least he has granted to be in my
Summary, <hi>viz.</hi> The Article of one
God, Maker of Heaven and Earth,
and the other of Jesus the Messiah;
though he every where calls them but
<hi>ONE:</hi> Which, whether it be to shew,
with what love and regard to truth he
continues, and consequently began this
Controversie; or whether it be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
and startle unwary, or confirm
prejudiced Readers, I shall leave to
others to judge. 'Tis evident he thinks
his Cause would be mightily maimed,
if he were forced to leave out the
charge of <hi>ONE</hi> Article; and he
would not know what to do for Wit
or Argument, if he should call them
<hi>two.</hi> For then the whole weight and
edge of his strong and sharp reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his <hi>Thoughts concerning the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Atheism,</hi> p. 122. would be lost.
There you have it in these words;
<hi>When the Catholick Faith is thus brought
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:107142:129"/>
down to one single Article, it will soon
be reduced to none; the Unit will dwindle
into a Cypher.</hi> And here again, it
makes the whole Argument of his
Atheistical Speech, which he winds
up with these convincing words; <hi>We
are glad to hear, that Christianity is
brought so low by this worthy Pen-man;
for this is a good Presage, that it will
dwindle into nothing. What! ONE
Article, and that so brief too: We like
such a Faith and such a Religion, because
it is so near NONE.</hi> But I must tell
this Writer of equal Wit, Sense, and
Modesty, That this Religion, which
he thus makes a dull Farce of, and
calls <hi>near none,</hi> is that very Religion,
which our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and
his Apostles preach'd for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Salvation of Mankind; no
one Article whereof, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
as necessary to be received by
Unbelievers to make them Christians,
is omitted. And I ask him, whether
it be his Errand, as one of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Ambassadors to turn it thus into
Ridicule? For till he has shewn, that
they Preach'd otherwise, and more
than what the Spirit of Truth has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107142:129"/>
of their Preaching in their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
which I have faithfully colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and set down, all that he shall
say reflecting upon the Plainness and
Simplicity of their Doctrine, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
directed against me, will by his
<hi>Atheistical Rabble</hi> of all kinds, now
they are so well enter'd and instructed
in it by him, be all turn'd upon our
Saviour and his Apostles.</p>
               <p>What tendency this, and all his
other trifling, in so serious a cause as
this is, has to the propagating of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism
and Irreligion</hi> in this Age, he
were best to consider. This I am sure,
the Doctrine of but <hi>one</hi> Article, (if
the Author and finisher of our Faith,
and those he guided by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
had Preach'd but <hi>one</hi> Article) has
no more tendency to Atheism, than
their Doctrine of <hi>one</hi> God. But the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> every where talks, as if the
Strength of our Religion lay in the
number of its Articles; and would be
presently routed, if it had but a few:
And therefore he has mustered up a
pretty full band of them, and has a

occasion. But I shall desire to
mind this Learned Divine, who is so
afraid what will become of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
if it should propose but <hi>one</hi> or
a few Articles as necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian, that
the Strength and Security of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
lies in the Divine Authority of
those who first promulgated the terms
of admittance into the Church, and
not in the Multitude of Articles sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by some necessary to be believed
to make a Man a Christian: And I
would have him remember, when he
goes next to make use of this strong
Argument of <hi>ONE dwindling into a
Cypher,</hi> that <hi>One</hi> is as remote as a
Million from none. And if this be
not so, I desire to know whether his
way of arguing will not prove Pagan
Polytheism to be more remote from
Atheism than Christianity. He will
do well to try the force of his Speech,
in the Mouth of an Heathen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the tendency of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
to Atheism, by reducing his great
number of Gods to but <hi>one,</hi> which was
<hi>so near none</hi> and would therefore <hi>soon
be reduced to none.</hi>

in these words. <hi>Is it not enough to
rob us of our God, by denying Christ to
be so; But, must they spoil us of all the
other Articles of Christian Faith but
one?</hi> Have a better heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good Sir,
for I assure you, no body can rob you
<hi>of your God,</hi> but by your own consent;
Nor <hi>spoil</hi> you of any of the <hi>Articles</hi>
of your <hi>Faith.</hi> If you look for them
where God has placed them, in the
Holy Scripture; and take them as he
has framed and fashion'd them there;
there you will always find them safe
and sound. But if they come out of
an Artificer's Shop, and be of humane

               <p>He, who considers this Argument

Philosopher's Stone in disputing. That
which would be worthless Lead in

Oratory changes its Nature, and gives
it the noble Tincture: So that what
in plain reasoning would be Nonsence,
let him but put it into a Speech, or

strong Argument. Whether this be
not so, I desire <hi>Mode</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> may

Whether it be from confusion of
Thought, or unfairness of Design; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because he has not clear distinct
notions of what he would say, or finds
it not to his purpose to speak them
clearly out, or both together; so it is,
that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> very seldom, but
when he rails, delivers himself so
that one can certainly tell what he
would have.</p>
               <p>The Question is, what is absolutely
necessary to be believed by every one
to make him a Christian. It has been
clearly made out from an exact Survey
of the History of our Saviour and his
Apostles, that the whole aim of all
their Preaching every where was to
convince the unbelieving World of
these two great Truths. First, That
there was one Eternal invisible God,
Maker of Heaven and Earth; And
next, That <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> the promised King, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
And that upon Mens believing
these two Articles they were Baptized,
and admitted into the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi>
received as Subjects of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and pronounced Believers. From
whence it unavoidably follows, that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107142:132"/>
these two are the only Truths necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to make a Man a
Christian.</p>
               <p>This Matter of Fact is so evident
from the whole tenor of the four Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,
and the Acts; And presses so
hard, that the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> who contends
for a great number of other Points
necessary to be believed to make a
Man a Christian, thinks himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to give some Answer to it:
But in his usual way full of Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and Confusion. To clear this
Matter, he lays down four Particulars.
The First is, <hi>p. 74. That the believing
Iesus to be the promised Messiah, was
the first step to Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second,</hi> p. 76. That though this
one Proposition (viz. <hi>of Jesus the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>)
be mentioned alone in some places,
yet there is reason to think, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that at the same time other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith were proposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third,</hi> p. 76. That though there
are several Parts and Members of the
Christian Faith, yet they do not all occur
in any one place of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fourth,</hi> p. 78. That Christianity
was erected by degrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:107142:132"/>
                  <hi>These particulars he tells us,</hi> p. 74.
he offers to clear an Objection. <hi>To see
therefore whether they are pertinent
or no, we must examine what the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is as he puts it. I think it
might have been put in a few words:
This I am sure, it ought to have been
put very clear and distinct. But the</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker
<hi>has been pleased to give it us,</hi>
p. 73. <hi>as followeth.</hi> Because I designed
these Papers for the satisfying of the
Reader's Doubts, about any thing occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
concerning the Matter before us,
and for the establishing of his wavering
Mind, I will here (before I pass to the
Second general Head of my Discourse)
answer a Query or Objection, which some
and not without some shew of Ground
may be apt to start. How comes it to
pass, they will say, that this Article of
Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> That Iesus is the Messiah
or Christ, is so often repeated in the
New Testament? Why is this sometimes
urged without the mentioning of any
other Article of Belief? Doth not this
plainly shew that this is all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to be believed as necessary to
make a Man a Christian? May we not
inferr from the frequent and sole repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107142:133"/>
of this Article in several places
of the Evangelists and the Acts, that
there is no other Point of Faith of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity; but that this alone is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to constitute a Man a true Member
of Christ.</p>
               <p>By which he shews, that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
which way to put the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
so as may be easiest to get rid
of it: And therefore he has turn'd it
several ways, and put several Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
about it. As First,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why</hi> this <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> viz. That
Jesus is the Messiah, <hi>is so often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the New Testament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next Question is, <hi>Why is this
sometimes urged without the mentioning
any other Article of Belief,</hi> which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
that sometimes other Articles of
Belief are mentioned with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third Question is,</hi> May we not
infer from the frequent and sole repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Article in several places of
the Evangelists and Acts.</p>
               <p>Which last Question is in effect,
Why is this so frequently and alone
repeated in the Evangelists and the
Acts, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Preachings of our
Saviour and his Apostles to Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:107142:133"/>
For of that he must give an
account, if he will remove the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.
Which three, though put as
one, yet are three as distinct Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
and demand a Reason for three
as distinct Matters of Fact, as these
three are, viz. <hi>frequently</hi> proposed;
<hi>Sometimes propos'd alone;</hi> and <hi>always</hi>
propos'd alone in the Preachings of
our Saviour and his Apostles; for so
in truth it was all through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels
and the Acts to the unconverted
Believers of one God <hi>alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These three Questions being thus
jumbled together in one Objection, let
us see how the Four particulars he
mentions will account for them.</p>
               <p>The first of them is this. <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of Iesus to be the promised
Messias,</hi> was, says he, the <hi>first step to
Christianity.</hi> Let it be so, what do
you infer from thence? The next
words shew, <hi>Therefore this rather than
any other Article was propounded to be
believed by all those whom either our
Saviour or his Apostles invited to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Christianity.</hi> Let your Premises
be never so true; and your Deduction
of this Proposition be never so regular
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:107142:134"/>
from them, it is all lost Labour. This
Conclusion is not the Proposition you
were to prove. Your Questions were,
<hi>why this Article is so often proposed?</hi>
And in those frequent repetitions,
<hi>why sometimes urged alone,</hi> and <hi>why al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
proposed alone,</hi> viz. <hi>to those whom
either our Saviour or his Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to imbrace Christianity.</hi> And
your Answer is, because the believing
<hi>Iesus to be the Messias, was the first step
to Christianity.</hi> This therefore remains
upon you to be proved,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="33" type="part">
               <head>XXXII.</head>
               <p>That because the believing Iesus to be
the Messias, is the first step to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
therefore this Article is
frequently proposed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament;
Is sometimes proposed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the mentioning any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle;
and always alone to Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.</p>
               <p>And when you have proved this,
I shall desire you to apply it to our
present Controversie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:107142:134"/>
His next Answer to those Questions
is in these words, <hi>p. 76. That though
this one Proposition or Article be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
alone in some places, yet there is
reason to think and be perswaded that
at the same time other Matters of Faith
were proposed.</hi> From whence it lies
upon him to make out this reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="34" type="part">
               <head>XXXIII.</head>
               <p>That because there is reason to
think, and be perswaded, that at
the same time, that this one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
was mentioned alone (as it
was sometimes) other Matters of
Faith were propos'd. Therefore
this Article was often proposed
in the New Testament; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
proposed alone; and always
proposed alone in the Preachings
of our Saviour and his Apostles
to Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>This I set down to shew the force
of his Answer to his Questions: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it to be true, not that I
grant it to be true, That where <hi>this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107142:135"/>
one Article is mentioned alone, we have
reason to think, and be perswaded, that
at the same time other Matters of Faith</hi>
[<hi>i. e.</hi> Articles of Faith necessary to be
believed to make a Man a Christian]
<hi>were proposed:</hi> And I doubt not but to
shew the contrary.</p>
               <p>His Third particular, in Answer to
the Question proposed in his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
stands thus, <hi>p. 76. That though
there are several Parts and Members of
the Christian Faith, yet they do not all
occur in any one place of the Scripture;</hi>
which Answer lays it upon him to
prove</p>
            </div>
            <div n="35" type="part">
               <head>XXXIV.</head>
               <p>That because <hi>the several parts of the
Members of the Christian Faith do
not all occur in any one place of
Scripture;</hi> Therefore <hi>this Article,</hi>
That Jesus was the <hi>Messias, was
often proposed in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sometimes proposed alone,
and always proposed alone</hi> in the
Preachings of our Saviour and
his Apostles, through the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Evangelists and the
Acts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:107142:135"/>
The Fourth and last Particular,
which he tells us is the main Answer
to the Objection, is in these words,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 78.
<q>That Christianity was erected by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</q>
Which requires him to make out this
Argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="36" type="part">
               <head>XXXV.</head>
               <p>That because Christianity was erected
by degrees, <hi>Therefore</hi> this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
<hi>that Jesus was the Messias,</hi>
was often proposed in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
sometimes proposed alone,
and always proposed alone in the
Preachings of our Saviour and
his Apostles to Unbelievers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the History of the
Evangelists and Acts.</p>
               <p>For, as I said before, in these three
Questions he has put his Objection;
To which he tells us this is the main
Answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:107142:136"/>
                  <hi>Of these four Particulars it is that
he says,</hi> p. 74. To clear this Objection,
and to give a full and satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to all doubts in this Affair, I
offer these ensuing particulars, which
will lead the Reader to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the whole case.</p>
               <p>How well they have <hi>clear'd the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
may be seen by barely setting
them down as Answers to these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
wherein he puts the Objection.</p>
               <p>This is all I have hitherto done:
Whereby is very visible how well (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them true) they clear the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
and how pertinently they are
brought to answer those Questions
wherein his Objection is contain'd.
Perhaps it will be said, that neither
these, nor any thing else can be an
apposite Answer to those Questions
put so together. I answer, I am of
the same mind. But if the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
through ignorance or shuffling will
talk thus confusedly, he must answer
for it. He calls all his three Questions
one Objection over and over again:
And therefore which of those Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
it does or does not lie in, I shall
not trouble my self to divine: Since I
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107142:136"/>
think he himself cannot tell. For,
which ever he takes of them, it will
involve him in equal Difficulties. I
now proceed to examine his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
themselves, and the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in them. The first, <hi>pag.</hi> 74.
stands thus.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The believing of Iesus to be the
promised Messias was the first step to
Christianity. It was that which made
way for the imbracing of all the other
Articles, a Passage to all the rest.
Answ.</hi> If this be, as he would have it,
only the leading Article amongst a
great many other equally necessary to
be believed to make a Man a Christian;
This is a reason, why it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
preach'd in the first place. But
this is no reason, why this alone should
be so often repeated, and the other
necessary Points not be once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
For I desire to know, what
those other Articles are, that in the
Preaching of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
are repeated or urged besides
this?</p>
               <p>In the next place, if it be true, that
this Article, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iesus</hi> is the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> was only the first in order, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107142:137"/>
a great many Articles as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed; how comes it
to pass, that barely upon the Proposal
and believing of this, Men were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Church as Believers?
The History of the New Testament is
full of instances of this, as <hi>Act.</hi> VIII.
5. 12. 13. IX<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in other places.</p>
               <p>Though it be true what the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
says here, <hi>That if they did not
give Credit to this in the first place,
that Iesus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>was that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and Extraordinary Person prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied
of long before, and that he was sent
and Commissioned by God, there could
be no hope that they would attend to any
other Proposals relating to the Christian
Religion;</hi> yet what he subjoins, That
<hi>this is the true reason, why that Article
was constantly propounded to be believed
by all that looked towards Christianity,
and why it is mention'd so often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the
Evangelical Writing</hi> is not true. For
First, this supposes that there were
other Articles joyn'd with it. This
he should have first proved, and then
given the reason of it; And not, as
he does here, suppose what is in the
Question, and then give a reason, why
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107142:137"/>
it is so; and such a reason that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with the Matter of Fact,
that is every where recorded in Holy
Writ. For if the true reason, why
the Preaching of this Article, that
<hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as it is recorded
in the History of the New Testament,
were only to make way for the other
Articles, one must needs think, that
either our Saviour and his Apostles
(with reverence be it spoken) were
very strange Preachers; Or that the
Evangelists, and Author of the Acts
were very strange Historians. The
first were to instruct the World in a
new Religion consisting of a great
number of Articles, says the <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
necessary to be believed to make a
Man a Christian, <hi>i. e.</hi> a great number
of Propositions making a large Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem,
every one whereof is so necessary
for a Man to understand, and believe,
that if any one be omitted, he cannot
be of that Religion. What now did
our Saviour and his Apostles do? Why,
if the <hi>Unmasker</hi> may be believed, they
went up and down with danger of
their Lives, and Preach'd to the
World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What did they Preach? Even
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:107142:138"/>
this single Proposition to make way
for the rest, <hi>viz. This is the Eminent
Man sent from God</hi> to teach you other
things, which amounts to no more
but this, That <hi>Iesus</hi> was the Person
which was to teach them the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but that true Religion it self is
not to be found in all their Preaching;
nay, scarce a word of it. Can there
be any thing more ridiculous, than
this? And yet this was all they
Preach'd; if it be true, that this was
all which they meant by the Preaching
every where <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
And if it were only an Introduction and
a <hi>making way</hi> for the Doctrines of the
Gospel. But it is plain it was called
the Gospel it self. Let the <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
as a true Successor of the Apostles,
go and Preach the Gospel as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did, to some part of the Heathen
World, where the Name of Christ is
not known: Would not he himself, and
every body think, he was very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
imploy'd, if he should tell them
nothing but this, that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the
Person promised and sent from God to
reveal the true Religion; But should
teach them nothing of that true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107142:138"/>
but this Preliminary Article?
Such the <hi>Unmasker</hi> makes all the
Preaching recorded in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the Conversion of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
World. He makes the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Saviour and his Apostles, to
be no more but this; that the great
Prophet promised to the World was
come, and that <hi>Iesus</hi> was he: But
what his Doctrine was, that they were
silent in, and taught not one Article
of it. But the <hi>Unmasker</hi> mis-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it: For as to his accusing the
Historians, the Evangelists, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Acts of the Apostles, for
their shameful omission of the whole
Doctrine of the Christian Religion, to
save his Hypothesis, as he does under
his next Head in these words, <hi>That
though this one Proposition be mention'd
alone in some places, yet there is reason
to think and be perswaded, that at the
same time other Matters of Faith were
proposed;</hi> I shall shew how bold he
makes with those inspired Historians,
when I come to consider that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>How ridiculous, how senseless this
bold <hi>Unmasker</hi> and Reformer of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107142:139"/>
History of the New Testament makes
the Preaching of our Saviour and his
Apostles, as it stands recorded of them
by infallible Writers, is visible. But
taking it as in truth it is there, we
shall have a quite other view of it.
Our Saviour Preach'd every where
the Kingdom of God, and by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
declar'd himself to be the King
of that Kingdom. The Apostles Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the same, and after his Ascension
openly avowed him to be the Prince
and Saviour promis'd. But Preach'd
not this, as a bare Speculative Article
of simple belief. But that Men might
receive him for their King, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Subjects. When they told
the World that he was the Christ, it
was not as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will have it;
Believe this Man to be a Prophet, and
then he will teach you his new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which when you have received
and imbraced, all and every Article
thereof, which are a great number,
you will then be Christians, if you be
not ignorant or incredulous of any of
them. But it was, Believe this Man
to be your King sent from God: Take
him for such, with a resolution to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107142:139"/>
the Laws he has given you, and
you are his Subjects; you are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
For those, that truly did so,
made themselves his Subjects: And to
continue so there was no more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than a sincere endeavour to know
his Will in all things, and to obey it.
Such a Preaching as this of <hi>Iesus</hi>
to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> the King and
Deliverer that God Almighty had
promised to Mankind, and now had
effectually sent to be their Prince and
Ruler; was not a simple preparation
to the Gospel: But when received
with the Obedience of Faith, was the
very receiving of the Gospel; and
had all that was requisite to make
Men Christians. And without it be so
understood, no body can clear the
Preaching of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
from that incredible Imperse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
or their Historians from that
unpardonable negligence, and not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either what they ought, or what
they undertook; which our <hi>Unmasker</hi>
hath so impiously charged upon them,
as will appear yet plainer in what I
have to say to the <hi>Vnmasker</hi>'s next
Particular. For as to the remainder
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107142:140"/>
of this Paragraph, it contains nothing
but his censure and contempt of me,
for not being of his Mind; for not
seeing as he sees, <hi>i. e.</hi> in effect not
laying that blame, which he does ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the Preaching of our Saviour
and his Apostles; or on the inspired
Writings of their Historians, to make
them comply with his System, and
the Christianity he would make.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Unmasker<hi>'s Second Particular,</hi>
p. 76. <hi>tells us,</hi> That though this One
Proposition or Article be mention'd alone
in some places, yet there is reason to
think, and be perswaded, that at the
same time other Matters of Faith were
proposed. For it is confess'd by all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and observing Men, that the
History of the Scripture is concise; and
that in relating of Matter of Fact many
Passages are omitted by the Sacred
Penmen. Wherefore though but this
one Article of belief, (because it is a
Leading one, and makes way for the rest)
be expresly mention'd in some of the
Gospels, yet we must not conclude thence,
that no other Matter of Faith, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to be admitted of. For things
are briefly set down in the Evangelical
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107142:140"/>
Records, and we must suppose many
things which are not in direct terms
related.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Vnmasker</hi> here keeps to
his usual custom of speaking in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
terms. He says, that where this
one Article, that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
is alone recorded in the Preaching of
our Saviour and his Apostles, <hi>We have
reason to be perswaded, that at the same
time other Matters of Faith were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</hi>
If this be to his purpose, by
<hi>Matters of Faith</hi> must be meant Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles of Faith, absolutely
necessary to be believed by every Man
to make him a Christian. That such
<hi>Matters of Faith</hi> are omitted in the
History of the Preaching of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles by the Sacred
Historians, this, he says, <hi>we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be perswaded of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> They need be good Reasons
to perswade a rational Man, that the
Evangelists in their History of our
Saviour and his Apostles (if they were
but ordinarily fair and prudent Men)
did, in an History publish'd to instruct
the World in a new Religion, leave
out the necessary and Fundamental
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107142:141"/>
parts of that Religion. But let them
be consider'd as inspired Writers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of the infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, putting them upon, and
directing them in the writing of this
History of the Gospel, and then it is
impossible for any Christian, but the
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> to think, that they made
any such gross Omissions, contrary to
the design of their Writing, without
a Demonstration to convince him of
it. Now all the reason that our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
gives is this: <hi>That it is confessed
by all intelligent and observing Men,
that the History of the Scripture is
concise, and that in relating Matters of
Fact, many Passages are omitted by the
Sacred Penmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Unmasker</hi> might have
spar'd the Confession of <hi>intelligent and
observing Men,</hi> after so plain a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> himself, <hi>Chap.</hi> XX. 31.
<hi>Many other things did Iesus in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his Disciples, which are not
written in this Book.</hi> And again, XXI. 25.
<hi>There are also many other things that
Iesus did, the which if they should be
written every one, I suppose the world
could not contain the Books that should
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:107142:141"/>
be written.</hi> There needs therefore no
opinion of <hi>intelligent and observing
Men</hi> to convince us, that the History
of the Gospel is so far <hi>Concise,</hi> that a
great many <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and a great many less material
Circumstances, even of those that are
set down. But will any <hi>intelligent</hi> or
<hi>observing</hi> Man, any one that bears
the Name of a Christian, have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to say, that the inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in the relation they give us of
what Christ and his Apostles Preach'd
to Unbelievers to convert them to
the Faith, omitted the Fundamental
Articles which those Preachers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to make Men Christians; and
without a belief of which they could
not be Christians?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi> talks after his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fashion; seems to say something,
which when examin'd proves nothing
to his Purpose. He tells us, <hi>That in
some places</hi> where the Article of <hi>Iesus</hi>
the Messiah is <hi>mention'd alone, at the
same time other matters of Faith were
proposed.</hi> I ask, were these <hi>other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith</hi> all the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles? If not, what are
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107142:142"/>
those <hi>other matters of Faith</hi> to the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
Purpose? As for Example, in
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Act.</hi> II. <hi>Other
matters of Faith were proposed with the
Article of Iesus the Messiah.</hi> But what
does this make for His Fundamental
Articles? Were They all propos'd with
the Articles of <hi>Iesus the Messiah?</hi> If
not, Unbelievers were converted and
brought into the Church without the
<hi>Unmasker</hi>'s necessary Articles. Three
Thousand were added to the Church
by this one Sermon. I pass by now
St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s not mentioning a Syllable of
the greatest part of the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s
necessary Articles; and shall consider
only, how long that Sermon may
have been. 'Tis plain from <hi>v.</hi> 15.
that it began not till about Nine in the
Morning, and from <hi>v.</hi> 41. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Night Three Thousand were
converted and Baptized. Now, I ask
the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> whether so small a
Number of Hours as St. <hi>Peter</hi> must
necessarily imploy in Preaching to
them were sufficient to instruct such
a mixed Multitude so fully in all those
Articles, which he has propos'd as
necessary to be believed to make a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107142:142"/>
Man a Christian, as that every one of
those Three Thousand, that were that
day Baptized, did understand and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
believe every one of those his
Articles, just in the sense of our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
System? Not to mention
those remaining Articles which the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> will not be able in twice
as many Months to find and declare
to us.</p>
               <p>He says, <hi>That in some places</hi> where
the Article of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> is
<hi>mentioned alone, at the same time other
matters of Faith were proposed.</hi> Let
us take this for so at present, yet this
helps not the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s case. The
Fundamental Articles, that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by our Saviour and his Apostles,
necessary to be believed to make Men
Christians, are not set <hi>down; but only</hi>
this single one of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah:</hi>
Therefore will any one dare to say that
they are omitted every where by the
Evangelists? Did the Historians of the
Gospel make their relation so <hi>concise</hi>
and short, that giving an account in
so many places of the Preaching of
our Saviour and his Apostles for the
Conversion of the Unbelieving World,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107142:143"/>
they did not in any one place, nor in
in all of them together, set down the
necessary Points of that Faith, which
their Unbelieving Hearers were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to? If they did not, how can
their Histories be called the Gospels of
<hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> Or how can they serve
to the end for which they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
Which was, to publish to the
World the Doctrine of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
that Men might be brought into his
Religion? Now I challenge the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
to shew me not out of any
one place, but out of all the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of our Saviour and his Apostles,
recorded in the four Gospels, and the
Acts, all those Propositions which he
has reckon'd up as Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith. If they are not to be
found there, 'tis plain, that either they
are not Articles of Faith necessary to
be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
or else, that those inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have given us an account of the
Gospel, or Christian Religion, wherein
the greatest part of Doctrines necessary
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
are wholly omitted: Which in
short is to say, that the Christianity
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:107142:143"/>
which is recorded in the Gospels and
the Acts, is not that Christianity,
which is sufficient to make a Man a
Christian. This (as absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
as it is) is what our <hi>Unmasker</hi>
charges upon the <hi>Conciseness,</hi> (as he is
pleased to call it) of the Evangelical
History. And this we must take upon
his word; Though these inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
tell us the direct contrary. For
St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his Preface to his Gospel,
tells <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that having a perfect
knowledge <hi>OF ALL THINGS,</hi>
the Design of his Writing was to set
them in order, that he might know
the certainty of those things, that
were believed amongst Christians.
And his History of the Acts begins
thus, <hi>The former Treatise</hi> [i. e. his
Gospel] <hi>have I made, O</hi> Theophilus,
<hi>of ALL that Iesus began to do and to
teach.</hi> So that how concise soever the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> will have his History to be,
he professes it to contain <hi>ALL</hi> that
Jesus <hi>taught.</hi> Which <hi>ALL</hi> must, in
the narrowest sense, that can be given
it, contain at least <hi>all</hi> things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to make a Man a Christian.
'Twould else be a very lame and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107142:144"/>
History of <hi>ALL</hi> that Jesus
<hi>taught;</hi> if the Faith contained in it
were not sufficient to make a Man a
Christian. This indeed, as the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
hath been pleased to term it,
would be a very <hi>lank Faith,</hi> a very
<hi>lank</hi> Gospel.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Iohn</hi> also says thus of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Gospel, <hi>Ch.</hi> XX. 30, 31.
<hi>Many other signs truly did Iesus in the
presence of his Disciples, which are not
written in this Book:</hi> So far his History
is by his own Confession <hi>concise. But
these,</hi> says he, <hi>are written, that ye
might believe, that Iesus is the Messiah
the Son of God, and that believing ye
might have life through his Name.</hi> As
<hi>concise</hi> as it was, there was yet (if the
Apostle's word may be taken for it
against the <hi>Unm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sker's</hi>) enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in his Gospel, for the procuring
of eternal life to those who believed
it. And whether it was that one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
that he there sets down, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Iesus was the Messiah,</hi> or that Set of
Articles which the <hi>Unm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sker</hi> gives us,
I shall leave to this Modern Divine to
resolve. And if he thinks still, that
all the Articles he has set down in his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107142:144"/>
Roll, are necessary to be believed to
make a Man a Christian, I must desire
him to shew them to me in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s
Gospel, or else to convince the World,
that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> was mistaken, when he
said, that he had written his Gospel,
that Men might believe that <hi>Iesus is
the Messiah the Son of God, and that
believing they might have life thorugh
his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that granting the <hi>History of the
Scripture</hi> to be so <hi>concise</hi> as the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
would have it, <hi>viz.</hi> That in
<hi>some places</hi> the infallible Writers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
the Discourses of our Saviour
and his Apostles, omitted all the other
Fundamental Articles propos'd by
them to be believed to make Men
Christians, but this one, that <hi>Iesus</hi>
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Yet this will not
remove the Objection that lies against
his other Fundamentals, which are not
to be found in the Histories of the
Four Evangelists; nay, which are not
to be found in every one of them. If
every one of them contains the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, and consequently all
things necessary to Salvation, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this will not be a new ground of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:107142:145"/>
Accusation against me, and give the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> a right to charge me with
laying by three of the Gospels with
<hi>contempt,</hi> as well as he did before
charge me with a <hi>contempt</hi> of the
Epistles, must be left to his soveraign
Authority to determine.</p>
               <p>Having shew'd, that allowing all he
says here to be as he would have it,
yet it clears not the Objection, that lies
against his Fundamentals; I shall now
examine what truth there is, in what
he here pretends, <hi>viz.</hi> that though the
one Article, that Jesus is the Messiah,
be mention'd <hi>alone in some places, yet
we have reason to be perswaded from
the conciseness</hi> of the Scripture History,
that there were at the same time join'd
with it other necessary Articles of
Faith in the Preaching of our Saviour
and his Apostles.</p>
               <p>It is to be observed, that the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
builds upon this false Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that in <hi>some places</hi> other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles of Faith join'd with
that of <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> are by the
Evangelists mention'd to be propos'd
by our Saviour and his Apostles, as
necessary to be believed to make those
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107142:145"/>
they Preach'd to Christians. For his
saying, that in some places that <hi>one
necessary Article is mention'd alone,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that in other places it is not
mention'd alone, but join'd with other
necessary Articles. And then it will
remain upon him to shew,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="37" type="part">
               <head>XXXVI.</head>
               <p>In what place either of the Gospels
or of the Acts, other Articles of
Faith are join'd with this, and
propos'd as necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make Men Christians.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker,</hi> 'tis probable, will
tell us, that the Article of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
is sometimes join'd with
this of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as particularly in
that first Sermon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts II.
by which there were Three Thousand
added to the Church at one time.
<hi>Answ.</hi> This Sermon well consider'd,
will explain to us both the Preaching
of the Apostles, what it was that they
propos'd to their unbelieving Auditors
to make them Christians; and also the
manner of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s recording their
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:107142:146"/>
Sermons. 'Tis true, that here are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
by St. <hi>Peter</hi> many other <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith</hi> besides that of <hi>Iesus</hi>
being the <hi>Messiah:</hi> For all that he said
being of Divine Authority, is <hi>Matter
of Faith,</hi> and may not be disbelieved.
The first Part of his Discourse, is to
prove to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that what they
had observed of Extraordinary at that
time amongst the Disciples, who spake
variety of Tongues, did not proceed
from Wine, but from the Holy Ghost;
And that this was the pouring out of
the Spirit prophesied of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ioel.</hi> This is all <hi>Matter of Faith,</hi>
and is written, that it might be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
But yet, I think, that neither
the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> nor any body else will
say, that this is such a necessary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith, that no Man could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an explicit belief of it, be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
Though being a Declaration of
the Holy Ghost by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is so
much a <hi>Matter of Faith,</hi> that no body,
to whom it is now propos'd, can deny
it and be a Christian. And thus all
the Scripture of the New Testament,
given by Divine Inspiration is <hi>Matter
of Faith,</hi> and necessary to be believed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:107142:146"/>
by all Christians to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.
But yet I do not think any
one so unreasonable as to say, that
every Proposition in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a Fundamental Article of
Faith, which is required explicitly to
be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>Here now is a <hi>matter of Faith</hi> join'd,
in the same Sermon, with this Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article that <hi>Iesus is the Messiah;</hi>
And reported by the Sacred Historian
so at large, that it takes up a Third
part of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon recorded by
St. <hi>Luke;</hi> And yet it is such a <hi>matter of
Faith,</hi> as is not contain'd in the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
Catalogue of necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
I must ask him then, whether
St. <hi>Luke</hi> were so <hi>concise</hi> an Historian,
that he would so at large set down a
<hi>matter of Faith</hi> propos'd by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
that was not necessary to be believed
to make a Man a Christian, and wholly
leave out the very mention of all the
<hi>Unmasker</hi>'s additional necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
if indeed they were necessary
to be believed to make Men Christians?
I know not how any one could charge
the Historian with greater unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107142:147"/>
or greater folly. But this the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> sticks not at, to preserve to
himself the Power of appointing, what
shall, and what shall not be <hi>necessary</hi>
Articles; and of making his System
the Christianity necessary, and only
necessary to be received.</p>
               <p>The next thing that St. <hi>Peter</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to in this his Sermon is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to the Unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi> that
<hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who had done Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
amongst them, whom they had
Crucified and put to Death, and whom
God had raised again from the Dead,
was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here indeed our Saviour's Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion,
Death, and Resurrection are
mentioned: And if they were no
where else recorded, are <hi>matters of
Faith;</hi> which, with all the rest of the
New Testament, ought to be believed
by every Christian to whom it is thus
propos'd; as a part of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
But that these were not here
propos'd to the Unbelieving <hi>Iews,</hi>
as the Fundamental Articles, which
St. <hi>Peter</hi> principally aimed at, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to convince them of, is
evident from hence; That they are
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:107142:147"/>
made use of as Arguments to perswade
them of this Fundamental Truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom
they ought to take for their Lord and
Ruler. For whatsoever is brought as
an Argument to prove another Truth,
cannot be thought to be the principal
thing aimed at in that argumentation;
though it may have so strong and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
a connexion with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that you cannot deny it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
denying even what is inferr'd from
it, and is therefore the fitter to be an
Argument to prove it. But that our
Saviour's Crucifixion, Death, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
were used here as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to perswade them into a belief
of this Fundamental Article, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and not as Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of a new Faith they were to
receive; is evident from hence, that
they Preach'd here to those who
knew the Death and Crucifixion of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> as well as <hi>Peter:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these could not be propos'd to
them as new Articles of Faith to be
believed: But those Matters of Fact,
being what the <hi>Iews</hi> knew already,
were a good Argument joyn'd with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:107142:148"/>
his Resurrection to convince them
of that truth, which he endeavoured
to give them a Belief of. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he rightly inferred from these
Facts joined together, this Conclusion,
the believing whereof would make
them Christians. <hi>Therefore let all the
House of Israel know assuredly, that
God hath made that same Iesus, whom
ye have crucified, Lord and Christ.</hi> To
the making good this sole Proposition
his whole Discourse tended: This was
the sole Truth he laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them of: This the Faith he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to bring them into; which
as soon as they had received with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
they were by Baptism ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Church, and three
Thousand at once made Christians.</p>
               <p>Here St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s own Confession,
without that <hi>of intelligent and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men,</hi> which the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has
recourse to, might have satisfied him
again, <hi>that in relating matters of Fact,
many passages are omitted by the sacred
Pen-men.</hi> For says St. <hi>Luke</hi> here <hi>v.</hi> 40.
<hi>And with many other words,</hi> which are
not set down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:107142:148"/>One would at first sight, wonder
why the <hi>Unmasker</hi> neglects these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
Authorities of the Holy
Pen-men themselves, where they own
their Omissions, to tell, us, that it is
<hi>confessed by all intelligent and observing
men, that in relating matters of Fact,
many Passages are omitted by the sacred
Pen-men.</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in what he says of
his Gospel, directly professes large
Omissions, and so does St. <hi>Luke</hi> here.
But these Omissions would not serve
the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s turn: For they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
against him, and what he would
have: And therefore he had reason
to pass them by. For St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in that
passage above-cited, <hi>Ch.</hi> XX. 30, 31.
tells us, that how much soever he had
left out of his History, he had incerted
that, which was enough to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to eternal Life. <hi>But these are
written that ye might believe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
ye might have life.</hi> But this
is not all he assures us of, <hi>viz.</hi> That
he had recorded all that was necessary
to be believed to eternal Life: But he
in express words, tells us what is that
<hi>ALL</hi> that is necessary to be believed
to eternal Life; and for the Proof of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107142:149"/>
which Proposition alone, he writ all
the rest of his Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we
might believe.</hi> What? Even this.
<hi>That Iesus is the Christ the Son of God,</hi>
and that <hi>believing</hi> this we <hi>might have
life through his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may serve for a Key to us, in
reading the History of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And shew us, why this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is no
where omitted, though a great part
of the Arguments used to convince
Men of it, nay very often th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> whole
Discourse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made to lead Men into the
Belief of it, be entirely omitted. The
Spirit of God directed them every
where to set down the Article, which
was absolutely necessary to be believed
to make Men Christians; So that That
could no ways be doubted of nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken;
But the Arguments, and
Evidences, which were to lead Men
into this Faith, would be sufficient,
if they were once found any where,
though scattered here and there in
those Writings, whereof that infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirit was the Author. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Decorum used in all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and avoided those continual large
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107142:149"/>
and unnecessary Repetitions, which our
critical <hi>Unmasker</hi> might have call'd <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,</hi>
with juster Reason, than he does
the Repetition of this short Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Messiah;</hi> which
I set down no oftner in my Book,
than the Holy Ghost thought fit to
insert in the History of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
as concise as it is. But this
it seems to our Nice <hi>Unmasker,</hi> is <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,</hi>
tedious and offensive. And if
a Christian and a Successor of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
cannot bear the being so often
told, what it was, that our Saviour
and his Apostles every where preach'd
to the Believers of one God, though
it be contain'd in one short Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
What cause of Exception, and
disgust would it have been to Heathen
Readers, some whereof might perhaps
have been as Critical as the <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
if this sacred History had in every
Page been filled with the repeated Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of the Apostles, all of them
every where to the same purpose, <hi>viz.</hi>
to perswade Men to believe, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
was the <hi>Messiah?</hi> It was necessary
even by the Laws of History, as
often as their preaching any where
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:107142:150"/>
was mention'd to tell to what purpose
they spoke; which being always to
convince Men of this one Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Truth, 'tis no wonder, we find it
so often repeated. But the Arguments
and Reasonings, with which this one
Point is urged, are, as they ought to
be, in most places left out. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Repetition of them had been su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
and consequently might
justly have been blam'd as <hi>tedious.</hi> But
there is enough recorded aboundantly
to convince any rational Man, any
one not willfully blind, that he is that
promised Saviour. And in this we
have a reason of the Omissions in the
History of the New Testament; which
were no other than such, as became
prudent, as well as faithful Writers.
Much less did that Conciseness (with
which the <hi>Vnmasker</hi> would cover his
bold Censure of the Gospels and the
Acts, and as it seems, lay them by
with <hi>Contempt</hi>) make the holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
omit any thing, in the preaching
of our Saviour and his Apostles, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be known, and
believed to make Men Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:107142:150"/>Conformable hereunto, we shall
find St. <hi>Luke</hi> writes his History of the
Acts of the Apostles. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it he sets down at large some
of the Discourses made to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Iews.</hi> But in most other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
unless it be where there was
something particular in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the Matter, he contents
himself to tell to what purpose they
spoke: Which was every where only
this, That <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
Nay, St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the first Speech of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 11. which he thought
fit to give us a great part of, yet
owns the Omission of several things,
that the Apostle said. For having
expressed this Fundamental Doctrine,
That <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
several of the Arguments
wherewith St. <hi>Peter</hi> urged it for the
Conversion of the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi>
his Auditors, he adds <hi>v. 40. And
with many other words did he testifie
and exhort saying, Save your selves
from this untoward Generation.</hi> Here
he confesses, that he omitted a great
deal which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had said to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them. To what? To that which
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:107142:151"/>
in other words he had just said before
<hi>v. 38. Repent and be baptized every
one of you in the name of Iesus Christ,</hi>
i. e. Believe <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
take him as such for your Lord and
King, and reform your Lives by a
sincere Resolution of Obedience to his
Laws.</p>
               <p>Thus we have an account of the
Omissions in the Records of <hi>Matters
of Fact</hi> in the New Testament. But
will the <hi>Unmasker</hi> say, that the
preaching of those Articles, that he
has given us as necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
to make a Man a Christian, was
part of <hi>those Matters of Fact,</hi> which
have been omitted in the History of
the New Testament? Can any one
think that <hi>the Corruption and Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of humane Nature, with the true
Original of it (the Defection of our first
Parents) the Propagation of Sin and
Mortality, our Restoration and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
by Christ's blood, the Eminency
and Excellency of his Priesthood, the
Efficacy of his Death, the full Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thereby made to divine Iustice,
and his being made an all-sufficient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for Sin, our Iustification by
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107142:151"/>
Christ's Righteousness, Election, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c. were all proposed, and that
too in the Sense of our Authors Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem,
by our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as Fundamental Articles of Faith,
necessary to be explicitely believed
by every Man, to make him a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
in all their Discourses to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
And yet that the inspired
Pen-men of those Histories every
where, left the mention of these Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Articles wholly out? This
would have been to have writ not a
<hi>concise,</hi> but an imperfect History of
<hi>all,</hi> that <hi>Iesus</hi> and his Apostles taught.</p>
               <p>What an account would it have
been of the Gospel, as it was first
preached and propagated, if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of the necessary Doctrines
of it were wholly left out, and a
Man could not find from one end to
the other of this whole History, that
Religion, which is necessary to be
believed to make a Man a Christian?
And yet this is that, which under the
Notion of their being <hi>concise,</hi> the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
would perswade us to have
been done by St. <hi>Luke</hi> and the other
Evangelists in their Histories. And
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:107142:152"/>
'tis no less than what he plainly says in
his <hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism,</hi>
p. 109. Where to aggravate
my Fault in passing by the Epistles,
and to shew the Necessity of search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them for Fundamentals, he in words
blames me; But in effect, condemns
the Sacred History contain'd in the
Gospels and the Acts. <hi>It is most
evident,</hi> says he, <hi>to any thinking Man,</hi>
that the Author of the Reasonableness
of Christianity <hi>purposely omits the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolary
Writings of the Apostles, because
they are fraught with other Fundamental
Doctrines besides that one which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
There we are instructed concerning
these grand heads of Christian Divinity.
Here</hi> i. e. in the Epistles, says he, <hi>There
are Discoveries concerning Satisfaction,</hi>
&amp;c. and in the close of his List of his
<hi>Grand Heads,</hi> as he calls them, some
whereof I have above set down out of
him, he adds, <hi>These are the Matters of
Faith contained in the Epistles.</hi> By all
which Expressions he plainly signifies,
that these, which he calls <hi>Fundamental
Doctrines,</hi> are none of those, we are
instructed in, in the Gospels and the
Acts; that they are not <hi>discover'd</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:107142:152"/>
nor <hi>contain'd</hi> in the historical Writings
of the Evangelists. Whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
that either our Saviour and his
Apostles did not propose them in their
Preachings to their unbelieving Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
or else, that the several faithful
Writers of their History, willfully, <hi>i. e.</hi>
unfaithfully, every where omitted
them in the account they have left
us of those Preachings; Which could
scarce possibly be done by them all,
and every where, without an actual
Combination amongst them to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the greatest and most material
parts of our Saviour's and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Discourses. For what else did
they, if all that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has
set down in his List be Fundamental
Doctrines; every one of them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to be believed to make
a Man a Christian; which our Saviour
and his Apostles every where preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make Men Christians; but yet
St. <hi>Luke</hi> and the other <hi>Evangelists,</hi> by
a very guilty, and unpardonable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseness,</hi>
every where omitted them;
and throughout their whole History
never once tell us, they were so much
as proposed; much less that they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:107142:153"/>
were those Articles, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
laboured to establish and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
Men of every where, before
they admitted them to Baptism? Nay,
the far greatest part of them the
History, they writ, does not any
where so much as once mention?
How after such an Imputation as this
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will clear himself from
laying by the four Gospels and the
Acts <hi>with contempt</hi> let him look; if
my not collecting Fundamentals out
of the Epistles had that Guilt in it.
For I never denied all the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Doctrines to be there; but
only said, that there they were not easie
to be found out; and distinguished
from Doctrines not Fundamental.
Whereas our good <hi>Vnmasker</hi> charges
the historical Books of the New
Testament with a total Omission of
the far greatest part of those Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Doctrines of Christianity,
which he says are absolutely necessary
to be believed to make a Man a
Christian.</p>
               <p>To convince the Reader what was
absolutely required to be believed to
make a Man a Christian, and thereby
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107142:153"/>
clear the holy Writers from the <hi>Unmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s
Slander, any one need but look a
little further into the History of the
Acts, and observe St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Method in
the Writing of it. In the beginning (as
we observed before) and in some few
other places, he sets down at large
the Discourses made by the Preachers
of Christianity to their unbelieving
Auditors. But in the Process of his
History, he generally contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to relate, what it was their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
drive at; what was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
they endeavour'd to convince
their unbelieving Hearers of, to make
them Believers. This we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
is never omitted. This is every
where set down. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> V. 42.
he tells us, that <hi>daily in the Temple,
and in every house the Apostles ceased
not to teach, and to preach IESUS
THE MESSIAH.</hi> The particulars
of their Discourses he omits, and the
Arguments they used to induce Men
to believe he omits: But never fails
to inform us carefully what it was the
Apostles <hi>taught and preach'd,</hi> and would
have Men believe. The account he
gives us of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching at
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:107142:154"/>
                  <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> is this: That <hi>three Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
Days he REASON'D with the
Iews out of the Scriptures, OPENING
and ALLEDGING that the Messiah
must needs have Suffer'd and risen again
from the Dead; and that Iesus was the
Messiah,</hi> Act. XVII. 2, 3. At <hi>Corinth,</hi>
That <hi>he REASON'D in the Synagogue
every Sabbath, and PERSWADED
the Iews and the Greeks, and TESTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIED
that Iesus was the Messiah.</hi>
XVIII. 4, 5. That Apollos <hi>mightily
convinced the Iews, SHEWING BY
THE SCRIPTURES that Iesus was
the Messiah,</hi> XVIII. 27.</p>
               <p>By these, and the like places, we
may be satisfied what it was that the
Apostles <hi>Taught</hi> and <hi>Preach'd,</hi> even
this one Proposition that <hi>Iesus was the
Messiah;</hi> For this was the sole Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
they <hi>reason'd</hi> about; this alone
they <hi>testified,</hi> and they <hi>shew'd out of
the Scriptures;</hi> and of this alone they
endeavour'd to <hi>convince</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> and
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that believed one God.
So that it is plain from hence, that
St. <hi>Luke</hi> omitted nothing, that the
Apostles <hi>Taught</hi> and <hi>Preach'd;</hi> none
of those Doctrines, that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:107142:154"/>
to <hi>convince</hi> Unbelievers of, to
make them Christians: Though he in
most places omitted, as was fit, the
Passages of Scripture which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
and the Arguments those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Preachers used to <hi>perswade</hi>
Men to believe and imbrace that
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Another convincing Argument, to
shew that St. <hi>Luke</hi> omitted none of
those Fundamental Doctrines which
the Apostles any where propos'd as
necessary to be believed, is from that
different account he gives us of their
Preaching in other places, and to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
otherwise dispos'd. Where the
Apostles had to do with Idolatrous
Heathens, who were not yet come
to the knowledge of the only true
God, there he tells us they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
also the Article of the one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
God, Maker of Heaven and
Earth: And this we find recorded in
him out of their Preaching to the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians,</hi>
Act. XIV. and to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
Act. XVII. In the later of
which St. <hi>Luke,</hi> to convince his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he out of <hi>conciseness</hi> omits
none of those Fundamental Articles,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107142:155"/>
that were any where propos'd by the
Preachers of the Gospel as necessary
to be believed to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
sets down not only the Article
of <hi>Iesus the Messiah,</hi> but that also of
the one invisible God, Creator of all
things, which (if any necessary one
might) this of all other Fundamental
Articles might by an Author, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
brevity, with the fairest excuse
have been omitted, as being implied
in that other of the <hi>Messiah ordained</hi>
by God. Indeed, in the Story of what
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> said at <hi>Lystra,</hi> the
Article of the <hi>Messiah</hi> is not mention'd.
Not that St. <hi>Luke</hi> omitted that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article, where the Apostles
taught it: But they having here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
their Preaching with that of the
one living God, they had not, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
time to proceed farther, and
propose to them what yet remain'd to
make them Christians: But they were,
by the instigation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> fallen
upon, and <hi>Paul</hi> stoned, before he could
come to open to them this other Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Article of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>This by the way shews the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
Mistake in his first Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107142:155"/>
                  <hi>p.</hi> 74. where he says (as he does
here again in his second Particular,
which we are now examining) that
<hi>believing Iesus to be the Messiah is the
first step to Christianity; and therefore
this, rather than any other, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to be believed by all those,
whom either our Saviour, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
invited to imbrace Christianity.</hi>
The contrary whereof appears here;
Where the Article of one God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in the first place, to those whose
Unbelief made such a proposal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
And therefore if his Reason
(which he uses again here, <hi>p.</hi> 76.) were
good, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Article of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> is expresly mention'd alone,
<hi>because it is a leading Article and makes
way for the rest,</hi> this Reason would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conclude for the Article of <hi>one
God:</hi> And that alone should be expresly
mentioned instead of the other. Since
as he argues for the other, <hi>p. 74. if
they did not believe this in the first
place, viz.</hi> That there was one God,
<hi>there could be no hopes that they would
attend unto any other Proposal relating to
the Christian Religion.</hi> The Vanity
and Falshood of which reasoning, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:107142:156"/>
That the Article of Jesus the Messiah
<hi>was</hi> every where <hi>propounded rather
than any other, because it was the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Article,</hi> we see in the History of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching to the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions more than one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
where more than one was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> though the first of
them was that <hi>leading Article</hi> of one
God, which if not received <hi>in the first
place, there could be no hope they would
attend to the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something the <hi>Unmasker</hi> would
make of this Argument of a <hi>leading
Article</hi> for want of a better, though
he knows not what. In his first <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
p. 74. he makes use of it to
shew, why there was but that one
Article propos'd by the first Preachers
of the Gospel, and how well that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
with him we have seen. For
this is Demonstration, that if there
were but that one propos'd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and the Apostles, there was
but that one necessary to be believed
to make Men Christians: Unless he
will impiously say that our Saviour
and the Apostles went about Preaching
to no purpose. For if they propos'd
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:107142:156"/>
not all that was necessary to make
Men Christians, 'twas in vain for them
to Preach, and others to Hear; if when
they heard and believ'd all that was
propos'd to them, they were not yet
Christians: For if any Article was
omitted in the Proposal, which was
necessary to make a Man a Christian,
though they believed all that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to them, they could not yet be
Christians; unless a Man can from an
Infidel become a Christian, without
doing what is necessary to make him
a Christian.</p>
               <p>Further, if his Argument of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>leading Article</hi> proves, that that
alone was propos'd, It is a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to give it as a Reason, why it
was <hi>set down alone,</hi> by the Historian
where it was not proposed alone by
the Preacher, but other necessary <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith were propos'd with it;</hi>
unless it can be true that this Article
of <hi>Iesus is the Messiah,</hi> was propos'd
alone by our Saviour and his Apostles,
because it was a <hi>leading Article,</hi> and
was mention'd alone in the History of
what they preach'd, because it was a
<hi>leading Article,</hi> though it were not
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:107142:157"/>
propos'd alone, but jointly with other
necessary <hi>matters of Faith.</hi> For this is
the use he makes here again, <hi>p.</hi> 76.
of his <hi>leading Article</hi> under his second
<hi>Particular,</hi> viz. To shew why the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
mention'd this necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
of <hi>Iesus the Messiah,</hi> alone, in
places where the Preachers of the
Gospel propos'd it not alone, but with
other necessary Articles. But in this
latter case it has no shew of a Reason
at all. It may be granted as reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
for the Teachers of any Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
not to go any farther, where
they see the first Article which they
propose is rejected, where the <hi>leading</hi>
Truth, on which all the rest depends,
is not received. But it can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at all for an Historian who writes
the History of these first Preachers,
to set down only the one first and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Article and omit all the rest, in
instances where more were not only
propos'd, but believed and imbraced,
and upon that the Hearers and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
admitted into the Church. 'Tis
not for Historians to put any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between leading or not leading
Articles; But if they will give a true
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:107142:157"/>
and useful account of the Religion,
whose Original they are writing, and
of the Converts made to it, they must
tell, not one, but all those necessary
Articles, upon assent to which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
were Baptized into that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and admitted into the Church.
Whoever says otherwise, accuses them
of falsifying the Story, misleading
the Readers, and giving a wrong
account of the Religion which they
pretend to teach the World, and
to preserve and propagate to future
Ages. This (if it were so) no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>conciseness</hi> could excuse or
palliate.</p>
               <p>There is yet remaining one Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
which were sufficient of it
self to convince us, that it was the sole
Article of Faith which was preach'd;
And that if there had been other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
necessary to be known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by Converts, they could not
upon any pretence of <hi>conciseness</hi> be
supposed to be omitted: And that is
the Commissions of those, that were
sent to Preach the Gospel. Which
since the Sacred Historians mention,
they cannot be suppos'd to leave out
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:107142:158"/>
any of the material and main Heads of
those Commissions.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Luke</hi> records it, <hi>Ch.</hi> IV. 43. that
our Saviour says of himself, <hi>I must go
unto the other Towns to tell the good
news of the Kingdom, for</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>upon
this Errand am I SENT.</hi> This
St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls simply <hi>Preaching.</hi> This
Preaching what it contain'd St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
tells us, <hi>Ch.</hi> IV. 23. <hi>And Iesus
went about all</hi> Galilee, <hi>teaching in their
Synagogues, and preaching the good news
of the Kingdom, and healing all manner
of Sickness, and all manner of Diseases
amongst the People.</hi> Here we have his
Commission, or End of his being sent,
and the Execution of it: Both termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
in this, that he declar'd the
good News that the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah</hi> was come; and gave them to
understand by the Miracles he did,
that he himself was he. Nor does
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> seem to affect such <hi>concise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
that he would have left it out,
if the Gospel had contained any other
Fundamental Parts, necessary to be
believed to make Men Christians. For
he here says, <hi>all manner of Sickness, and
all manner of Disease,</hi> when either of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:107142:158"/>
them might have been better left out,
than any necessary Article of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to make his History <hi>concise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We see what our Saviour was</hi> sent
<hi>for. In the next place, let us look
into the Commission he gave the
Apostles, when he</hi> sent <hi>them to Preach
the Gospel. We have it in the X. of
St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>in these words;</hi> Go not
into the way of the Gentiles, and into any
City of the Samaritans enter ye not.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the
house of Israel. And as ye go PREACH,
SAYING THE KINGDOM OF HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN
IS AT HAND. Heal the Sick,
cleanse the Lepers, raise the Dead, cast
out Devils: Freely have ye received
freely give. Provide neither Gold, nor
Silver, nor Brass in your Purses; nor
Scrip in your journey; neither two Coats,
neither Shooes nor yet Staves (for the
Workman is worthy of his meat). And
into whatsoever City or Town ye shall
enter, enquire who in it is worthy, and
there abide till ye go thence. And when
ye come into any house salute it. And
if the house be worthy, let your peace
come upon it: But if it be not worthy,
let your peace return to you. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:107142:159"/>
shall not receive you, nor hear
your words; When ye depart out of that
house or City, shake off the dust of
your feet. Verily, I say unto you, It
shall be more tolerable for the Land of
Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of
judgment, than for that City. Behold,
I send you forth as Sheep in the midst
of Wolves: Be ye therefore wise as
Serpents, and harmless as Doves. But
beware of Men, for they will deliver
you up to the Councils, and they will
scourge you in their Synagogues. And
ye shall be brought before Governours,
and Kings for my sake, for a Testimony
against them and the Gentiles. But when
they deliver you up, take no thought
how or what ye shall speak; for it shall
be given you in that same hour what ye
shall speak. For it is not ye that speak,
but the Spirit of your Father which
speaketh in you. And the Brother shall
deliver up the Brother to Death, and
the Father the Child: and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall rise up against the Parents,
and cause them to be put to Death.
And ye shall be hated of all men for
my Name's sake: But he that endureth
to the end shall be saved. But when
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:107142:159"/>
they persecute you in this City, flee ye
into another: For verily I say unto
you, ye shall not have gone over the
Cities of Israel till the Son of man
be come. The Disciple is not above
his Master, nor the Servant above his
Lord. It is enough for the Disciple
that he be as his Master, and the
Servant as his Lord. If they have
called the Master of the house Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,
how much more shall they call
them of his houshold? Fear them not
therefore: For there is nothing covered,
that shall not be revealed; and hid,
that shall not be known. What I tell
you in darkness, that speak ye in light:
And what ye hear in the ear, that preach
ye upon the house tops. And fear not
them which kill the Body, but are not
able to kill the Soul: But rather fear
him which is able to destroy both Soul
and body in Hell. Are not two Sparrows
sold for a farthing; And one of them
shall not fall on the ground without your
Father? But the very hairs of your
head are all numbred. Fear ye not
therefore, ye are of more value than
many Sparrows. Whosoever therefore
shall confess me before men, him will I
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:107142:160"/>
confess also before my Father which is in
Heaven. But whosoever shall deny me
before men, him will I also deny before my
Father which is in Heaven. Think not
that I am come to send peace on Earth;
I came not to send peace but a sword.
For I am come to set a man at variance
against his Father, and the Daughter
against her Mother, and the Daughter-in
Law against the Mother in Law.
And a man's foes shall be they of his
own houshold. He that loveth Father
and Mother more than me, is not worthy
of me. And he that loveth Son or
Daughter more than me, is not worthy
of me. And he that taketh not his Cross
and followeth after me, is not worthy of
me: He that findeth his life shall lose
it: And he that loseth his life for my
sake shall find it. He that receiveth
you receiveth me, and he that receiveth
me receiveth him that sent me. He that
receiveth a Prophet in the name of a
Prophet, shall receive a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
and he that receiveth a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, shall receive a righteous mans
reward. And whosoever shall give to
drink unto one of these little ones a cup
of cold water only, in the name of a
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:107142:160"/>
Disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall
in no wise lose his reward. And it
came to pass when Iesus had made an
end of Commanding his twelve Disciples.</p>
               <p>This is the Commission our Saviour
gave the Apostles when he sent them
abroad to recover, and save <hi>the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st
Sheep of the house of Israel.</hi> And will
any of the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s <hi>intelligent and
observing Men</hi> say, that the <hi>History of
the Scripture</hi> is so <hi>concise, that any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,</hi>
any essential, any material, nay
any parts at all of the Apostles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<hi>are here omitted by the Sacred
Penman?</hi> This Commission is set down
so at full, and so particularly, that S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
who was one of them to whom
it was given, seems not to have left
out one word of all, that our Saviour
gave them in charge. And it is so
large, even to every particular Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of their Instructions, that I doubt
not but my citing so much, <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi>
out of the Sacred Text, will
here again be troublesome to the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker.</hi>
But whether he will venture
again to call it <hi>tedious,</hi> must be as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Caution happen to have the
better on't. Can any one who reads
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:107142:161"/>
this Commission, unless he hath the
Brains as well as the Brow of an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker,</hi>
alledge that the <hi>conciseness</hi> of
the History of the Scripture has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from us those Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which our Saviour and his
Apostles Preach'd; but the Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
thought fit by consent, for
unconceivable Reasons, to leave out in
the Narrative they give us, of those
Preachings? This Passage here wholly
confuteth that. They could Preach
nothing, but what they were sent to
Preach: And that we see is contain'd
in these few words, <hi>Preach, saying the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand. Heal
the Sick, cleanse the Lepers, raise the
Dead, cast out Devils,</hi> i. e. Acquaint
them, that the Kingdom of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
is come, and let them know by
the Miracles, you do in my Name,
that I am that King and Deliverer
they expect. If there were any other
necessary Articles, that were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
for the saving of the <hi>lost Sheep</hi>
they were sent to, can one think that
St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who sets down so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely
every Circumstance of their
Commission, would have omitted the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:107142:161"/>
most important, and material of it?
He was an ear Witness, and one that
was sent; And so (without supposing
him inspired) could not be misled by
the short account he might receive
from others, who by their own, or
others forgetfulness might have drop'd
those other Fundamental Articles,
that the Apostles were order'd to
Preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The very like account St.</hi> Luke <hi>gives
us of our Saviours Commission to the
Seventy,</hi> Ch. <hi>X.</hi> 1,—16. After these
things the Lord appointed other seventy
also, and sent them two and two before
his face into every city and place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he himself would come. Therefore
said he unto them, The harvest truly is
great, but the labourers are few: Pray
ye therefore the Lord of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rvest,
that he would send forth labourers into
his harvest. Go your ways: behold, I
send you forth as Lambs among Wolves.
Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shooes:
and salute no man by the way. And
into whatsoever house ye enter, first say,
Peace be to this house. And if the son
of peace be there, your peace shall rest
upon it; if not, it shall return to you
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:107142:162"/>
again. And in the same house remain
eating and drinking such things as they
give: for the labourer is worthy of his
hire. Go not from house to house.
And into whatsoever city ye enter and
they receive you, eat such things as are
set before you. And heal the sick that
are therein, and SAY VNTO THEM,
THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS
COME NIGH VNTO YOV. But
in whatsoever city ye enter, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you not, go your ways out into the
streets of the same and say, Even the
very dust of your city which cleaveth
on us, we do wipe off against you: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
be ye sure of this, that the
Kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.
But I say unto you, that it shall be more
tolerable in that day for Sodom than for
that city. Wo unto thee Chorazin, Wo
unto thee Bethsaida: For if the mighty
works had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
which have been done in you, they had a
great while ago repented, sitting in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
and ashes. But it shall be more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for Tyre and Sidon at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than for you. And thou Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,
which art exalted to Heaven,
shalt be thrust down to Hell. He that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:107142:162"/>
heareth you, heareth me: and he that
despiseth you despiseth me: and he that
despiseth me, despiseth him that sent
me.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour's Commission here to
the Seventy, whom he sent to Preach,
is so exactly conformable to that
which he had before given to the
Twelve Apostles, that there needs
but this one thing more to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
to convince any one, that
they were sent to convert their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to this sole belief, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the <hi>Messiah</hi> was come, and
that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And that
the Historians of the New Testament
are not so <hi>concise</hi> in their account of
this Matter, that they would have
omitted any other necessary Articles
of Belief, that had been given the
Seventy in Commission. That which
I mean is, the <hi>Kingdom of the Messiah</hi>
is twice mentioned in it to be come,
<hi>v.</hi> 9. &amp; 11. If there were other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
given them by our Saviour to
propose to their Hearers, St. <hi>Luke</hi> must
be very fond of this one Article, when
for <hi>conciseness</hi> sake, leaving out the
other Fundamental Articles that our
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:107142:163"/>
Saviour gave them in charge to
Preach, he repeats this more than
once.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Third Particular,
<hi>p.</hi> 76. begins thus; <hi>This also must be
thought of, that though there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts and members of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, yet they do not all occur
in any one place of Scripture.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is in it (whether owing to his
Will, or Understanding, I shall not
enquire) that the <hi>Unmasker</hi> always
delivers himself in doubtful, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
terms. It had been as easie
for him to have said, There are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Articles of the Christian Faith,
necessary to be believed to make a
Man a Christian, as to say (as he
does here) <hi>There are several parts and
members of the Christian Faith.</hi> But as
an evidence of the clearness of his
Notions, or the fairness of his Arguing,
he always rests in generals. <hi>There
are,</hi> I grant, <hi>several parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Christian Faith,</hi> which do
no more <hi>occur in any one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
than the whole New Testament
can be said to <hi>occur in any one place
of Scripture.</hi> For every Proposition
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:107142:163"/>
deliver'd in the New Testament for
Divine Revelation, is <hi>a part and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Christian Faith.</hi> But 'tis
not those <hi>parts and members of the
Christian Faith</hi> we are speaking of;
But only such <hi>parts and members of
the Christian Faith,</hi> as are absolutely
necessary to be believed by every
Man, before he can be a Christian.
And in that sense I deny his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That they do not
occur in any one place of Scripture.
For they do all occur in that first Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. II. 11. by which
Three Thousand were at that time
brought into the Church, and that in
these words, <hi>Therefore let all the house
of Israel know assuredly, that God hath
made that same Iesus, whom you have
Crucified, Lord and Christ. Repent and
be baptized every one of you in the Name
of Iesus Christ.</hi> Here is the Doctrine
of Jesus the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> and of
<hi>Repentance</hi> propos'd, to those who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
believe one God; Which I say,
are all the parts of the Christian
Faith necessary to be received to
make a Man a Christian. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> does here, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:107142:164"/>
more is required, is to beg, not prove
the Question.</p>
               <p>If he disputes this Collection of
mine out of that Sermon of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
I will give him a more authentick
Collection of the necessary parts of
the Christian Faith from an Author
that he will not question. Let him
look into <hi>Act. 20. 20, &amp;c.</hi> and there he
will find St. <hi>Paul</hi> saying thus to the
Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whom he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his last leave of, with an Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that he should never see them
again. <hi>I have kept back nothing that
was profitable unto you. But have
shew'd you, and have taught you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and from house to house, testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both to the Iews, and also to the
Greeks, repentance towards God, and
Faith towards our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
If St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew what was necessary
to make a Christian, here it is: Here
he (if he knew how to do it, for 'tis
plain from his words he designed to
do it) has put it together. But there
is a greater yet than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
has brought all the parts of Faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation into one place,
I mean our Saviour himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> XVII.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:107142:164"/>
13. in these words. <hi>This is Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that they might know thee the only
true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou
hast sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the</hi> Unmasker <hi>goes on.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when in some places, only one
single part of the Christian Faith is
made mention of, as necessarily to be
imbrac'd in order to Salvation, we must
be careful not to take it alone, but to
supply it from several other Places,
which make mention of other necessary
and indispensable points of belief. I
will give the Reader a plain instance of
this, <hi>Rom. X.</hi> 9. If thou shalt believe
in thy heart, that God hath rais'd him
(<hi>i. e.</hi> the Lord Iesus) from the dead
thou shalt be saved. Here one Article
of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the belief of Christ's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
(because it is of so great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in Christianity) is only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd:
But all the rest must be supposed,
because they are mention'd in other
places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> One would wonder that any
one conversant in holy Writ, with ever
so little Attention; much more that
an Expounder of the Scriptures should
so mistake the sense and stile of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:107142:165"/>
Scripture. Believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the
<hi>Messiah</hi> with a lively Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> as I
have shew'd, taking him to be our
King, with a sincere submission to the
Laws of his Kingdom, is all that is
required to make a Man a Christian;
for this includes repentance too. The
believing him therefore to be the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> is very often, and with great
reason, put both for Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
too; which are sometimes set
down singly, where one is put for
both, as implying the other: And
sometimes they are both mention'd; and
then Faith, as contradistinguish'd to
Repentance, is taken for a simple As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the mind to this Truth that
<hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Now this Faith
is variously expressed in Scripture.</p>
               <p>There are some particulars in the
History of our Saviour allow'd to be
so peculiarly appropriated to the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
such incommunicable marks of
him, that to believe them of <hi>Iesus</hi>
of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was in effect the same,
as to believe him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and so are put to express it. The
principal of these is his Resurrection
from the dead, which being the great:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:107142:165"/>
and demonstrative Proof of his being
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> 'tis not at all strange, that
the believing his Resurrection should
be put for believing him to be the
<hi>Messiah:</hi> Since the declaring his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
was a declaring him to be
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues,
<hi>Act.</hi> XIII. 32, 33. <hi>We declare unto
you good tidings,</hi> or <hi>we preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to you,</hi> for so the word signifies,
<hi>how that the promise that was made
unto the Fathers, God hath fullfilled the
same unto us their children, in that he
hath raised up Iesus again.</hi> The force
of which Argument lies in this, that
if <hi>Iesus</hi> was raised from the dead,
then he was certainly the <hi>Messiah:</hi>
And thus the promise of the <hi>Messiah</hi>
was fullfilled in raising <hi>Iesus</hi> from
the dead. The like Argument St. <hi>Paul</hi>
useth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 17. <hi>If Christ be
not raised, your faith is vain, you are
yet in your Sins.</hi> i. e. If <hi>Iesus</hi> be not
risen from the dead, he is not the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> your believing it is in vain,
and you will receive no benefit by
that Faith. And so likewise from
the same Argument of his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> proves him
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:107142:166"/>
to be the <hi>Messiah, Act.</hi> XVII. 2, 3.
<hi>And</hi> Paul, <hi>as his manner was, went
into</hi> the Synagogue, <hi>and three Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
Days reasoned with</hi> the Jews <hi>out
of the Scriptures, opening and alledging
that the Messiah must needs have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and risen again from the dead: And
that this Iesus whom I preach unto you
is the Messiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The necessary Connection of these
two, that if he rose from the dead he
was the <hi>Messiah;</hi> And if he rose
not from the dead he was not the
<hi>Messiah;</hi> The chief Priest and Pharisees,
that had prosecuted him to Death,
understood very well, who therefore
<hi>came together unto</hi> Pilate <hi>saying, Sir,
we remember that that deceiver said,
whilst he was yet alive, after three
days I will rise again. Command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Sepulchre be made sure unto
the third day, least his disciples come
by night and steal him away, and say
unto the people, he is risen from the
dead: So the last error shall be worse
than the first.</hi> The <hi>error</hi> they here
speak of, 'tis plain, was the opinion,
that he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> To stop
that Belief, which his Miracles had
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:107142:166"/>
procured him amongst the People,
they had got him put to Death:
But if after that, it should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that he rose again from the
dead, this demonstration that he was
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> would but establish what
they had laboured to destroy, by his
Death: Since no one, who believed
his Resurrection, could doubt of his
being the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not at all therefore to be
wonder'd, that his Resurrection, his
Ascension, his Rule and Dominion,
and his coming to judge the quick
and the dead, which are Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
marks of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
peculiarly to him, should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Scripture be put alone as
sufficient descriptions of the <hi>Messiah;</hi>
And the believing them of him put
for believing him to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
Thus, <hi>Acts</hi> X. our Saviour in <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Discourse to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> when he
brought him the Gospel, is describ'd
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> by his Miracles,
Death, Resurrection, Dominion, and
coming to judge the quick and the
dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:107142:167"/>
These, (which in my <hi>Reasonableness
of Christianity,</hi> I have upon this
ground taken the Liberty to call <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
Articles</hi>) where they are set
alone for the Faith to which Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is promis'd, plainly signifie the
believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that
Fundamental Article which has the
promise of Life; And so give no
Foundation at all for what the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
says, in these words. <hi>Here
one Article of Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>The belief of
Christ's Resurrection (because it is of
so great Importance in Christianity) is
only mention'd; but all the rest must be
suppos'd, because they are mention'd in
other places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If all the rest be of absolute,
and indispensible Necessity to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian, <hi>all
the rest</hi> are every one of them of
equal <hi>importance.</hi> For things of equal
Necessity to any end, are of equal
Importance to that end. But here
the Truth forced its way unawares
from the <hi>Unmasker.</hi> Our Saviour's
Resurrection, for the reason I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
is truly <hi>of great importance in
Christianity;</hi> so great, that his being
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:107142:167"/>
or not being the <hi>Messiah</hi> stands or
falls with it: So that these two <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Articles</hi> are inseparable, and
in effect make but one. For since
that time, believe one and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
both; Deny one of them and
you can believe neither. If the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
can shew me any <hi>one</hi> of the
Articles in his List, which is not <hi>of</hi>
this <hi>great importance</hi> mention'd alone
with a promise of Salvation for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it, I will grant him to have
some colour for what he says here.
But where is to be found in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
any such Expression as this; If
thou shalt believe with thy heart <hi>the
corruption and degeneracy of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
thou shalt be saved? or the
like? This place therefore out of the
<hi>Romans</hi> makes not for, but against
his List of necessary Articles. One
of them alone he cannot shew me
any where set down, with a <hi>Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the rest, as having Salvation
promis'd to it. Though it be true,
that that one which alone is absolutely
necessary to be superadded to the
Belief of one God, is in divers places
differently expressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:107142:168"/>
That which he subjoins, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of what he had said, is a
farther Proof of this. <hi>And consequently,</hi>
says he, <hi>if we would give an impartial
account of our belief, we must consult
those places: And they are not all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but dispersed here and there:
Wherefore we must look them out, and
acquaint our selves with the several
particulars, which make up our belief,
and render it entire and consummate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Never was Man constanter
to a loose way of talking. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is only about Articles necessary
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
And here he talks of the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
particulars, which make up our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and render it entire and consummate;</hi>
Confounding as he did before <hi>essential</hi>
and <hi>integral</hi> parts, which it seems he
cannot distinguish. Our Faith is true
and saving, when it is such as God by
the new Covenant requires it to be:
But it is not <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>consummate,</hi>
till we explicitely believe all the
Truths contained in the Word of
God. For the whole Revelation of
Truth in the Scripture, being the
proper and entire Object of Faith.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:107142:168"/>
Our Faith cannot be <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
till it be adequate to its proper
Object, which is the whole divine
Revelation contain'd in the Scripture:
And so to make our Faith <hi>entire</hi> and
<hi>consummate,</hi> we must <hi>not look out those
places,</hi> which he says, <hi>are not all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
To talk of <hi>looking out,</hi> and
culling of places is Nonsense, where
the whole Scripture alone can <hi>make
up our belief, and render it entire and
consummate:</hi> Which no one, I think,
can hope for in this frail State of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Error. To make the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> speak Sense, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and to the
purpose, here, we must understand him
thus. <hi>That if we will give an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Account</hi> of the Articles, that are
necessary to be believed to make a
Man a Christian, <hi>we must consult those
places</hi> where they are, <hi>for they are not
all together, but dispersed here and there,
wherefore we must look them out,</hi> and
acquaint our selves with the several
particulars <hi>which make up</hi> the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles of <hi>our belief,</hi> and will
render a Catalogue of them <hi>entire</hi> and
<hi>consummate.</hi> If his Supposition be
true, I grant his Method to be reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:107142:169"/>
and upon that I join issue with
him. Let him thus <hi>give us an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Account of our belief:</hi> Let him <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us with the several particulars,
which make up</hi> a Christian's <hi>belief, and
render it entire and consummate.</hi> Till
he has done this, let him not talk
thus in the air of a Method, that
will not do: Let him not reproach
me, as he does, for not taking a
<hi>course,</hi> by which he himself cannot
do, what he reviles me for failing in.
<hi>But our hasty Author,</hi> says he, <hi>took
another course, and thereby deceived
himself and unhappily deceived others.</hi>
If it be so, I desire the <hi>Unmasker</hi> to
<hi>take the course</hi> he proposes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
undeceive me, and others; and
<hi>acquaint us with the several particulars
which make up</hi> a Christian's <hi>belief, and
render it entire and consummate.</hi> For
I am willing to be undeceived: But
till he has done that, and shewn us
by the success of it, that his <hi>course</hi>
is better, he cannot blame us for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
that <hi>course we have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I come now to his Fourth and last par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
p. 78. <hi>which he says,</hi> is the main
Answer to the Objection, <hi>and therefore I
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:107142:169"/>
shall set it down in his own words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
as it stands together.</hi> This, <hi>says he,</hi>
must be born in our Minds, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
was erected by degrees, according
to that Prediction and Promise of
our Saviour, that the Spirit should
teach them all things, <hi>Joh. XIV.</hi>
26. and that he should guide them into
all truth, <hi>Joh. XVI. 13. viz.</hi> after his
departure and ascension, when the Holy
Ghost was to be sent in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to enlighten Mens minds, and to
discover to them the great Mysteries of
Christianity. This is to be noted by us,
as that which gives great light in the
present case. The discovery of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Gospel was gradual. It
was by certain steps that Christianity
climbed to its heighth. We are not to
think then that all the necessary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Christian Religion were
clearly publish'd to the World in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time. Not but that all that were
necessary for that time were publish'd:
But some which were necessary for the
succeeding one were not then discover'd
or at least not fully. They had ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
no belief, before Christ's Death and
Resurrection, of those Substantial Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:107142:170"/>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> that he should die and rise
again; But we read in the Acts, and in
the Epistles, that these were formal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith afterwards, and are ever
since necessary to compleat the Christian
belief. So as to other great Verities,
the Gospel increased by degrees, and was
not perfect at once. Which furnishes us
with a reason why most of the choicest
and sublimest truths of Christianity are
to be met with in the Epistles of the
Apostles, they being such Doctrines as
were not clearly discover'd and open'd
in the Gospels and the Acts. <hi>Thus far
the</hi> Vnmasker.</p>
               <p>I thought hitherto, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace in Christ Jesus had
been but one, immutably the same:
But our <hi>Vnmasker</hi> here makes two,
or I know not how many. For I
cannot tell how to conceive, that the
Conditions of any Covenant should
be changed, and the Covenant remain
the same: Every change of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in my apprehension makes a
new and another Covenant. We
are not to think, says the <hi>Vnmasker,
That all the necessary Doctrines of the
Christian Religion were clearly publish'd
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:107142:170"/>
to the World in our Saviour's time; not
but that all that were necessary for that
time were publish'd: But some which
were necessary for the Succeeding one, were
not then discover'd; or at least not fully.
Answ.</hi> The <hi>Unmasker,</hi> constant to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
speaks here doubtfully, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell whether he should say that the
Articles necessary to Succeeding times,
were discover'd in our Saviour's time,
or no: And therefore, that he may
provide himself a retreat, in the doubt
he is in, he says, <hi>they were not clearly
publish'd;</hi> they <hi>were not then discover'd,
or at least not fully.</hi> But we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to pull off his Mask, and to
that purpose.</p>
               <p>1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. I ask him how he can tell, that
all the necessary Doctrines were <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
published</hi> or <hi>in part discover'd;</hi>
for an obscure publishing, a Discovery
in part, is opposed to, and intimated in
<hi>not clearly published, not fully discover'd.</hi>
And if a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Discovery be all
that he denies to them, I ask</p>

               <p>Which those Fundamental Articles are,

               <head>XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>Whether there are any Articles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make a
Man a Christian, that were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
at all in our Saviour's time,
and which they are.</p>
               <p>If he cannot shew these distinctly,
it is plain he talks at random about
them: But he has no clear and distinct
conception of those that were publish'd,
or not publish'd; clearly or obscurely
discover'd, in our Saviour's time. It
was necessary for him to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for those his pretended neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Articles, which are not to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound any where propos'd in the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:107142:171"/>
Preaching of our Saviour and his
Apostles to their yet Unbelieving Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors;
And therefore he says, <hi>We are
not to think all the necessary Doctrines
of the Christian Religion were clearly
published to the World in our Saviour's
time.</hi> But he barely says it, without
giving any Reason, why <hi>we are not to
think so.</hi> It is enough that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to his Hypothesis. He says <hi>we
are not to think so,</hi> and we are presently
bound not <hi>to think so.</hi> Else from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man, that did not usurp an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over our Thoughts, it would
have requir'd some Reason to make
them think, that something more was
requir'd to make a Man a Christian
after than in our Saviour's time. For,
as I take it, it is not a very probable,
much less a self-evident Proposition, to
be received without Proof, That there
was something <hi>necessary for that time,</hi>
to make a Man a Christian, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more that was <hi>necessary</hi> to make
a Man a Christian in the <hi>succeeding
time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, since this great Master
says <hi>we ought to think so,</hi> let us in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
think so as well as we can; till
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:107142:172"/>
he vouchsafes to give us some Reason
to think, that there was more requir'd
to be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in the succeeding time, than in
our Saviour's. This, instead of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
does but increase the Difficulty:
For if more were necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian after
our Saviour's time, than was during
his life; how comes it, that no more
was propos'd by the Apostles in their
Preaching to Unbelievers for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them Christians, after our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Death, than there was before:
Even this one Article, that he was the
<hi>Messiah?</hi> For I desire the <hi>Unmasker</hi> to
shew me any of those other Articles
mentioned in his List (except the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
and Ascension of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
which were intervening Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact, evidencing him to be the
<hi>Messiah</hi>) that were propos'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
after our Saviour's time to their
Unbelieving Hearers, to make them
Christians. This one Doctrine, that
<hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was that, which
was propos'd in our Saviour's time to
be believed, as necessary to make a
Man a Christian: The same Doctrine
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:107142:172"/>
was likewise what was propos'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
in the Preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to Unbelievers, to make them
Christians.</p>
               <p>I grant this was more <hi>clearly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
after than in our Saviour's time;
But in both of them it was all that was
propos'd to the Believers of one God,
to make them Christians. Let him
shew, that there were any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in or after our Saviour's time
to be believed, to make Unbelievers
Christians. If he means by <hi>necessary
Articles published to the World,</hi> the
other Doctrines contain'd in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
I grant they are all of them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Articles to be believed by every
Christian, as far as he understands
them. But I deny, that they were
propos'd to those they were writ to,
as necessary to make them Christians,
for this demonstrative Reason: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were Christians already.
For Example, many Doctrines proving,
and explaining, and giving a farther
Light into the Gospel, are publish'd
in the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and
<hi>Thessalonians.</hi> These are all of Divine
Authority, and none of them may be
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:107142:173"/>
disbelieved by any one who is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
But yet what was propos'd or
publish'd to both the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> to make them Christians,
was only this Doctrine that <hi>Iesus</hi> was
the <hi>Messiah:</hi> As may be seen, <hi>Act.</hi> XVII.
and XVIII. This then was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
necessary to make men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in our Saviour's time; And this
the only Doctrine necessary to make
Unbelievers Christians after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time. The only difference was,
that it was more clearly propos'd after
than before his Ascension: The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof has been sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd.
But any other Doctrine but
this, propos'd clearly or obscurely, in or
after our Saviour's time, as necessary
to be believed to make Unbelievers
Christians, That remains yet to be
shewn.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Unmasker</hi> speaks of the
Doctrines that were necessary for the
<hi>succeeding time</hi> after our Saviour, he
is in doubt whether he should say they
were, or were not <hi>discover'd</hi> in our
Saviour's time; and how far they
were then <hi>discover'd:</hi> And therefore
he says, <hi>some of them were not then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:107142:173"/>
or at least not fully.</hi> We must
here excuse the doubtfulness of his
talking concerning the discovery of
his other necessary Articles. For how
could he say they were discover'd, or
not discover'd, clearly or obscurely,
fully or not fully, when he does not
yet know them all, nor can tell us,
what those necessary Articles are? If
he does know them let him give us a
List of them, and then we shall see
easily whether they were at all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
or discover'd in our Saviour's
time. If there are some of them, that
were not at all discover'd in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time, let him speak it out, and
leave shifting: And if some of those,
that were <hi>not necessary for our Saviour's
time,</hi> but <hi>for the succeeding one</hi> only
were yet discover'd in our Saviour's
time, why were they not necessary to
be believed in that time? But the truth
is, he knows not what these Doctrines
necessary for Succeeding times are,
and therefore can say nothing positive
about their Discovery. And for those
that he has set down, as soon as he
shall name any one of them, to be of
the number of those <hi>not necessary for
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:107142:174"/>
our Saviour's time,</hi> but <hi>necessary for the
Succeeding one,</hi> it will presently appear,
either that it was discover'd in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time; And then it was as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for his time as the Succeeding: Or
else that it was not discover'd in his
time, nor to several Converts after his
time, before they were made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
And therefore it was no more
necessary to be believed to make a Man
a Christian in the Succeeding, than it
was in our Saviour's time. However,
general Positions and Distinctions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Foundation, serve for shew, and
to beguile unwary and inattentive
Readers.</p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Having thus minded him that
the Question is about Articles of Faith
necessary to be explicitly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed to make a Man a Christian;
I then, in the next place, demand of
him to tell me,</p>

               <p>Those that he instances in of <hi>Christ's
Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> will not help
him one jot: For they are not new
Doctrines revealed, new Mysteries
discovered; but Matters of Fact, which
happen'd to our Saviour in their due
time, to compleat in him the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
and Predictions of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
and demonstrate him to be the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
promised. These are recorded
of him by the Spirit of God in holy
Writ; but are no more necessary to be
believed to make a Man a Christian,
than any other part of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
but as far as they have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Connexion with his being the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> and cannot be denied without
denying him to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> And
therefore this Article of his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
(which supposes his Death) and
such other Propositions as are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
with his being the <hi>Messiah,</hi> are,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:107142:175"/>
as they very well may be, put for his
being the <hi>Messiah;</hi> and as I have
shew'd, propos'd to be believed in the
place of it.</p>
               <p>All that is reveal'd in Scripture has
a consequential necessity of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by all those, to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd:
Because it is of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
one part as much as another.
And in this sense, all the Divine Truths
in the inspired Writings are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
and necessary to be believed.
But then this will destroy our <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>'s
select Number of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Articles: And <hi>the choicest and
sublimest Truths of Christianity,</hi> which
he tells us, <hi>are to be met with in the
Epistles,</hi> will not be more necessary to
be believed, than any, which he may
think the commonest or meanest
Truths in any of the Epistles or the
Gospels. Whatsoever part of Divine
Revelation, whether reveal'd before,
or in, or after our Saviour's time;
whether it contain (according to the
distinction of our <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s nice pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late)
<hi>choice</hi> or common; <hi>sublime</hi> or
not sublime Truths; is necessary to be
believed by every one, to whom it is
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:107142:175"/>
propos'd, as far as he under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tands, what
is propos'd. But God by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
has entred into a Covenant of Grace
with Mankind; a Covenant of Faith,
instead of that of Works, wherein some
Truths are absolutely necessary to be
explicitly believed by them to make
Men Christians; and therefore those
Truths are necessary to be known,
and consequently necessary to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to them to make them Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
This is peculiar to them to
make Men Christians. For all Men,
as Men, are under a necessary obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to believe what God proposes to
them to be believed: But there being
certain distinguishing Truths, which
belong to the Covenant of the Gospel,
which if Men know not, they cannot
be Christians; and they being some
of them such as cannot be known
without being propos'd; those and
those only are the necessary Doctrines
of Christianity I speak of; without a
knowledge of, and assent to which, no
Man can be a Christian.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to a clear deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

               <head>XLV.</head>
               <p>What they are? that we may see why
those rather than any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the New Testament, are
necessary to be propos'd to every
Man to make him a Christian; And
if they are not every one propos'd to
him, and assented to by him, he
cannot be a Christian.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vnmasker</hi> makes a great noise,
and hopes to give his unwary, though
well-meaning Readers, odd Thoughts,
and strong Impressions against my
Book, by declaiming against my <hi>lank
Faith,</hi> and my <hi>narrowing</hi> of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to one Article; which, as he says,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:107142:177"/>
is the next way to reduce it to <hi>none.</hi>
But when it is consider'd, it will be
found, that 'tis he that narrows Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
The <hi>Unmasker,</hi> as if he were
Arbiter and Dispenser of the Oracles
of God, takes upon him to single out
some Texts of Scripture; and, where
the words of Scripture will not serve
his turn, to impose on us his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
and Deductions as necessary
Articles of Faith; which is in Effect
to make them of equal Authority
with the unquestionable Word of God.
And thus, partly in the words of the
Scripture, and partly in words of his
own, he makes a Set of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<hi>with an Exclusion</hi> of all the other
Truths deliver'd, by the Spirit of God
in the Bible: Though all the rest be
of the same Divine Authority, and
Original; and ought therefore all
equally, as far as they are understood,
by every Christian to be believed. I
tell him, and I desire him to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it: God has no where given
him an Authority thus to garble the
inspired Writings of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Every part of it is his Word,
and ought every part of it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:107142:177"/>
by every Christian Man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as God shall inable him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. It ought not to be narrowed
to the Cut of the <hi>Vnmasker</hi>'s peculiar
System: 'Tis a Presumption of the
highest Nature, for him thus to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
according to his own Phancy to
establish a Set of Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
This is to diminish the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Word of God, to set up his
own; and create a reverence to his
System, from which the several parts
of Divine Revelations are to receive
their Weight, Dignity and Authority.
Those Passages of Holy Writ which
suit with that, are <hi>Fundamental, Choice,
Sublime</hi> and <hi>Necessary:</hi> The rest of the
Scripture (as of no great moment) is
not Fundamental, is not necessary to
be believed, may be neglected, or must
be tortur'd to comply with an Analogy
of Faith of his own making. But
though he pretend to a certain Set of
Fundamentals; yet to shew the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and Impudence of that pretence,
he cannot tell us which they are; and
therefore in vain contends for a Creed
he knows not, and is yet no where.
He neither does, and which is more, I
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:107142:178"/>
tell him he never can give us a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Fundamentals gather'd
upon his Principles out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with the rejection of all the rest
as not Fundamental. He does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the difference there is between
what is necessary to be believed by
every Man to make him a Christian,
and what is requir'd to be believed by
every Christian. The first of these
is what by the Covenant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
is necessary to be known, and
consequently to be propos'd to every
Man to make him a Christian: The
latter is no less than the whole Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of God; all the Divine Truths
contain'd in Holy Scripture; which
every Christian Man is under a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to believe, so far as it shall please
God upon his serious and constant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to enlighten his Mind to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them.</p>
               <p>The Preaching of our Saviour and
his Apostles, has sufficiently taught
us what is necessary to be propos'd to
every Man to make him a Christian.
He that believes him to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<hi>Messiah,</hi> takes <hi>Iesus</hi> for his King,
and repenting of his former Sins, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:107142:178"/>
resolves to live for the future in
obedience to his Laws is a Subject of
his Kingdom, is a Christian. If he
be not, I desire the <hi>Unmasker</hi> to tell
me, what more is requisite to make
him so. Till he does that, I rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that this is all that was at
first, and is still necessary to make a
Man a Christian.</p>
               <p>This, though it be contain'd in a
few words, and those not hard to be
understood; though it be in one vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
act of the Mind relinquishing
all irregular Courses, and submitting
it self to the rule of him, whom God
had sent to be our King, and promised
to be our Saviour; Yet it having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Race of Mankind from
the First Man <hi>Adam</hi> to the End of the
World, it being a Contrivance, wherein
God has displaid so much of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness to the corrupt and
lost Sons of Men, and it being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to which the Almighty had a
peculiar regard in the whole Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and Oeconomy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as
well as in the Prophecies and History
of the Old Testament; This was a
Foundation capable of large Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:107142:179"/>
1. In explaining the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
Necessity, Use and End of his
coming. 2. Next, in proving him to
be the Person promis'd; by a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
of his Birth, Life, Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
Death, and Resurrection, to
all those Prophecies and Types of him,
which had given the expectation of
such a Deliverer, and to those Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of him whereby he might be
known, when he did come. 3. In
the discovery of the Sort, Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Extent, and Management of his
Kingdom. 4. In shewing from what
we are deliver'd by him, and how
that Deliverance is wrought out, and
what are the Consequences of it.</p>
               <p>These, and a great many more the
like, afford great numbers of Truths
deliver'd both in the Historical, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolary,
and Prophetical Writings of
the New Testament, wherein the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of the Gospel hidden from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages were discover'd; and that
more fully, I grant, after the pouring
out of the Holy Ghost upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
But could no body take Christ
for their promised King, and resolve
to obey him, unless he understood all
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:107142:179"/>
the Truths that concern'd his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or, as I may say, Mysteries of
State of it? The truth of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is manifest out of the plain and
uniform Preaching of the Apostles,
after they had received the Holy
Ghost, that was to guide them into all
Truth. Nay, after the writing of
those Epistles, wherein were contain'd
the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s <hi>Sublimest</hi> Truths; They
every where propos'd to Unbelievers
<hi>Iesus the Messiah</hi> to be their King, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd</hi>
of God; and to this join'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
And this alone they Preach'd
for the Conversion of their Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Hearers. As soon as any one
assented to this, he was pronounced
a Believer; And these inspired Rulers
of the Church, these infallible Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Gospel, admitted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ's Kingdom by Baptism. And
this after, long <hi>after our Saviour's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,
when</hi> (as our <hi>Unmasker</hi> expresses
it) <hi>the Holy Ghost was to be sent in a
special manner to enlighten mens Minds,
and to discover to them the great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Christianity,</hi> even as long as
the Apostles lived: And what others
were to do, who afterwards were to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:107142:180"/>
Preach the Gospel; St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> III. 11. <hi>Other foundation can no
man lay than that is laid, even Iesus
the Messiah.</hi> Though upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
Men might build variously,
things that would, or would not hold
the touch; Yet however, as long as
they kept firm to this Foundation,
they should be saved, as appears in
the following Verses.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if all the Doctrines of
the Gospel, which are contain'd in the
Writings of the Apostles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
were necessary to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and explicitly believed, in the
true sense of those that deliver'd them,
to make a Man a Christian; I doubt
whether ever any one, even to this
day, was a true Christian: Though I
believe the <hi>Unmasker</hi> will not deny
but that, e're this, Christianity (as he
expresses it) <hi>is by certain steps climbed
to its height.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for this, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has found
a convenient and wise remedy. 'Tis
but for him to have the Power to
declare, which of the Doctrines deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
in Holy Writ are, and which are
not necessary to be believed, with an
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:107142:180"/>
additional Power to add others of his
own, that he cannot find there, and
the business is done. For unless this
be allow'd him, his System cannot
stand: Unless his Interpretations be
received for authentick Revelation, we
cannot have all Doctrines necessary
for our time; In truth, we cannot be
Christians. For to this only, what he
says concerning the <hi>gradual discovery
of the Doctrines of the Gospel tends.
We are not to think,</hi> says he, <hi>that all
the necessary Doctrines of the Christian
Religion were clearly publish'd to the
World in our Saviour's time. Not but
that all that were necessary for that
time were publish'd: But some that
were necessary for the succeeding one
were not then discover'd, or at least
not fully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must here ask the <hi>Unmasker</hi> a short
Question, or two; as First,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="47" type="part">
               <head>XLVI.</head>
               <p>Are not all the Doctrines necessary
for our time contain'd in his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:107142:181"/>
Next,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="48" type="part">
               <head>XLVII.</head>
               <p>Can all the Doctrines necessary for
our time, be propos'd in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words of the Scripture?</p>
               <p>When he has answer'd these two plain
Questions (and an Answer to them,
I shall expect) the World will then
see, what he designs by <hi>Doctrines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for our Saviour's time, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
necessary for succeeding times;</hi>
whether he means any thing else by
it, but the setting up his System, as
the exact Standard of the Gospel; and
the true and unalterable Measure of
Christianity, in which <hi>it has climbed
to its height.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let not good and sincere Christians
be deceived, nor perplexed by this
Maker of another Christianity, than
what the infallible Spirit of God has
lest us in the Scriptures. 'Tis evident
from thence, that whoever takes <hi>Iesus
the Messiah</hi> for his King, with a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to live by his Laws, and does
sincerely repent as often as he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresses
any of them, is his Subject;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:107142:181"/>
All such are Christians. What they are
to know, or believe more concerning
him, and his Kingdom, when they
are his Subjects, he has left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in the great and Sacred Code,
and Constitutions of his Kingdom, I
mean in the Holy Scriptures. All
that is contain'd therein, as coming
from the God of Truth, they are to
receive as Truth, and imbrace as such.
But since it is impossible explicitly to
believe any Proposition of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine but what men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
or in any other sense than we
understand it to have been deliver'd
in; An explicit belief is, or can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in no Man, of more than what
he understands of that Doctrine. And
thus, whatsoever upon fair Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
he understands to be contain'd
in that Doctrine, is necessary to him
to be believed: Nor can he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a Subject of Christ upon other
terms.</p>
               <p>What he is perswaded is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ his King, in any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
he finds in the Sacred Code;
That by his Allegiance he is bound to
submit his Mind to receive for true,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:107142:182"/>
or else he denies the Authority of
Christ, and refuses to believe him;
nor can be excused by calling any one
on Earth Master. And hence it is
evidently impossible for a Christian
to understand any Text in one sence,
and believe it in another, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
dictated.</p>
               <p>All that is contain'd in the inspired
Writings, is all of Divine Authority,
must all be allow'd for such, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for Divine and infallible Truth,
by every Subject of Christ's Kingdom,
<hi>i. e.</hi> every Christian. How comes then
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> to distinguish these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of the Holy Spirit into neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and not necessary Truths? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to produce his Commission,
whereby he hath the Power given
him to tell, which of the Divine
Truths contain'd in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are of necessity to be believed, and
which not. Who made him a Judge
or Divider between them? Who gave
him this Power over the Oracles of
God; to set up one, and debase ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at his pleasure? Some, as he thinks
sit, are the <hi>choicest</hi> Truths. And what
I beseech him are the other? Who
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:107142:182"/>
made him a Chuser, where no body
can pick and chuse? Every proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there, as far as any Christian can
understand it, is indispensibly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed: And farther than
he does understand it, it is impossible
for him to believe it. The Laws of
Christ's Kingdom do not require Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities,
for they are all reasonable,
just and good.</p>
               <p>Some of the Truths delivered in
Holy Writ are very plain: 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
I think, to mistake their
Meaning: And those certainly are all
necessary to be explicitely believ'd.
Others have more Difficulty in them,
and are not easy to be understood.
Is the <hi>Unmasker</hi> appointed Christ's
Vicegerent here, or the Holy Ghost's
Interpreter, with Authority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
which of these are necessary
to be believ'd, and in what Sense,
and which not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Obscurity that
is to be found in several passages of
the Scripture, the difficulties that
cover and perplex the meaning of
several Texts, demand of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

in reading and hearing the Scriptures;

one is to do for himself; and thereby

loves to speak doubtfully and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely)
I know no other infallible
guide, but the Spirit of God in the
Scriptures. Nor has God left it in
my choice, to take any Man for such.
If he had, I should think the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
the unlikeliest to be he, and the last
Man in the World to be chosen for
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Guide: And herein, I appeal to
any sober Christian, who hath read
what the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has with so little
Truth and Decency (for 'tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
mens fault if they have not
Sense) writ upon this Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would not be of the same mind?</p>
               <p>But yet as very an <hi>Unmasker</hi> as he is,
he will be extremely apt to call you
Names, nay to declare you no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
and boldly affirm you have no
Christianity, if you will not swallow
it just as it is of his Cooking. You
must take it just as he has been pleased to
dose it; no more, nor no less, than what
is in his System. He hath put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Throne of Christ, and
pretends to tell you, which are, and
which are not the indispensable Laws
of his Kingdom. Which parts of his
divine Revelation you must necessarily
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:107142:185"/>
know, understand, and believe, and
in what sense; and which you need
not trouble your head about, but may
pass by as not necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
He will tell you that some of
his necessary Articles are Mysteries,
and yet (as he does <hi>p.</hi> 115. of his
<hi>Thoughts concerning the Causes of
Atheism</hi>) that they are easy to be
understood by any Man, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to him. In answer to that,
I demanded of him <q>who was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
them? The <hi>Papists</hi> I told him,
would explain some of them one
way, and the <hi>Reformed</hi> another;
The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Anti-remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants</hi>
give them different senses;
And probably the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> and
<hi>Unitarians</hi> will profess, that they
understand not each other's Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</q>
But to this in his reply
he has not vouchsafed to give me
any answer. Which yet I expect,
and I will tell him why; Because as
there are different Explainers, there
will be different Fundamentals. And
therefore, unless he can shew his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to be the sole Explainer of
Fundamentals, he will in vain make
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:107142:185"/>
such a pudder about his Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
Another Explainer, of as good
Authority as he, will set up others
against them. And what then shall
we be the better for all this stir,
and noise of Fundamentals? And I
desire it may be consider'd how much
of the Divisions in the Church, and
bloody Persecutions amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
has been owing to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
thus set up against Christianity,
in multiplied Fundamentals and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
made necessary by the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
of opposite Systems. The
<hi>Unmasker</hi>'s Zeal wants nothing but
Power to make good his to be the only
Christianity, for he has found the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed to be defective. He is as
infallible as the Pope, and another as
infallible as he; and where Humane
Additions are made to the Terms of
the Gospel, Men seldom want Zeal
for what is their own.</p>
               <p>To conclude; What was sufficient
to make a Man a Christian in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
time, is sufficient still, <hi>viz.</hi>
the taking him for our King and
Lord, ordained so by God. What was
necessary to be believed by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:107142:186"/>
in our Saviour's time as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
Duty, which they owed
to their Lord and Master, was the
believing all divine Revelation, as far
as every one could understand it:
And just so it is still, neither more
nor less. This being so, the <hi>Unmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
may make what use he pleases of
his Notion, <hi>That Christianity was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by Degrees,</hi> it will no way (in
that sence in which it is true) turn to
the advantage of his select Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
necessary Doctrines.</p>
               <p>The next Chapter has nothing in
it, but his great Bug-bear, whereby
he hopes to fright People from Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Book, by crying out, <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
Socinianism.</hi> Whereas I challenge
him again to shew one word of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism</hi>
in it. But however it is worth
while to write a Book to prove me a
<hi>Socinian.</hi> Truly, I did not think my
self so considerable, that the World
need be troubled about me, whether
I were a follower of <hi>Socinus, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
Calvin,</hi> or any other Leader of
a Sect amongst Christians. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
I am sure I am, because I believe
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the King and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:107142:186"/>
Saviour promised, and sent by God:
And as a Subject of his Kingdom, I
take the rule of my Faith, and Life,
from his Will declar'd and left upon
Record in the inspired Writings of the
Apostles and Evangelists in the New
Testament: Which I endeavour to
the utmost of my power, as is my
Duty, to understand in their true
sense and meaning. To lead me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their true meaning, I know (as I
have above declar'd) no infallible
Guide, but the same Holy Spirit, from
whom these Writings at first came.
If the <hi>Unmasker</hi> knows any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Interpreter of Scripture, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to direct me to him. Till
then, I shall think it according to my
Master's Rule, not to be called, nor to
call any Man on Earth <hi>Master.</hi> No
Man, I think, has a right to prescribe
to my Faith, or Magisterially to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Interpretations or Opinions
on me: Nor is it material to any one
what mine are, any farther than they
carry their own Evidence with them.
If this, which I think makes me of
no Sect, entitles me to the Name of a
<hi>Papist,</hi> or a <hi>Socinian,</hi> because the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:107142:187"/>
thinks these the worst, and
most invidious he can give me; and
labours to fix them on me for no
other reason, but because I will not
take him for my <hi>Master on Earth,</hi> and
his System for my Gospel; I shall
leave him to recommend himself to
the World by this Skill, who no doubt
will have reason to thank him for the
rareness and subtility of his Discovery.
For, I think, I am the first Man, that
ever was found out to be at the same
time a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and a Factor for <hi>Rome.</hi>
But what is too hard for such an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker?</hi>
I must be what he thinks fit.
When he pleases a <hi>Papist,</hi> and when he
pleases a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
a <hi>Mahometan.</hi> And probably, when
he has consider'd a little better, an
<hi>Atheist;</hi> for I hardly scaped it when
he writ last. My Book, he says, hath
a tendency to it; and if he can but go
on, as he has done hitherto, from
Surmises to Certainties, by that time
he writes next his Discovery will be
advanced, and he will certainly find
me an <hi>Atheist.</hi> Only one thing I dare
assure him of, that he shall never find,
that I treat the things of God or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:107142:187"/>
so, as if I made only a Trade,
or a Jest of them. But let us now
see how at present he proves me a
<hi>Socinian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His first Argument is, my not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
for my leaving out, <hi>Matth.</hi>
XXVIII. 19. and <hi>Iohn</hi> I. 1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 82.
of his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd.</hi> This
he takes to be a Confession, that
I am a <hi>Socinian.</hi> I hope he means
fairly, and that if it be so on my
side, it must be taken for a standing
Rule between us, that where any thing
is not answer'd, it must be taken for
granted. And upon that score, I must
desire him to remember some Passages
of my <hi>Vindication,</hi> which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and others which I shall mind
him of hereafter, which he passed
over in Silence, and hath had nothing
to say to, which therefore by his
own rule, I shall desire the Reader to
observe, that he has granted.</p>
               <p>This being premised; I must tell
the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> that I perceive he reads
my Book with the same Understanding
that he writes his own. If he had
done otherwise, he might have seen,
that I had given him a reason for my
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:107142:188"/>
omission of those two, and other <hi>plain
and obvious Passages and famous Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in the Evangelists,</hi> as he calls
them, where I say, <hi>p.</hi> 11. <q>That if
I have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t out none of those <hi>Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
or <hi>Testimonies,</hi> which contain
what our Saviour and his Apostles
preach'd and required assent to, to
make Men Believers, I shall think
my Omissions (let them be what
they will) no Faults in the present
Case. Whatever Doctrines Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
would have to be believed, to
make a Man a Christian, he will
be sure to find them in those Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings
and <hi>famous Testimonies</hi> of
our Saviour and his Apostles I have
quoted. And if they are not there,
he may rest satisfied, that they were
not propos'd by our Saviour and his
Apostles, as necessary to be believed
to make Men Christ's Disciples.</q>
From which words, any one but an
<hi>Unmasker,</hi> would have understood my
Answer to be, That all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to make Men
Christians, might be found in what
our Saviour and the Apostles propos'd
to Unbelievers for their Conversion:
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:107142:188"/>
But the two Passages abovemention'd,
as well as a great many others in the
Evangelists, being none of those, I
had no reason to take notice of them.
But the <hi>Unmasker</hi> having out of his
good pleasure put it once upon me,
as he does in his <hi>Thoughts of the Causes
of Atheism,</hi> p. 107. That I was an
<hi>Epitomizer of the Evangelical Writings,</hi>
though every one may see I make not
that my Business, yet `tis no matter
for that, I must always be accountable
to that fancy of his. But when he
has proved,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="49" type="part">
               <head>XLVIII.</head>
               <p>That this is not as just a reason for
my omitting them, as several other
<hi>obvious Passages</hi> and <hi>famous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies</hi>
in the Evangelists, which
I there mention, for whose Omission
he does not blame me,</p>
               <p>I will undertake to give him another
Reason, which I know not whether
he were not better let alone.</p>
               <p>The next Proof of my being a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> is,
that I take the <hi>Son of God</hi> to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:107142:189"/>
be an expression used to signifie the
<hi>Messiah. Slichtingius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it so, and therefore I am, the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> says, a <hi>Socinian.</hi> Just as
good an Argument, as that I believe
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be a Prophet, and so do the
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> therefore I am a <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan:</hi>
Or thus, The <hi>Unmaskert</hi> holds
that the Apostles Creed does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all things necessary to Salvation,
and so says <hi>Knot</hi> the Jesuit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> is a Papist. Let
me turn the Tables, and by the same
Argument I am Orthodox again. For
two Orthodox, Pious and very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Prelates of our Church, whom,
when I follow Authorities, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to <hi>Slichtingius</hi> and <hi>Socinus,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it as I do, and therefore I am
Orthodox. Nay, it so falls out, that
if it were of force either way, the
Argument would weigh most on this
side: Since I am not wholly a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Writings of these two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Bishops, but I never read a
Page in either of those <hi>Socinians.</hi> The
never sufficiently admir'd and valued
Archbishop <hi>Tillotson</hi>'s words, which I
quoted, the <hi>Unmasker</hi> says, <hi>do not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:107142:189"/>
import any such thing.</hi> I know
no words that <hi>necessarily import</hi> any
thing to a Caviller. But he was known
to have such clear Thoughts, and so
clear a Stile; so far from having any
thing doubtful, or fallacious in what
he said, that I shall only set down his
words as they are in his Sermon of
Sincerity, <hi>p.</hi> 2. to shew his meaning.
<hi>Nathaniel,</hi> says he, <hi>being satisfied, that
he</hi> [our Saviour] <hi>was the Messiah, he
presently owned him for such, calling him
THE SON OF GOD, and the King
of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of the other Eminent
Prelate, the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> whom our
Church is still happy in, are these.
<hi>To be the Son of God, and to be Christ,
being but different Expressions of the
same thing:</hi> Witness, <hi>p.</hi> 14. And
p. 10. <hi>It is the very same thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Iesus is the Christ, and
to believe that Iesus is the Son of
God, express it how you please. This
ALONE is the Faith which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
a man, and put a divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into him, that it makes him a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
over the World as Iesus was.</hi>
Of this the <hi>Unmasker</hi> says, that this
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:107142:190"/>
Reverend Author <hi>speaking only in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
way represents these two as the same
thing,</hi> viz. That Iesus is the Christ,
and that Jesus is the Son of God, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these Expressions are applied to
the same person, and because they are
both comprehended in one general Name,</hi>
viz. <hi>Jesus.</hi> Answ. The Question is
whether these two Expressions, <hi>the
Son of God,</hi> and <hi>the Messiah,</hi> in the
Learned Bishop's Opinion signifie the
same thing. If his Opinion had been
asked in the Point, I know not how
he could have declar'd it more clearly.
For he says they are <hi>Expressions of the
same thing,</hi> and that <hi>it is the very same
thing to believe that Iesus is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,
and to believe that he is the Son
of God;</hi> Which cannot be so, if <hi>Messiah</hi>
and <hi>Son of God</hi> have different Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:
For then they will make two
distinct Propositions in different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which it can be no more the same
thing to believe, than it is the same
thing to believe that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is a
Notable Preacher, and a Notable Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
or than it is to believe one Truth
and all Truths. For by the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that it is the <hi>same thing to believe</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:107142:190"/>
two distinct Truths, it will be the
<hi>same thing to believe</hi> two thousand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Truths, and consequently all
Truths. The <hi>Unmasker,</hi> that he might
seem to say something, says that the
<hi>Reverend Author represents these as the
same thing. Answ.</hi> The <hi>Unmasker</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fails, like <hi>Midas,</hi> to turn every
thing he touches into his own Metal.
The Learned Bishop says very directly
and plainly, that <hi>to be the Son of God,</hi>
and <hi>to be the Messiah, are Expressions of
the same thing:</hi> And the <hi>Unmasker</hi>
says, he <hi>represents these Expressions as
one thing.</hi> For `tis of Expressions that
both the Bishop and he speak: Now,
<hi>Expressions</hi> can be <hi>one thing,</hi> but one
of these two ways: Either in Sound,
and so these two Expressions are not
one; Or insignification, and so they
are. And then the <hi>Unmasker</hi> says, but
in other words, what the Bishop had
said before, <hi>viz.</hi> That these two <hi>to be
the Son of God</hi> and <hi>to be the Messiah,</hi> are
<hi>Expressions of the same thing.</hi> Only
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> has put in the word
<hi>Represents</hi> to amuse his Reader, as if
he had said something, and so indeed
he does after his fashion, <hi>i. e.</hi> obscurely
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:107142:191"/>
and fallaciously; which when it comes
to be examined, is but the same thing
under shew of a difference: Or else,
if it has a different meaning, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively
false. But so it be
obscure enough to deceive a willing
Reader, who will not be at the pains
to examine what he says, it serves
his turn.</p>
               <p>But yet, as if he had said something
of weight, he gives Reasons for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Represents these two Expressions as
one thing,</hi> in stead of saying, these
two are <hi>but different Expressions of the
same thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The First of his Reasons is, Because
the Reverend Author is here <hi>speaking
only in a General way. Answ.</hi> What
does the <hi>Vnmasker</hi> mean by a <hi>General
way?</hi> The Learned Bishop speaks of
two particular <hi>Expressions</hi> applied to
our Saviour. But was his Discourse
never so general, how could that alter
the plain Signification of his words,
<hi>viz.</hi> That those two are but <hi>different
Expressions of the same thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Because these Expressions are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the same person. Answ.</hi> A very
demonstrative Reason, is it not, that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:107142:191"/>
therefore they cannot be different Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the same thing?</p>
               <p>3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>And because they are both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in one general Name,</hi> viz.
<hi>Iesus. Answ.</hi> It requires some Skill
to put so many Falshoods in so few
words. For neither both nor either
of these Expressions are <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
in the Name <hi>Iesus:</hi> And that
<hi>Iesus,</hi> the Name of a particular Person,
should be a <hi>general Name,</hi> is a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
reserv'd to be found out by this
new Logician. However <hi>general</hi> is a
Learned Word, which when a Man
of Learning has used twice, as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the same thing, he is cover'd
with <hi>Generals.</hi> He need not trouble
himself any farther about sence, he may
safely talk what Stu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> he pleases, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least Suspicion of his Reader.</p>
               <p>Having thus strongly proved just
nothing; he proceeds and tells us,
<hi>p. 91. Yet it does not follow thence, but
that if we will speak strictly and closely,
we must be forced to confess, they are of
different Significations.</hi> By which
words (if his words have any Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication)
he plainly allows, that the
Bishop meant as he says, that these
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:107142:192"/>
two are but <hi>different Expressions of the
same thing:</hi> But withal tells him, that
if he will <hi>speak closely and strictly,</hi> he
must say, <hi>they are of different Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</hi>
My concernment in the case
being only, that in the Passage al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
the Reverend Author said,
that the <hi>Son of God</hi> and the <hi>Messiah</hi>
were <hi>different Expressions of the same
thing,</hi> I have no more to demand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these words of the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> he has
granted all I would have. But shall
leave it to the decisive Authority of
this Superlative Critick to determine,
whether this Learned Bishop, or any
one living, besides himself, can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Phrases of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and <hi>speak strictly and closely</hi>
concerning them. Perhaps his being
yet alive, may preserve this Eminent
Prelate from the malicious driveling
of the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s <hi>Pen,</hi> which has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
the Ashes of two of the same
Order, who were no mean Ornaments
of the <hi>English</hi> Church; And if they
had been now alive, no body will
doubt, but the <hi>Unmasker</hi> would have
treated them after another fashion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:107142:192"/>
But let me ask the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(if either of these Pious Prelates,
whose words I have above quoted, did
understand that Phrase of the <hi>Son of
God</hi> to stand for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> which
they might do without holding any
one <hi>Socinian</hi> tenet) he will dare to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him a <hi>Socinian.</hi> This is so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
an Inference, that I could not
but laugh at it. But withal tell him,
<hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 23. That <q>if the sence
wherein I understand those Texts
be a Mistake, I shall be beholding
to him to set me right: But they
are not popular Authorities, or
frightful Names, whereby I judge
of Truth or Falshood.</q> To which
I subjoin these words; <q>You <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill now
no doubt applaud your Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
the Point is gain'd, and I
am openly a <hi>Socinian.</hi> Since I will
not disown, that I think the <hi>Son of
God</hi> was a Phrase, that among the
<hi>Iews</hi> in our Saviour's time was used
for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> though the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
understand it in the same
sence. And therefore I must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be of their Perswasion in
every thing else. I admire the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:107142:193"/>
force, and fairness of your
Reasoning, and so I leave you to
triumph in your Conjectures.</q> Nor
has he sailed my expectation: For
here, <hi>p.</hi> 91. of his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi>
he upon this erects his Comb, and
Crows most mightily. <hi>We may,</hi> says
he, <hi>from hence as well as other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
pronounce him the same with those
Gentlemen</hi> (i. e. as he is pleased to
call them <hi>my good Patrons and Friends

               <p>The places which in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shew that the <hi>Son of God</hi> stands for
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> are so many, and so clear,
that I imagine no body that ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd

First, <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> Joh. I. 20.
when the <hi>Iews</hi> sent to know who he
was, confessed he himself was not the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> But of <hi>Iesus</hi> he says, <hi>v.</hi> 34.
after having several ways in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Verses declar'd him to be the
<hi>Messiah; And I saw and bare record,
that this is the SON OF GOD.</hi>
And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> III. 26—36. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<hi>Iesus</hi> to be, and himself not
to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he does it in these
Synonymous terms of the <hi>Messiah</hi> and
<hi>the Son of God,</hi> as appears by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<hi>v.</hi> 28. 35, 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nathanael</hi> owns him to be the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
in these words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> I. 50. <hi>Thou
art the SON OF GOD, Thou art
the King of Israel:</hi> Which our Saviour
in the next Verse calls <hi>Believing,</hi> a
term, all through the History of our
Saviour, used for owning <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And for confirming that
Faith of his, that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
our Saviour further adds, that he
should see <hi>greater things,</hi> i. e. Should
see him do greater Miracles, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luke</hi> the 4<hi>th. 41. And Devils also
came out of many crying, Thou art the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:107142:194"/>
Messiah the Son of God, and he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them suffered them not to speak.</hi>
And so again, St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us,
Chap. III. 11, 12. <hi>That unclean Spirits,
when they saw him, fell down before him
and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of
God. And he strictly charged them,
that they should not make him known.</hi>
In both these places, which relate to
different times, and different occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
the Devils declare <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
<hi>the Son of God.</hi> `Tis certain, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they meant by it, they used a
Phrase of a known Signification in
that Country. And what may we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
think they designed to make
known to the People by it? Can we
imagine these unclean Spirits were
Promoters of the Gospel, and had a
Mind to acknowledge and publish to
the People the Deity of our Saviour,
which the <hi>Vnmasker</hi> would have to
be the Signification of the <hi>Son of God?</hi>
Who can entertain such a thought?
No, they were no Friends to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:
And therefore desir'd to spread
a Belief of him, that he was the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
that so he might by the envy of
the Scribes and Pharisees, be disturb'd
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:107142:195"/>
in his Ministry, and be cut off before
he had compleated it. And therefore
we see our Saviour in both places for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
them to make him known; As
he did his Disciples themselves, for
the same Reason. For when St. <hi>Peter,
Mat.</hi> XVI. 16. had own'd <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in these words; <hi>Thou art
the Messiah the Son of the living God.</hi>
It follows, <hi>v. 20. Then charged he his
Disciples, that they should tell no man,
that he was Iesus the Messiah.</hi> Just as
he had forbid the Devils to <hi>make him
known,</hi> i. e. to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Besides,
these words here of St. <hi>Peter</hi> can be
taken in no other sence, but barely
to signifie that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
to make them a proper Answer to
our Saviour's Question. His first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
here to his Disciples, <hi>v.</hi> 13. is,
<hi>Whom do men say that I the Son of
Man am?</hi> The Question is not, of
what Original do you think the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
when he comes will be? For then
this Question would have been as it is,
<hi>Mat.</hi> XXII. 42. <hi>What think you of the
Messiah, whose Son is he?</hi> If he had
enquir'd about the common opinion
concerning the Nature and Descent of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:107142:195"/>
the <hi>Messiah.</hi> But his Question is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himself; <hi>Whom</hi> of all the
extraordinary Persons known to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> or mentioned in their Sacred
Writings, the People thought him to
be. That this was the meaning of his
Question is evident, from the Answer
the Apostles gave to it; And his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
demand, <hi>v. 14, 15. They said,
some say thou art Iohn the Baptist,
some Elias, and others Ieremias, or one
of the Prophets. He saith unto them,
But WHOM say ye that I am?</hi> The
People take me, some for one of the
Prophets, or Extraordinary Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from God, and some for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But which of them do you take
me to be? <hi>Simon Peter answer'd and
said, Thou art the Messiah the Son of
the living God.</hi> In all which Discourse,
'tis evident there was not the least
Enquiry made by our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Person, Nature, or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the <hi>Messiah;</hi> but whether
the People or his Apostles thought
him, <hi>i. e. Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the
<hi>Messiah.</hi> To which St. <hi>Peter</hi> gave him
a direct and plain Answer in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
words, declaring their Belief
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:107142:196"/>
of him to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> Which is all,
that with any manner of Congruity,
could be made the sence of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Answer. This alone of it self were
enough to justifie my interpretation
of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> both
whose words confirm it. For St. <hi>Mark</hi>
Chap. VIII. 29. renders it, <hi>Thou art
the Messiah,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. IX. 18.
<hi>The Messiah of God.</hi> To the like Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Who art thou, Iohn</hi> the Baptist
gives a like Answer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> I. 19. 20.
<hi>I am not the Christ.</hi> By which Answer,
as well as by the following Verses, it
is plain, nothing was understood to be
meant by that Question, but, which
of the extraordinary Persons promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to or expected by the <hi>Iews,</hi> art
thou?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> XI. 27. The Phrase of the <hi>Son
of God</hi> is made use of by Saint <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha:</hi>
And that it was used by her to
signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and nothing else
is evident out of the Context. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>
tells our Saviour, that if he had
been there before her Brother died, he
by that Divine Power, which he had
manifested in so many Miracles which
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:107142:196"/>
he had done, could have saved his
Life; and that now, if our Saviour
would ask it of God, he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Restoration of his Life. <hi>Iesus</hi>
tells her, he shall rise again: Which
words <hi>Martha</hi> taking to mean, at the
general Resurrection, at the last Day,
<hi>Iesus</hi> thereupon takes occasion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
to her, that he was the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
by telling her, that he was <hi>the
Resurrection and the Life,</hi> i. e. That the
Life, which Mankind should receive
at the general Resurrection, was by
and through him. This was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> It being a
received Opinion amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi>
that when the <hi>Messiah.</hi> came, the Just
should rise, and live with him for ever.
And having made this Declaration of
himself to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> he asks
<hi>Martha,</hi> Believest thou this? What!
Not whose Son the <hi>Messiah</hi> should be;
But whether he himself was the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
by whom Believers should have
Eternal Life at the last Day. And to
this, she gives this direct and appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Answer; <hi>Yea, Lord, I believe that
thou art the Christ the Son of God,
which should come into the World.</hi>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:107142:197"/>
The Question was only whether she
was perswaded, that those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him, should be raised to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life; That was in effect, whether
he was the <hi>Messiah:</hi> And to this she
answers <hi>yea Lord,</hi> I believe this of
thee; And then she explains what was
contain'd in that Faith of hers, even
this, that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that
was promis'd to come, by whom
alone Men were to receive eternal
Life.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Iews</hi> also understood by
the <hi>Son of God</hi> is also clear from that
passage at the latter end of XXII. of
<hi>Luke.</hi> They having taken our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and being very desirous to get
a Confession from his own Mouth,
that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that they
might from thence be able to raise a
formal, and prevalent Accusation
against him before <hi>Pilate;</hi> the only
thing the Council asked him was,
whether he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> v. 67.
To which he answers so in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Words, that he lets them see,
he understood, that the design of their
Question was to entrap him, and not
to believe in him, whatever he should
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:107142:197"/>
declare of himself: But yet he tells
them, <hi>Hereafter shall the Son of Man
sit on the right hand of the power of God;</hi>
Words that to the <hi>Iews</hi> plainly enough
owned him to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> But
yet such as could not have any force
against him with <hi>Pilate.</hi> He having
confessed so much, they hope to draw
yet a clearer Confession from him.
<hi>Then said they all, art thou then the Son
of God? And he said unto them, ye say
that I am. And they said, what need
we any further witness? For we our
selves have heard of his own Mouth.</hi>
Can any one think that the Doctrine
of his <hi>Deity</hi> (which is that which the
<hi>Unmasker</hi> accuses me for <hi>waveing</hi>) was
that, which the <hi>Iews</hi> designed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
our Saviour of before <hi>Pilate;</hi>
or that they needed Witnesses for?
Common sense, as well as the current
of the whole History shews the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>owned himself to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and

                  </gap>hereby claim'd a Title to be King of
the <hi>Iews.</hi> The <hi>Son of God</hi> was so
known a Name amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> to
stand for the <hi>Messiah;</hi> that having
got that from his Mouth, they
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:107142:198"/>
thought they had Proof enough of
Treason against him. This carries
with it a clear and easie meaning.
But if the <hi>Son of God</hi> be to be taken,
as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> would have it, for
a Declaration of his <hi>Deity,</hi> I desire
him to make common, and coherent
sence of it.</p>
               <p>I shall add one Consideration more
to shew, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> was a
Form of Speech then used amongst
the <hi>Iews</hi> to signifie the <hi>Messiah,</hi> from
the persons that used it. <hi>uiz. Iohn
the Baptist, Nathanael, St. Peter,
St. Martha,</hi> the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and the
<hi>Centurion,</hi> Luke XXVII. 54. Here are
<hi>Iews, Heathens; Friends, Enemies;
Men, Women; Believers,</hi> and <hi>Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi>
All indifferently use this
Phrase of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and apply
it to <hi>Iesus.</hi> The Question between
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> and me is whether it
was used by these several persons, as
an Appellation of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> (or as
the <hi>Unmasker</hi> would have it) in a quite
different Sence; As such an Application
of Divinity to our Saviour, that he
that shall deny that to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it in the minds of these Speakers,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:107142:198"/>
denies the Divinity of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
For if they did speak it without that
meaning, it is plain it was a Phrase
known to have another meaning; or
else they had talked unintelligible Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.
Now I will ask the <hi>Unmasker,</hi>
whether he thinks, that the Eternal
<hi>Generation,</hi> or as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> calls
it, <hi>Filiation</hi> of <hi>Iesus</hi> the Son of God,
was a Doctrine that had enter'd into
the Thoughts of all the Persons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
even of the <hi>Roman Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
and the Soldiers that were with
him watching Jesus? If he say he
does, I suppose he thinks so only for
this time, and for this occasion: And
then it will lie upon him to give the
World convincing Reasons for his
Opinion, that they may think so too:
Or if he does not think so, he must
give up this Argument, and allow
that this Phrase, in these places, does
not necessarily import the Deity of
our Saviour, and the Doctrine of his
eternal Generation: And so a Man may
take it to be an Expression standing
for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> without being a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi>
any more than he himself is
one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:107142:199"/>
There is one place, <hi>the</hi> Unmasker <hi>tells
us,</hi> p. 87. that confutes all the Surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
about the Identity of these terms. It
is, <hi>says he,</hi> that famous Confession of
Faith, which the Aethiopian E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nuch made
when <hi>Philip</hi> told him he might be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
if he believed. This without doubt
was said according to that apprehension
which he had of Christ, from <hi>Philip</hi>'s
instructing him; for it is said, he Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
unto him Iesus, <hi>v.</hi> 35. He had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him that Iesus was the Christ
the anointed of God, and also that he
was the Son of God, which includes in
it that he was God. And accordingly
this Noble Proselyte gives this account
of his Faith, in order to his being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd,
in order to his being admitted a
Member of Christ's Church, I believe
that Iesus is the Son of God; Or you
may read it according to the Greek,
I believe the Son of God to be Iesus
Christ. Where there are these two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Propositions.</p>
               <p>1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. That Iesus is the Christ, the
Messiah</p>

               <p>

The <hi>Unmasker</hi> is every where stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
the same subtil Arguer. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he has proved, that <hi>the Son of
God,</hi> in this Confession of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi>
signifies, what he would have, we shall
examine by and by. This at least is
Demonstration, that this Passage of
his overturns his Principles; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
his long List of Fundamentals to
two Propositions, the belief whereof
is sufficient to make a Man a Christian.
<hi>This Noble Proselyte,</hi> says the <hi>Unmasker,
gives this account of his Faith in order
to his being baptized, in order to being
admitted a Member of Christ's Church.</hi>
And what is that Faith according to
the <hi>Unmasker?</hi> He tells you <hi>there are</hi>
in it <hi>these two distinct Propositions,</hi> viz.
I believe, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>That</hi> Jesus <hi>is the</hi> Christ
<hi>the</hi> Messias; 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>That he is not only the</hi>
Messias, <hi>but the Son of God.</hi> If this
<hi>famous Confession,</hi> containing but these
two Articles were enough to his being
Baptized; If this Faith were sufficient
to make <hi>this Noble Proselyte</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
what is become of all those other
Articles of the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s System,
without the belief whereof, he in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places tells us a Man cannot be a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:107142:200"/>
Christian? If he had here told us, that
Philip <hi>had not time nor opportunity,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his short stay with the Eunuch,
to explain to him all the <hi>Vnmasker</hi>'s
System, and make him understand all
his Fundamentals; he had had Reason
on his side: And he might have urged
it as a Reason why <hi>Philip</hi> taught him
no more. But nevertheless he had, by
allowing the <hi>Eunuch</hi>'s <hi>Confession of Faith</hi>
sufficient for his Admittance <hi>as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christ's Church,</hi> given up his
other Fundamentals as necessary to be
believed to make a Man a Christian;
even that of the <hi>Holy Trinity:</hi> And he
has at last reduced his necessary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to these two, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Iesus is the
Messiah,</hi> and that <hi>Iesus is the Son of
God.</hi> So that after his ridiculous cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mine a <hi>lank Faith,</hi> I desire him
to consider, what he will now call his
own. Mine is next to <hi>none,</hi> because,
as he says, it is but <hi>one</hi> Article. If
that reasoning be good, his is not far
from <hi>none:</hi> If consists but in two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
which is next to <hi>one,</hi> and very
little more remote from <hi>none</hi> than <hi>one</hi>
is. If any one had but as much Wit
as the <hi>Unmasker,</hi> and could be but as
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:107142:200"/>
smart upon the number <hi>two,</hi> as he has
been upon an <hi>unit,</hi> here were a brave
opportunity for him to lay out his
Parts; and he might make vehement
Complaints against one, that has thus
<hi>cramp'd our Faith, corrupted mens Minds,
depraved the Gospel, and abused Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi>
But if it should fall out, as I
think it will, that the <hi>Unmasker</hi>'s two
Articles should prove to be but <hi>One,</hi>
he has saved another that labour, and he
stands painted to himself with his own
Charcoal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Unmasker</hi> would have the <hi>Son
of God,</hi> in the Confession of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
to signifie something different
from the <hi>Messiah:</hi> And his reason is,
because else it would be an <hi>absurd Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tology.
Answ.</hi> There are many Exege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Expressions put together in the
Scripture, which though they signifie
the same thing, yet are not <hi>absurd
Tautologies.</hi> The <hi>Unmasker</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
the Proposition, and would have
it to signifie thus. <hi>The Son of God is
Iesus the Messiah,</hi> which is a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so different from what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
proposed every where else, that
he ought to have given a Reason, why,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:107142:201"/>
when every where else they made the
Proposition to be of some thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
should make the Affirmation to
be of something concerning the Son
of God: As if the Eunuch knew very
well what the <hi>Son of God</hi> signified, <hi>viz.</hi>
as the <hi>Unmasker</hi> tells us here, that it
included or signified <hi>God;</hi> and that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>
(who we read at <hi>Samaria</hi> preach'd
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> i. e. instructed
them who the <hi>Messiah</hi> was) had here
taken pains only to instruct him, that
this God was <hi>Iesus</hi> the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to
bring him to assent to that Proposition.
Whether this be Natural to conceive,
I leave to the Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tautology,</hi> on which the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
builds his whole Objection, will
be quite removed, if we take <hi>Christ</hi>
here for a proper Name in which way
it is used by the Evangelists and Apostles
in other places, and particularly by
St. <hi>Luke;</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> II. 28. III. 6. 20. IV.
10. XXIV. 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In two of these
places, it cannot with any good sence
be taken otherwise; for if it be not in
<hi>Act.</hi> III. 6. and IV. 10. used as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name, we must read those places
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:107142:201"/>
thus, <hi>Iesus the Messiah of Nazareth:</hi>
And I think it is plain in those others
cited, as well as in several other places
of the New Testament, that the word
<hi>Christ</hi> is used as a proper Name. We
may easily conceive, that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Acts</hi> were writ the Name of
<hi>Christ,</hi> was grown by a familiar use to
denote the Person of our Saviour, as
much as <hi>Iesus.</hi> This is so manifest,
that it gave a Name to his Followers,
who as St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, XI. 26. were
were called <hi>Christians;</hi> And that, if
Chronologists mistake not, Twenty
Years before St. <hi>Luke</hi> writ his History
of the Apostles; And this so generally,
that <hi>Agrippa</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> uses it, <hi>Act.</hi> XXVI.
28. And that <hi>Christ</hi> as the proper
Name of our Saviour was got as far
as <hi>Rome,</hi> before St. <hi>Luke</hi> writ the <hi>Acts,</hi>
appears out of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> l. 5. And by
that Name he is called in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> Ann.
<hi>l.</hi> 15. 'Tis no wonder then, that St. <hi>Luke</hi>
in Writing this History, should some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
set it down alone, sometimes
join'd with that of <hi>Iesus,</hi> as a proper
Name; which is much easier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
he did here, than that <hi>Philip</hi>
propos'd more to the Eunuch to be
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:107142:202"/>
believed to make him a Christian, than
what in other places was propos'd for
the Conversion of others; or than
what he himself propos'd at <hi>Samaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His 7th. Chapter is to prove, that I
am a <hi>Socinian,</hi> because I omitted Christ's
<hi>Satisfaction.</hi> That Matter having been
answer'd, <hi>p.</hi> 147. where it came properly
under consideration, I shall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
here, that the great stress of his
Argument lies as it did before; not upon
my total omission of it out of my
Book, but on this, that <hi>I have no such
thing in the place where the Advantages
of Christ's coming are purposely treated
of;</hi> from whence he will have this to
be an unavoidable Inference, <hi>viz. That
I was of Opinion, that Christ came not to
satisfie for us.</hi> The reason of my omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it in that place, I told him was
because my Book was chiefly designed
for <hi>Deists;</hi> and therefore I mention'd
only those Advantages, which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
must agree in; and in omitting
of that, comply'd with the Apostle's
Rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. To this he tells me
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>latly, that was not <hi>the design</hi> of my
Book. Whether the <hi>Unmasker</hi> knows
with what design I publish'd it better
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:107142:202"/>
than I my self, must be left to the
Reader to judge: For as for his Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in what he knows, or knows not, he
has given so many Instances of it, that
I may safely referr that to any body.
One Instance more of it may be found
in this very Chapter, where he says,
<hi>I pretend indeed,</hi> p. 5. <hi>that in another
place</hi> of my <hi>Book,</hi> I mention <hi>Christ's</hi>
restoring all Mankind from the state
of Death, and restoring them to Life,
<hi>and</hi> his laying down his Life for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as our Saviour Professes he did.
<hi>These few words this</hi> Vindicator <hi>hath
picked up in his Book since he wrote it.
This is all, through his whole Treatise,
that he hath drop'd concerning that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Christ's Incarnation,</hi> i. e.
Christ's Satisfaction. <hi>Answ.</hi> But that
this is not <hi>all</hi> that I drop'd through my
whole Treatise concerning that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
may appear by those places
above-mentioned, <hi>p.</hi> 157. where I say,
that the design of Christ's coming was
to be <hi>offered up;</hi> and speak of the Work
of <hi>Redemption;</hi> which are Expressions
taken to imply our Saviour's Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
But the <hi>Unmasker</hi> thinking I
should have quoted them, if there had
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:107142:203"/>
been any more, besides those mention'd
in my <hi>Vindication,</hi> upon that Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sticks not boldly to affirm, that
there were no more; and so goes on
with the Veracity of an <hi>Unmasker.</hi> If
affirming would do it, nothing could
be wanting in his Cause that might be
for his Purpose. Whether he be as
good at proving, this Consequence
(amongst other Propositions which
remain upon him to be proved) will
try, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>That if the Satisfaction of Christ be
not mentioned in the place where
the Advantages of Christ's coming
are purposely treated of, then I
am of Opinion, that Christ came

               <p>which is all the Argument of his 7th.
Chapter.</p>
               <p>His last Chapter, as his first, begins
with a Commendation of himself. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
it boasts his freedom from
<hi>Bigolism, Dogmatizing, Censoriousness,</hi>
and <hi>Vncharitableness.</hi> I think he hath
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:107142:203"/>
drawn himself so well, with his own
Pen, that I shall need referr the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
only to what he himself has
writ in this Controversie, for his
Character.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph, <hi>p.</hi> 104. he
tells me <hi>I laugh at Orthodoxy.</hi> Answ.
There is nothing that I think deserves
a more serious Esteem than right Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
(as the Word signifies) if taken
up with the Sense of Love and Truth.
But this way of becoming Orthodox
has always Modesty accompanying it,
and a fair Acknowledgment of Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in our selves, as well as a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Error in others. On the
other side, there is nothing more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
than for any Man or Company
of Men to assume the Title of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy
to their own set of Opinions, as
if Infallibility were annexed to their
Systems, and those were to be the
standing Measure of Truth to all the
World; from whence they erect to
themselves a power to censure and
condemn others for differing at all
from the Tenets they have pitch'd
upon. The Consideration of humane
Frailty ought to check this Vanity:
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:107142:204"/>
But since it does not, but that with a
sort of Allowance it shews it self in
almost all religious Societies, the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the trick round, sufficiently turns
it into ridicule. For each Society ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an equal right to a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of themselves, a Man by passing
but a River or a Hill, loses that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy
in one Company which
pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed him up with such Assurance
and Insolence in another; and is there,
with equal Justice, himself expos'd to
the like Censures of Error and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
which he was so forward to lay
on others at Home. When it shall
appear that Infallibility is intailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one set of Men of any Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Truth confined to any Spot
of Ground, the Name and Use of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy
as now it is in Fashion every
where, will in that one place be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.
Till then, this ridiculous
Cant will be a Foundation too weak
to sustain that Usurpation that is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon it. 'Tis not that I do
not think every one should be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Truth of those Opinions he
professes. 'Tis that I contend for:
And 'tis that which I fear the great
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:107142:204"/>
Sticklers for Orthodoxy often fail in.
For we see generally that Numbers of
them exactly jump in a whole large
Collection of Doctrines, consisting of
Abundance of particulars; as if their
Notions were by one common Stamp
printed on their Minds, even to the
least Lineament. This is very hard,
if not impossible, to be conceived of
those who take up their Opinions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from Conviction. But how fully
soever I am perswaded of the Truth of
what I hold, I am in common Justice
to allow the same Sincerity to him
that differs from me; And so we are
upon equal Terms. This Perswasion
of Truth on each side, invests neither
of us with a right to censure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the other. I have no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to treat him ill for differing from
me, than he has to treat me ill for the
same cause. Pity him I may; inform
him fairly I ought; but contemn,
malign, revile or any otherwise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
him for not thinking just as I
do, that I ought not. My Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy
gives me no more Authority
over him, than his (for every one is
Orthodox to himself) gives him over
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:107142:205"/>
me. When the Word Orthodoxy
(which in effect signifies no more but
the Opinions of my Party) is made
use of as a pretence to domineer (as
ordinarily it is) it is, and always will
be ridiculous.</p>
               <p>He saith I <hi>hate even with a deadly
hatred all Catechisms and Confessions, all
Systems, and Models.</hi> I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that I have once mentioned the
Word <hi>Catechism,</hi> either in my <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of Christianity,</hi> or <hi>Vindication.</hi>
But he knows <hi>I hate them deadly,</hi> and
I know I do not. And as for <hi>Systems</hi>
and <hi>Models,</hi> all that I say of them, in
the Pages he quotes to prove my
Hatred of them, is only this, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 8.
of my <hi>Vindication</hi> 
                  <q>Some Men had
rather you should write booty, and
cross your own Design of removing
Mens Prejudices to Christianity,
than leave out one Title of what
they put into their Systems.
Some Men will not bear it, that
any one should speak of Religion,
but according to the Model that
they themselves have made of it.</q>
In neither of which places do I
speak against <hi>Systems</hi> or <hi>Models;</hi> but
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:107142:205"/>
the ill use, that some Men make of
them.</p>
               <p>He tells me also in the same place,
<hi>p.</hi> 104. that I <hi>deride Mysteries.</hi> But
for this he hath quoted neither
words, nor place: And where he does
not do that, I have reason from the
frequent Liberties he takes to impute
to me, what no where appears in my
Books, to desire the Reader to take
what he says not to be true. For
did he mean fairly, he might, by quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Words, put all such Matters
of Fact out of doubt; and not force
me so often as he does to demand
where it is, as I do now here
again,</p>

               <p>His next Words, <hi>p.</hi> 104. are very
remarkable: They are <hi>O how he</hi> [the
Vindicator] <hi>grins at the Spirit of
Creed making?</hi> p. 18. Vind. <hi>the very
thoughts of which do so haunt him, so
plague and torment him, that he cannot
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:107142:206"/>
rest till it be conjured down. And here
by the way, seeing I have mention'd his
rancour against Systematick Books and
Writings, I might represent the Misery
that is coming upon all Booksellers if this
Gentleman and his Correspondents go on
suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>essfully. Here is an effectual Plot
to undermine</hi> Stationers-Hall; <hi>for all
Systems and Bodies of Divinity, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> must be cashier'd: Whatever
looks like System must not be bought or
sold. This will fall heavy on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s</hi> Church-yard, <hi>and
other places.</hi> Here the Politick <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masker</hi>
seems to threaten me with the
Posse of <hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> because
my Book might lessen their Gain in
the Sale of Theological <hi>Systems.</hi> I
remember that <hi>Demetrius the Shrine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
which brought no small gain to
the Crafts-men whom he called together,
with the Workmen of like Occupation,
and said to this purpose; Sirs, Ye know,
that by this Craft we have our Wealth;
Moreover ye see, and hear, that this</hi>
Paul <hi>hath perswaded, and turned away
much People saying, that they be no
Gods that are made with hands, so that
this our Craft is in danger to be set at
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:107142:206"/>
naught. And when they heard these
Sayings, they were full of wrath, and
cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the
Ephesians.</hi> Have you, Sir, who are so
good at Speech-making, as a worthy
Successor of the Silver-smith, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
your Zeal for the Truth, and
your writing of Divinity by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
it will bring, made a Speech to this
purpose to the <hi>Craftsmen,</hi> and told
them, that I say, Articles of Faith,
and Creeds, and Systems in Religion
cannot be made by Mens Hands or
Fancies; But must be just such, and
no other, than what God hath given
us in the Scriptures? And are they
ready to cry out to your content,
<hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Ephesians? If you
have well warm'd them with your
Oratory, 'tis to be hoped they will
heartily join with you, and bestir
themselves, and choose you for their
Champion, to prevent the <hi>Misery</hi> you
tell them <hi>is coming upon them,</hi> in the
loss of the Sale of <hi>Systems and Bodies
of Divinity;</hi> For, as for <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
which you name too, I think you
went a little too far. Nothing of that
kind, as I remember, hath been so
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:107142:207"/>
much as mention'd. But however,
some sort of Orators, when their hands
are in, omit nothing true or false, that
may move those that they would
work upon. Is not this a worthy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and becoming a Preacher
of the Gospel, to be a Sollicitor for
<hi>Stationers-Hall?</hi> and make the Gain
of the <hi>Gentlemen of</hi> Paul's <hi>Church-yard</hi>
a Consideration, for or against any
Book writ concerning Religion? This,
if it were ever thought on before, no
body but an <hi>Unmasker,</hi> who lays all
open, was ever so foolish as to Publish.
But here you have an account of his
Zeal: The views of Gain are to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the truths of Divinity. Had his
Zeal, as he pretends in the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
no other aims, but the <hi>defence
of the Gospel,</hi> 'tis probable this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
would have been managed after
another fashion.</p>
               <p>Whether what he says in the next,
<hi>p.</hi> 105. to excuse his so o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>know my Heart and Thoughts,</hi>
will satisfie the Reader, I shall not
trouble my self. By his so often doing
it again in his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi>
I see he cannot write without it. And
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:107142:207"/>
so I leave it to the Judgment of the
Readers, whether he can be allow'd
to know other Mens thoughts, who
in many Occasions seems not well to
know his own. The Railing in the
remainder of this Chapter I shall pass
by, as I have done a great deal of the
same strain in his Book: Only to shew
how well he understands or represents
my sense, I shall set down my Words,
as they are in the Pages he quotes,
and his Inferences from them.

of making a Religion for others (and
those that make Creeds do that) being
once got into any one's fancy, must
at last make all Oppositions to those
Creeds and Creed-maker's Irreligion.
Thus we see in process of time it did
in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But it was in
length of time, and by gentle degrees.
The <hi>Unmasker,</hi> it seems, cannot stay,
is in hast, and at one jump leaps into
the Chair. He has given us yet but
a piece of his Creed, and yet that is
enough to set him above the state of
Humane Mistakes or Frailties, and to
mention any such thing in him, is to
do <hi>Irreligiously.</hi>

               <p>

And <hi>yet in many Pages together, most

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:107142:211"/>
the main Articles of Religion as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.
Answ.</hi> In my <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 19.
you may remember these words, <q>I
require you to Publish to the World
those Passages which shew my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Epistles.</q> Why do
you not (especially having been so
called upon to do it) set down those
words, wherein <hi>I most irreverently
treat a great part of the Apostolical
Writings?</hi> At least why do you not
quote those <hi>many Pages</hi> wherein I do
it? This looks a little suspiciously,
that you cannot: And the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have in this very Page not
been sparing to quote places which
you thought to your purpose. I must
take leave therefore (if it may be done
without <hi>Irreligion</hi>) to assure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that this is another of your many
Mistakes in Matters of Fact, for which
you have not so much as the excuse
of Inadvertency: For as he sees, you
have been minded of it before. But
an <hi>Vnmasker,</hi> say what you will to
him, will be an <hi>Unmasker</hi> still.</p>
               <p>He closes what he has to say to me
in his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> as if he
were in the Pulpit, with an Use of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:107142:211"/>
Exhortation. The false Insinuations,
it is filled with, makes the Conclusion
of a Piece with the <hi>Introduction.</hi> As
he sets out so he ends, and therein
shews wherein he places his Strength.
A custom of making bold with Truth,
is so seldom curable in a grown Man,
and the <hi>Unmasker</hi> shews so little sence
of Shame, where it is charged upon
him, beyond a possibility of clearing
himself, that no body is to trouble
themselves any farther about that
part of his established Character. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therefore that alone to Nature
and Custom, two sure Guides, I shall
only intreat him, to prevent his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Railing for Argument, (which I
fear he too often does) that upon his
entrance every where upon any new
Argument, he would set it down in
Syllogism, and when he has done
that (that I may know what is to be
answered) let him then give Vent as
he pleases, to his noble Vein of Wit
and Oratory.</p>
               <p>The lifting a Man's self up in his
own Opinion, has had the Credit in
former Ages to be thought the lowest
Degradation that Humane Nature
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:107142:212"/>
could well sink it self to. Hence says
the Wise Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> XXVI. 6. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
a Fool according to his folly, lest he
be wise in his own conceit.</hi> Hereby
shewing, that Self-conceitedness is a
Degree beneath ordinary Folly. And
therefore he there provides a fence
against it, to keep even Fools from
sinking yet lower, by falling into it.
Whether what was not so in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
days, be now, by length of time, in
ours, grown into a mark of Wisdom
and Parts, and an Evidence of great
Performances; I shall not enquire.
Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>—who goes beyond all
that ever I yet met with in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of his own, best knows
why he so extols what he has done
in this Controversie. For fear the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he has not been sparing of in his

trumpet out his Worth, or
might be forgotten; He in a new Piece
entituled, <hi>The Socinian Creed,</hi> proclaims
again his mighty Deeds, and the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
he has established to himself by
them, in these words; <hi>But he and his
Friends (the One-Article-Men) seem to
have made Satisfaction by their profound
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:107142:212"/>
silence lately, whereby they acknowledge
to the World, that they have nothing
to say in Reply to what I laid to
their Charge, and fully proved against
them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> p. 128. This
fresh Testimony of no ordinary
Conceit, which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath of
the Excellency and Strength of his
Reasoning in his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi>
I leave with him and his Friends to be
considered of at their leisure: And if
they think I have mis-applied the
term of <hi>Conceitedness,</hi> to so Wise, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and every way accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
a Disputant (if we may believe
himself) I will teach them a way how
he, or any body else, may fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me of it. There remains on his
Score marked in this Reply of mine,
several Propositions to be proved by
him. If he can but find Arguments
to prove them that will bear the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
down in form, and will so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
them, I will allow my self to be
mistaken. Nay, which is more, if he
or any body in the 112. Pages of his
<hi>Socinianism Unmasked,</hi> can find but Ten
Arguments that will bear the test of
Syllogism, the true Touchstone of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:107142:213"/>
right Arguing, I will grant that that
Treatise deserves all those Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
he has bestowed upon it;
though it be made up more of his
own Panegyrick, than a Confutation
of me.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>Socinian Creed</hi> (for a <hi>Creed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker</hi>
he will be; and whether he has
been as lucky for the <hi>Socinians</hi> as for
the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> I know not) <hi>p.</hi> 120. he
begins with me, and that with the
same conquering Hand and Skill which
can never fail of Victory; if a Man
has but Wit enough to know what
Proposition he is able to Confute, and
then make that his Adversary's tenet.
But the Repetitions of his old Song
concerning <hi>one Article, the Epistles,</hi> &amp;c.
which occur here again, I shall only
set down, that none of these excellent
things may be lost, whereby this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
and Unanswerable Writer has so
well deserved his own Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>viz.</hi> That I say <hi>there is but one
single Article of the Christian Truth
necessary to be believed and assented to
by us,</hi> p. 121. That I <hi>slight the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Principles, curtail the Articles of
our Faith, and ravish Christianity it
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:107142:213"/>
self from him,</hi> p. 123. And that I
<hi>turn the Epistles of the Apostle into
Waste Paper,</hi> p. 127, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These, and the like Slanders, I
have already given an Answer to in
my Reply to his former Book. Only
one new one here I cannot pass over
in Silence; because of the remarkable
Prophaneness which seems to me to be
in it, which, I think, deserves pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
notice. In my <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> I have laid together those
Passages of our Saviour's Life, which
seemed to me most eminently to shew
his Wisdom, in that Conduct of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with that Reserve and Caution
which was necessary to preserve him,
and carry him through the appointed
time of his Ministry. Some have
thought I had herein done conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Service to the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
by removing those Objections
which some were apt to make from
our Saviour's Carriage, not rightly
understood. This <hi>Creed-maker</hi> tells me,
<hi>p. 127. That I make our Saviour a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard:</hi>
A Word not to be applied to the
Saviour of the World by a Pious or
Discreet Christian upon any pretence,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:107142:214"/>
without great Necessity and sure
Grounds. If he had set down my
words, and quoted the Page (which
was the least could have been done
to excuse such a Phrase) we should
then have seen which of us two this
impious and irreligious Epithete given
to the Holy <hi>Iesus,</hi> has for its Author.
In the mean time, I leave it with him,
to be accounted for by his Piety, to
those, who by his Example shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to entertain so vile a thought,
or use so prophane an Expression of
the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> who free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave himself up to Death for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He also says in the same</hi> p. 127.
that I every where strike at Systems,
the Design of which is to establish one
of my own, or to foster Scepticism, by
beating down all others.</p>
               <p>For clear Reason or good Sence, I
do not think our <hi>Creed-maker</hi> ever had
his fellow. In the immediate prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
words of the same Sentence, he
charges me with <hi>a great Antipathy
against Systems;</hi> and before he comes
to the end of it, finds out my <hi>Design</hi>
to be the <hi>establishing one of my own.</hi> So
that this <hi>my Antipathy against Systems,</hi>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:107142:214"/>
makes me in love with one. My <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi>
he says, <hi>is to establish a System of
my own, or to foster Scepticism in beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down all others.</hi> Let my Book, if
he pleases, be my System of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Now is it in me any more
<hi>fostering Scepticism,</hi> to say my System
is true and others not, than it is in
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> to say so of all other
Systems but his own? For, I hope,
he does not allow any System of
Christianity to be true, that differs
from his any more than I do.</p>
               <p>But I have spoke against all Systems.
<hi>Answ.</hi> And always shall, so far as they
are set up by particular Men or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as the just Measure of every
Man's Faith, wherein every thing
that is contained, is required and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be believed to make a Man
a Christian: Such an Opinion and
Use of Systems I shall always be
against; till the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> shall tell
me amongst the Variety of them
which alone is to be received and
rested in, in the absence of his Creed;
which is not yet finished, and, I fear,
will not as long as I live. That every
Man should receive from others, or
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:107142:215"/>
make to himself such a System of
Christianity as he found most confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the Word of God, according
to the best of his understanding, is
what I never spake against, but think
it every one's Duty to Labour for,
and to take all opportunities as long
as he lives, by Studying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
every day, to perfect.</p>
               <p>But this, I fear, will not go easily
down with our Author; for then he
cannot be a <hi>Creed-maker</hi> for others.
A thing he shews himself very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to, how able to perform it we
shall see when his Creed is made. In
the mean time, talking loudly and at
Random about Fundamentals, without
knowing what is so, may stand him
in some stead.</p>
               <p>This being all that is new, which I
think my self concerned in, in this
<hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> I pass on to his <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script.</hi>
In the first Page whereof, I
find these words, <hi>I found that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager
of the</hi> Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<hi>had prevailed with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to make a Sermon upon my Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that Treatise, and the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it.</hi> Such a piece of Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:107142:215"/>
as this, might have been born
from a fair Adversary. But the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has given of himself
in his <hi>Socinianism Unmask'd,</hi> perswades
me this ought to be bound up with
what he says of me in his <hi>Introduction</hi>
to that Book in these words: <hi>Among
others, they thought and made Choice of
a Gentleman, who they knew would be
extraordinary useful to them. And he
it is probable was as forward to be made
use of by them, and presently accepted
of the Office that was assigned him;</hi> and
more there to the same purpose. All
which, I know to be utterly false.</p>
               <p>'Tis pity that one who relies so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
upon it, should have no better
an Invention. The <hi>Socinians</hi> set the
Author of the <hi>Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. on Work to write that
Book, by which Discovery, the World
being (as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> says) <hi>let into
the project,</hi> that Book is confounded,
<hi>baffled,</hi> blown off, and by this Skilful
Artifice there is an end of it. Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
preaches and publishes a Sermon
without this irrefragable Gentleman's
good Leave and Liking: What now
must be done to discredit it and keep
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:107142:216"/>
it from being read? Why, Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
too, was set on Work by <hi>the Manager
of the Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
In your whole Store-house of Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems,
you that are so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
Have you but this one Way
to destroy a Book which you set your
Mightiness against, but to tell the
World it was a Jobb of Journey-work
for some body you do not like? Some
other would have done better in this
new Case, had your happy Invention
been ready with it: For you are not
so bashful or reserved, but that you
may be allowed to be as great a Wit
as he who professed himself ready at
any time to say a good or a new thing
if he could but think of it. But in
good earnest, Sir, if one should ask
you, do you think no Books contain
Truth in them which were Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by the <hi>Procuration</hi> of a Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller?
I desire you to be a little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Point, not knowing how
far it may reach. Ay, but such Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
live not at the <hi>Lower End of
Pater-Noster-Row,</hi> but in <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard,</hi>
and are the Managers of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guess
Books, than <hi>The Reasonableness
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:107142:216"/>
of Christianity.</hi> And therefore you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rightly subjoin, <hi>Indeed it was a
great Master-Piece of Procuration, and
we can't but think that Man must speak
truth, and defend it very Impartially
and Substantially, who is thus brought
on to undertake the Cause.</hi> And so
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Sermon is found to have
neither Truth nor Sence in it, because
it was Printed by a Bookseller at the
lower End of <hi>Pater-Noster-Row;</hi> for
that, I dare say, is all you know of
the Matter. But that is hint enough
for a happy Diviner to be sure of the
rest, and with Confidence to report
that for certain Matter of Fact, which
had never any being but in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casting
Side of his Politick Brain.</p>
               <p>But whatever were the Reason that
moved Mr. <hi>B</hi>—to Preach that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
of which I know nothing; This
I am sure, it shews only the Weakness
and Malice (I will not say, and ill
Breeding, for that concerns not one of
Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Pitch) of any one who
excepts against it, to take notice of
any thing more than what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has Published. Therein alone
consists the Errour, if there be any;
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:107142:217"/>
and that alone those meddle with, who
write for the sake of Truth. But poor
Cavillers have other Purposes, and
therefore must use other Shifts, and
make a bustle about something besides
the Argument to prejudice and beguile
unwary Readers.</p>
               <p>The only Exception the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
makes to Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Sermon,
is the Contradiction he imputes to
him, in saying, <q>That there is but
one Point or Article necessary to
be believed for the making a Man
a Christian: And that there are
many Points <hi>besides this,</hi> which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ hath taught and revealed,
which every sincere Christian is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
obliged to endeavour to
understand:</q> And, <q>That there
are particular Points and Articles,
which being known to be revealed
by Christ, Christians must indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
assent to.</q> And where now
is there any thing like a Contradiction
in this? Let it be granted for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s Set of
Articles (let their Number be what
they will when he has sound them all
out) are necessary to be believed, for
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:107142:217"/>
the making a Man a Christian. Is there
any contradiction in it to say, There
are many Points besides these, which
Jesus Christ hath taught and revealed,
which every sincere Christian is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
obliged to endeavour to
understand? If this be not so; It
is but for any one to be perfect in
Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Creed, and then he may
lay by the Bible, and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
he is absolutely dispensed with,
from studying or understanding any
thing more of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Supremacy, is
not yet so far established that he will
dare to say, That Christians are not
obliged to endeavour to understand
any other Points revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but what are contained in his
Creed. He cannot yet well Discard all
the rest of the Scripture; because he
has yet need of it for the compleating
of his Creed, which is like to secure
the Bible to us for some time yet.
For I will be answerable for it, he
will not be quickly able to resolve
what Texts of the Scripture do, and
what do not contain Points necessary
to be believed. So that I am apt to
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:107142:218"/>
imagine, that the <hi>Creed-maker,</hi> upon
Second Thoughts, will allow that
Saying, There is but One, or there
are but Twelve, or there are but as
many as he shall set down (when he
has resolved which they shall be) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the making a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
and the saying, There are other
Points besides contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which every sincere Christian
is indispensibly obliged to endeavour
to understand, and must believe when
he knows them to be revealed by
Jesus Christ; are two Propositions that
may consist together without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
               <p>Every Christian is to partake of
that Bread and that Cup which is the
Communion of the Body and Blood
of Christ. And is not every sincere
Christian indispensibly obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to understand these Words of
our Saviour's Institutions, <hi>This is my
Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood?</hi> And if
upon his serious Endeavour to do it,
he does understand them in a literal
sence, that Christ meant that that
was really his Body and Blood, and
nothing else; must he not necessarily
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:107142:218"/>
believe that the Bread and Wine in
the Lord's Supper, is changed really
into his Body and Blood, though he
doth not know how? Or, if having
his Mind set otherwise, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Bread and Wine to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Body and Blood of Christ;
without ceasing to be true Bread and
Wine; Or else, if he understands them,
that the Body and Blood of Christ
are verily and indeed given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Sacrament, in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
manner; Or lastly, If he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
our Saviour to mean by those
words, only the Bread and Wine to
be a Representation of his Body and
Blood; In which was soever of these
Four, a Christian understands these
words of our Saviour to be meant by
him, is he not obliged in that sence to
believe them to be true, and assent to
them? Or can he be a Christian, and
understand these words to be meant by
our Saviour, in one sence, and deny his
assent to them as true, in that sence?
Would not this be to deny our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Veracity, and consequently his
being the <hi>Messiah</hi> sent from God? And
yet this is put upon a Christian where
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:107142:219"/>
he understands the Scripture in one
sence, and is required to believe it in
another. From all which it is evident,
that to say there is One, or any Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Articles necessary to be known
and believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and that there are others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Scripture, which a Man
is obliged to endeavour to understand,
and obliged also to assent to as he
does understand them, is no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>To believe Jesus to be the Messiah,
and to take him to be his Lord and
King, let us suppose to be that only
which is necessary to make a Man a
Christian: May it not yet be necessary
for him, being a Christian, to study
the Doctrine and Law of this his Lord
and King, and believe that all that he
delivered is true? Is there any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in holding of this? But this
<hi>Creed-maker,</hi> to make sure Work, and
not to sail of a Contradiction in
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s words, misrepeats them,
<hi>p.</hi> 241. and quite contrary both to
what they are in the Sermon, and
what they are as set down by the
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> himself, in the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:107142:219"/>
preceding Page; Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> says,
<q>There are other Points that Jesus
Christ hath taught and revealed,
which every sincere Christian is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
<hi>obliged to understand,</hi> and
which being known to be revealed
by Christ, he must indispensibly
assent to.</q> From which, the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
argues thus, <hi>p. 240. Now if there
be other Points and particular Articles,
and those many, which a sincere Christian
is obliged, and that necessarily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly
to understand, believe, and
assent to, then this Writer hath in effect
yielded to that Proposition I maintained,</hi>
viz. <hi>That the belief of one Article is not
sufficient to make a Man a Christian,
and consequently he runs counter to the
Proposition he had laid down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is there no difference, I beseech you,
between being <hi>indispensibly obliged
to endeavour to understand, and being
indispensibly obliged to understand
any Point?</hi> Tis the first of these,
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> says, and 'tis the latter
of these you argue from, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
nothing against him; nor can
you to your purpose. For till Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
says (which he is far from saying)
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:107142:220"/>
that every sincere Christian is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and indispensibly obliged to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all those Texts of Scripture,
from whence you shall have drawn
your necessary Articles (when you
have perfected your Creed) in the
same sence that you do, you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
nothing against what he hath
said concerning that one Article, or
any thing that looks like <hi>running Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to it. For it may be enough to
constitute a Man a Christian, and one
of Christ's Subjects, to take <hi>Iesus</hi> to
be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his appointed King,
and yet without a Contradiction, so
that it may be his indispensible Duty
as a Subject of that Kingdom, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to understand all the Dictates
of his Soveraign, and to assent to the
Truth of them, as far as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
them.</p>
               <p>But that which the good <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
aims at, without which, all his
necessary Articles fall, is that it should
be granted him, that every sincere
Christian was <hi>necessarily and indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
obliged</hi> to understand all those
parts of Divine Revelation, from
whence he pretends to draw his Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:107142:220"/>
in their true meaning, <hi>i. e.</hi> just as
he does. But his infallibility is not yet
so established, but that there will need
some proof of that Proposition. And
when he has proved that every sincere
Christian is <hi>necessarily and indispensibly</hi>
obliged to understand those Texts in
their true meaning, and that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of them is that true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I shall then ask him, whether
<hi>every sincere Christian is not as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and indispensibly obliged</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
other Texts of Scripture, in
their true meaning, though they have
no place in his System?</p>
               <p>For Example, To make use of the
Instance above-mentioned, is not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sincere Christian <hi>necessarily and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensibly</hi>
obliged to endeavour to
understand these Words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
<hi>This is my body, and this is my
blood,</hi> that he may know what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
in the Sacraments? Does he
cease to be a Christian, who happens
not to understand them just as the
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> does? Or may not the
old Gentleman at <hi>Rome</hi> (who has
somewhat the ancienter Title to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility)
make Transubstantiation a
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:107142:221"/>
Fundamental Article necessarily to be
believed, there, as well as the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
here makes his Sence of any
disputed Text of Scripture a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Article necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?</p>
               <p>Let us suppose Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> had said
that instead <hi>of one point,</hi> the Right
Knowledge of the <hi>Creed-makers</hi> One
Hundred Points (when he has resolved
on them) doth constitute and make
a Person a Christian; yet there are
many other Points Jesus Christ hath
taught and revealed which every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Christian is indispensibly obliged
to endeavour to understand, and to
make a due use of: For this I think
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> will not deny. From
whence, in the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s Words,
I will thus argue. <hi>Now if there be
other Points and particular Articles,
and those many, which a sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is obliged, and that necessarily and
indispensibly, to understand and believe,
and assent to, then this Writer doth in
effect yield to that Proposition which I
maintained,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Belief of
those one hundred Articles is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make a Man a Christian.</hi> For
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:107142:221"/>
this is that which I maintain; That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ground, the Belief of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
which he has set down in his
List, are not sufficient to make a Man
a Christian; and that upon Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s
Reason, which the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> insists
on against one <hi>Article, viz.</hi> because
there are many other Points Jesus
Christ hath taught and revealed,
which every sincere Christian is as
necessarily and indispensibly obliged
to endeavour to understand and make
a due use of.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Creed-maker</hi> is cautious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any of his Predecessors: He will
not be so caught by his own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore is very shy to
give you the precise Articles that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sincere Christian is necessarily and
indispensibly obliged to understand, and
give his assent to. Something he is sure
there is that he is indispensibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to understand and assent to, to
make him a Christian; but what that
is, he cannot yet tell. So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a Christian or no, he does
not know, and what other People will
think of him, from his treating of the
serious things of Christianity, in so
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:107142:222"/>
trifling and scandalous a way, must
be left to them.</p>
               <p>In the next Paragraph, <hi>p.</hi> 242. The
Creed-maker <hi>tells us, Mr.</hi> Bold <hi>goes
on to confute himself, in saying,</hi> 
                  <q>a true
Christian must assent unto this
that Christ Jesus is God.</q> But this
is just such another Confutation of
himself as the before-mentioned, <hi>i. e.</hi>
as much as a Falshood substituted by
another Man, can be a confutation of
a Man's self, who has spoken Truth
all of a piece. For the <hi>Creed-maker,</hi>
according to his sure way of <hi>baffling</hi>
his Opponents, so as to leave them
nothing to answer, hath here, as he
did before, changed Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s words,
which in the 35. <hi>p.</hi> quoted by the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
stand thus; <q>When a true
Christian understands that Christ
Jesus hath taught that <hi>He is a God,</hi>
he must assent unto it.</q> Which is
true and conformable to what he had
said before; that every sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
must endeavour to understand
the Points taught and revealed by
Jesus Christ, which being known to be
revealed by him he must assent unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:107142:222"/>
The like piece of Honesty the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
shews in the next Paragraph,
<hi>p.</hi> 243. where he charges Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
with saying <hi>that a true Christian is as
much obliged to believe that the Holy
Spirit is God, as to believe that Iesus
is the Christ,</hi> p. 40. In which place,
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s words are; <q>When a
true Christian understands that
Christ Jesus hath given this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Holy Spirit, <hi>viz,</hi> That
<hi>he is God;</hi> He is as much obliged
to believe it, as he is to believe that
<hi>Iesus is the Christ.</hi>
                  </q> Which is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contestable
Truth, but such an one as
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> himself saw would
do him no Service, and therefore he
mingles it, and leaves out half to make
it serve his turn. But he that should
give a Testimony in the slight Affairs
of Men, and their Temporal Concerns,
before a Court of Judicature, as the
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> does here, and almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, in the great Affairs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the Everlasting Concern of
Souls, before all Mankind, would lose
his Ears for it. What therefore this
worthy Gentleman alledges out of
Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> as a Contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:107142:223"/>
being only the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to Truth and clear Matter
of Fact, needs no other Answer.</p>
               <p>The rest of what he calls <hi>Reflections
on Mr. Bold</hi>'s <hi>Sermon,</hi> being nothing
but either rude and mis-becoming Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of him; Or pitiful Childish Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him, to change his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
at the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s Intreaty,
and give up the Truth he hath owned,
in Courtesie to this doubty Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
shews the Ability of the Man.
Leave off begging the Question, and
superciliously presuming that you are
in the right, and instead of that, shew
it by Argument; And I dare answer
for Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> you will have him, and
I promise you with him one Convert
more. But Arguing is not, it seems,
this notable Disputant's way. If Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of himself, and contemning others,
false Quotations, and feigned Matters
of Fact, which the Reader neither can
know, nor is the Question concerned
in if he did know, will not do, there
is an end of him; He has shewn his
excellency in scurrilous Declamation,
and there you have the whole of this
unanswerable Writer. And for this,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:107142:223"/>
I appeal to his own Writings in this
Controversie, if any judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
can have the patience to look them
over.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his Reflections
on Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Sermon, he confidently
tells the World, That <hi>he had found
that the Manager of</hi> the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christianity, <hi>had prevailed on
Mr.</hi> Bold <hi>to Preach a Sermon upon his
Reflections,</hi> &amp;c. And adds, <hi>And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think, that that Man must speak
the truth, and defend it very impartially
and substantially, who is thus brought on
to undertake the Cause.</hi> And at the
latter end, he Addresses himself to
Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> as one that is <hi>drawn off</hi> to
be an under Journey-man Worker in
<hi>Socinianism.</hi> In his gracious Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<hi>Mr.</hi> Bold <hi>is seemingly a Man of
some relish of Religion and Piety,</hi> p. 244.
He is forced also to own him to be a
Man of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> p. 245.
A very good rise, to give him out to the
World, in the very next words, as a Man
of a profligate Conscience: For so he
must be, who can be <hi>drawn off</hi> to
Preach or Write for <hi>Socinianism,</hi> when
he thinks it a most dangerous Errour,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:107142:224"/>
who can <hi>dissemble with himself,</hi> and
<hi>choak his inward Perswasions</hi> (as the
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> insinuates that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
does in the same Address to him,
<hi>p.</hi> 248.) and write contrary to his
Light. Had the <hi>Creed maker</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think in earnest that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
was going off to <hi>Socinianism,</hi> he might
have reasoned with him fairly, as with
a Man running into dangerous Errour:
Or if he had certainly known that he
was by any By-ends prevailed on to
undertake a Cause contrary to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
he might have some Reason
to tell the World as he does, <hi>p.</hi> 239.
<hi>That we cannot think he should speak
truth, who is thus brought to undertake
the Cause.</hi> If he does not certainly
know that Mr. <hi>Bold was THUS
brought to undertake the Cause,</hi> he could
not have shewn a more Villainous and
Unchristian Mind than in publishing
such a Character of a Minister of the
Gospel, and a worthy Man, upon no
other Grounds, but because it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might
be subservient to his ends. He is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in a Controversie that by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
he cannot maintain; Nor
knew any other way from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:107142:224"/>
to attack the Book he pretends
to write against; but by crying out
<hi>Socinianism;</hi> a Name he knows in great
Disgrace with all other Sects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and therefore sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr
all those who approve, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
Books by hearsay, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
their Truth themselves, from
perusing a Treatise to which he could
affix that imputation. Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Name
(who is publickly known to be no <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>)
he foresees will wipe off that
false Imputation, with a great many
of those who are led by Names more
than Things. This seems exceedingly
to trouble him, and he labours might
and main, to get Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> to quit a
Book as <hi>Socinian,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> knows
is not <hi>Socinian;</hi> because he has read
and considered it.</p>
               <p>But though our <hi>Creed-maker</hi> be
mightily concerned that Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>
should not appear in the Defence of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yet this concern cannot raise him one
jot above that Honesty, Skill and good
Breeding, which appears towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
He manages this Matter with
Mr. <hi>B—d,</hi> as he has done the rest of
the Controversie, just in the same
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:107142:225"/>
strain of Invention, Civility, Wit and
good Sence. He tells him, besides
what I have above set down, <hi>that he
is drawn off to debase himself and the
post,</hi> i. e. <hi>the</hi> Ministry, <hi>he is in,</hi> p. 245.
<hi>That he hath said very ill things to the
lessening and impairing, yea, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming
of that knowledge and belief of
our Saviour, and of the Articles of
Christianity, which are necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us,</hi> p. 245. <hi>That the Devout
and Pious</hi> (whereby he means him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for <hi>one</hi> and <hi>none</hi> is his own beloved
Wit and Argument) <hi>observing that
Mr.</hi> Bold <hi>is come to the necessity of but
ONE Article of Faith, they expect that
he may in time hold that NONE is
necessary,</hi> p. 248. <hi>That if he writes
again in</hi> the same <hi>strain, be will write
rather like a Turkish Spy, than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Preacher; That he is a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slider,
and Sailing to</hi> Racovia <hi>with a
side Wind:</hi> Than which, what can there
be more Scurrilous or more Malicious?
And yet at the same time, that he
outrages him thus, beyond not only
what Christian Charity, but common
Civility would allow in an ingenuous
Adversary, he makes some awkward
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:107142:225"/>
Attempts, to sooth him, with some ill
timed Commendations; And would
have his under-valuing Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s
<hi>Animadversions,</hi> pass for a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him: Because he, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
pretends not to believe <hi>so crude
and shallow a thing</hi> (as he is pleased to
call it) to be his. A notable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to gain the greater Liberty of
Railing at him under another Name,
when Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>'s it seems is too well
known to serve him so well to that
purpose. Besides it is of good use to
fill up three or four Pages of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections;</hi>
a great Convenience to a
Writer, who knows all the ways of
<hi>baffling</hi> his Opponents but Argument,
and who always makes a great deal of
stir about Matters foreign to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
which whether they are granted
or denied, make nothing at all to the
Truth of the Question on either side.
For what is it to the <hi>Shallowness</hi> or
Depth of the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> who
writ them? Or to the Truth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>'s Defence of the
<hi>Reasonableness of Christianity</hi> whether
a <hi>Lay-man</hi> or a <hi>Church-man;</hi> a <hi>Socinian,</hi>
or one of the <hi>Church of</hi> England an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:107142:226"/>
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> as well as he?
Yet this is urged as a matter of great
weight. But yet in reality it amounts
to no more but this, that a Man of
any Denomination, who wishes well
to the Peace of Christianity, and has
observed the horrible Effects the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion has felt from the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of Men in Matters of Faith,
may have reason to defend a Book,
wherein the Simplicity of the Gospel,
and the Doctrine proposed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Unbelievers, is made out,
though there be not one Word of the
distinguishing Tenents of his Sect in
it. But that all those, who under any
Name, are for imposing their own
Orthodoxy, as necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and persecuting those who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from them, should be all against
it, is not perhaps very strange.</p>
               <p>One thing more I must observe of
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> on this Occasion: In
his <hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> Ch. VI. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
&amp;c. And his Book, must be judged
of by the Characters and Writings of
those, who entertain or commend his
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:107142:226"/>
Notions. <hi>A professed Unitarian has
defended it;</hi> therefore he is a <hi>Socinian.</hi>
The Author of <hi>A Letter to the Deists,</hi>
speaks well of it, Therefore he is a
<hi>Deist.</hi> Another as an Abettor <hi>of the
Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>p.</hi> 125. whose Letters I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen: And his Opinions too are,
I suppose, set down there as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me. Whatever is bad in the
Tenets or Writings of these Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
me. But the Mischief is, Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s
Orthodoxy will do me no good: But
because he has defended my Book
against Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> all my Faults are
become his, and he has a mighty
Load of Accusations laid upon him.
Thus contrary Causes serve so good a
Natured, so Charitable and Candid a
Writer as the <hi>Creed-maker,</hi> to the same
purpose of Censure and Railing. But
I shall desire him to figure to himself
the Loveliness of that Creature which
turns every thing into Venom. What
others are, or hold, who have expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
favourable thoughts of my Book,
I think my self not concerned in. What
Opinions others have published, make
those in my Book neither true nor
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:107142:227"/>
false; and he that for the sake of
Truth would confute the Errors in it,
should shew their Falshood and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as they are there: But they who
write for other Ends than Truth, are
always busie with other Matters, and
where they can do nothing by Reason
and Argument, hope to prevail with

Party.</p>
               <p>Taking therefore the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
as well as the <hi>Sermon,</hi> to be his
whose Name they bear, I shall leave
to Mr. <hi>B—d,</hi> himself to take what
Notice he thinks fit of the little Sence
as well as great Impudence of putting
his Name in Print to what is not his;
or taking it away from what he hath
set it to; whether it belongs to his
<hi>Bookseller</hi> or <hi>Answerer.</hi> Onely I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pass by the palpable falsifying of
Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>'s Words, in the beginning
of his Epistle to the Reader, without
mention. Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>'s Words are,
<q>Whereby I came to be furnished
with a truer and more just No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the main Design of that
<hi>TREATISE</hi>
                  </q> and the Good
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> set them down thus, <hi>The
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:107142:227"/>
main Design of MY OWN TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISE
OR SERMON:</hi> A sure
way for such a Champion for Truth
to secure to himself the Laurel or the
Whetstone.</p>
               <p>This irresistible Disputant (who si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
all that come in his way, so
that those that would cannot answer
him) to make good the mighty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums
he has given himself, ought
(one would think) to clear all as he
goes, and leave nothing by the way
unanswered, for fear he should fall into
the Number of those poor <hi>baffled</hi>
Wretches whom he with so much
scorn reproaches, that they <hi>would</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<hi>if they could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B—d</hi> begins his <hi>Animadversions</hi>
with this Remark, that our <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
had said, That <hi>I give it over
and over again in these formal Words,</hi>
viz. <hi>That nothing is required to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by any Christian Man but this,
That Iesus is the Messiah.</hi> To which
Mr. <hi>B—d</hi> replies, <hi>p.</hi> 4. in these Words,
<q>Though I have read over the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. with
some Attention, I have not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
those formal Words in any part
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:107142:228"/>
of that Book, nor any Words that
are capable of that Construction;
provided they be consider'd with
the Relation they have to, and the
manifest Dependance they have on
what goes before, or follows after
them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                  </hi> answers
not.</p>
               <p>Whether it was because <hi>he would
not,</hi> or because he <hi>could not,</hi> let the
Reader judge. But this is down upon
his Score already, and it is expected
he should answer to it, or else confess
that he <hi>cannot.</hi> And that there may
be a fair Decision of this Dispute.
I expect the same Usage from him,
that he should set down any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of his, I have not answer'd to,
and call on me for an Answer, if <hi>I
can.</hi> And if <hi>I cannot,</hi> I promise him to
own it in Print.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Creed-maker <hi>had said,</hi> That it
is most evident to any thinking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
Person, that I purposely omit
the Epistolary Writings of the Apostles,
because they are fraught with other
Fundamental Doctrines, besides that
which I mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:107142:228"/>
To this Mr. <hi>B—d</hi> answers, <hi>p.</hi> 5.
<q>That if by <hi>Fundamental Articles,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> means here, all the
Propositions delivered in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
concerning just those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Heads he [Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>] had
there mentioned, it lies upon him
to prove, That Jesus Christ hath
made it necessary, that every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
must have an explicit Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Belief of all those, before
he can be a Christian.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                  </hi> answers
not.</p>
               <p>And yet without an Answer to it,
all his Talk about <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and
those which he pretended to set down
in that place, under the Name of
<hi>Fundamentals,</hi> will signifie nothing in
the present case; Wherein, by <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi>
were meant such Propositions
which every Person must necessarily
have an explicit Knowledge and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of, before he can be a Christian.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>B—d,</hi> in the same place, <hi>p.</hi> 6,
and 7. very truly and pertinently adds,
<q>That it did not pertain to [my]
undertaking to enquire what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:107142:229"/>
either in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> or
the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and the <hi>Acts,</hi> were
of greatest moment to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by them who are Christians,
but what was necessary to be
known and believed to a Person's
being a Christian. For there are
many important Doctrines, both
in the <hi>Gospels</hi> and in the <hi>Acts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, <hi>That Iesus is the Messiah.</hi>
But how many soever the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
be, which are taught in the
<hi>Epistles,</hi> if there be no Doctrine
besides this, <hi>That Iesus is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
taught there as necessary to
be believed to make a Man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
all the Doctrines taught
there will not make any thing
against what this Author has as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
nor against the Method he
hath observed; Especially, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
we have an Account in
the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> of what
those Persons by whom the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were writ, did teach as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be believed to Peoples
being Christians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, and what Mr. <hi>B—d</hi> subjoins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <q>That it was not my design to give
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:107142:229"/>
an Abstract of any of the inspired
Books</q>, is so true, and has so clear
Reason in it, that any but this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
would have thought himself
concerned to have answered some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to it.</p>
               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                  </hi> answers
not.</p>
               <p>It not being it seems a <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s
Business to convince Mens Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by Reason, but to impose
on their Belief by Authority, or
where that is wanting, by Falshoods
and Bauling. And to such Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
observes well, <hi>p.</hi> 8. that <q>if I had
given the like Account of the
Epistles, that would have been as
little satisfactory as what I have
done already, to those who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
not to distinguish <hi>BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TWIXT
WHAT IS NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSARY
TO BE BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIEVED
TO MAKE A
MAN A CHRISTIAN, AND
THOSE ARTICLES WHICH
ARE TO BE BELIEVED
BY THOSE WHO ARE
CHRISTIANS,</hi> as they can
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:107142:230"/>
attain to know, that Christ hath
taught them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Distinction the <hi>Creed-maker,</hi>
no where that I remember, takes any
Notice of; unless it be <hi>p.</hi> 255. where
he has something relating hereunto,
which we shall consider when we
come to that place. I shall now go
on to shew what Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> has said,
to what he answers not.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> farther tells him, <hi>p.</hi> 10.
That if he will prove any thing in
Opposition to the <hi>Reasonableness of
Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. it must be this;
<q>That Jesus Christ and his Apostles
have taught, that the Belief of
some one Article, or certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Articles distinct from this,
<hi>That Iesus is the Messiah,</hi> either as
exclusive of, or in Conjunction
with the Belief of this Article, doth
constitute and make a Person a
Christian: But that the Belief of
this, that Jesus is the Messias alone,
doth not make a Man a Christian</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                  </hi> irresraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
answers nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:107142:230"/>
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> also, <hi>p.</hi> 10. Charges him
with his falsly accusing me in these
words: <hi>He pretends to contend for one
single Article, with the exclusion of all
the rest, for this reason; because all
Men ought to understand their Religion.</hi>
And again where he says I aim at this,
viz. <hi>That we must not have any Point of
Doctrine in our Religion, that the Mob
doth not at the very first naming of
it, perfectly understand and agree to,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> has quoted my express
words to the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to this,</hi> this answerable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>answers nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if he be such a mighty Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
that nothing can stand in his way;
I shall expect his direct Answer to it,
among those other Propositions which
I have set down to his Score, and I
require him to prove if he can.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Creed-maker</hi> spends Five Pages
of his Reflections in a great stir who
is the Author of those <hi>Animadversions</hi>
he is <hi>Reflecting</hi> on. To which, I tell
him, it matters not to a Lover of
Truth, or a Confuter of Errours, who
was the Author; but what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:107142:231"/>
He, who makes such a deal of
doe about that which is nothing to
the Question, shews he has but little
Mind to the Argument; that his hopes
are more in the recommendation of
Names and prejudice of Parties, than
in the Strength of his Reasons and
the goodness of his Cause. A Lover
of Truth follows That, whoever be for
or against it; and can suffer himself to
pass by no Argument of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
without taking notice of it either
in allowing its force, or giving it a fair
Answer. Were the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of giving such an Evidence as this,
of his Love of Truth, he would not
have passed over the Twenty first
Pages of Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s <hi>Animadversions</hi> in
silence. The Falshoods that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
charged upon him would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
an Answer of him, if he <hi>could</hi>
have given any: And I tell him he must
give an Answer, or confess the Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his</hi> 255. p. <hi>he comes to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of these words of Mr.</hi> Bold, <hi>in the
21. Page of his</hi> Animadversions, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That a Convert to Christianity or
a Christian, must necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:107142:231"/>
as many Articles as he shall
attain to know that Christ Jesus
hath taught</hi>
                  </q>. Which, <hi>says the
Creed-maker,</hi> wholly invalidates what
he had said before in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That</hi> Iesus Christ, <hi>and his</hi> Apostles,
<hi>did not teach any thing as necessary
to be believed to make a Man a
Christian, but only this one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
That</hi> Iesus of Nazareth
was the Messiah. </q>
                  <hi>The reason he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to shew, That the former of
these Propositions, (in Mr.</hi> Bold) invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
<hi>the latter, and that</hi> the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter
contradicts himself, <hi>stands thus:</hi>
For, <hi>says he,</hi> if a Christian must give
assent to all the Articles taught by our
Saviour in the Gospel, and that necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily;
then all those Propositions reckon'd
up in my late Discourse, being taught
by Christ or his Apostles, are necessary
to be believed. Answ. <hi>And what, I
beseech you, becomes of the rest of
the Propositions</hi> taught by Christ or his
Apostles, <hi>which you have not</hi> reckon'd
up in your late Discourse; <hi>Are not
they necessary to be believed,</hi> if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
must give an assent to ALL the
Articles taught by our Saviour and his
Apostles?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:107142:232"/>
Sir, If you will argue right from
that antecedent, it must stand thus:
<hi>If a Christian must give an assent to
ALL the Articles taught by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and his Apostles, and that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily;</hi>
Then all the Propositions in
the New Testament, taught by Christ
or his Apostles, are necessarily to be
believed. This Consequence I grant
to be true, and necessarily to follow
from that antecedent, and pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your best of it: But withal reme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ber,
that it puts an utter end to your
select Number of Fundamentals, and
makes all the Truths delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
the New Testament necessary to be
explicitly believed by every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>But Sir, I must take notice to you,
that if it be uncertain whether he
that Writ the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> be the
same Person that Preached the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
yet it is very visible that 'tis
the very same Person that reflects on
both; Because he here again uses the
same Trick in answering in the <hi>Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversions,</hi>
the same thing that had
been said in the <hi>Sermon,</hi> viz. By
pretending to argue from words as
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:107142:232"/>
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s, when Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> has said no
such thing. The Proposition you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
from here is this, <hi>If a Christian
must give assent to all the Articles
taught by our Saviour, and that necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> says no such thing.
His words, as set down by your self
are; <q>A Christian must necessarily
believe as many Articles as he shall
attain to know that Christ Jesus hath
taught. </q>And is there no difference
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ween <hi>ALL that Christ Iesus hath
taught; and AS MANY as any one
shall attain to know that Christ Iesus hath
taught?</hi> There is so great a difference
between these two, that one can scarce
think even such a <hi>Creed-maker</hi> could
mistake it. For one of them admits
all those to be Christians, who taking
<hi>Iesus</hi> for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> their Lord and
King, sincerely apply themselves to
understand and obey his Doctrine and
Law, and do believe all that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
to be taught by him: The
other shuts out, if not all Mankind,
yet Nine Hundred Ninety Nine of a
Thousand, of those who profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Christians, from being really so.
For he speaks within Compass, who
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:107142:233"/>
says there is not one of a Thousand,
if there be any one Man at all, who
explicitly knows and believes that all
that our Saviour and his Apostles
taught, <hi>i. e.</hi> All that is delivered in
the New Testament, in the true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence
that it is there intended. For if giving
assent to it, in any sence, will serve
the turn, our <hi>Creed-maker</hi> can have
no Exceptions against <hi>Socinians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
Lutherans,</hi> or any other, who
acknowledging the Scripture to be the
Word of God, do yet oppose his
System.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> goes on, <hi>p.</hi> 255.
and endeavours to prove, that what
is necessary to be believed by every
Christian, is necessary to be believed
to make a Man a Christian, in these
words: <hi>But he will say, the belief of
those Propositions,</hi> makes not a Man a
Christian. <hi>Then, I say, they are not
necessary and indispensible; for what is
absolutely necessary in Christianity, is
absolutely requisite to make a Man a
Christian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ignorance, or something worse,
makes our <hi>Creed-maker</hi> always speak
doubtfully or obscurely, whenever he
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:107142:233"/>
pretends to argue; for here <hi>absolutely
necessary in Christianity</hi> either signifies
nothing, but absolutely necessary to
make a Man a Christian; and then
it is proving the same Proposition by
the same Proposition: Or else, has a
very obscure and doubtful Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For, if I ask him whether it <hi>be
absolutely necessary in Christianity</hi> to
obey every one of our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
what will he answer me? If
he answers, <hi>NO;</hi> I ask him which of
our Saviour's Commands is it not <hi>in
Christianity absolutely necessary</hi> to obey?
If he answers, <hi>YES;</hi> Then I tell him
by his rule, there are no Christians;
because there is no one that does in
all things obey all our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and therein fails to perform
what is <hi>absolutely necessary in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;</hi>
and so by his rule is no
Christian. If he answers, Sincere En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to obey, is all that is <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary;</hi> I reply, And so Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Endeavour to understand, is all
that is <hi>absolutely necessary:</hi> Neither
perfect Obedience, nor perfect Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is <hi>absolutely necessary in
Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:107142:234"/>
But his Proposition being put in
terms clear, and not loose and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
should stand thus, <hi>viz. What
is absolutely necessary to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is absolutely requisite to make a
Man a Christian:</hi> But then I deny
that he can inferr from Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s
words, that those Propositions (<hi>i. e.</hi>
which he has set down as Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
or necessary to be believed) ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to be believed by
every Christian. For that indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
necessity Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> speaks of, is
not absolute, but conditional. His
words are, <hi>A Christian must believe
as many Articles as he shall attain
to know that Iesus Christ hath taught.</hi>
So that he places the indispensible
necessity of Believing, upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of attaining to know that
Christ taught so. An endeavour to
know what <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> taught, Mr.
B—dsays truely is <hi>absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
to every one who is a Christian,
and to believe what he has attained
to know that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> taught,
that also, he says, is <hi>absolutely necessary</hi>
to every Christian. But all this grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as true it is) it still remains (and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:107142:234"/>
eternally will remain) to be proved
from this (which is all that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
says) that something else is absolutely
required to make a Man a Christian,
besides the unfeigned taking <hi>Iesus</hi> to
be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his King and Lord,
and accordingly, a sincere resolution
to obey and believe all that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
and taught.</p>
               <p>The Jailor, <hi>Acts</hi> XVI. 30. in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to his Question, what he
should <hi>do to be saved;</hi> was answer'd,
That <hi>he should believe in the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</hi> And the Text says that
the Jailor <hi>took them the same hour
of the night, and washed their stripes,
and was baptized, he and all his
straight-way.</hi> Now, I will ask our
<hi>Creed-maker,</hi> whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> in
speaking to him the <hi>Word of the
Lord,</hi> proposed and explained to him
all those Propositions and <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Heads of Doctrine,</hi> which our
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> has set down as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be believed to make a Man a
Christian. Let it be consider'd, the
Jailor was a Heathen, and one that
seems to have no more Sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or Humanity, than those of
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:107142:235"/>
that Calling use to have: For he had
let them alone under the Pain of their
Stripes without any Remedy, or so
much as the ease of washing them,
from the Day before, till after his
Conversion, which was not till after
Midnight. And can any one think
that between his asking what he
should <hi>do to be saved,</hi> and his being
<hi>baptized,</hi> which the Text says, was
<hi>the same hour</hi> and <hi>straightway,</hi> there
was time enough for St. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Silas</hi> to explain to him all the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s
Articles, and make such a Man
as that, and all his house understand
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s whole System;
especially since we hear nothing of
it in the Conversion of these or
any others who were brought into
the Faith in the whole History of the
Preaching of our Saviour and the
Apostles? Now let me ask our <hi>Creed-maker,</hi>
whether the Jailor was not a
Christian, when he was baptized; and
whether if he had then immediately
died, he had not been saved, without
the Belief of any one Article more
than what <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had then
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aught him? Whence it follows, that
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:107142:235"/>
what was then proposed to him to be
believed (which appears to be nothing
but that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messiah</hi>) was
all that was absolutely necessary to
be believed to make him a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
though this hinders not but
that afterwards it might be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for him, indispensibly necessary,
to believe other Articles, when he
attained to the Knowledge that Christ
had taught them. And the reason
of it is plain: Because the knowing
that Christ taught any thing, and
the not receiving it for true, (which
is believing it) is inconsistent with the
believing him to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> sent
from God to inlighten and save the
World. Every word of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
is absolutely and indispensibly
necessary to be believed, by every
Christian, as soon as he comes to
know it to be taught by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
or his Apostles, or to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation. But yet this is far
enough from making it absolutely
necessary to every Christian to know
every Text in the Scripture, much
less to understand every Text in the
Scripture; and least of all, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:107142:236"/>
it as the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> is pleased
to put his sence upon it.</p>
               <p>This the good <hi>Creed-maker</hi> either
will not, or cannot understand: But
gives us a List of Articles culled out
of the Scripture by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and tells us those are absolutely
necessary to be believed by every one,
to make him a Christian. For what
is of <hi>absolute Necessity in Christianity,</hi>
as those he says are, he tells us is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
requisite to <hi>make a Man a
Christian.</hi> But when he is asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these are all the Articles of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Necessity, to be believed to
make a Man a Christian; This wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Divine, that takes upon him to
be a Successor of the Apostles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell. And yet, having taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him also to be a <hi>Creed-maker,</hi> he
must suffer himself to be called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for it again and again, till he tells
us what is of absolute Necessity to be
believed to make a Man a Christian,
or confess that he cannot.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, I take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to say, That every Proposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the New Testament by our
Saviour, or his Apostles, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:107142:236"/>
by any Christian as of Divine
Revelation, is of as absolute necessity
to be assented to by him, in the
Sence he understands it to be taught
by them, as any one of those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
enumerated by the <hi>Creed-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:</hi>
And if he thinks otherwise, I
shall desire him to prove it. The
Reason whereof is this, that in divine
Revelation the ground of Faith being
onely the Authority of the Proposer,
where that is the same, there is no
difference in the Obligation or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of believing. Whatever the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi>
that came from God taught, is
equally to be believed by every one
who receives him as the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as
soon as he understands what it was
he taught. There is no such thing as
garbling his Doctrine, and making
one part of it more necessary to be
believed than another, when it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
His saying is, and must
be, of unquestionable Authority to all
that receive him as their heavenly
King; and carries with it an equal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of assent to all that he says
as true. But since no Body can expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly
assent to any Proposition of our
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:107142:237"/>
Saviour's as true, but in the Sence he
understands our Saviour to have spoken
it in, the same Authority of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi>
his King, obliges every one abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and indispensibly to believe
every part of the New Testament in
that Sence he understands it: For
else he rejects the Authority of the
Deliverer, if he refuses his Assent to
it in that Sence which he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
it was delivered in. But the
taking him for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his King
and Lord, laying upon every one
who is his Subject, and Obligation to
endeavour to know his Will in all
things, every true Christian is under
an absolute and indispensible necessity,
by being his Subject, to study the
Scriptures with an unprejudiced mind,
according to that Measure of Time,
Opportunity, and Helps which he
has; that in these sacred Writings, he
may find what his Lord and Master
hath by himself, or by the Mouths
of his Apostles, required of him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be believed or done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Creed-maker, <hi>in the following
Page, 256. hath these Words;</hi> It is
worth the Reader's observing, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:107142:237"/>
I had in twelve Pages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
(<hi>viz.</hi> from the Eighth to the
Twentieth) proved that several Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
are necessary to be believed by
us, in order to our being Christians;
yet this Sham-Animadverter attends
not to any one of the particulars which
I had mentioned, nor offers any thing
against them, but onely in a Lumping
way, dooms them all in those magisterial
Words; <hi>I do not see any Proof he
produces,</hi> p. 21. This is his wonderful
way of confuting me, by pretending that
he cannot see any Proof in what I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and all the World must be led
by his eyes.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>It is worth the Reader's obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
That the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> does not
reply to what Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> has said to
him, as we have already seen, and
shall see more as we go on; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he has little reason to complain
of him, for not having answered
enough. Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> did well to leave
that which was an insignificant <hi>lump,</hi>
so as it was together: For 'tis no
<hi>wonderful</hi> thing <hi>not to see any Proof,</hi>
where there is no Proof. There is
indeed, in those Pages the <hi>Creed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:107142:238"/>
mentions, much Confidence, much
Assertion, a great many Questions
asked, and a great deal said after his
Fashion: But for a Proof, I deny there
is any one: And if what I have said
in another place already, does not
convince him of it, I challenge him,
with all his <hi>Eyes</hi> and those of the
<hi>World</hi> to boot, to find out in those
Twelve renowned Pages one Proof.
Let him set down the Proposition,
and his Proof of its being absolutely
and indispensibly necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian;
And I too, will join with him in his
Testimonial of himself, that he is <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable.</hi>
But I must tell him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
talking a great deal loosely
will not do it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> and I say we cannot see
any Proof in those Twelve Pages:
The way to make us <hi>see,</hi> or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the World that we are blind,
is to single out one Proof out of that
Wood of Words there, which you
seem to take for Arguments, and set
it down in a Syllogism, which is the
fair trial of a Proof or no Proof. You
have indeed a Syllogism in the 23<hi>d.</hi>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:107142:238"/>
Page, but that is not in those Twelve
Pages you mention. Besides, I have
shew'd in another place, what that
proves; to which I referr you.</p>
               <p>In Answer to the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s
Question, about his other Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
found in the Epistles; <hi>Why did
the Apostles Write these Doctrines?
Was it not, that those they Writ to,
might give their Assent to them?</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bold, p.</hi> 22. replies; <q>But then
it may be asked again, Were not
those Persons Christians, to whom
the Apostles writ <hi>these Doctrines,</hi>
and whom they required to Assent to
them? <hi>Yes, verily:</hi> And if so, What
was it that made them Christians,
before their Assent to <hi>these Doctrines</hi>
was required? If it were any thing
besides their Believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> it ought to be instanced
in, and made out.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to this</hi> Mr. Edwards <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing in Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> and the <hi>Creed-maker,</hi>
(for I follow Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>'s Order,) is
about a Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> has proved,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:107142:239"/>
                  <q>That <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and his Apostles
have taught, That no Man can be
a Christian, or shall be saved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he have an explicit <hi>Knowledge of
all those things which have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
respect to the Occasion, Author,
Way, Means and Issue of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and which are necessary for the
knowing the true Nature and Design
of it?</hi>
                  </q> This, Mr. <hi>Bold, p.</hi> 24.
tells him <q>he has not done.</q> To
this the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> replies, <hi>p.</hi> 258.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet the Reader may satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that this is the very thing that
I had been proving just before, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
all along in the foregoing Chapter.
Answ.</hi> There have been those who
have been seven Years proving a thing,
which at last they could not do;
And I give you seven Years to prove
this Proposition which you should
there have proved, and I must add
to your score here, <hi>viz.</hi>

[the Animadverter] <hi>hath the confidence
to say,</hi> p. 31. viz. <hi>There is no Enquiry
in the Reasonableness of Christianity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Faith subjectively considered, but
only objectively,</hi> &amp;c. And thus having
set down Mr. <hi>B—d</hi>'s Words otherwise
than they are; for Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> does not
say <hi>there is no Enquiry,</hi> i. e. no Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(for so the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> explains
<hi>Enquiries</hi> here. For to convince
Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> that there is an <hi>Enquiry,
i. e.</hi> Mention of <hi>Subjective Faith,</hi> he
alledges, That Subjective Faith is
<hi>spoken of</hi> in the 191. and 192. <hi>pages</hi> of
my Book.) But Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> says, not
that Faith considered subjectively, is
<hi>not spoken of</hi> any where in the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. But
<q>That the Author's <hi>Enquiry</hi> and
<hi>Search, (i. e.</hi> the Author's Search,
or Design of his Search) was not
concerning Christian Faith consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
subjectively:</q> And thus the
<hi>Creed-maker</hi> imposing on his Reader,
by perverting Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Sence, from
what was the Intention of my <hi>Enquiry
and Search,</hi> to what I had said in it,
he goes on, after his scurrilous fashion,
to insult, in these words which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:107142:241"/>
                  <hi>I say, it may be guessed from
this, what a Liberty this Writer takes,
to assert what he pleases.</hi> Answ. <hi>To
assert what one pleases,</hi> without Truth,
and without Certainty, is the worst
Character can be given a Writer:
And with Falshood to charge it on
another, is no mean Slander and
Injury to a Man's Neighbour. And
yet to these shameful Arts must he
be driven, who finding his strength of
managing a Cause, to lie only in
Fiction and Falshood, has no other
but the dull <hi>Billinsgate</hi> way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it, by endeavouring to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Reader's Observation and
Censure from himself, by a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
repeated Imputation of that to
his Adversary, which he himself is so
frequent in the Commission of. And
of this, the Instances I have given,
are a sufficient Proof: In which I
have been at the Pains to set down
the Words on both Sides, and the
Pages where they are to be found, for
the Reader's full Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Cause in Debate between us
is of great Weight, and concerns
every Christian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That any Evidence
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:107142:242"/>
in the Proposal, or Defence of it, can
be sufficient to conquer all Men's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
is a Vanity to imagine. But
this, I think, I may justly demand of
every Reader, that since there are
great and visible Falshoods on one
side or the other, (for the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this kind are positive and
frequent,) he would examine on which
Side they are; And upon that, I
will venture the Cause in any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Judgment, who will be but at the
pains of turning to the Pages marked
out to him; And as for him that will
not do that, I care not much what
he says.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s following words,

can this Animadverter come off with
peremptory declaring, that Subjective

of the</hi> Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<hi>&amp;c. When in another place,</hi>
p. 35, and 36. <hi>he averrs, That Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

Subjectively are the same. Answ.</hi> In
which words, there are two manifest

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntruths; The one is, That Mr. <hi>Bold
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:107142:242"/>
peremptorily declares, that Subjective
Faith is not inquired into,</hi> i. e. Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the <hi>Reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
&amp;c. Whereas Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> says
in that place, <hi>p.</hi> 31. <q>If he [<hi>i. e.</hi>
the Author] had not said one
word concerning Faith subjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered.</q> The <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s
other Untruth, is his saying, <hi>That

<hi>that Christian Faith and Christianity

                  </hi> Whereas
'tis evident, that Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
arguing against these words of the
<hi>Creed-maker, (The belief of Iesus being
the Messiah was one of the first and
leading Acts of Christian Faith</hi>) speaks
in that place of <hi>an act of Faith,</hi> as these
words of his demonstrate. <q>Now, I
apprehend that Christian Faith and
Christianity consider'd subjectively

Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> replies; That I have

               <p>The <hi>Creed-maker</hi> says, <hi>p.</hi> 59. of his

of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:107142:243"/>
tells men again and again, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Man, or Member of Christ, needs
not know or believe any more than that
one individual Point.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
thus replies, <hi>p.</hi> 33. <q>If any Man will
shew me those words in any part of
the <hi>Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. I shall
suspect I was not awake all the
time I was reading that Book: And
I am as certain as one awake can be,
that there are several Passages in
that Book directly contrary to these
words. And there are some Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in the <hi>Vindication of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,</hi>
&amp;c. one would think,

               <p>Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> p. 34. takes notice, that
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> had not put the Query

<hi>some, and not without some shew of ground,

Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> puts the Query right, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:107142:244"/>
this one Article alone, <hi>viz.</hi> That

tells him, That <q>Christian Faith must
be the belief of something or other:
And if it be the belief of any thing
besides this, That <hi>Iesus is the Christ

be specified; and it should be made

               <p>Mr. <hi>B—d,</hi> in the four follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

explained the difference between
that Faith which constitutes a Man
a Christian, and that Faith whereby
one that is a Christian, believes the
Doctrines taught by our Saviour; and
the ground of that difference, and
therein has fully over-turned this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that <hi>believing Iesus to be the

Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> replies, That this should be

proposed, as requisite to be believed
to make Men Christians. And <hi>p.</hi> 40.
he gives a Reason why he is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Because there is
nothing but this recorded, which
was insisted on for that purpose.</q>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Bold, p.</hi> 42. shews, that <hi>Rom.</hi> X. 9.
which the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> brought against
it, confirms the Assertion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Reasonableness,</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Faith that makes a Man
a Christian.</p>
               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> Answers
not.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Creed-maker</hi> says, p. 78. <hi>This
is the main Answer to the Objection,</hi> (or
Query above proposed,) viz. <hi>That
Christianity was erected by degrees.</hi>
This, Mr. <hi>Bold, p.</hi> 43. proves to be
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:107142:245"/>
nothing to the purpose, by this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Because what makes one
Man a Christian, or ever did make
any Man a Christian, will at any
time, to the End of the World,
make another Man a Christian;</q>
And asks, <q>Will not that make a
Christian now, which made the
Apostles themselves Christians?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi> Answers
not.</p>
               <p>In Answer to his 6th. Chapter,
Mr. <hi>Bold, p.</hi> 45. tells him, <q>It was
not my Business to discourse of the
Trinity, or any other particular
Doctrines proposed to be believed by
them who are Christians; And that
it is no fair and just Ground to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
a Man, for rejecting the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the Trinity, and that
Jesus is God; Because he does not
interpret some particular Texts to
the same purpose others do.</q>

               <p>But to this <hi>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                  </hi> answers
not.</p>
               <p>Indeed he takes notice of these words
of Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> in this Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Hence Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> takes occasion to
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:107142:246"/>
write many Pages about these terms
[viz. <hi>Messiah and Son of God</hi>] But I
do not perceive that he pretends to
offer any Proof that these were not
Synonymous terms amongst the <hi>Iews</hi>
at that time, which is the Point he
should have proved, if he designed
to invalidate what this Author saith
about that matter.</q> To this the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>
replies, <hi>p. 257. The Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>o disprove what I delivered, and closely
urged on that head.</hi> Answer, What
need any Answer to disprove where
there is no Proof brought that reaches
the Proposition in Question? If there
had been any such Proof, the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of it, in short, had been a more
convincing Argument to the Reader,
than so much bragging of what has
been done. For here are more Words
spent (for I have not set them all
down) than would have served to
have expressed the Proof of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the terms above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
were not Synonymous amongst
the <hi>Iews,</hi> if there had been any Proof
of it. But having already examined
what the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> brags he has
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:107142:246"/>
                  <hi>closely urged,</hi> I shall say no more of it
here.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Creed-makers</hi> making me a
Socinian, in his Eighth Chapter, for
not naming Christ's Satisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Advantages and Benefits
of Christ's coming into the World;
Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> replies, 1. That it is no
Proof, because <q>I promised not to
name every one of them. And the
mention of some is no denial of
others.</q> 2. He replies, That <q>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
is not so strictly to be
termed an Advantage, as the effects
and fruits of it are; and that the
Doctrine of Satisfaction instructs us
in the way how Christ did by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Appointment, obtain those
Advantages for us.</q> And this was
an Answer that deserved some reply
from the <hi>Creed-maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this he answers not.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bold</hi> says right, That this is a
Doctrine that is of mighty Importance
for a Christian to be well acquainted
with. And I will add to it, that it is
very hard for a Christian who reads
the Scripture with Attention, and an
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:107142:247"/>
unprejudiced Mind, to deny the <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
of <hi>Christ:</hi> But it being a term
not used by the Holy Ghost in the
Scripture, and very variously explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those that do use it, and very
much stumbled at by those I was there
speaking to, who were such as I there
say, <q>who will not take a Blessing,
unless they be instructed what need
they had of it, and why it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them;</q> I left it, with
the other disputed Doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
to be looked into (to see what
it was Christ had taught concerning it)
by those who were Christians, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
Jesus to be the Saviour promised
and sent from God. And to those who
yet doubted that he was so, and made
this Objection; <q>What need was
there of a Saviour?</q> I thought it
most reasonable to offer such Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
only as were agreed on by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and were capable of no Dispute,
but must be acknowledged by every
body to be needful. This, though the
Words above-quoted out of <hi>p.</hi> 254, &amp;
256. of the <hi>Reasonableness of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
&amp;c. shew to be my <hi>Design;</hi> yet
the <hi>Creed-maker</hi> plainly gives me the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:107142:247"/>
Lye, and tells me it was not my <hi>Design.</hi>
All the World are <hi>faithless, false, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
hypocritical, Strainers upon
their Reason and Conscience, Dissemblers,
Iourney-men, mercenary Hirelings,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Mr. <hi>Edwards:</hi> I mean, all the
World that opposes him. And must
not one think he is mightily behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Excellency and Readiness of
his own Nature, who is no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Controversie, but he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
finds out in his Adversaries
these Arts of Equivocation, Lying and
Effrontry in managing of it? Reason
and Learning, and acquired Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
might else have let him have
gone on with others in the dull and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
way of fair arguing; wherein
possibly he might have done no great
feats. Must not a rich and fertile Soyle
within, and a prompt Genius wherein
a Man may readily spie the Propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of base and corrupt Nature, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be an excellent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
for a Disputant, to help him
to the quick Discovery and laying
open of the Faults of his Opponents;
which a Mind otherwise disposed
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:107142:248"/>
would not so much as suspect? Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>
without this, could not have been so
soon found out to be a <hi>Iourney-man,</hi> a
<hi>Dissembler,</hi> an <hi>hired Mercenary,</hi> and
stored with all those good Qualities
wherein he hath his full share with me.
But why would he then venture upon
Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> who is so very quick-sighted
in these matters, and knows
so well what villainous Man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of?</p>
               <p>I should not here, in this my <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
have given the Reader so
much of Mr. <hi>Bold</hi>'s Reasoning, which
though clear and strong, yet has more
Beauty and Force as it stands in the
whole Piece in his Book; Nor should
I have so often repeated this Remark
upon each Passage, <hi>viz. to this Mr.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>answers not;</hi> had it not been the
shortest and properest Comment could
be made on that triumphant Paragraph
of his, which begins in the 128. page
of his <hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> wherein amongst
a great deal of no small strutting are
these Words; <hi>By their profound silence
they acknowledge they have nothing to
reply.</hi> He that desires to see more of
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:107142:248"/>
the same noble strain, may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to that eminent Place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it was fit the Reader should
have this one taste more of the <hi>Creed-maker</hi>'s
Genius, who passing by in
silence all these clear and apposite
Replies of Mr. <hi>Bold,</hi> loudly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of him, <hi>p. 259. That where he</hi>
[<hi>Mr.</hi> Bold] <hi>finds something that he
dares not object against, he shifts it off.</hi>
And again, <hi>p. 260. That he doth not
make any offer at Reason, there is not
the least shadow of an Argument.—As
if he were only hired to say something
against me</hi> [the Creed-maker] <hi>though
not at all to the purpose: And truly,
any Man may discern a <hi>Mercenary</hi>
Stroke all along;</hi> with a great deal
more to the same purpose. For such
Language as this, mixed with Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
neither fit to be spoken by,
nor of a Minister of the Gospel, make
up the remainder of his <hi>Postscript.</hi>
But to prevent this for the future;
I demand of him, That if in either
of his Treatises there be any thing
against what I have said, in my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of Christianity,</hi> which he
thinks not fully answer'd, he will set
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:107142:249"/>
down the Proposition in direct Words,
and note the Page of his Book where
it is to be found; And I promise him
an Answer to it. For as for his
Railing, and other Stuff, besides the
Matter, I shall hereafter no more
trouble my self to take notice of it.
And so much for Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THere is another Gentleman,
and of another sort of Make,
Parts, and Breeding, who (as it seems,
ashamed of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Way of
handling Controversies in Religion)
has had something to say of my
<hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c.
And so has made it necessary for me
to say a Word to him, before I let
these Papers go out of my Hand. It
is the Author of <hi>The Occasional Paper,</hi>
Numb. 1. The 2, 3, and 4 Pages of
that <hi>Paper,</hi> gave me great hopes to
meet with a Man who would examine
all the Mistakes which come abroad in
Print, with that Temper and Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
that might set an exact Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for Controversie, to those who
would approve themselves to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Contenders for Truth and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:107142:249"/>
and nothing else, in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
they engaged in. Making him
Allowance for the Mistakes that Self-Indulgence
is apt to impose upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Frailty, I am apt to believe he
thought his Performances had been
such: But I crave leave to observe,
That good and candid Men are often
misled, from a fair unbiassed pursuit of
Truth, by an over-great Zeal for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that they, upon wrong Grounds,
take to be so; And that it is not so
easie to be a fair and unprejudiced
Champion for Truth, as some who
profess it think it to be. To acquaint
him with the Occasion of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
I must desire him to read and
consider his 19th. Page, and then to
tell me.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether he knows, that the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> proposed in the <hi>Reasonableness
of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. was <hi>borrowed,</hi> as
he says, from <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Leviathan?</hi> For
I tell him, I borrowed it only from
the Writers of the Four <hi>Gospels,</hi> and
the <hi>Acts;</hi> and did not know that
those words he quoted out of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi>
were there, or any thing like
them. Nor do I know yet any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:107142:250"/>
than as I believe them to be
there, from his Quotation.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Whether affirming, as he does
positively, this, which he could not
know to be true, and is in it self per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
false, were meant to encrease
or lessen the Credit of the Author of
the</hi> Reasonableness of Christianity, <hi>&amp;c.
in the Opinion of the World? Or is
consonant with his own Rule,</hi> p. 3.
of putting candid Constructions on what
Adversaries say? <hi>Or with what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
in these words;</hi> The more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
the Cause is, still the greater should
be the Caution. The very Discoursing
about Almighty God, or our Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
should compose our Passions, and
inspire us with Candour and Love. It
is very indecent to handle such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in a manner that betrays Rancour
and Spite. These are Fiends that ought
to vanish; and should never mix ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Search after Truth, or the
Defence of Religion.</item>
                  <item>3. Whether the Propositions which
he has out of my Book, inserted into
his 19th. Page, and says<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>are conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the words of the Leviathan,</hi>
were those, of all my Book, which
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:107142:250"/>
were likeliest to give the Reader a
true and fair Notion of the Doctrine
contained in it? If they were not,
I must desire him to remember and
beware of his <hi>Fiends.</hi> Not but that he
will find those Propositions there to
be true. But that neither he nor
others may mistake my Book, this is
that, in short, which it says,
<list>
                        <item>1. That there is a Faith that makes
Men Christians.</item>
                        <item>2. That this Faith is the Believing
<hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. That the Believing <hi>Iesus</hi> to be
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> includes in it a receiving
Him for our Lord and King, promised
and sent from God: And so lays upon
all his Subjects an absolute and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
necessity of assenting to all that
they can attain, the Knowledge that
he taught; and of a sincere Obedience
to all that he commanded.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>This, whether it be the Doctrine of
the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> I know not. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to me out of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from whence (as I told him in
the <hi>Preface</hi>) I took it, to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our Saviour and his Apostles;
And I would not willingly be mistaken
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:107142:251"/>
in it. If therefore there be any other
Faith besides this absolutely requisite to
make a Man a Christian, I shall here
again desire this Gentleman to inform
me what it is, <hi>i. e.</hi> to set down all
those Propositions which are so indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly
to be believed, (for 'tis of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Believing, I perceive, the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
runs) that no Man can be a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
i. e.</hi> a Christian, without an
Actual Knowledge of, and an Explicit
Assent to them. If he shall do this with
that Candour and Fairness he declares
to be necessary in such Matters, I shall
own my self obliged to him: For I am
in earnest, and I would not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in it.</p>
               <p>If he shall decline it, I, and the
World too, must conclude, that upon
a review of my Doctrine, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the Truth of it, and is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that I am in the right. For it is
impossible to think that a Man of that
Fairness and Candour which he solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prefaces his Discourse with, should
continue to condemn the Account I
have given of the Faith which I am
persuaded makes a Christian; And yet
he himself will not tell me (when I
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:107142:251"/>
earnestly demand it of him, as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be rid of my Error, if it be
one) what is that more, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
required to be believed by
every one, before he can be a Believer;
<hi>i. e.</hi> what is indispensibly necessary to
be known, and explicitly believed to
make a Man a Christian.</p>
               <p>Another thing which I must desire
this Author to examine by those his
own Rules, is, What he says of me,
<hi>p.</hi> 30. where he makes me to have a
Prejudice against the Ministry of the
Gospel, and their Office, from what I
have said, <hi>p.</hi> 260, 261, 270. of my <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness,
&amp;c.</hi> concerning the <hi>Priests<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
of the World, in our Saviour's time;
which he calls <hi>bitter Reflections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If he will tell me what is so <hi>bitter,</hi>
in any of those Passages which he has
set down, that is not true, or ought not
to be said there, and give me the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why he is offended at it; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
him to make what Reparation he
shall think fit, to the Memory of those
<hi>Priests</hi> whom he with so much Good-nature
Patronizes, near Seventeen
Hundred Years after they have been
out of the World; and is so tenderly
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:107142:252"/>
concerned for their Reputation, that
he excepts against that, as said against
them, which was not. For one of the
three Places he sets down, was not
spoken of Priests. But his making my
mentioning the Faults of the Priests
of old, in our Saviour's time, to be
an <hi>Exposing the Office of the Ministers
of the Gospel</hi> now, <hi>and a Vilifying those
who are employed in it;</hi> I must desire
him to examine, by his own Rules of
Love and Candour, and to tell me,
whether I have not reason here again
to mind him of his <hi>FIENDS,</hi> and
to advise him to beware of them?
And to shew him why I think I have,
I crave leave to ask him those Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether I do not all along plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in express words, speak of the
Priests of the World, preceding, and in
our Saviour's time? Nor can my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
bear any other sence.</item>
                  <item>2. Whether all I have said of them
be not true?</item>
                  <item>3. Whether the representing truly
the Carriage of the <hi>Iewish,</hi> and more-especially
of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Priests in
our Saviour's time, as my Argument
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:107142:252"/>
required, can expose the Office of the
Ministers of the Gospel now? or ought
to have such an Interpretation put
upon it?</item>
                  <item>4. Whether what he says of the
<hi>Ayr and Language I use reaching far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
carry any thing else in it but a
Declaration, that he thinks some Men's
Carriage now, hath some affinity with
what I have truly said of the Priests of
the World before Christianity; and
that therefore the Faults of those should
have been let alone, or touch'd more
gently, for fear some should think these
now concerned in it?</item>
                  <item>5. Whether, in truth, this be not to
accuse them with a Design to draw
the Envy of it on me? Whether out
of Good-will to them, or to me, or
both, let him look. This I am sure,
I have spoke of none but the Priests
before Christianity, both <hi>Iewish</hi> and
<hi>Heathen.</hi> And for those of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
what our Saviour has pronounced of
them, justifies my <hi>Reflections</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>bitter;</hi> And that the Idolatrous
Heathen Priests were better than they,
I believe our Author will not say: And
if he were Preaching against them, as
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:107142:253"/>
opposing the Ministers of the Gospel,
I suppose he would give as ill a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of them. But if any one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
my Words farther than to those
they were spoke of, I ask whether
that agrees with his Rules of <hi>Love</hi> and
<hi>Candour?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I shall impatiently expect from this
Author of <hi>The Occasional Paper,</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to these Questions; and hope to
find them such as becomes that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and Love of Truth, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses.
I long to meet with the Man,
who laying aside Party, and Interest,
and Prejudice, appears in Controversie
so as to make good the Character of a
Champion of Truth for Truth's sake;
A Character not so hard to be known
whom it belongs to, as to be deserved.
Whoever is truly such an one, his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to me will be an Obligation.
For he that proposes to himself the
convincing me of an Error, only for
Truth's sake, cannot, I know, mix any
<hi>Rancour,</hi> or <hi>Spite,</hi> or Ill-will, with it.
He will keep himself at a distance from
those <hi>Fiends,</hi> and be as ready to hear
as offer Reason. And two so disposed,
can hardly miss Truth between them,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:107142:253"/>
in a fair Enquiry after it; at least, they
will not lose Good-breeding, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Charity, a Vertue much more
necessary than the attaining of the
Knowledge of obscure Truths, that
are not easie to be found; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
therefore, not necessary to be
known.</p>
               <p>The unbiassed Design of the Writer,
purely to defend and propagate Truth,
seems to me to be that alone which
legitimates Controversies. I am sure,
it plainly distinguishes such from all
others, in their Success and Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
If a Man, as a sincere Friend to
the Person, and to the Truth, labours
to bring another out of Error, there
can be nothing more beautiful, nor
more beneficial. If Party, Passion or
Vanity direct his Pen, and have an
Hand in the Controversie, there can
be nothing more unbecoming, more
prejudicial, nor more odious. What
Thoughts I shall have of a Man that
shall, as a Christian, go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me what is necessary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to make a Man a Christian,
I have declared, in the <hi>Preface</hi> to my
<hi>Reasonableness of Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. nor
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:107142:254"/>
do I find my self yet alter'd. He that
in Print finds fault with my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Discovery of that wherein the
Faith which makes a Man a Christian
consists, and will not tell me what
more is required, will do well to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the World what they ought to
think of him.</p>
