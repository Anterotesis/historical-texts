            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Heart</hi> to attend unto the Word spoken.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Apostle doth often begin and end his Epistles with Prayer, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64481:3"/>
the best Key to open, and the best Seal to close the Doctrine taught.</p>
            <p>Now because the summe of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness here standeth in two things, That God is at <hi>peace</hi> with us, and that we live in <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to him, and both these founded in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, Sealed by the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, the great Apostle, High Priest, and Shepheard of the Church, and ratified by the power of his <hi>Resurrection;</hi> therefore the Apostle hath so couched these things in this Prayer, that it may be a Summary both of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> touching the <hi>person</hi> and <hi>offices</hi> of Christ in this Epistle, and of the <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> unto stedfastness in Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence frequently inferred therefrom.</p>
            <p>The Words contain in them Two general parts: A <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> to enforce it. In the Prayer we observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Matter of it, <hi>perfection in every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Rule of our perfection in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God's will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The end of Doing his will, to <hi>please him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Principles of this Perfection, 1. God's <hi>peaceable Affection</hi> towards us in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64481:3"/>
Christ. 2. God's <hi>Gracious working in us. Working in you</hi> that which is well-pleasing in his sight.</p>
            <p>The Arguments are drawn, 1. from the Free Grace of God in an <hi>Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> 2. From the Love of Christ, the great Shepheard of his Church, in purchasing all the mercies of that Covenant with the price of his own <hi>Blood.</hi> 3. From the power of God bearing witness to the Efficacy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of that Blood, in <hi>Raising Christ from the Dead.</hi> 4. From the Pastoral Office, wherein Christ applyeth and dispenseth the Mercies of this Covenant, as the <hi>great She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard of the Sheep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the Prayer, wherein we have a compleat Character of Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in these few particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Internal work of God's grace in us, <hi>working in you.</hi> Good works begin not at the Hand, but at the Heart; we must be <hi>renewed in the spirit of our minde,</hi> and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 23. 3. 16.</note> by God's Spirit <hi>in the Inner-man,</hi> as the Apostle speaks. He in the Philosopher who could not make a Dead Body stand, gave it over with this Conclusion, <hi>Oportet ut sit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Intus.</hi> We may not judge of our selves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64481:4"/>
by mere External conformities; the Lip or <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 8.</note> Knee may be near, when the Heart is farr off. We must try how our Consciences is freed from the allowance, and our Will from the love of Sin, What life of Grace is in our Heart, How our Soul stands in awe of God's Commandments. The outward Act may be <hi>dissembled,</hi> but no Man can love God in Hypocrisie; Again, the outward Act may be <hi>disabled,</hi> but nothing can hinder the Heart from delighting in God's Law. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is that in God's Eye, which he is in his Spiritual Capacity. A Bodily service, like a Body, is Dead without a Soul to animate and enliven it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Life of Grace within will produce <hi>work</hi> without. In vain do we please our selves in the opinion of a good Heart, if there be an Evil Conversation. Grace in the Heart, like Leaven in the Lump, or Sap in the Root, wil work its way into the whole Man. Where God gives <hi>one heart,</hi> he gives <hi>one way,</hi> Jer. 32. 39. The Wicked must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake <hi>his way</hi> as well as <hi>his thoughts,</hi> and so finde mercy, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Christian perfection disposeth unto <hi>Every Good Work,</hi> causeth a Man to keep
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64481:4"/>
               <hi>a good Conscience in All things.</hi> Sinceritie <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 18.</note> makes Obedience universall. He who out of the awe of God's Authority keeps one Commandment, must needs, on the same Reason, keep all, as Saint <hi>James</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. 10. they being All alike Holy, and alike His. There is in Every good Christian a Concatenation of all Vertues and Grace. As the Childe receives from the Parent Member for Member, So when Christ is formed in a Believer, he receiveth <hi>of his fullness Grace for Grace,</hi> John 1. 16. And therefore as one dangerous Wound may kill a Man, or one dangerous Leake sink a Vessell, So one presumptuous Sinne may destroy a Soul. We must not therefore content our selves with <hi>Herod</hi>'s progress, of whom it is said, that <hi>he did many things,</hi> Marc. 6. 20. But we must with <hi>David</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect <hi>unto all God's Commandments, and hate every False way,</hi> Psal. 119. 6. 128. This is our <hi>Commission,</hi> to teach Men to observe <hi>All things</hi> whatsoever Christ hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. And this should be your <hi>Resolution,</hi> to say with good <hi>Cornelius,</hi> We are here present before God to hear <hi>All things</hi> that are commanded Thee of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 3.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64481:5"/>
4. Christian perfection is <hi>Constant,</hi> holds out to a consummation and <hi>full growth,</hi> to a <hi>perfect Man,</hi> Eph. 4. 13. Keeps God's Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes Alwayes <hi>to the end,</hi> Psal. 119. 112. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an Heart throughly fitted, and composed for good works, as the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> importeth, So the Apostle sayeth of himself that he <hi>followed after, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth,</hi> and <hi>pressed forward</hi> in the Race of Christianity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14. as all true denominations are founded in habituall and permanent Qualities, We call not him a Red man who is so onely with Blushing, nor him a Pale man who is so onely with Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; So sincere Piety is not in fitts, pangs, or sudden flashes, but is sober, regular, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, constantly disposing the Soul unto <hi>Every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Christian Perfection hath for its Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and Measure the good and perfect <hi>will of God,</hi> inquireth <hi>what God the Lord will speak,</hi> Psal. 85. 8. teacheth us to deny our own <hi>Reason,</hi> and not dispute; to deny our own <hi>will,</hi> and not to rebell against the will of <hi>God;</hi> to say as Christ to his Father, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt;</hi> or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> in his Conversion, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have <note place="margin">Act. 9. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64481:5"/>
me to do?</hi> Great reason it is that the <hi>wisest Will</hi> should order, and that the <hi>Soveraign Will</hi> should Rule Every other Will which is subordinate unto it. And since we know that <hi>God</hi> requireth nothing of us but for our <hi>own benefit,</hi> (for <hi>our goodness extendeth not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 13. Psal. 16. 2.</note> 
               <hi>unto him)</hi> we should Even out of Self-love obey his will.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Christian Perfection proposeth as its ultimate end to <hi>please God,</hi> and to bring glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Name, is not guided by Carnal hopes or fears to please men, but chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>God's eye</hi> and his approbation. So <hi>Abraham walked before God,</hi> so <hi>David set the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1. Psal. 16. 8. Joh. 8. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Lord alwayes before his face,</hi> so our Blessed Saviour did always those things <hi>that pleased his Father.</hi> And great Reason it is, that the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>Beings</hi> should be the <hi>last</hi> of <hi>Ends;</hi> that we should study to please and bring glory to him, who in so doing hath promised to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist and reward us, and by not so doing is provoked both to disappoint and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Our good works cannot please God, but in and <hi>through Jesus Christ.</hi> For 1. his Spirit and Grace are necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able all our <hi>performances.</hi> 2. His Merits and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64481:6"/>
               <hi>mercy</hi> are necessary to pardon all our <hi>fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Thus farr the Matter of the Prayer <hi>Perfection in Every good work to do God's will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are next to Consider the <hi>Principles</hi> of these good works; which are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God's peaceable affection</hi> towards us, <hi>The God of Peace.</hi> Enmity began at us, but Reconciliation begins at God, our <hi>destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of our selves, But from him is our help,</hi> Hos. 13. 9. He came not onely to <hi>save,</hi> but to <hi>seek</hi> and to finde that which was lost, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. When we were <hi>Sinners,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6. 8. 10.</note> obnoxious to Justice; <hi>Enemies,</hi> Exposed to wrath; <hi>without Strength,</hi> Unable to decline God's Justice, to withstand his Power, to prevent or escape his Displeasure; for him in this Case to send after his Creatures, his Enemies, that fled from him, that Rebelled against him, <hi>to be seech them to be reconciled unto God,</hi> to be content to be saved, to accept of <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> pardon and peace, of glory and Blessedness, this is <hi>a love which passeth knowledge,</hi> which <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 9.</note> exceedeth the expression or Comprehension of Men or Angells.</p>
            <p>And we must thus apprehend God as <hi>a God of Peace</hi> before we can be fitted for any good work. It is the Nature of Man, as the

Historian, tells us, <hi>odisse quem Laeserit;</hi> We having by Sin wronged God, do after hate and fly from him, till he proclaim Pardon and Peace. <hi>Peter</hi> repented not of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial till <hi>Christ looked</hi> back <hi>upon him;</hi> the Tears <note place="margin">Luke 22. 61.</note> which fell from his Eyes, were put into them by the Eyes of Christ. While Heaven in Winter is cold and tempestuous, the Earth is Barren, till the Sun return with warmoh and healing: So the Soul is fruitless, till the Light and favour of God shine forth upon it. <hi>We love him because he loved us first.</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 19. We <hi>Remember our wayes</hi> when he is <hi>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> towards us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63. His pardon and goodness is the ground of our fear, <hi>There is forgiveness with Thee,</hi> saieth the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>that thou mayest be feared.</hi> Psal. 130. 4. <hi>They shall fear the Lord and his Goodness,</hi> Hos. 3. 5. Godly men, sayeth <hi>Macarius,</hi> have Joy and Fear mingled together; the Joy which they have in God, Makes them Fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, They dare not grieve him that comforts them, nor use his Favours to his own dishonour.</p>
            <p>The best way therefore to Abound in good works, to be kept in an Uniform and constant Love of God's holy wayes, is to get
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64481:7"/>
our Hearts possessed with a Sense and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Divine Love, that <hi>God</hi> is unto us in Christ <hi>a God of Peace;</hi> for where God <hi>speaks Peace,</hi> he brings <hi>Healing,</hi> Isai. 57. 19. The <hi>Peace of God</hi> wherever it is <hi>will Rule,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Assurance</hi> of Faith is an excellent means to have the <hi>Heart sprinkled from an Evil Conscience.</hi> Heb. 10. 22.</p>
            <p>And here since our God is a <hi>God of Peace,</hi> Our Saviour a <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> His Gospel <note place="margin">Isai. 9. 6. Isai. 54. 10.

               <note place="margin">Jude 8. 3.</note> calls it; How should we all bewaile the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough-lamented Divisions which still Continue and wofully increase in the midst of the most considerable <hi>Protestant Nation</hi> in the Christian World? How should all of us besiege Heaven with United Prayers, with Uncessant Importunities for the <hi>peace of Jerusalem?</hi> How should All whom the <hi>God of Peace</hi> hath entrusted with the care of his House, looking strait forward, with a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64481:7"/>
single Eye, and Unbiassed aime, to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the Interest of Religion, and Salvation of Souls, put forth their utmost and most Zealous Endeavours to close up these dolefull Breaches which are amongst us? <hi>Rulers,</hi> by the Prophet, are called <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> Isa. 3. 7. and it is recorded for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Jehoash</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> that he took care for the <hi>repairing of the breaches of the House of God,</hi> 2 Reg. 12. 5. The Church of Christ in Heaven shall have no Divisions in it, and he hath taught us to Pray, that <hi>his will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> Why should we not with all Seriousness and Sincerity endeavour, as farr as possibly may be, to Effect that, which we hope for in Heaven, which we Pray for on Earth? We read of Wise-hearted Men that they made several <hi>Curtaines</hi> with <hi>Loops</hi> and <hi>Taches,</hi> and so Coupled them to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they became <hi>one Tabernacle,</hi> Exod. 36. The Lord thereby teaching us, that it is a work of special wisedom from Above, so to procure Order and Unity in his Church, that the Interest and Beauty thereof may be strengthened and preserved, that it may become <hi>Beautifull as Tirrah, comely as Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <note place="margin">Cant. 6. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:64481:8"/>
Terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> For certainly next to Truth of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> Purity of <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of Life, there is nothing more necessary for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God's Honour, and Mens Salvation, for preventing all Atheistical prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Religion, and departures to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adversarie, for strengthening the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of all both Governors and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church, than the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> thereof is. And so long as <hi>Ephraim</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> against <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> and both against <hi>Judah,</hi> we may Justly fear that <hi>God's Anger is not yet turned away, but that his Hand is stretched out still,</hi> as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
            <p>The next Principle of Perfection is <hi>God's Gracious Working in us,</hi> fitting, preventing, assisting us, unto the Good Works here prayed for. This Aide of Divine Grace is Necessary, 1. to our Habitual Aptness, 2. to our Actual working, 3. to our Progress and Perseverance in any good. All our good Works are begun, continued and ended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>God's Grace.</hi> Creatures which seek no higher Perfections than are to befound within the Sphere of their own <hi>Nature,</hi> may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64481:8"/>
by the Guidance and force of Nature attain thereunto: But Man seeking a <hi>Supernatural Happiness,</hi> must be thereunto carried by the force of <hi>Supernatural Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then our Habitual Fitness is onely from Grace, <hi>Our Sufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. of our Selves we are utterly Indisposed unto Good. This Indisposition Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> hath reduced to Two Heads, <hi>Ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> &amp; <hi>Difficultas. Ignorance</hi> in the Minde, <hi>the Natural man cannot know the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>Difficulty,</hi> in the <hi>Will</hi> for want of Love, in the <hi>Heart</hi> for want of Sense and Softness, in all the other <hi>Faculties</hi> for want of Strength.</p>
            <p>To the Removal of these Indispositions <hi>Grace</hi> is Necessary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Grace onely <hi>enlightneth the Eyes by the Spirit of Wisedom and Revelation,</hi> Ephes. 1. 17, 18. Christ onely <hi>giveth us an Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that we may know him that he is true, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. we have received <hi>the Spirit which is of God,</hi> sayeth the Apostle, <hi>that we might know</hi> the things that are freely given to us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Grace onely Removeth <hi>Difficulty,</hi> First from the <hi>Will,</hi> by a sweet and effectual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64481:9"/>
enclining us to love God, by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ineffable operation working in us, &amp; <hi>veras Revelationes &amp; Bonas Voluntates,</hi> as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Grace onely removeth <hi>Difficulty</hi> from the <hi>Heart,</hi> by Softening it with such an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, according to the Judgment of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Father, <hi>Quae à Nullo Duro Corde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spuitur.</hi> I will give them, sayeth the Lord, <hi>an Heart of Flesh, Ezek.</hi> 36. 26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Grace onely Removeth <hi>Difficulty</hi> from all other <hi>Faculties</hi> enabling them <hi>to do doe all things through the strength of Christ,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. Not <hi>I,</hi> sayeth the Apostle, but the <hi>Grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. Thus Grace is Necessary, <hi>ut Innotescat quod Latebat, ut suave Fiat quod non Delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> to make that known which was hidden from us, to make that sweet which was Irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to us, as the same Father Excellently speaks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Grace is Necessary to put this Habitual Fitness into <hi>Excercise.</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us <hi>both to will and to doe</hi> of his good pleasure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. It is <hi>God</hi> that <hi>Works all our Works</hi> in us and for us, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 26. 12. <hi>Certum est Nos facere quum facimus, sed ille
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64481:9"/>
facit ut faciamus,</hi> as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaks. It is true we are the Workmen when we do work, but it is he by his Grace who ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us to Work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Grace is necessary to our <hi>perseverance</hi> in well-doing, as the presence of the Sun is Necessary to the Continuance of Light in the House, He is <hi>able to Keep us from falling,</hi> as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> speaks, <hi>verse</hi> 24. <hi>Non Mihi suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit,</hi> sayeth Saint Hierom, <hi>quòd semel Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, nisi semper Donaverit, Peto ut accipiam, &amp; cum accepero Rursus Peto:</hi> It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me that <hi>God</hi> giveth me Grace once, except he give it me alwayes, I begg that I may receive it, and when I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, I begg it still. We must thus by constancy in Faith and Prayer Attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the means of Grace, because Every Stepp of our Sufficiency depends upon it.</p>
            <p>We now proceed unto the <hi>Arguments</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Apostle for enforcing the matter of this Prayer, Drawn from the Mercy of an <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> From the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> whereby that Mercy was purchased for us, From his <hi>Resurrection</hi> whereby it hath been ratified and secured unto us;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64481:10"/>
and Lastly from his <hi>Pastoral Office,</hi> whereby it is Administred and Dispensed for the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Salvation of hi Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then our God of Peace was Pleased to enter into a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> with Man, when he had violated the former Covenant; The Lord might have left us in our Lapsed Estate, as he did the Fallen Angels, <hi>Non Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectavit Angelos, sed praecipitavit,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> But he was more Mercifull to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Man, who, since he fell not but by hearkning to the voyce of a <hi>Tempter,</hi> should not perish without having provided for him the <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>Covenant</hi> is Founded and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Sanction is essential to Contracts, which among the Antients was done by Killing of a Sacrifice, of which Custom we finde mention <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 18, and it was Imitated by the Gentiles, <hi>Stabant, &amp; Caesâ firmabant faedera porcâ.</hi> That then which the Scripture calls the <hi>Blood of the Covenant</hi> was that whereby <note place="margin">Exod. 24. 8. Zach. 9. 11. Heb. 9. 20.</note> the Covenant was ratified, or had its San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as we read in <hi>Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch</hi> and others, of Leagues sealed by Drinking of <hi>Blood;</hi> So <hi>Servius</hi> the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64481:10"/>
will have <hi>Sanctio</hi> to come <hi>à Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; faedus à feriendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Christ by his Blood is the <hi>Mediator</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 11. 8. 6.</note> and <hi>Surety</hi> in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> as our Apostle telleth us, a <hi>Mediator</hi> to Reconcile, a <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to Undertake, according to the several Articles whereby the Parties in Covenant stand Engaged each to other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In behalf of <hi>God</hi> there is due unto him from Man <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to his Justice, and <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Law. Christ as our <hi>Surety</hi> hath in his own Person fully satisfied the Justice of God, and Rigor of the Law: and as our <hi>Head</hi> doth derive upon his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the Grace of his holy Spirit, whereby they are enabled to perform such <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Obedience,</hi> as the Covenant of Grace doth require, and accept.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In behalf of <hi>Man</hi> there is necessary <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Heb. 9. 15. Zach. 12. 10. Rem. 2. 7.</note> of Sinne, <hi>Reconciliation</hi> unto God, Re estating in an Inheritance, <hi>Grace</hi> to make him Holy, <hi>Glory</hi> to make him Blessed. These things God in this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> doth promise to give unto us in Christ, who by the price of his Blood hath purchased them for us. Thus Christ as our <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hath paid <hi>our Debt</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> and as the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64481:11"/>
Purchaser and Treasurer of his Father's Mercie, doth <hi>procure</hi> and <hi>perform</hi> God's <hi>Promises</hi> unto us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Covenant is an <hi>Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> so called by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 3. as by Saint <hi>John</hi> an <hi>Everlasting Gospell, Rev.</hi> 14. 6. Though the manner of its Dispensation in several Ages of the Church hath been Divers, yet the Substance is one and the same for ever: <hi>Varta Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta, Fides eadem,</hi> as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaks.</p>
            <p>A Covenant founded in Everlasting Love, the Gifts whereof are <hi>without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29. A Covenant Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the <hi>Oath of God</hi> to shew the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his Counsell</hi> therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17. A Covenant of the <hi>Sure Mercies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Isai. 55. 3. of a <hi>Kingdom which cannot be moved,</hi> Heb. 12. 28.</p>
            <p>Lastly a Covenant, the Benefits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are for ever, <hi>Everlasting Salvation,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. An <hi>Eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17. An <hi>Inheritance Incorruptible,</hi> and that <hi>Fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1, 4.</p>
            <p>Now if we consider Each of these Three Particulars, we shall finde them Weighty
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64481:11"/>
               <hi>Arguments</hi> unto that <hi>Holiness</hi> and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Apostle here prayeth for.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The whole substance of the <hi>Covenant</hi> is Frequently in the Scripture comprised and re-capitulated in these two words, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my People.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jer. 24 7. 30. 22. 31. 33. 32. 38. Ezek, 11. 20. 36. 28. Hos. 2. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And if he be <hi>Our God</hi> we must be <hi>Holy;</hi> for it is written, <hi>Ye shall be Holy, for I the Lord your God am Holy,</hi> Levit. 19. 2.</p>
            <p>And if we be <hi>His People</hi> we must be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for <hi>he Saves his People from their Sinnes,</hi> Matth. 1. 21. He <hi>purifies</hi> unto Himself <hi>a Peculiar People,</hi> zealous of good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p>Yea Our <hi>Holiness</hi> is one Principal branch of those good things which in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace are promised unto us. <hi>I will put my Fear in their Hearts,</hi> that they shall not depart from me, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. I will give them an <hi>Heart of Flesh,</hi> that they may <hi>walk in my Statutes,</hi> Ezek. 11. 19, 20. I will <hi>put my Spirit within you,</hi> and cause <hi>you to walk in my Statutes,</hi> and ye shall Keep my Judgments and do them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. The <hi>Law</hi> doth but Command, but the <hi>Covenant</hi> supplyeth Grace to do, in Sincerity, though not in Perfection, what the Law Requires;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64481:12"/>
               <hi>Lex imperat, Fides impetrat,</hi> as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaks. The <hi>Law</hi> was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> But <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> the Duties of the Moral Law, and <hi>Truth</hi> to accomplish the Prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations of the Ceremonial Law came <hi>by Jesus Christ,</hi> John 1. 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, whereby the Covenant of Grace is established, and the Sure Mercies of <hi>David</hi> purchased for us, is an invincible <hi>Argument</hi> unto <hi>Holiness</hi> of Life, For the <hi>Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all Sinne,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. The <hi>Blood of Christ purgeth our Conscience from Dead Works</hi> to serve the Living God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>By the Blood of Christ we were redeemed from our vain Conversation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>In Christ crucified Faith sees his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love in Giving Himself for us, and this <hi>Love of Christ constraineth us</hi> to Live unto him who died for us, 3 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>In Christ crucified Faith sees the Justice of God against Sinne, who <hi>spared not his own Sonne, but delivered him up for us all.</hi> and this works in the Heart an <hi>Hatred</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sinne, and an endeavour to avenge
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64481:12"/>
the Blood of Christ upon it. And it works a <hi>Fear</hi> of Sinne, for if Sinne brought a curse upon the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it will much more bring it upon the <hi>Sinner,</hi> if the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be despised. Where Sinne is found it will be punished. Sinne <hi>forsaken</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of hath been found on the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and hath there been punished: Sinne <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forsaken</hi> and unrepented of remains yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Sinner,</hi> and so long he himself is under the Curse which is Due unto it. For Christ did not Dye to <hi>Protect</hi> us in our Sinnes, but to <hi>Deliver</hi> us from them; He dyed to save the Sinner, but withall to destroy the Sinne. He therefore who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to Hold fast his Sinne, doth <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretativè</hi> resolve to let go Salvation.</p>
            <p>Again the Apostle teacheth us thus to Argue, We are <hi>not our own,</hi> for we are <hi>Bought with a Price,</hi> Therefore we must Glorifie <hi>God</hi> in our Bodie and in our Spirit <hi>which are Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20. For <hi>Quod emitur transit in potestatem Ementis.</hi> In the Imperial Law a Person redeemed became the Servant of him that Redeemed him, <hi>per Modum Pignoris,</hi> till he could pay back his Ransom. Certainly Christ did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64481:13"/>
not purchase us with so Precious a Price as his Own Blood, that we should continue the Servants of Satan and Sinne still, which he came to Destroy. Yeare <hi>Bought</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>with a price,</hi> sayeth the Apostle, <hi>be ye not the Servants of Men,</hi> Much less of Sinne: for <hi>to this End Christ both Dyed and Rose, and Revived, that he might be Lord both of the Dead and Living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9.</p>
            <p>The Apostle maketh mention of the <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship</hi> of Christ's Sufferings, and our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>comformable</hi> to his Death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. wherein <hi>our Old Man is Crucified</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>with him,</hi> that the <hi>Bodie of Sinne might be destroyed,</hi> that henceforth <hi>We should not serve Sinne,</hi> as the same Apostle speaks. For that is to be done to Sinne in us, which was done to Christ when he was made <hi>Sinne</hi> for us.</p>
            <p>The Death of Christ was a <hi>Violent Death,</hi> Christ having no Sinne in himself could not have dyed otherwise than as a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> So Sinne in us would never dye of it self, <hi>Omnis Peccator Peccat in Suo AEterno.</hi> It must therefore be Judged, condemned, and destroyed, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64481:13"/>
Again, the Death of the Cross was <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Supplicium,</hi> as Historians Usually call it; whereunto the Apostle seemeth to allude, when he sayeth that Christ took upon him the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> and <hi>became Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> unto Death, Even <hi>the Death of the Cross, Phil</hi> 2. 7, 8. Thus should we treat Sinne as a Base, Vile, and Servile thing, not suffering it to <hi>reign</hi> or <hi>have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> over us, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom</hi> 6. 12. 14.</p>
            <p>Again, the Death of the Cross was <hi>In same Supplicium,</hi> Christ endured the Cross and <hi>despised the shame,</hi> saith our Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. So Sinne should be put to shame by us. A Sinner in his Baptisme and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly Expresseth it, <gap reason="foreign">

some Learned Men (as I Remember) think was a Cup of Astonishment to Dull his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against the Pain of Death, Thereby teaching us, if so, to refuse any Anodynes or Stupesactives which might take away the sense of sinne from us. Thus the Blood of Christ is to <hi>cure</hi> Sinne, and not onely to <hi>Cover it.</hi> One of the surest Comforts of the pardon of Sinne is its dying in us, for the Life of a Christian should be a shewing forth of the Death of Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Everlastingness</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace is an Impregnable Argument unto <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> of Life. There is no Real fruit in Sin, the Promises thereof are all false and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Gehazi</hi> promised himself Gain, but got a Leprosie. <hi>Balaam</hi> pursued Honour, but met with a Sword. <hi>Achan</hi> found a Wedge of Gold, but it cleaved asunder his Soul from his Body. The onely fruits of Sinne are, <hi>Shame</hi> if we repent, and <hi>Death</hi> if we do not repent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
            <p>But whatever Fruit we can promise our selves from Sinne, it is all but <hi>vanishing</hi> and Transitory, The pleasures of Sinne are <hi>but for a Season,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. the <hi>World passeth away, and the Lusts thereof,</hi> 1 John 2. 17.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64481:14"/>
Our Sinne will Leave us nothing to keep Company with for ever, but a polluted Soul, and a Guilty Conscience. Now what a Folly is it for Men that are themselves <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,</hi> who must have a <hi>Being</hi> as long as there is <hi>power</hi> in God to preserve it, as long as there is <hi>Truth</hi> in God to make good the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of Eternal Life to them that Serve him, and the <hi>threatnings</hi> of Eternal Death to them that Despise him, not to provide an Happiness of equal duration with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? to preferr the false and dying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the World, before the Pleasures which are at God's Right-hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more? O let us learn by a sincere and serious <hi>Holiness</hi> of Life, to secure unto our selves the Mercies of an <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> O let us Remember what a God we have to do withall, and Dread to provoke him, because his wrath is Eternal, <hi>Who amongst us can dwell with Everlasting Burnings?</hi> and resolve to serve him with Reverence and Godly fear, Because he will <hi>render unto them, who by patient continuance</hi> in well-doing, seek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> Rom. 2. 7.</p>
            <p>And let the perpetuity of his <hi>Covenant</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64481:15"/>
teach us constancy in our <hi>Obedience.</hi> If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> neither should we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our <hi>Duty;</hi> if he <hi>save</hi> us to the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,</hi> we should <hi>serve</hi> him to the <hi>uttermost.</hi> There will be an End of our Labour and Pain in serving of him, there will be no End of his Love and Grace in saving us. No comparison between a few Tears of Godly Sorrow, and a whole River of Endless Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; between our weak and momentary Duties, and a farr more exceeding and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of Glory.</p>
            <p>There are but Two Arguments more, which being both Peculiar to the Day, and the Solemnity thereof, I shall very briefly conclude with.</p>
            <p>The former is drawn from Christ's <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Who brought again from the Dead the Lord Jesus.</hi> But why is Christ said here, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Act. 2. 24. 32. 3. 15, 26. 4 10. 5. 30. 13-30, 33. Rom. 6. 4.</note> elsewhere, to be <hi>raised by God the Father,</hi> when we finde it done <hi>by his own power,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy this Temple, and in Three dayes <hi>I will raise it up,</hi> John 2. 19. I have power to Lay down my Life, and <hi>I have power to take it up again,</hi> John 10. 18. I answer two things. First the <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby Christ was <hi>Quickned,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> Expresseth it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64481:15"/>
the Spirit of the Father, and of the Sonne and so the Action Common to Both. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Hereby the Father, to whose Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice the Debt was due, by letting <hi>Christ</hi> out of Prison, Acknowledged a Satisfaction of Judgment. Christ dyed as a reputed Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor, <hi>He was Numbred with the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,</hi> Isai. 53. 12. But he Rose a <hi>Justified</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> Person, and <hi>declared the Sonne of God</hi> with power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. for owning whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as for Blasphemie, they Accused and Condemned him, <hi>John</hi> 10. 33, 36. <hi>John</hi> 19. 7. Now this Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> is likewise a Notable Argument to enforce the Duty here prayed for. We finde delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Captivity</hi> Largely described by a <hi>Resurrection,</hi> Ezek. 37. 1, 13. and Even this <hi>figurative Resurrection</hi> is used as a special Argument to enforce the Duties of the whole Decalogue. I am the Lord thy God which <hi>brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage, Thou shalt have no other Gods before me, &amp;c.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>Resurrection of Christ</hi> being a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from a greater Captivity, is an Excellent <hi>Argument</hi> unto <hi>Holiness</hi> of Life; for <hi>God, having raised up his Sonne Jesus, sent
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64481:16"/>
him to bless us, in turning us away from our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity,</hi> Act. 3. 26. That like as Christ was raised from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, so <hi>we also should walk in Newness of Life,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. The Life of Christ is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and Communicative, <hi>Because I Live, Ye shall Live also,</hi> John 14. 19. Christ rose to declare his Victory over all our Enemies, the greatest whereof is Sinne, in the Subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof and Quickning us unto New Obedience, the self-same Power is Exerted upon the Hearts of Sinners, which was wrought in Christ when he was Raised from the Dead, as the Apostle insinuateth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>The Resurrection of Christ is a Ground of Holiness, <hi>Per modum causae Efficientis &amp; Exemplaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of Efficiency, called the <hi>Power of his Resurrection,</hi> Phil. 3. 10. whereby <hi>we are risen with him,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. He from <hi>his Grave,</hi> and We from <hi>our Sinne;</hi> For He being the <hi>Head,</hi> and We the <hi>Members,</hi> we have a Communion with him in the good things of the Head. Being a Risen and a <hi>Living Head,</hi> he will not have a <hi>Dead Body.</hi> God is not the God, nor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64481:16"/>
Christ the Head, of the Dead, but of the <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 32.</note> Living.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of <hi>Pattern,</hi> His Resurrection is an Exemplar of our Sanctification. 1. He Rose <hi>to Life,</hi> not as a Ghost or <hi>Spectrum,</hi> but as a Victor, to teach us not to content our selves with Dead shews of Holiness, but to live the Life of God. 2. He Rose to an <hi>Heavenly Life,</hi> to ascend unto his <note place="margin">John 20. 17.</note> Father, Teaching us to have our <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in Heaven,</hi> and our <hi>Affections set upon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20. Col. 3. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>things above</hi> where Christ is. 3. He Rose to an <hi>abiding Life,</hi> to dye no more, now no more to return to corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 34. So should we unto such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as is not again to be repented of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. 4. He Rose to Life <hi>speedily,</hi> very Early in the Morning, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 1. Teaching us, as the Psalmist speaks, to make haste, and not delay to Keep God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 60. Rise as Early as we will he is up to save us, before we are to serve him. 5. He Rose to a <hi>victorious Life,</hi> He came not forth bound as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but he left the Grave-cloaths behind him, <hi>John</hi> 20. 6, 7. So should we rise from Sinne, never to be bound or intangled in it more.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64481:17"/>
A Sealed-stone, a Watch of Souldiers could not hinder his Resurrection; no Fears or Prejudices should dismay us, or Keep us in the Grave of Sinne, when Christ calls us out. In our Spiritual Resurrection, there are Ever, More with us, than against us. We should Keep these Evidences of our Communion with Christ in his Resurrection clear and unquestionable; for we must rise with him unto <hi>Holmess,</hi> before we can rise with him unto <hi>Glory.</hi> No Man can rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope to be like unto Christ in Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hereafter who doth not purifie himself, that he may be like unto him in <hi>Holiness</hi> here; No Man can sincerely desire <hi>consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> Holiness, who is an Enemy to <hi>inchoate</hi> Holiness.</p>
            <p>The Last <hi>Argument</hi> is drawn from Christ's <hi>Pastoral Office,</hi> The <hi>Great Shepheard of the Sheep,</hi> of whom the Angell foretold that he should be <hi>Great,</hi> Luke 1. 22. A Great King, A Great Prophet, A Great High-Priest, <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 25. Luke 7. 16. Heb. 4. 14. 1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> The Chief Shepheard, Great in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this Power Acted by Great Love, and both Quickned by Great Interest: For <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 6.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64481:17"/>
he will put forth to Save to the uttermost those that come unto God by him, for Every <hi>Office</hi> of his is by him powerfully administred, to the Sanctification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a <hi>Shepheard</hi> He Rules and Governs his People with <hi>a Scepter of Righteousness,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 8. 2 Cor. 10. 5.</note> bringing <hi>into Captivity their Thoughts unto his Obedience,</hi> causing them with all Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to submit unto his Soveraignty, and to choose much rather to be ordered by his Will, than to be left unto their Own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As a <hi>Shepheard</hi> He Leads them by his Heavenly <hi>Doctrine</hi> and most Gracious <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> into the wayes of Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Causing them <hi>to walk as he walked,</hi>

               <hi>to follow his Steps;</hi> and as the Angel of God's presence, treading forth their way unto the Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As a <hi>Shepheard</hi> he Heals all their Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 3. 147. 3.</note> whereof Sinne is the chief: This is his name <hi>the Lord that Healeth us, Exod.</hi> 15. 26. For this End he was wounded, that <hi>by his</hi>

Ezek. 37. 4, 10.</note> from <hi>Dry Bones;</hi> No <hi>Man's</hi> Doubts or Fears, No Man's Sinnes or Temptations should Keep him from coming with a Lively Faith, with Godly Sorrow, with unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Christ for Mercy; of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they who feel most need of him, are most welcome to him, and whosoever so come, he will in no wise cast them out, <hi>John</hi> 6. 37.</p>
            <p>Lastly, as a <hi>Shepheard</hi> he <hi>feedeth his People</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 23. 1, 5.</note> not onely with his Holy Word, but with his own most precious <hi>Body and Blood.</hi> In the Law, the Passover, after it had been Sacrificed unto God, was to be Eaten in a Feast by them that offered it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 2, 5, 6, 7.
