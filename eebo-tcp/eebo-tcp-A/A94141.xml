         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>§. VI. Some Conſiderations concerning the meaning of the Covenant.</head>
               <p>OUr aforeſaid ſcruples are much ſtrengthned by theſe enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt that whereas no Oath, which is contradictory to it ſelfe, can be taken without Perjury; becauſe the one part of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction muſt needs be falſe: this Covenant either indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, or at leaſtwiſe (which to the point of conſcience is not much leſſe effectuall) ſeemeth to us to contain ſundry Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: as namely, amongſt others, theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To preſerve as it is, without change, and yet to reforme and alter, and not to preſerve, <hi>one and the ſame Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Abſolutely and without exception <hi>to preſerve;</hi> and yet upon ſuppoſition to <hi>extirpate</hi> the ſelf-ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſent Religion of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. To reform Church-Government eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland, according to the Word of God:</hi> and yet to extirpate that Government which we are perſwaded to be according thereunto, for the introducing of another whereof we are not ſo perſwaded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To endeavour <hi>really the extirpation of Hereſies, Schiſmes and Profaneneſſe;</hi> and yet withall to extirpate that Government in the Church, the want of the due exerciſe whereof we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112560:14"/>
to have been one chief cauſe of the growth of the ſaid evils; and doe beleeve the reſtoring and continuance thereof would be the moſt proper and effectuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>To preſerve with our eſtates and lives, the liberties of the Kingdome;</hi> that is, (as in the Proteſtation is explained) of the Subject; and yet contrary to theſe liberties, to ſubmit to the impoſition of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> and of the <hi>Negative Oath</hi> not yet eſtabliſhed by Law: and to put our lives and eſtates under the arbitrary power of ſuch as may take away both from us when they pleaſe, not onely without, but even againſt Law, <hi>if they ſhall judge it convenient ſo to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we find in the Covenant, ſundry expreſſions of dark <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or doubtfull conſtruction: Whereunto we cannot ſweare in judgement, till their ſenſe be cleared and agreed upon. As, Who are the <hi>Common Enemies?</hi> and which be <hi>the beſt Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> mentioned in the firſt Article. Who (in the fourth Article) are to be accounted <hi>Malignants?</hi> How far that phraſe of <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Reformation</hi> may be extended? What is meant by <hi>the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judicatory of both Kingdomes?</hi> and ſundry other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the uſe that hath been made of this Covenant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> (ſometimes to purpoſes of dangerous conſequence) we are brought into ſome fears and jealouſies, leſt by taking the ſame we ſhould caſt our ſelves into more ſnares then we are yet aware of. For in the firſt Article,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. Whereas we are</hi> to endeavour the Reformation of Religion in this Kingdome, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Reformation in Worſhip (whereby we could not ſuppoſe any more was intended (according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note n="a" place="margin">The Lords &amp; Commons doe declare, That they intend a due and neceſſary Reformation of the Liturgie of the Church; and to take away nothing therein but what ſhall be evill, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly offenſive, or at leaſt unneceſſary and burthenſome. <bibl>Declarat. 9. Apr. 1642. Exact Coll. pag. 135.</bibl>
                  </note> Declaration) then a review of the Service-book,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112560:15"/>
that the tranſlations might be in ſome places amended, ſome alterations made in the Offices and Rubricks; or at moſt ſome of the Ceremonies laid aſide for the reaſons of expediency and condeſcenſion) hath produced an utter abolition of the whole form eſtabliſhed: without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting any other certain form in the room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reformation in point of Diſcipline and Government intended (ſo far as by the overtures hitherto made we are able to judge) is ſuch, as we conceive not to be <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God,</hi> nor (for any thing we know) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of any Church that ever was in the world (beſt or worſt) ſince the Creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond Article, our griefe and fears had been leſſe, if we could have obſerved <hi>the extirpation of Popery, Hereſie, Schiſme, and Profaneneſſe,</hi> to have been as really intended, and ſet on with as much ſpeed and animoſity, as the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and that which ſome call <hi>Superſtition.</hi> But when we ſee, under the notions of rooting out Prelacy and Superſtition, ſo much quickneſſe uſed to fetch in the Revenues of the Church, and the ſacred Utenſils, (no otherwiſe guilty of Superſtition, for ought we know, then that they are worth ſomething) and on the other ſide, ſo little yet done toward the extirpation of Hereſie, Schiſme, and Profaneneſſe, (as things of leſſe temporall advantage.) We cannot diſſemble our ſuſpicion, that the deſigners of this Covenant might have ſomething elſe before their eyes beſides what in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Introduction is expreſſed; and that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing meant in this Article, that looketh ſo like Sacrilege, that we are afraid to venture thereon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third Article</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although we ſhould not otherwiſe have apprehended any matter of danger or moment in the ordering of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, in the Article mentioned: yet ſince M. <hi>Challoner in his Speech,</hi> and others have made advantage thereof to infer from that very order, that the defence of the Kings Perſon and Authority ought to be with ſubordination to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Rights and Privileges of Parliaments, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112560:15"/>
the Liberties of the Kingdome, which are <hi>in the firſt place,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>(c)</hi> From whence it is moſt evident, that the Rights and Privileges of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Liberties of the Kingdom are in the firſt place to be preſerved. <bibl>Anſw. to Scotiſh Papers, 18. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1646. page 21.</bibl>
                  </note> and before it to be endeavoured; We hope we ſhall be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if we dare not take the Covenant in this ſenſe; eſpecially, conſidering that if the Argument be of any force, it will bind us at leaſt, as ſtrongly to endeavour the maintenance of <hi>the Kings Perſon, Honour and Eſtate</hi> in the firſt place, and the reſt but ſubordinately thereunto; becauſe they are ſo ordered in the Proteſtation: And then, that Proteſtation having the advantage of preceding, it will bind us more ſtrongly, as being the firſt obligation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas ſome have been the rather induced to take the Covenant in this particular by being told, that that limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties of the Kingdomes</hi> was not to be underſtood exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively: yet when we finde that the Houſe of Commons in their anſwer to the Scottiſh Papers, doe <note n="d" place="margin">We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you mention the defence of the King twice from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet in both places leave out <hi>In the preſervation and, &amp;c. pag. 39. &amp; 46.</hi> a maine clauſe, without which the other part ought never to be mentioned. <hi>pag. 56.</hi>
                  </note> often preſſe that limitation, as without which the endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Kings Majeſties Perſon and Authority ought not to be mentioned; it cannot but deter us from taking the Covenant in this particular ſo underſtood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eſpecially being told in a late pamphlet, that the King not having preſerved the Liberties of the Kingdome, &amp;c. as of duty he ought, is thereby become a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and ſo cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be a King, and conſequently that his ſubjects ceaſe to be Subjects, and owe him no longer ſubjection. Which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, ſince we heartily deteſt, as falſe and ſcandalous in the ſuppoſition, and in the inference ſeditious and diveliſh; we dare not by ſubſcribing this Article ſeeme to give the leaſt countenance thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But it ſtriketh us with horror to think what uſe hath been made of this fourth Article; concerning the puniſhment of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112560:16"/>
Malignants, &amp;c. as by others otherwayes; ſo eſpecially by <hi>the Corrector of a ſpeech without dores,</hi> written in the defence of M. <hi>Challoners</hi> Speech: Who is ſo bold as to tell the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that they are bound by their Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for the bringing of evill inſtruments to condigne puniſhment) to deſtroy the King and his Poſterity; and that they cannot juſtifie the taking away of <hi>Straffords</hi> and <hi>Canterburies</hi> lives for Delinquency, whilſt they ſuffer the cheif Delinquent to goe unpuniſhed.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Salvo's</hi> that we have uſually met withall, for the avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the aforeſaid ſcruples, either concerning the whole Covenant, or ſome particulars therein of ſpeciall importance: We find upon examination to be no way ſatisfactory to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that we may take the Covenant <hi>in our own ſenſe:</hi> but this (in a matter of this nature, <hi>viz.</hi> an impoſed promiſory Oath, in the performance whereof others alſo are preſumed to be concerned) ſeemeth to be</p>
               <p n="1">

               <p n="3">3. Contrary to <hi>the end of the Covenant</hi> it ſelf. Which being the confirmation of a firm union among the Covenanters, that by taking thereof they might have mutuall aſſurance of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall aſſiſtance &amp; defence: If one may be allowed to take it in one ſenſe, &amp; another in a contrary; the Covenanters ſhall

3. If this would ſatisfie the Conſcience, we might with a good Conſcience not only take the preſent Covenant, but even ſubſcribe to the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> alſo; yea, and to the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Alcoran;</hi> and ſwear to maintain and defend either of them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as lawfully we may, or as they are agreable to the Word of God.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, for the <hi>ſecond Article</hi> in particular, in the branch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extirpation of Church-Government, we are told that it is to be underſtood of the whole Government, taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively and in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> ſo as if we doe endeavour but the taking away of <hi>Apparitors</hi> only, or of any other one kind of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour officers belonging to the Eccleſiaſtcall Hierarchy, we ſhall have ſufficiently diſcharged our whole promiſe in that particular without any prejudice done to Epiſcopacy. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neither the compoſers of the Covenant by their words, nor the impoſers of it by their Actions, have given us the leaſt ſignification that they meant no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea rather, if we may judge either by the cauſe or the effects, we may well think there was a meaning to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the whole government, and every part thereof in the Article expreſſed. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covenant being (as we have no cauſe to doubt) fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at the inſtance of the Scots and for the eaſier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of their aſſiſtance in the late War, was therefore in all reaſon ſo to be framed and underſtood as to give them ſatisfaction, &amp; (conſidering what themſelves have <note n="c" place="margin">By the Covenant, both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of other His Majeſties Subjects of England and Ireland ſtand bound as well as we to hinder the ſetting up of the Church-Government by Biſhops in the Kingdome of Scotland: And that we as well as they ſtand bound to endeavour the extirpation thereof in England and Ireland. <hi>Scots Declar. to the States of the United Provinces, 5.

                  </note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) againſt Epiſcopacy, we have little reaſon to beleeve the taking away Apparitors, or any thing, leſſe then the rooting out of Epiſcopacy it ſelf, would have ſatisfied them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The proceedings alſo ſince the entring of this Covenant in endeavouring <hi>by Ordinance of Parliament</hi> to take away
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112560:17"/>
the Name, Power, and Revenues of Biſhops doe ſadly give us to underſtand, what was their meaning therein.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as to the ſcruples that ariſe from the Soveraignty of the King, and the duty of Allegiance as Subjects; we find two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſeverall wayes of anſwering, but little ſatisfaction in either.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The former, by ſaying (which ſeemeth to us a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and ſtrange Divinity) that <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> ſtanding in relation either to other, the King being now diſabled to give us protection, we are thereby freed from our bond of ſubjection. Whereas</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Subjects obligation <hi>(Jus ſubjectionis)</hi> doth not ſpring from, nor relate unto the actuall exerciſe of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protection; but from and unto the Princes obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to protect <hi>(Jus Protectionis.)</hi> Which obligation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him as a duty which he is bound in conſcience to performe, when it is in his power ſo to doe; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative obligation thereunto lyeth upon us as a duty which we are bound in conſcience to performe, when it is in our power ſo to doe. His inability therefore to performe his duty doth not diſcharge us from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of performing ours, ſo long as we are able to doe it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the King ſhould not protect us, but neglect his part, though having power and ability to perform it; his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary neglect ought not to free us from the faithfull performance of what is to be done on our part. How much leſſe then ought we to think our ſelves diſ-obliged from our ſubjection, when the <hi>Non-protection</hi> on his part is not from the want of will, but of power?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The later (wherein yet ſome have triumphed) by ſaying that the Parliament being the ſupreme Judicatory of the Kingdome, the King, <hi>whereſoever in perſon,</hi> is ever preſent there <hi>in his power,</hi> as in all other Courts of Juſtice: and that therefore whatſoever is done by them, is not done without the King, but by him. But craving pardon firſt, if in things without our proper ſphere we hap to ſpeak unproperly or amiſſe; We muſt next crave leave to be ſtill of the ſame mind we were, till it ſhall be made evident to our underſtandings,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112560:18"/>
that the King is there <hi>in his power,</hi> as it is evident to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that he is not there <hi>in his Perſon:</hi> Which ſo far as our naturall reaſon and ſmall experience will ſerve us to judge, all that hath been ſaid to that purpoſe can never doe.</p>

               <p>And as for the Argument drawn from the <hi>Analogie</hi> of other Courts, wherein the Kings Power is alwayes ſuppoſed to be vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually preſent, under ſubmiſſion we conceive it is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1. The Judges in other Courts are deputed by him, and doe all in his name, and by his authority; and therefore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his power in thoſe Courts of miniſteriall Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſufficient, his perſonall preſence not neceſſary, neither hath he any perſonall vote therein at all. But in the high
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112560:19"/>
Court of Parliament, where the King himſelf is the Supreme Judge, judging in his own name and by his own authority, his Power cannot be preſumed to be really preſent without either the actuall preſence of his perſon, or ſome virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repreſentation thereof ſignified under his great Seal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Judges in inferiour Courts, becauſe they are to act all in his name, and by his Authority, doe therefore take Oathes of fidelity for the right exerciſing of Judicature in their ſeverall places; ſitting there, not by any proper intereſt of their owne, but only in right of the King, whoſe Judges they are, and therefore they are called the Kings Judges and his Miniſters. But in the high Court of Parliament, the Lords and Commons ſit there in Councell with the King as Supreme Judge for the good of the whole Realm; and therefore they are not called the Kings Judges, but the Kings Councell: and they have their ſeverall proper rights and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts peculiar and diſtinct both between themſelves, &amp; from that of the Kings; by reaſon whereof they become <hi>diſtinct</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112560:19"/>
they may neither ſwerve from the Laws, in giving Judgement, nor reverſe their owne Judgements after they are given. But the High Court of Parliament, having (by reaſon of the Kings Supreme Power preſiding therein) a Power Legiſlative as well as Judiciall, are not ſo limited by any earthly Power, but that they may change and over-rule the Lawes, and their own Acts at their pleaſure. The Kings Perſonall aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not needfull in thoſe other Courts, which are boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thoſe Lawes whereunto the King hath already given his perſonall aſſent: but unto any Act of Power beſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, above, or againſt the Lawes already eſtabliſhed, we have been informed, and it ſeems to us very agreeable to reaſon, that the Kings Perſonall Aſſent ſhould be abſolutely neceſſary: Foraſmuch as every ſuch Act is the exerciſe of a Legiſlative rather then of a Judiciall power; and no Act of Legiſlative power in any Community (by conſent of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) can be valid, unleſſe it be confirmed by ſuch perſon or perſons as the Soveraignty of that Community reſideth in.
