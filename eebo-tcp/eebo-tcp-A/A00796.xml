            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing moued by some friendes, to conferre with one of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent good iudgement, and of no ill disposition of nature, though very earnest in that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he did professe: I was desirous to doe my best endeuours, to let him plainly see, that the Catholique Romaine faith was the onely right. For which purpose, I did chose, to let passe disputes about par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pointes, and in generall to shewe; First, that it is necessary to admitte an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority in the true Catholique church: by reason whereof, euery one is to learne of it onely, which is the true faith of Christ. Secondly, that those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which professe the Romaine faith, are the true Catholique church. The which hauinge proued: I did consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; that the faith &amp; beleife, which the authoritie of the Romaine church, doth commend vnto vs, ought, without doubt, to be holden for the true faith.</p>
            <p>Vpon which pointes, when he had heard my discourse: he desired me, for his better remembrance, to sette downe in writtinge, what I had said. The which I had first thought to haue done briefely,


<pb facs="tcp:26144:5"/>
and to haue imparted it onely to him: but by some other frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, it was wished, that I should ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle the matter, more at large; they inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dinge (as it seemed) that it might not onely doe good to him, but to others also, that should haue need of it, aswell as he. Of which sorte of men standinge in this need, as I could not (consideringe their miserable case) but take great pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so I was easily moued, especially at my friendes request, to be willinge to doe my endeuour, which might be for their reliefe &amp; succour: and to take any course, which might turne to their helpe and profit.</p>
            <p>Now of all other courses, which haue beene, and might be vndertaken; that, which, in my speach, I did choose, as most expedient for him, with whome I did conferre, seemed best also for me, to prosequute in this my writinge, for the benefit of him, and others, and this for foure reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because it is very briefe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly such, as euery one might haue leisure, and should not be much weary to reade it.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because, the matter handled in it, is not very high nor hard, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, easy, &amp; plaine: and such, as may be vnderstoode of any, who, hauing but a reasonable witte, or vnderstanding, will carefully reade it (as the importance of the matter requireth) with iudgment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, &amp; (which is chiefe) with praier to God, and a resolute good will to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that, which he shall finde to be right.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: because, these few plaine pointes, which are here sett downe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other: and whosoeuer shall, by the help of Gods grace, and the force of these, or other reasons, yeeld assent to the pointes proued in this discourse: must by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence, without farther disputing or difficultie, yeeld to all particular pointes, which the aforesaid church comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for pointes of faith, and wilbe moued to settle himselfe in the stedfast belefe of all For if he once admitte, that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

some auctority to be needful, as a meanes whereby wee may bee lifted vp to God. The which lifting vp to God, is first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne by true faith: and because, this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority is so needfull a meanes, he would not haue vs doubte, but that God, whose prouidence stretcheth it selfe to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane matters, hath not failed to prouide this meanes for vs, it being a principall matter, and so principall, as vpon which (according to the ordinary course) depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <head>CHAP. VI. What conditions or properties must be found in the rule of faith.</head>
               <p>THis rule, which almighty God hath prouided, as a sufficient meanes, to direct me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the knowledge of true faith, necessary to saluation; must haue three conditions or properties.</p>
               <p>First it must be certaine &amp; infallible; for otherwise it cannot be a sufficient fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon to build faith, which (as is proued before) is absolutely infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:26144:15"/>Secondly it must bee such, as may bee certainely, and plainely knowne, of all sortes of men.

               <p>Thirdly, it must bee vniuersall, that it may not only make vs know certainely, what is the true faith in some one, two, or moe pointes, but absolutely in all pointes of faith.

                  <p>OVT of these former grounds foure conclusions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion</hi> is, that Scripture alone, especially as it is, by Protestants transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the English tongue; cannot bee this rule of faith.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="proof">
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:26144:16"/>
                  <head>This I proue.</head>
                  <p>First, for that these translations faile in the first condition; that is to say, they are not infallible; (as the rule of faith must be) for neither were the Scriptures writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this language, immediately by the holy Ghost: neither were the translators assisted by the same holy Ghost infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Infallibly (I say) that is, in such sort, as it were vnpossible that they should erre in any point. Sith, therefore, the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as being but men, may erre. (To say nothing of that which by <hi>Gregory Martin</hi> is proued: and by the often changes of new and variable translations is shewed that some haue erred) how can a man, (and especially an vnlearned man, who hath not sufficient meanes, learning, nor leisure to compare the translations with the prime authentical originall) how can (I say) such a man be infallibly sure, that this particuler tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slation, which he hath, doth not erre? &amp; if in some places it erre; how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he be infallibly sure, that in those places, which doe seeme to fauour that sect, which he followeth, it doth not erre? vnlesse he will admit an vnfallible aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, to assure vs, that such,


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26144:16"/>
or such a translation doth not erre, in any point, of which auctority, I shall speake more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they faile in the second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or property, which the rule of faith should haue. For the Scriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues alone, in what language soeuer, bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, and hard to be vnderstood, at least to vnlearned men, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not read them; and therefore the Scriptures alone, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee, vnto vnlearned men, a sufficient rule to instruct them in al points of faith; as is plaine. For locke vp an vnlettered man, and an English Bible, for a time in a studdy; and he will come forth (I warrant you) as ignorant in matters of faith, as he went in; if wee adde no other meanes to instruct him, but the bare written Word, which he cannot reade. And yet vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men may bee saued: and saued they cannot be, without an entire and vnfalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith: and this they cannot haue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there be some certaine rule and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible meanes prouided by almightie God, meet for the capacity, to teach them this faith: and Scripture alone (as is now proued) is not a rule meete for the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of vnlearned men, or apte to instruct


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26144:17"/>
them sufficiently, in all points of faith. But what speake I only of vnlearned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? sith, also learned men cannot, by onely reading the scriptures, be vnfallibly sure, that they rightly vnderstand them. For while they vnderstand one way, perhaps they ought to vnderstand another way: that which they vnderstand plainly and litterally, ought perhaps to be vnderstood figuratiuely and mystically; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that which they vnderstand figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, ought perhaps to bee vnderstood properly. And seeing that it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that all do not expound right, sith the exposition of one, is contrary to the exposition of another; (as right is neuer contrary to right) how should one be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly sure, that hee onely expoundeth right; hauing nothing to assure him, but the seeming of his owne sense &amp; reason, which is as vncertaine and fallible, as the iudgments and persuasions of other men, who seeme to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, to haue attained, as well as he, the right interpretation or sense. Moreouer there be many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the perfect vnderstanding of Scripture, which are found but in verie few: and those also in whom those giftes


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26144:17"/>
are, are not vnfallibly sure, that they are so guided by those giftes, but that, both they and others may prudently doubte, least sometimes, in their priuate expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as men, they erre. And consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their priuate expositions cannot bee that rule of faith, which wee seeke for, which must on the one side bee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and plainely vnderstood: and on the other side, it must bee vnfallible, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and such as cannot erre.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they faile in the third condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Scriptures are not so vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, as the rule of faith had need to be. For this rule ought to be so vniuersall, that it may be able, absolutely to resolue &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all doubtes &amp; questions of faith, which either haue bin, or may hereafter bee in controuersie; for otherwise there were not sufficient meanes prouided, by which, schisme and heresies might bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oided: <hi>vnity</hi> of faith, (so necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) might be conserued among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men. But the Scriptures bee not thus vniuersall. For there bee diuers questions or doubtes, moued now a daies, and those also touching very substantiall matters, which are not expressely set downe, nor


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26144:18"/>
determined, by onely expresse Scripture. For where haue we any expresse Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to proue, that all those, and onely those bookes which Catholikes or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants holde for Scripture, or indeede Gods word, and true Scripture? this wee shall not finde expressely set downe in a part of Scripture. This point, therefore, whereupon dependeth the certainety of euery point, proued out of Scripture, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made certaine to our knowledge, or beliefe; vnlesse we admitte some other infallible rule, or auctority, whereupon wee may ground an vnfallible beliefe; which infallible rule if we admitte, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vs, that there is, at all, any Scripture: and that those bookes, and no other bee <hi>Canonicall</hi> Scripture; why should wee not admitte the same to assure vs vnfalliblie, which is the true sense and meaning of the same Scripture. Hereupon S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith very well <hi>Cur non apud eos diligentissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me requiram,</hi>

                  <p>Thus I haue proued, that those english translations, wherupon Protestants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly build their faith, cannot be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rule of true Christian faith.

                  <p>THE <hi>Second</hi> Conclusion is, that no one mans naturall witte &amp; learning; neither any company of men neuer so learned, (only as they are learned men, not infallibly assisted by the holy Spirit of God) can, either by interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or otherwise, be this rule of faith.</p>

                  <head>This I proue.</head>
                  <p>Because all this wit and learning, be it neuer so exquisite or rare, is humane, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and fallible; and therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a sufficient foundation, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to build a diuine, supernatural, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible faith.</p>
                  <p>This reason I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme. Because, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a man, neuer so witty and learned

                     <hi>THE Third Conclusion</hi> is, that no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, who perswadeth himselfe to be singulerly instructed by the Spirit, can be this rule of faith; especially so far forth, as hee beleeueth or teacheth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the receiued doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church.</p>

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:26144:21"/>
                  <head>This I proue.</head>
                  <p>First, because S, <hi>Paule</hi> saith <hi>Si quis vobis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

                     <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themasit.</hi> Pronouncing generally, that, whosoeuer teacheth or preacheth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the receiued doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, should be held Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized or accursed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the rule of faith, must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, plainely knowne to all sortes of men, and vniuersall; that is to say, such, as may sufficiently instruct all men, in all pointes of faith, without danger of error. (As hath beene proued before.) But this priuate spirit is not such. For, first, that man himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be vnfallibly sure, that he in particuler is taught by the holy Spirit. For neither is there any prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se in Scripture, to assure infallibly, that hee in particuler is thus taught: neither is there any other sufficient reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the same. For suppose hee haue such extraordinary motions, feelings or Illustrations, which, he thinketh, cannot come of himselfe, but from some Spirit; yet hee cannot in reason straight waies conclude, that he is thus moued &amp; taught by the Spirite of God. For sure it is, that


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:26144:22"/>
euery spirit, is not the Spirit of God. As there is the Spirit of truth: so there is a spirit of errour. As there is an Angell of light: so there is a prince of darkenesse. Yea sometimes <hi>Ipsa Sathanas transfigurat se in Angelum lucis.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11</note> Sathan himselfe, doth transfigure himselfe, into an Angell of light. Wherfore he had neede very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to put in practise, the aduise of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> who saith.<note place="margin">2. Iohn 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Nolite credere omni spiritui, sed probate spiritus, si ex Deo sint.</hi> Doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue euery spirit, but proue or try them, whether they be of God or noe. Neither doth it seeme sufficient, that a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> try them, onely by his owne iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by those motions, feelinges or illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which, in his priuate conceipte, are confirmable to Scripture; because al his trial is very vncertaine, and subiect to errour; by reason that our owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (especially in our owne matters) is very easily deceaued; and that Sathan can so cunningly couer himselfe vnder the shape of a good Angell; &amp; so colour his wicked designements with pretense of good; and so guild his darke &amp; grosse errours, with the glistering light of the words, and seeming sense of Scripture,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:26144:22"/>
that hardly, or not at all, he shalbe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Wherefore the safest way were to try these spiritts, by the touchstone, of the true Pastours of the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church, who may say with S. <hi>Paul, non ignoramus cogitationes Sathanae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.</note> we are not ignorant of the cogitations of Sathan; and who may also say with S. <hi>Iohn. Nos ex Deo sumus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.</note> 
                     <hi>qui nouit Deum audit nos: qui non est ex Deo, non audit nos. In hoc cognoscimus spiritum veritatis, &amp; spiritum erroris.</hi> We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth vs: he that is not of God, doth not heare vs. In this wee know the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of errour. Now, if any will not admitte this manner of trying, and discerning the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth, from the spirit of errour, but will trust their owne iudgement alone, in this matter; feare they may iustly, nay, rather they may be sure (as <hi>Cassian</hi> saith) that they shal worship in their thoughts,<note place="margin">Collat. 61. c. 11.</note> the angell of darkenes, for the Angell of light, to their exceeding great harme. And, at least, howsoeuer their priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and selfe-loue encline them to thinke well of themselues, &amp; of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which they permitte to teach them those singuler points of new and strange


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26144:23"/>
doctrine: yet sure it is, that this their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the goodnes of their spirit, is not infallible, as the rule of faith must be; sith diuers, now adaies, perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the same maner to be taught by the holy Spirit; &amp; yet (one of them tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching against another) it is not possible, that all, that thus perswade themselues, should bee taught by this spirit; sith this Spirit doth neuer teach co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to it selfe. And therefore some, in this their perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, must needes be deceaued. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who, hauing no testimony of euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t miracle, or some other vndoubted proof, dare arrogantly affirme, that he onely is not deceaued; especially in such sorte, as to condemne all other, and to propose himselfe to himselfe &amp; others, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sufficient rule of faith, considering that others, who presume, &amp; perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues altogither in like manner are, in this their perswasion, deceaued.</p>
                  <p>But suppose one could assure himselfe, that he were taught by Gods Spirite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, what is the true faith in all pointes, in such sort, that he could erre in none, (as it is not the manner of almighty God, to teach men immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26144:23"/>
alone, or by an Angell; but rather as the Scripture telleth vs <hi>fides ex auditu.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> Faith is bredde in vs by hearing: and is to bee required <hi>ex ore Sacerdotis</hi> out of the mouth of the Priest:<note place="margin">Mal. 5.</note> and is to be learned of Pastors and Doctors, whom God hath appointed in his Church, of purpose; to instruct vs, and continue vs in the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t faith) but suppose (I say) that one could assuredly perswade himselfe, to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taught of God, what is the truth in all pointes. How should hee, without testimony of miracle, glue assurance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that hee is thus taught? especiallie when hee teacheth quite contrary to the Catholike Church, which, by plaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and testimonies of Scripture, vvee know to be taught of God.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps he will alledge that generall promise of Scripture <hi>Omnis qui petit accipit</hi> assuring them therby,<note place="margin">Matth. 7</note> that euery one that prayeth for any thing, receiueth it; and that he hath earnestly prayed for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, therefore he must needes haue it. But to this argument, we may easily answere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this promise of our Sauiour, is not so vniuersally to be vnderstood, as though euery one that prayeth for a thing, shall


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26144:24"/>
infallibly obtaine it, without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (at least in the manner of praying) required of our part. For we reade, euen in Scripture <hi>petitis &amp; non accipitis eo quod male petatis.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iacobi 4.</note> You aske or pray and receiue not (the thing requested) because you aske amisse. By which place wee learne, that to obtaine any thing by prayer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a condition of praying wel, or in such sorte, as is fit; the which condition, doth (as learned men obserue) include many circumstances, for fault of the due obseruance whereof, it may and doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen, that our prayer is not well made, nor in such sort as is fit; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently frustrate of the efficacy, which otherwise by the promise of our Sauiour it should haue had. Now these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances being many, and diuers of them very inward, it is not very easie. For any man, to be absolutely sure, that hee hath obserued them, in such sort, as is fit; and therefore he cannot bee absolutely sure, that his praier hath taken effect; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no sufficient proofe, whereby one may perswade others, that hee hath the Spirit of God, to say, hee hath prayed for it; especially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering, that we may


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26144:24"/>
finde very many most contray, in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one to another, who notwithstanding will say, that they daily pray for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and I doubt not, but many of them in some sort, yea earnestly, after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, doe pray for it; yet sure it is that all these (being thus contrary) haue it not. How shal we then be assured, that this or that man, who, presuming vpon the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this spiritt, (which he thinketh he hath obtained by prayer) setteth a broache a singular and new inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, how shall we be sure (I say) that such a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath the spiritt of God indeed? Some will perchance saye, that we may safely beleeue them, because, they preach nothing but pure Scripture, while as for euery pointe of their doctrine, they cite still sentences of Scripture. But this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere will not serue. First, because, for &amp; in the name of scripture, they bring forth their false &amp; corrupt translations, which do differ, in some places, euen in wordes, from true scripture. Secondly, supposing that they did alwaies cite the true wordes of scripture, yet they may easily applye them to a wronge sense or meaninge; to witt to that, which they falsely imagine,

And as they may seeme to themselues, to follow onely the Scriptures, when they follow their owne errours: so they may seeme (especially to the simple people; or to those, who, being seduced by them who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly build their beliefe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to preach nothing but pure Scripture, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed, they preach their owne erronious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, coloured and painted with words of

                  <p>Wherefore, there is no reason, wherby wee may bee assured, that such men haue the Spirit of God: but we may finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reasons to conuince that they haue not this Spirit.

                  <p>If our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> hath promised to any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of men, the presence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and the assistance of his holy spiritt, of purpose, to instructe, &amp; teach them all trueth: giuing withall peculiar charge &amp; commission to them, to teache all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and to preache to euery creature: giuing also warrant to all, that they may safely heare them, giuing also commandement,

whereby he bindeth all, to doe, in all thinges, according to their saying: and threatning greatly those, who will not heare and beleeue them: then certainely the doctrine &amp; teaching of these men, is, in all pointes, most true and infallible; &amp; such, as, (if the other conditions, required in the rule of faith, be not, (as they are not,) wanting) may well be proposed to all sortes, as an assured ground, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they may safely build an infallible <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> faith.

should teach vs, &amp; that we should heare them, and doe in all thinges, according to their saying: we may not likwise doubt, but that they shall be able to teache, all sortes of men, in all pointes, the infallible trueth; and that all sortes of men, may, if they will, learne of that company, what, in all pointes, is the infallible trueth. For otherwise by this generall commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hearing them, and doing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their saying, we should be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de sometime, to heare &amp; beleeue an vntruth and to doe that, which were not vpright and good: which without blasphemy to <hi>Christ</hi> his veritie &amp; goodnes can no way be thought.</p>

Church, yea, although it should happen, that their liues were not lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but bad. For although our Sauiour, in this place, doth only in expresse wordes, make mention of the chaire of <hi>Moses,</hi> in which the Priests of the old Law did sit: yet he is to be vnderstood, to speake also of the chaire of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> his owne Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, in which the Priestes of the new Law doe succeed.

that order of Bishoppes which is deriued from S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself vnto <hi>Anastasius,</hi> who now sitteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same chair; although some traytor had crept in, in those times, he should nothing hurt the Church and the innocent Christians, for whome, our Lord prouiding, saith of euill Prelates, what they say, do; what they do, do not.</p>
                  <p>The threates we may gather. First out of S. <hi>Luke</hi> when our Sauiour faith,<note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Qui vos spernit, me spernit.</hi> Hee that despiseth you, despiseth me. Signifying, that look what sinne it were, not to heare, but to despise our Sauiour Christ himselfe, that wee should account it the same, to despise, &amp; not to giue eare, and credit, to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. Insinuating therby, that the like punishment is to be expected, for the saide contempte. Secondly in S. <hi>Mathew</hi> the same our Sauiour expressely saith; <hi>Si Ecclesiam non audierit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>sit tibi sicut Ethnicus &amp; publicanus.</hi> If he wil not heare the Church let him be to thee like an Ethnicke and a Publican. Finally, in S. <hi>Marke</hi> after hee had giuen charge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission to preach the Gospell to euery creature,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.</note> hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth this threate to those that will not beleeue saying <hi>Qui non crediderit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnabitur</hi>


                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:26144:29"/>
hee that will not beleeue shall be condemned.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see our Sauiour Christ hath promised to his Church, the continuall presence of himselfe and of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to teach that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany all truth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of followeth that it is infallibly taught al truth.

                  <p>First, out of the very wordes, of those promises, which I cited, out of S. <hi>Mathew,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> For how can <hi>Christ</hi> our Sauiour, or his holy Spirit, be with his Church, in

                  <p>Secondly, I proue the same, out of an other promise, or prophesie of our Sauior <hi>Christ,</hi> to his Church, wherein hee saith: <hi>portae inferi non preual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For how was it true, that the gates of hell shall not preuaile, if they haue preuailed so much, as vtterly to abolish the Church or at least, to bannishe it quite out of the world, for so long a time? grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for (which euery <hi>Christian</hi> must needes graunt) that the prophesies and promises

in the 61. chapter. (Which chapter to be vnderstood of our Sauiour Christ &amp; his Church, wee may gather out of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> where our Sauiour himselfe citeth some words out of that chapter,<note place="margin">Luc. 4.</note> and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to be fulfilled in himselfe) the words of the Prophesie are these <hi>Faedus perpetuum feriam eis,</hi>

How could he more plainely haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tould the visiblenes of the Church?</p>
                  <p>Secondly our Sauiour hath ordained this his Church to bee the light of the world; according as he saith, <hi>vos estis lux mundi</hi> you are the light of the world,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> and to be a rule or meanes, by which, all men, at all times, may come to the knowledge of that <hi>One,</hi> infallible, entire faith, which is necessary to saluation, as hath bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Then (I say) men, that liued at that time, wanted necessary meanes, wherby they might attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of true faith, and consequently, whereby they might come to saluation, which if it were so.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:26144:34"/>
meanes sufficient, whereby, all men may come to the knowledge of true faith, and thereby, by degrees, to saluation. Sith es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, he hath power to prouide these meanes: and knoweth, that without these meanes prouided, it is vnpossible for men to attaine true faith, and eternall saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For knowing it vnpossible, he cannot be saide to will it; sith no wise man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that, which he knoweth perfectly to be altogither vnpossible; and much lesse may Almighty God be saide, to will any thing, which is absolutely vnpossible, considering that his wisedome is infinit, and that his will is alwaies ioyned with some worke or effecte, by which, that which he willeth, at least, is made possible to be done. Wherefore to verifie that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God would haue all men saued, we must needes say, that hee hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for all men, those meanes, which bee necessary, and without which, it is vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for them, to come to the knowledge of true faith, and therby to saluation; <hi>One</hi> of which meanes, is a visible Church, of which they must heare, &amp; learne the true faith; which is the first, and a necessarie steppe to saluation. The Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

must needes be alwaies visible.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly if the vniuersall Churche of <hi>Christ,</hi> should, for any space of time, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible: it should, for that space, cease to professe outwardly that faith, which, in hart, it did beleeue. For if it did outwardly professe; how should it not, by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, be made visible and knowen? But if the vniuersall Church, should, for such a time, faile to professe the faith; hell gates (contrary to <hi>Christes</hi> promise) did mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preuaile against it. For, were it not a mightie preuailing, that the whol church should faile in a thing, so necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? as we know, outward profession of faith to be necessary, both by that of our Sauiour:<note place="margin">Math. 10.</note>

                     <hi>Corde creditur ad iustitiam, ore fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio ad salutem.</hi> With hart we beleeue to iustice, with mouth we confesse to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which place learned men inteprete


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:26144:35"/>
to signifie, that profession of faith is, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, necessary to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and they say further, that, this sometimes, is so oft, as either the glorie of God, or the profit of our neighbour, doth, of necessitie, require it; the which cases of necessity do happen very often, and great meruaile it were, (or rather vnpossible) that they should neuer haue happened, for so long a time, as the Protestants would haue their Church to haue beene inuisible.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly if the Church were not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wee could not fulfill that commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of our Sauiour, wherein he said: <hi>Dic Ecclesiae.</hi> Tell the Church. For how can we tell the Church any thing,<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> if wee can not tell where to seeke it; neither if wee did by chaunce meete it, could wee know it to be the Church.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, it is certaine, that once, the true Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> was visible; to wit, when it first began in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the Apostles and Disciples of our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> and that companie, which by their preaching was conuerted to the faith. But there can no reason be shewed, why it should be visible then, and not now.</p>
                  <p>If it were needefull to be visible then,


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:26144:36"/>
because otherwise it could not bee a Church, that is, <hi>A Society of men lincked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the profession of one faith: in the vse of the same Sacramentes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnder the gouernement of lawfull Pastours.</hi> For the same reason, it must needes be vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ble now; because, (as in the last chapter is proued) there must be a Church now; &amp; therefore it must be a society of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, professing the same faith: vsing the same Sacramentes: liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gouernement of lawfull pastours. For all this pertaineth to the very essence of the Church.</p>
                  <p>If also it were needefull to be visible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that those offices &amp; functions, which must bee done in the Church, might bee well perfourmed: to wit, as there were in the Church some pastors, &amp; some sheepe; (as S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> saieth) some to commaund,<note place="margin">Oratione de mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda.</note> some to obey: some to teach, some to be taught; some to feede the flock of <hi>Christ,</hi> some to be fedde: so (that euery one of these, might doe what pertained properly to his duetie) it was needfull, that the pastours must know their sheepe and the sheep their pastours; &amp; that those that should teach, and rule, and minister the Sacraments, must see, and knowe


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:26144:36"/>
them, whome they were to teach and rule, and to whome, they were to giue the Sacramentes. And on the contrary syde, the other had need to haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those, of whome they must be taught, whome they must obey, and, from whome, they were to receiue the holesome food of the holy Sacramentes. If (I saye) this reason proue, that it was needefull then, that the Church should be visible and knowen: for the same reason, it wilbe also neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to say, that the Church must be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, now, &amp; at all times. For at all times, there m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st be pastours and sheepe in the Church, being the sheepefolde of <hi>Christ.</hi> And, at all times, these pastors must go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, instruct, and minister the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and the other must receiue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, instruction, and the foode of the holy Sacraments, at their hands. And consequentely, there had neede be some visible tokens, at all times, by which the pastours may knowe their sheepe, least, for want of this knowledge; they may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, <hi>dare sanctum canibus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:26144:37"/>
them not to doe. And on the other side, there had neede be some visible markes, by which the sheepe may know and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne their lawfull pastours, &amp; true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, from false teachers, and intruding vsurpers. For otherwise, they could not tell, whome to heare, &amp; obey, &amp; whome to repaire to for the Sacramentes: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whome to take heede of, as of false prophetes: whose voice to neglect, as of strangers: and whose poisoned foode of polluted Sacraments to reiect, no lesse then a baite laide to kill them by theeues and robbers; as it importeth greatly eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to do.</p>
                  <p>If lastly it were needfull to be visible, then, that those, which were out of it, might ioyne themselues vnto it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come members of it; thereby to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the graces and benedictions, which Christ our Lord communicated only to it; and to escape the deluge of eternall damnation wherewith, all was sure to be drowned, that were found, out of it, as it were, out of another <hi>Noë</hi> his <hi>arke.</hi> This reason also requireth and vrgeth, that the Church must be visible now, and at al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. For if, at any time, it were not


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26144:37"/>
visible; how could men, that were out of it, come vnto it? or how could they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine saluation, if they did not enter into it? sith at all times, the merits and fruites of Christs Passion are inclosed in it: and the meanes, of saluation, and to escape e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation, are only found in it. The Church therefore is visible at all times. For at all times, that Prophesie of <hi>Isaias</hi> must be true, wherin our Lord spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thus to the Church,<note place="margin">Isa. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>Aperientur portae tuae iugiter, die ac nocte non claudentur; vt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur ad te fortitudo gentium, &amp; reges earum adducantur; Gens enim &amp; regnum quod non seruierit tibi peribit.</hi> Thy gates shalbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually opened, day and night they shall not be shut; that the strength of nations and the kings therof may be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; for the nation and kingdome which shall not serue thee, shall perish.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly the only reason and ground, by which, heretiques hold the Church to be inuisible, is, because they imagine the Church to consist onely of the elect or onely of the good. But this is a false ground, as appeareth by the name of Church in Greeke <hi>Ecclesia</hi> which euen by the etymology of the word doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,

Christ: and that this Church doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: and is alwaies visible, that is to say, such as may be found out and knowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now the greatest question is (sith, there are diuers companies of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Christ; euery one of which, challenge to themselues, the title of the true Church) how euery man may come to know assuredly, and in particuler, which company is indeed the true visible Church of Christ, whose doctrine we must, in all points, beleeue and follow.</p>
               <p>To this question I answere that euery company which hath the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or which challeng to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues the name of the Church, are not alwaies the true Church. For of heretiques we may well say; as S. <hi>Austen</hi> doth, <hi>non, quia ecclesia Christi videntur habere nomen, idcirco pertinent ad eius consecrationem.</hi> They doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pertaine to the consecration of the Church of Christ, because they seeme to cary the name of the Church of Christ. For (as the same S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith in another place) heretiques are only whited ouer with the name of Christians.<note place="margin">Lib. &amp; ep. parm. cap. 7. Lib. de prescript.</note> When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Si haeretici sunt</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith) <hi>Christiani esse non possunt.</hi> If they be hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:26144:39"/>
they cannot be true Christians. The reason whereof, the same <hi>Tertullian</hi> insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth to be, because, they follow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that faith, which came from Christ (to his Apostles and Disciples, and which was deliuered by them, from hand to hand, to our forefathers, and so to vs) but they follow that faith, which they chose to themselues; of which election or choise, the name of heretike &amp; heresie did arise.</p>
               <p>The way therefore, to discerne, which is the true Church, is, first to set downe, which be the certaine markes, by which, all men may easily know the Church: &amp; then to examine to whom these markes do agree. The which, that I may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter performe, in the chapters following, here I thinke good, first briefely to note, what belongeth to the nature of a good and sufficient marke.</p>
               <p>Note, therefore that two things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in euery sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t marke. The first is, that it be not common to many, but proper, and only agreeing to the thing, whereof it is a marke. As for example, it is no good marke whereby to know any particuler ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; to say, he hath two hands, or two eares; because this is common to


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:26144:40"/>
many and therefore no sufficient note or marke, wherby one may be distinguished or knowne from all other. But a marke, whereby we may discerne one speciall man, from all other, must be some one thing, or moe, which he hath, and others haue not.<note place="margin">Taller. bigger.</note> As if he were <hi>longer, larger,</hi> or fairer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest; or if some others were as <hi>long,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tall. Tall.</note> and other some as faire, yet none were <hi>long</hi> &amp; faire both, but only he. The second thing, required in a good marke, is, that it be more apparant, and easie to be knowne, then the thing. For example, If I were to describe and make knowne a certaine man, who were otherwise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. I must not thinke it sufficient to giue the definition of his essence, or to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe the secret disposition of his hart, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and other inward partes, which are commonly harder to be knowne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the man himselfe. But I must declare some apparant thing in his face, hands or some outward part of his body: or in his voice, apparell, behauiour, or such like; which agreeing onely to that man; and being easie to be knowne, may be a meanes to make vs know the man we seeke for.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when we will assigne some


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26144:40"/>
good markes, by which, all sortes of men may, in some sort, discerne, which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of men is the true Church, we must haue speciall regard to assigne those things, which, in some matters, may be apparant to all sortes of men; sith all sortes of men had neede to seeke out, and according to their capacitie discerne which is the true Church: we must also assigne those thinges, which agree to no other companie, but that, which is the true Church, to th'intent that a man shall see all those thinges, which be assigned as marks, to agree to any companie, he may streightwaies conclude, that company to bee the true Church: as on the contrarie side, if he perceiue, either all, or any one of them to be wanting, in any company, he may be sure, that, that company is not the true Church.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:26144:41"/>
nature of a good marke, we may easily gather, that those markes, which some Haeretiques assigne, to wit, the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith: and the right vse of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, are no good markes, by which all sortes of men may come to knowe, which is the true Church; but are meanes (as Haeretiques vse them) to cast a myste ouer the whole matter, when as they know, that they can, most easily, conuert all the Sacramentes, and holy wordes of Scripture,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de bapt. &amp; donat. cap. 19.</note>

               <p>The doctrine of faith, therefore (I say) and the right vse of Sacramentes, be not good marks, whereby men may discerne which is the true Church.</p>
               <div type="proof">
                  <head>This I proue.</head>
                  <p>First, for that by the true doctrine of faith (which they assigne for a marke of the Church) either they meane, true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26144:41"/>
in some pointes onely, or in all. True doctrine in some pointes onely, is no good marke, because the Haeretiques teache the trueth in some pointes. This therfore being not proper to the Church; but agreeing rather to Haeretiques, can bee no good marke of the true Church: because it wanteth the first condition of a marke, which is, to be proper, &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely to the thing, whereof it is a marke. True doctrine also in all pointes, although it be proper (if we ioyne to it the right vse of Sacramentes, with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to lawfull pastours) &amp; agree one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the true Church, yet it is no good marke; because, it faileth in the second condition, which is required in a good marke, that is to say, it is not apparant or easy to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of al those, who should seeke out the true Church. As I may easily proue, because to know which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie teacheth the trueth in all pointes, requireth first learning, wherby one may vnderstand the tearmes, and state of the question, or controuersie. besides, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to discusse and weigh prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the worth and sufficiency of the authorities and reasons of both partes; that, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:26144:42"/>
pondering of reasons, he may prudently conclude which is the better part. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer one had neede to haue a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of Gods grace and the assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his Spirit, whereby he may discerne &amp; see those thinges, which be aboue all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall rules and reasons. <hi>Ad haec quis ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus?</hi> Who can saye that himselfe is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furnished with these helpes? who can bee infallibly sure, that he hath all these, in such sorte, as is requisite, for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineing, by his own industrie, true &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible faith; in all points? surely, at least, the vnlearned must needes confesse, that, in diuers mysteries, they doe not so much as vnderstand the tearmes and state of the question: and much lesse are they able, to examine sufficiently the worth of euery reason: neither are all such, as can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselues, that they are singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlightened, and immediately taught of Gods Spirite: neither, if they did thus perswade themselues, could they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly sure, that in this their perswasion they were not deceiued; sith it is certaine, that some of them, that most strongely perswade themselues to be thus taught, are in this their perswasion deceiued; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26144:42"/>
can the vnlearned sufficiently know the truth, in euery particuler point, by giuing credit to some one, or other learned man, or any companie of the learned; vnles, that company, bee first knowen, to be of the true Church, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to be guided in their teaching, by the holy Ghost, as I proued before. So that it is most hard or rather vnpossible for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and especially for an vnlearned man, in all pointes,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. &amp; Faust. cap. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>liquidam à tot erroribus discernere veritatem,</hi> to discerne the plaine truth from so many errours, as S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith. It is also most hard for a man of himself to iudge, which vse of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is right, if he be not first taught by the Church; sith this is a principall point of the true doctrine of faith, which is (as I sayde) very hard or rather vnpossible to be perfitely knowen by a mans owne selfe. But to know, first, which company is the true Church; and then, by giuing credit to it, to learne, which is the true faith; &amp; which vse of Sacraments is right, there are not so many things required, nor any great difficultie, as shalbe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For the Church is that direct way, which <hi>Isaias</hi> speaketh of, when hee saith:


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:26144:43"/>
                     <hi>Haec erit vobis directa vta,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. c. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>ita vt stulti non errent per eam.</hi> This shalbe to you a direct waye, so that euen fooles, (to wit simple &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men) may not erre in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I proue the same, because, when we seeke for the true Church, we seeke it principally for this end, that by it, as by a necessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; infallible meanes we may heare, and learne of it, the true, faith in all pointes, which otherwise in it selfe is hidden, obscure and vnknowen to vs; according to that of S. <hi>Paule. Animalis homo non percipit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <hi>quae sunt Spiritus Dei</hi>: the sensuall man doth not perceiue those thinges, which are of the Spirit of God. For, sith, none, by the onely power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall wit, (which in vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vseth the help of outward senses,) can obtaine the supernaturall knowledge of diuine mysteries, which we belieue by our faith: neither doth the Spirit of God who, as the principall cause, infuseth this guift of faith into our soules) ordinarily instruct any man, in the knowledge of true faith, immediately by himselfe alone, or by an Angell sent from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; we must needes, if we will haue true faith, seeke first for that, which it pleaseth almighty God to


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:26144:43"/>
vse, as the ordinary instrument and as a necessary meanes, by which men may learne true faith; the which is no other, but the preaching and teaching of the true Church, according to that saying of S. <hi>Paule.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Quomodo credent ei quem non audie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint? quomodo audient sine praedicante? quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do praedicabunt nisi mittantur?</hi> How shall they beleeue him, whom they haue not heard? how shall they heare, without a preacher? how shall they preach, vnlesse they be sent. Therefore the true Church, which only hath preachers truely sent of God, must first be found out, that by it we may heare and know which is the true faith. Therefore of the two, the true Church is rather a marke, whereby we may know the true preaching, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the true doctrine of faith, then contrary, that, (as heretiques say) the doctrine should be a marke, whereby all men must know, which is the true Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, true faith is included in the true Church, and, as it were enclosed in her belly; as S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith, vpon those words of the Psalme <hi>Errauerunt ab vtero,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Ps. 53.</note>

                        </gap>i sunt falsa. In ventre ecclesiae</hi> (saith he)


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:26144:44"/>
                     <hi>veritas manet; quisquis ab hoc ventre separatus fuerit, necesse est, vt falsa loquatur.</hi> Truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the belly of the Church; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is seperated (to wit by difference in doctrine) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this belly of the Church, must needs speake false. Therfore like as, if a man had golde in his belly, we must first find the man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before we can come to see the golde it selfe: so we must first, by other markes, find out the true Church, which hath the gold of true faith, hidden in her belly, before we come to see the gold of true faith it selfe Sith especially, we cannot see it, vnlesse shee open her mouth, and deliuer it vnto vs, &amp; that we cannot (being spiritually blind) certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know it to be true, &amp; not counterfeite, but by giuing credit to her testimony of it. According as the same S. <hi>Austen</hi> saith <hi>Euangelio non crederem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. &amp; Ep. Fund. cap. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>nisi me ecclesiae authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas commoueret.</hi> I should not beleeue the Gospell it selfe, vnlesse I were moued by the authority of the Church. For if we had not the testimony of the Church, how should we haue bin infallibly sure, that there were any Gospel at all? or how should wee haue knowne, that those bookes, which beare title of the Gospell,


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:26144:44"/>
according to S. <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> Are true Canonicall Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then those bookes, which are writen in the name of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> bearing the same title or inscription of Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the true doctrine of faith, in all particuler pointes, must bee fore knowne, as a marke, whereby to know the true Church; then (contrary to that which hath bin proued) the authority of the Church, should not be a necessarie meanes, whereby men must come to the knowledge of the true faith. For if before wee come to know, which is the true Church, we must, by other meanes, haue knowne, which is the true faith; what neede then is there, for getting true faith already had, to seeke or bring in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the same Church.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, If, before we giue absolute and vndoubted credit to the true Church we must examine and iudge, whether euery particuler point of doctrine, which it holdeth, be the truth, with authority to accept that only, which we like, or which seemeth, in our conceipt, right and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Scripture: &amp; to reiect, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26144:45"/>
wee mislike, or which, in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate iudgement, seemeth not so right and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable; then we make our selues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers and Iudges ouer the Church; &amp; consequently, we preferre our liking or disliking, our iudgement and censure, of the interpretation &amp; sense of Scripture, before the iudgement, and censure of the Church of God. But it is absurd, both in reason and religion, to preferre the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any priuate man (be he neuer so witty and learned, or neuer so strongly perswaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his owne mind, that he is taught by the Spirit) before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; definitiue sentence of the Church of God; the which is a company of men, many of which, both are, &amp; alwaies haue bin, vertuous, wise, and learned, &amp; (which is chiefe) is such a company, as, according to the absolute and infallible promises of our Sauiour, hath, vndoubtedly, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit among them, guiding them, and teaching them all truth, and not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to erre, as before hath beene proued.</p>
                  <p>But you may perhaps say that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture we are willed, not to beleeue euery spirit,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> but to try spirits, whether they bee

of God or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore, we must examine and try the spirit of the Church, by looking into euery particuler point of doctrine, which it teacheth.</p>
                  <p>I answere. That, in that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not meant, that it belongeth to euery particuler man to try all spirits; but in generall, the Scripture giueth the Church warning, not to accept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euery one, that boasteth himselfe to haue the Spirit, and willeth, that they should trie those spirits; not, that euery simple or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, should take vpon him to trie them: but that those of the Church, to whom the office of trying spirits doth appertaine, to wit, the Doctors and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, which almighty God hath put in his Church, of purpose,<note place="margin">Eph. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Sacraments also do not only signifie, but, in the vertue, which they haue from Christ his Passion, they also worke, in vs, (as instrumentall causes) true &amp; inward sanctitie. Wherfore although euery one, that is in the Church, be not holy, yet, no doubt, alwaies some are; the which their holines, it pleaseth almighty God to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie and make knowne sometime by miracle, and ordinarily, he vseth to make it apparant enough, by the light of their vertuous actions, which, at all times, in many members of the true Church, doe so shine before men, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by it, men are moued to glorify God, and sometimes to imitate in their owne life, that, which, in others, they admire. And whatsoeuer member of the Church faileth from this holines of life, it is euident, that the faulte is only in himselfe, who liueth not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prescript of his profession, nor vseth, in due sort, those meanes, which it hath of the holy Sacraments, which, as I said before, are effectual instruments of sanctification.</p>

time to spread it selfe absolutely ouer the whole world, as I haue proued, that the true Church shall doe, and the reason hereof may bee assigned, because as Saint <hi>Austen</hi> saieth, <hi>diu stare non possunt,</hi> they can not continue so long, as were needefull, to gett them so vniuersally spred ouer the whole world, especially considering, that as S. <hi>Paule</hi> saieth, when they haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a while,<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Insipientia earum manifesta fit omnibus,</hi> their folishenes is made manifest to all, and so no meruaile, <hi>si vltra non profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant,</hi> if they prosper not, nor make no further progresse.

               <p>It appeareth therefore plaine enough, that these foure properties <hi>One Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique</hi> and <hi>Apostolique</hi> agree only to the true Church; and sith it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for any to see or know, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Christians hath these properties (as in the next chapter I shall declare.) It is also plaine, that these foure <hi>One, Holie Catholique, Apostolique</hi> (being proper to the true Church: and apparant enough) are good notes or markes, by which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may discerne, which company of those, which haue the name of Christians, and which professe (as euery company professeth themselues) to teach the true doctrine of Christ, is indeed the true Church, which, doubtlesse, teacheth, in all points, the true doctrine of Christ.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. That the Romane Church is One, Holy, Catholique, Apostolique, and therefore the true Church.</head>
               <p>THVS farre my discourse hath gone along all in generalities, in shewing the necessity of true faith: and that this faith is to be learned of the true Church: and that this Church continueth alwaies and is visible, as being a <hi>visible company of men professing the true faith of Christ: parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Sacraments: and liuing vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of lawfull Pastors his substitutes:</hi> &amp; that, (whereas diuers companies of men take vpon them the title of this Church, whereby some do stand in doubt, which company is the true Church) there bee certain marks, by which, the true Church may be certainely knowen, &amp; discerned, from all other companies or congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and finally, that these markes bee those foure <hi>One, Holy, Catholique, Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> which are certainely knowne to bee the properties of the true Church, both by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and also by plaine testimonies of Scriptures and Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:26144:57"/>Now it wil be good to see, if we can, by these generall grounds, conclude, which particuler company of men is the true Church of Christ. A conclusion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great consequence, as touching all matters in controuersie concerning the doctrine of faith, as may appeare, by the drifte of all my former discourse. For the framing of which conclusion, we shal not need to bring in comparison, all the companies or sectes of diuers religions, that haue bin and are in the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause euery one can easily discerne of themselues, and especially by the helpe of that, which hath beene saide, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Turkes</hi> nor <hi>Iewes</hi> nor whatsoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infidels, can be the true Church of Christ, because these neither haue the name of Christians, neither do they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to haue the name of Christ. Neither am I now to meddle with heretiques and schismatiques of former ages, the which, as they haue bin condemned, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent of the Church, so, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, they haue beene worne out by the same Church, in so much, that euen the memory of them (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) seemeth to be perished with them.</p>

Now this being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, whom we know to haue bene mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Romane Church, are saincts: we may well inferre, that, at least, some part of this Church is holy, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this part (<hi>per synecdochen</hi>) the whole may be tearmed <hi>holy</hi>: especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the faith of this part, (which was a principall roote, out of which their holines did spring) is all one in substance with the faith, which we all professe: and therefore, we may say that our faith and profession enclineth and leadeth to the same holines of life that theirs did. And therefore though many, through their owne fault, faile in the practise of vertue and holines, yet our profession (being all one with the professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these holy men) is to be tearmed holy, as theirs was. Of which holy profession in some sort, all our whole companie may be called <hi>holy,</hi> as of the art of painting or any other art,

all that professe them are commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a name proper to their professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though it happen that diuers of them, be not very skilfull, nor doe not much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his art.</p>
                  <p>And from hence riseth the second dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, betwixt Protestantes and vs, to wit, that the very doctrine it selfe, which Protestantes teach, doth (as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) induce men to libertie, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to lewde life: whereas the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> faith, which wee professe, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely forbiddeth all vice: and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth lawes contrary to liberty and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life; &amp; containeth most soueraigne meanes, to incite and moue a man, to all perfite vertue, and holines of life. As for example. It teacheth, that, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the presence or predestination of Almighty God, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath free-will, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (being ayded by Gods grace, which grace, through the merit of Christs Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ready for all, that with humble, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout and perseuerant prayer will aske, &amp; by frequenting, in due sort, the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, will seeke for it) he may auoid sinne and embrace vertue, the which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away despaire of shunning euill and


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26144:64"/>
doing well, which easily followeth of the contrary opinion. It teacheth also that Gods comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements be not vnpossible to be obserued; nay nor hard (through helpe of grace, which is alwaies at hand) to be obserued of one, which hath but a good will;<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>&amp; onus meum leue</hi> my yoke is sweet, &amp; my burthen light. The which moueth a man to conceiue great hope of eschewing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and liuing wel, which hope, (&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently hart) to do well, a man cannot haue, who perswadeth himself, that Gods commandements be vnpossible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, as I shewed before. Againe it teacheth, that, as a man may, by grace, auoid sinne, and easily keepe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, &amp; by doing good workes, liue well: so this good life is pleasing &amp; acceptable vnto God, and these good workes (as proceeding from grace, and receiuing vertue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the merits of Christ, of which this grace doth depend) are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, and such, for reward whereof,


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:26144:65"/>
God will giue, to them that perseuerant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do them, euerlasting blisse in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. The which doctrine will, doubtlesse, if it be duely considered, breed in a mans mind great loue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to doe well, as the contrary must needs breed, at least, a coldnes in deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not a contempt &amp; loathing of good deeds, and specially of those good deeds, which haue any difficulty annexed to them. It teacheth also that for sinners are prepared exceeding great punishments in the next life; and that though there be meanes in the Church to get remission of sin, &amp; pardon of the paine, yet it teacheth that a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ordinarily be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certaine, that hee hath so vsed those meanes, as that hee hath thereby gotten that remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or pardon; which is a great motiue to make men wary not to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sinne, and to moue them <hi>Cum metu &amp; tremore operari salutem</hi> with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to worke their saluation whereas Protestants vpon supposed certainety of saluation cast away this holesome feare,<note place="margin">Philip. cap. 2.</note> and so may easily become carelesse of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding any sinne. Furthermore it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth holesome lawes and customes,


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:26144:65"/>
of fasting and prayer, and of other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of vertue &amp; piety, wherby the flesh may be subiect to the spirit, and the spirit to God. It maintaineth also secret confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes to a Priest, as being a thing necessary, and commanded by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himselfe, the which both is a great bridle to hold men backe from sinne (as experience teacheth) and is a speciall meanes, whereby the Pastours of the Church knowing the inward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of their flocke, may better, apply fitte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to their spirituall diseases, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, to euery one, fit exercises, for their practise and progresse in vertue. Finally the profession of this Church is such, that euen simple Protestants, when they see any <hi>Catholique</hi> do a thing amisse, will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily say <hi>You should not thus, or a man of your profession should doe otherwise.</hi> So that those which be sinful in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> cannot, in any sort, ascribe their sinnes to any defect, or peruersity of the doctrine of the Church, but must needes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own frailty or malice, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the teaching of the Church, &amp; sometimes eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to their owne conscience, &amp; actuall knowledge.</p>

The Bishops and Pastors could not bee so simple, or so vnmindfull of their duty, but they would first note such an euident contrariety, to the ancient and vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiued faith; and noting it, they would, doubtlesse, with common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent, resist, contradict, and finally, according to Saint <hi>Paule</hi> his rule, accurse it.<note place="margin">Gall. 1.</note> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this could not happen now, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heretofore was heard, that any such absurd errour or heresie did or could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, without noting or resisting; what reason can any man haue, to say, that this hath happened at <hi>Rome?</hi> not being able to alledge any writter, that did note the thing, the person, the time, and what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made and continued against it, as in all heresies that haue spronge vp of new, we can doe. If there could not a little ceremonie be added to the Masse,


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:26144:71"/>
but that it was set downe in history, when and by whom; how could the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Masse, (which consisteth in consecration, oblation, and consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the sacred Hoast) be newly inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and no mention made, when or by whom, or that euer there was any such new inuention at all? If also historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were not afraide to note personall and priuate vices of the <hi>Popes</hi> themselues; which they might well think <hi>Popes</hi> would not willingly haue made open to the world; why should they haue feared to haue recorded any alteration in religion?

If lastly the histories which make mention of these priuate vices of <hi>Popes,</hi> and other Christian Princes, could not onely first


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:26144:71"/>
come out, but also continue, without touch, till these latter times; what reason can any haue to doubte or dreame, but that the like would haue beene set out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the alteration of religion, if it had happened? and that, if any such history reporting any true accident of alteration or change of religion had come out; it should, partly by Gods prouidence, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by humane diligence; haue bin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, till these our daies; especially co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that such records had beene so requisite, for discerning the ancient, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, true Christian religion, from vpstart nouelty, which must needes bee false.</p>
                  <p>So that we may well conclude; that, if Christian religion had, since the Apostles time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altered in <hi>Rome</hi>; it would haue bin recorded in histories, as other things, and especially such notable alterations are recorded: and those histories would haue beene preserued till this day, as other Christian monuments haue beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, euen in time of persecution, yea, euen then, when the persecutors made particuler enquiry for Christian bookes, to burne or consume them. But in those


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:26144:72"/>
auncient histories, there is no mention made of any such alteration of religion in <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore it followeth that there was no such alteration or change at all. No such alteration being made, it is euident that the same faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was in Saint <hi>Paules</hi> time, hath alwaies continued, &amp; is there now. That which was there then, was the true faith and religion, as appeareth by that high commendation, which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> hath left written of it. Therefore that which is there now, must needes bee the <hi>onely</hi> true <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Catholique</hi> faith; and that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which professeth it, must needes bee the <hi>Onely</hi> true <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Catholique Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can I see what answere can, with any probability, be forged against this reason. For to say, that the errours of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> crept in by little and little, and so, for the littlenes of the thing, or for the negligence of the Pastors, were not espied; is an Idle fiction already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed. For first those matters, which the <hi>Protestantes</hi> call errours in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, be not so little matters, but that lesse, euen in the like kinde, are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recorded in stories.

Also the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants account the vse of the Images to be Idolatry, and say (very ignorantly or maliciously) that wee adore stockes and stones, as the <hi>Panims</hi> did. The which thinges, could not so haue crept in, by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, but they must needes be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied: Neither could the Pastours of the Church, at any time, be so simple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, so sleepy and negligent, but they must needes haue seene: and seeing must needes in some sort haue resisted, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue said. For to imagine all the Pastours, of any one age, to haue beene in such a deepe <hi>Lethargicall</hi> and deadlie sleepe, that they could not onely not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, when the enemy should ouer sow <hi>Cockle</hi> in the harts of some; but also when this <hi>Cockle</hi> of false beliefe should grow to

outward action, and especially to publike practise, the which could not be but most apparant; to imagine (I say) all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to be so simple and sleepy, not then to marke, or not to resist, is rather the dreame of a proud man in his sleepe, who is apte to thinke all men fooles beside himselfe, then a iudiciall conceipte of a waking man of any vnderstanding, who ought to thinke of things past, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the verity recorded in stories, or when this faileth, by comparing the likelihood of that which hee thinketh was done by men of that time, with that, which most men of their quality, would do in like case.</p>
