            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT Worshipfull, my very good Friend, Sir THOMAS BARKER.</head>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> 
               <hi>Send you here, an Answer to that Paper I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you; containing a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Reasons, conveyed into the hands of some devout Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men your friends, with purpose to divert them from society with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14157:3"/>
               <hi>and specially in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice established among us. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first view of them, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at the Authors strange drawing and misapplying Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to his purpose, &amp; at the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which he imputed to ancient Hereticks, whereof, to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, I had never read nor heard before. But when I came to examine the places more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in his owne Authors, I found cause even to be astonished at the boldnesse of the man, that taking advantage of the credulity of such good people, durst put such a pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of lies into their hands: And I could not but pitty their case, who being fallen into the net of errour,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14157:3"/>
               <hi>are by such a cunning, but ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practise, in danger to be inwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and snarled by this perswasion of separation, so as, if Gods mercy be not the more, there is no meanes for them to come ever even to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this falshood, wherby their simplicity is abused. There is not a more approoved remedie against the stinging of a Scorpion, then the Scorpion it selfe bruised in oyle, and applyed. I have here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bray this Scorpion; it shall be your part to apply it. And if this Collector can and will justifie under his name his</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Separation, <hi>and his</hi> Catalogue of Heresies, <hi>and his</hi> Charge of Protestants to
<pb facs="tcp:14157:4"/>
renew them, <hi>he shall proove himselfe an honest man: if he cannot, and will yeeld to the truth, at least a good Christian. If he doe not one of the two, request your friends (as our old Proverbe hath it) to let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their</hi> Pater noster, <hi>but cast him, &amp; his</hi> additions to the Catholick faith, <hi>for ever out of their</hi> Creed. <hi>Concluding, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire God to give you and them a right understanding in all things, and to follow the truth in Charity; and rest</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14157:5"/>
they worship; as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Laban, Gen. 31. Or a contrary manner of worshipping him in matter of substance.</hi> Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and differences in opinions, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and ceremonies, doe not make a diverse, much lesse a contrary religion; as appeares in the religion before and after the Law written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Christ. These were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as an infant, a childe, and a man of yeares, yet the same person.</p>
                  <p>As for the terme <hi>Society,</hi> it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of divers sorts; one in the duties of religion, another in common life. Wherein againe some is <hi>necessary,</hi> and not at our choice and discretion, as the society of parents and children, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and masters, subjects and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, citizens, neighbours, kinsfolkes, passengers in the same ship, guests at the same table; yea, every man with another, in that hee is a man. Some againe is <hi>voluntary,</hi> and at pleasure, as of contracting marriage, friendship, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, choosing our habitation and company with whom we will consort our selves. These explications premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14157:6"/>
I answer in these five propositions.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>society</hi> in the worship of God with true beleevers, professing pure <note place="margin">1.</note> religion, is lawfull and necessary, and when it may be had, cannot long bee omitted without sin, <hi>Psal. 122. 1. I was glad when they said unto me, let us goe into the house of the Lord, Psal. 133. 1. Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity, Act.</hi> 2. 42, 44. The Christians of the primitive Church are said to have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in praiers, and were together: and Vers. 46. And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bread from house to house, did eate their meat with gladnesse, and singlenesse of heart. Heb. 10. 25. Not forsaking the assembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>society</hi> with men that worship the true God, though in some <note place="margin">2.</note> points ignorant or misbeleevers, may be holden so long as they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, and God is not dishonoured:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14157:6"/>
                     <hi>Act. 19. 9. Paul resorted to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Iewes,</hi> till they were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and blasphemed the way of the Lord, then hee <hi>separated the Disciples.</hi> See also 1. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 41. where <hi>Solomon</hi> praieth for the stranger that was not of Gods people Israel, but came out of a farre countrey, and should come and pray towards the Temple, that God would heare, and doe according to his request, that all the people of the earth might know his Name, to feare him as Israel did.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>society</hi> with men that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <note place="margin">3</note> a false God, or the true God with a false and Idolatrous worship in the exercise of their religion, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, <hi>Deut. 12. 30. Take heed to thy selfe, that thou bee not snared by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, after that they be destroyed from before thee, saying, how did these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions serve their gods? even so will I doe likewise. Thou shalt not doe so unto the Lord thy God.</hi> How neer so ever they be; <hi>Deut. 13. 6, 7. If thy brother, the sonne of thy mother, or thy sonne, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosome, or</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14157:7"/>
                     <hi>thy friend, which is as thine owne soule, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 27. The Levites are bidden by <hi>Moses</hi> from the Lord, to <hi>slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour,</hi> that had committed idolatry by worshipping God in the golden Calfe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>civill society</hi> with men of a false religion, or wicked life, to <note place="margin">4.</note> whom we are necessarily bound by the Law of God, or man, must be holden, and cannot bee broken without sinne: as that of the <hi>subiect and the Prince, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>the husband and the wife,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. <hi>servant &amp; master,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. yea, <hi>Iew &amp; Samaritane, Luk.</hi> 10. 37.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>civill society,</hi> such as is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary with men of a false religion <note place="margin">5.</note> or wicked life, albeit sometimes it be turned to good, yet it is hazardous to the professours of the truth, as 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 31. and Chap. 19. 2. where <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> hardly escaping with his life, is thus reprooved, <hi>Shouldest thou helpe the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord?</hi> And <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 15.

                  <p>VVE have seen what is in the Catalogues, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres. <note place="margin">Answer.</note> And for the rest, it is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, that these opinions, or any one of them, in that sense wherein they are defended by the Protestants, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14157:29"/>
within the first foure hundred years after Christ. Which that it may the better appeare, I will set downe the doctrine that sounds in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, touching these points.</p>
                  <p>First, we teach, that a sinner truly penitent for all his sinnes, and resting <note place="margin">I.</note> by faith upon the Redemption that is in Christ Iesus, is by that faith alone <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24. 28.</note> freely justified, without the workes of the Law. Notwithstanding, true faith worketh by charity, and sheweth it selfe by good workes, which God doth account for righteous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward farre beyond desert.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that Baptisme is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appointed by Christ our <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 22. 16. Col. 2. 12. Rom. 4. 11, 20.</note> Lord, to wash away sinne, and in stead of Circumcision, to be a seale of the righteousnesse of faith. And that none despising this Sacrament, can be saved. Yet they are not wholly to be excluded from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, who by the straits of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14157:29"/>
time, not by the will of their Parents are deprived thereof; for they may <note place="margin">Act. 11. 16. <hi>See Saint</hi> Ambrose orat. de obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu valent. &amp; S. Aug. de Bapt. cont. Don. l. 4. c. 22. &amp; 25.</note> have the baptisme of the Spirit, though not of Water: as those cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised in the Christian faith, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered martyrdome sometimes before outward Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that in the state of this <note place="margin">III.</note> present life, it is impossible to keep Gods Commandements to <hi>perfection,</hi> according to the Law; but not to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,</hi> when we are in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the gate of mercy is <note place="margin">IV.</note> not to be shut against any sinner; peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently desiring reconciliation, but he is to be admitted to the same, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or publikly.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that Praiers are to be made <note place="margin">V.</note> for all that are departed in the true faith of Christ; that is, first, <hi>Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,</hi> that they are delivered from the body of death, and miseries of this sinfull world. Secondly, <hi>Requests</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:14157:30"/>
of Gods mercy, that they may have their perfect consummation and blisse in body and soule, in the kingdome of God, at the last judgment.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that Virginity, such as the <note place="margin">VI.</note> Apostle describeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34, 37. holy in body and spirit, and underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be free from the cares of this world, to be carefull for the things that pertaine to the Lord, is a more excellent estate then marriage.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, that the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">VII.</note> pray for the Church on earth; and it is lawfull for us to pray to God to heare their praiers: but they know not our hearts; neither may we aske grace or glory of any but God onely.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, that images of God are unlawfull. The images of Christ and <note place="margin">VIII.</note> the Saints may be used in way of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, or remembrance, and with reverent respect: not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14157:30"/>
with incense, vowes, or praiers.</p>
                  <p>Loe here our Doctrine, for which never any man was cut off from the Primitive Church, nor any counted a <hi>Rebell,</hi> till the Pope began to play the masterly servant in the house of God, and to strike his fellow-servants, and cast out whom he list out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>

May we sleepe together, and not say the Lords prayer together? To this it seemed hard to make a handsome answer with reason, therefore the Councell of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the <hi>ancient practise of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall Tradition</hi> are brought in, to beare it downe by meer authority.

Especially these same Psalmes that we are speaking of, calling <hi>Iewes and Gentiles, old and young, all that have breath; yea, the bruit and senselesse creatures</hi> to the joynt performance of this duty, <hi>The praising their Creator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did the <hi>Councell</hi> then forbid that which God commands? Did Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> consent to it? I think not. But the Author of this Collection, whether wittingly or ignorantly, God knowes, goeth about to beguile the

simple with a cunning Translation, and wrong application of this Canon, to make feare where there is no feare.</p>

                  <p>Iudge lastly, and see what a sinne it is for any Catholick to disswade, or be disswaded from such meetings, wherein the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed; the <hi>blessed Trinity</hi> worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> reverently read; the <hi>Psalmes</hi> sung to Gods praise; <hi>Praiers</hi> made for all estates in a knowne and understood language; where there is <hi>admission</hi> into the Church by Baptisme; <hi>instruction</hi> touching our <hi>misery</hi> through sinne by the Law; our <hi>remedy</hi> in Christ by the Gospel; the remembrance of whose perfect <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; his <hi>blessed Body and Blood</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed according to his instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where penitent sinners are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; the <hi>Dead</hi> reverently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended into the hands of God; the <hi>Living</hi> informed according to the
