            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>SHall I be guilty of Tautologies? Shall I Name <hi>Grafton</hi> first, and say she's Beautiful? Or shall I say your Ladyship is most Beautiful, and need I then Name <hi>Grafton?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it I feel inspiring me, while I address you? What is it Transports my Senses and my Soul with Ravishment? 'Tis <hi>Grafton;</hi> 'tis the Dutchess of <hi>Grafton,</hi> Love's Goddess, and the Queen of Beauty.</p>
                  <p>I see your Ladyship in Idea, but ev'n the Idea represents not any form so Amiable.</p>
                  <p>The fancyful Poet's Mistress in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation wears Charms Divinely shining, wears Beauties gloriously Aerial, yet far inferiour.</p>

To whom but to your Grace should I present <hi>Amasia?</hi> To you, the Mistress, the <hi>Amasia</hi> of the World.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Paris!</hi> O happy Son of Royal <hi>Priam!</hi> Who saw three Goddesses at once, three <hi>Graftons!</hi> Not <hi>Hellena,</hi> made both the bribe and the reward for the Golden prize which he decreed to <hi>Venus,</hi> knew any Charms, like <hi>Grafton's:</hi> Not <hi>Hellena;</hi> Not <hi>Venus</hi> self; no, not the three God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses could make up, with Charms united, Glories so exquisitely Celestial.</p>

                     </gap> all in vain been offer'd; Justice had prevail'd o'er all.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Grafton!</hi> 'Tis almost Impious for a Poet to approach you, not in Verse; where is the incense I should offer at the Shrine of Beauty? Where is the Praise, through which the Poet claims his Priviledge to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore? Where are the Flights, the Raptures
<pb facs="tcp:41628:3"/>
of Extatick Poetry? Why soar they not? Why? 'Tis because they Flag beneath you.</p>
                  <p>I cannot Praise you; I will not then attempt it; I have not <hi>Venus's</hi> sufficiently Divine, before me, to draw this <hi>Venus</hi> by. Scarce other Beauties are bright e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be the shadows of your Picture; I shall therefore resist the Torrents of my fancy, and withhold my Artless, my una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pencil.</p>
                  <p>If sorrow in the Face of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Chief could be no otherwise exprest than by a Curtain drawn to vail it, how shall I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to hope that the Superlative excess of Beauty can be describ'd which blooms in yours! I too must draw the Curtain here, and rather choose to hide the Charming ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than, by exposing it in a faint, glimmering Light, to darken, and obscure it more.</p>
                  <p>'Tis <hi>Elyzium,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Kingdom of Love,</hi> which Courts your Grace's presence; both <hi>Sylvius</hi> and <hi>Amasia</hi> Joyn'd (but in a fancyful enjoyment,) claim in this Poem

the Tenant's right of doing Homage to your Ladyship, both Court your Grace to give a visit to their humble Groves, to that <hi>Elyzium</hi> which we can possess only in your Grace's Smiles, for wheresoe'er your Grace appears, Love sways, and fixes his unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Kingdom there.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>SInce 'tis inevitable that Books must be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, when Printed, 'tis almost a necessary Conclusion that Prefaces must be written, whether they will be read or not. I have been in a thousand various Thoughts how to manage in a Point so very Nice; sometimes I have inclin'd to attempt in some sort a Vindication, at least of some of the following Poems; then, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them all, with Censures on my self, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, I am positive, as my Muses and I can meet with from the most rigidly-good Judgment of the most Malicious Critick: Again I thought to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster up all the Poetical excuses the doubting Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor swells with, Just before his Off-Spring comes to Light; as the Juvenile Years in which I writ them; (which by the way, gives me Occasion to say, that on that account I call'd the Book <hi>the Works of the Muses,</hi> having a Notion that the Title bears in it an Air of Puerility.) The undesigning the Publication of most of them, when written; the Publishing them at last not thro' any vain Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ends, but for Private necessary Reasons; and the having destroy'd a larger Collection than I now Publish, I thought might be of weight enough for so light a thing as an excuse. The two last Reasons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> my Approbation,
<pb facs="tcp:41628:5"/>
for the one excuses me to my self, which I think most Material; and the last of all will in a great measure excuse me to the World. I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary only to say three or four Words more, and those partly in Vindication. I have writ several Copies on very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Occasions; Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> has writ some. There are several of <hi>Ovid's</hi> Stories which I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, many of them have been already attempted, some by several Hands; and most of them have been very well perform'd by my Brother, and Publish'd some Years since; mine were written in an other Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knew of his. There is nothing now remains, for my own satisfaction to be said, but to assure the Ladies that they will meet with nothing in my Writings that need cause a Blush; and so, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recommending my Book to their Protection, I am wholly indifferent, and shall be unconcern'd at what the Grave and the Precise shall say.</p>

                        <l>But there I find, nor Sea, nor Cave, nor Wood,</l>
                        <l>Nor Stars, nor Heav'n it self can do me good.</l>
                        <l>Wild Thoughts distract me in those grateful bow'rs'</l>
                        <l>I take each gentle Breeze's Voice for yours.</l>
                        <l>Whilst by Succession day and night return,</l>
                        <l>I, greatly curs'd, must never cease to mourn.</l>
                        <l>Yet Groves like these did once the Joys improve,</l>
                        <l>Of blest <hi>Adonis,</hi> and the Queen of Love.</l>
                        <l>So might I rifle my <hi>Amasia's</hi> Charms,</l>
                        <l>And clasp my Goddess in my burning Arms.</l>
                        <l>How strangely blest might she her <hi>Sylvius</hi> see,</l>
                        <l>And make her self more happy, blessing me.</l>
                        <l>Securely close, and from all Cities far,</l>
                        <l>Remote from tumults, and the noise of War.</l>
                        <l>In secret shades she might my Passion crown;</l>
                        <l>There my <hi>Amasia</hi> might be all my own.</l>
                        <l>As boist'rous Storms endear the distant shore:</l>
                        <l>And hardship always shews our Joys the more.</l>
                        <l>So should she make me Court her even there,</l>
                        <l>And e'er she blest me, let me tast despair.</l>
                        <l>Whilst peaceful silence Reigns thro' all the bow'rs,</l>
                        <l>And ev'n no Whispers can be heard, but ours.</l>

                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41628:18"/>
There we shall ne'er fear any watchful Spies.</l>
                        <l>None but the Moon sees where <hi>Amasia</hi> lies.</l>
                        <l>Such Thought as these my waking wishes fly,</l>
                        <l>Tho' none, <hi>Amasia</hi> loves so fixt as I.</l>
                        <l>Ev'n tho' you hate me most, I Love you still,</l>
                        <l>Nor would be cur'd of my Tormenting ill.</l>
                        <l>My very pain yields me some pleasure now,</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>PArting I felt most Mortal pangs, and smart,</l>
                        <l>I felt your scorn, and I resolv'd to part.</l>
                        <l>Think! think, <hi>Amasia,</hi> with what pains I strove</l>
                        <l>My long fixt Eyes from thy dear Face to move.</l>
                        <l>Not Men condemn'd with deadlier anguish go,</l>
                        <l>To meet their fate, than I to part from you.</l>
                        <l>Yes, I remember, too, too well I may,</l>
                        <l>When my despair deny'd my longer stay,</l>
                        <l>And urg'd me from my self, and thee more dear, away.</l>
                        <l>With forward steps to seek my fair I ran,</l>
                        <l>Resolv'd to part, resolv'd to part a Man.</l>
                        <l>Resolv'd no more to be a Slave, and pine,</l>
                        <l>But be my self, and be no longer thine.</l>
                        <l>Onward in hast to thy abode I flew,</l>
                        <l>To see, to leave, and not to Love thee too,</l>
                        <l>But with dry Eyes to bid a long Adieu.</l>
                        <l>To thy Apartment boldly now I came,</l>
                        <l>And hop'd, and fancy'd that I felt no flame.</l>

Not as a Lover I approach'd thee near,</l>
                        <l>Ask'd what Commands you had for me to bear.</l>
                        <l>Scornful you Smil'd, and answer'd you had none,</l>
                        <l>Then, sixt I stood, a perfect Lover grown.</l>
                        <l>With silent Admiration there I gaz'd,</l>
                        <l>The more I look'd, I grew the more amaz'd.</l>
                        <l>My awful, trembling, wishing Eyes I drew,</l>
                        <l>I took them off, but to look on anew.</l>
                        <l>On thy dear Face fond glances still they cast,</l>
                        <l>They look'd, to see when they should look their last.</l>
                        <l>With wakeful Eyes so have I often lain,</l>
                        <l>Expecting Sleep to case my Mortal pain,</l>
                        <l>But Expectation made the blessing vain.</l>
                        <l>Thus, he who sees thee, and expects to go,</l>
                        <l>Stands still expecting, and may still do so.</l>
                        <l>With wat'ry Eyes I strove in vain to see,</l>
                        <l>Take the last sight, since that the last must be.</l>
                        <l>That I no more must thy dear Beauties view,</l>
                        <l>Made streaming Tears flow from my Eyes anew,</l>
                        <l>Denying then the Pow'r of seeing too.</l>
                        <l>Strait, stagg'ring on, as to Salute, I bow'd,</l>
                        <l>And stumbled near you, and you laugh'd aloud.</l>
                        <l>With slow approaches, to your Lips I came,</l>
                        <l>While your Eyes sparkled with disdainful flame.</l>

A glance so fierce rob'd me of all my Sense,</l>
                        <l>It did no Sun-shine on your Lips dispense,</l>
                        <l>But blasted the dear Fruits I should have gather'd thence.</l>
                        <l>Leaving no Kiss lodg'd on thy Lovely Face,</l>
                        <l>I totter'd feebly from the wish'd Embrace.</l>
                        <l>My Heart beat thick, and now alarm'd me whole,</l>
                        <l>Alarm'd my Senses, and alarm'd my Soul.</l>
                        <l>It's motions rose, to call me thence away,</l>
                        <l>But ah! that very motion urg'd my stay.</l>
                        <l>By slow degrees from thy lov'd sight I drew,</l>
                        <l>I sigh'd, and stood, to take another veiw,</l>
                        <l>Turn'd often back —</l>

                     <p>AS your Great Father Reign'd our Monarch in Wit throughout all its Spacious Regions, but Resided most in the most Flowry Fields of Poetry, I, who am a Tenant, (tho' a Poor one) of the Muses land he sway'd, claim thence a Subject's right of throwing my self into your Ladyship's Protection. And as there is no Salique Law impos'd the Throne of Wit, permit me to salute your Ladyship the Muses Queen; the Crown is yours by
<pb facs="tcp:41628:27"/>
True Descent, and Just Succession; but why should I, rais'd to no Eminency in Verse, pretend to make the Declaration, when the World already has Proclaim'd you so. Your Ladyship's Character of Wit sits Crown'd by the Universal Admiration, as well as the Universal Consent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And had not this noble Empire of the Soul devolv'd on your Ladyship by Birth, Succession must have been excluded, and by Election you had been courted to receive the Scepter. But 'tis your Ladyship's by Descent, as well as by Desert; so equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by both, I find my self at a loss to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether your Ladyship receives more glory by the World's acknowledging the late, and ever admirable Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> your Father; or his Memory, by the World's boasting the incomparable Lady <hi>Sandwich</hi> his Daughter.</p>
                     <p>Thus, Madam, your Ladyship and your Father become Rivals in Fame: And indeed, none besides, can without Arrogance
<pb facs="tcp:41628:27"/>
pretend any Claim, where such a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date as your Ladyship appears. Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sway'd the Heaven of Poetry, at once the awful and the Youthful <hi>Jove,</hi> his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his Fancy, were the Light'ning and the Thunder which he brandish'd. Thus great he rul'd, — and all his Attributes are yours. Your Ladyship lives the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> and seems the charming Off-spring of the very brain of <hi>Jove.</hi> 'Tis your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship's to be beauteous, but yet to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it.

your Ladyship, and if there shall be any offence to be conceiv'd at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, it cannot be because I offer this, but because I withhold the rest, for all the Works of every Muse are yours.

                        <l>And speak in thunder — She is now no more.</l>
                        <l>In mildest flames he that lost Mistress Mourn'd,</l>
                        <l>But in more fierce for bright <hi>Amasia</hi> burn'd.</l>
                        <l>His Skies have twice a mighty hazzard run;</l>
                        <l>By one before, now by a brighter Sun.</l>
                        <l>The sleeping flowers did their gay Beauties hide,</l>
                        <l>As if their paint should be no more descry'd,</l>
                        <l>And hung their heads, rob'd of their blooming Pride.</l>
                        <l>The Mourning <hi>Spheres</hi> did with slow motions rowl,</l>
                        <l>And groans of thunder ran from Pole to Pole.</l>
                        <l>Themselves the Clouds with pangs of anguish tore,</l>
                        <l>With their ripe Birth of Vengeance first they roar,</l>
                        <l>Then fly, as frighted at what late they bore.</l>
                        <l>The wondring Eccho from the hollow ground,</l>
                        <l>In fearful Voice return'd the thund'ring sound.</l>

The angry Winds wrought up the Ocean so,</l>
                        <l>The flashing Seas appear'd to lighten too,</l>
                        <l>Where curling Clouds of roaring Billows drew.</l>
                        <l>Then, while I lay, rock'd by the thund'ring Night,</l>
                        <l>I soon beheld my Scene of vast delight.</l>
                        <l>Thy dear Idea to thy Lover came,</l>
                        <l>And I embrac'd thee in a Charming dream.</l>
                        <l>Our blisses flew not in the Common road,</l>
                        <l>You were all Heav'n, and <hi>Sylvius</hi> all a God.</l>
                        <l>As when in trances ravish'd Infants lie,</l>
                        <l>They see the boundless Blessings of the Sky,</l>
                        <l>So, at that time, that happy time, did I.</l>
                        <l>Alas! how weak's their Judgment, and how poor,</l>
                        <l>Who call Death sleep, but on a longer score,</l>
                        <l>For I did ne'er so truly live before.</l>
                        <l>Oh! that the Night could have for ever stay'd!</l>
                        <l>Ah! too, too soon it's fleeting glories fled;</l>
                        <l>When lovelier far, than was the Fairest Day,</l>
                        <l>Her Shield of Clouds to pointed rays gave way,</l>
                        <l>And on her Wings bore thee, and all my Joys away.</l>

                     <p>THE Fair and the Young, the Poet and the Painter, are equally proud to draw; the Pencil, or the Pen, may be happy in those Draughts; but the Beauties of the Mind, not the Sun himself, whose light Paints the whole Scene of the Creation, ev'n with a Pencil made of Beams, can represent in their Meridian Lustre. The more they shine, the more
<pb facs="tcp:41628:47"/>
they are perceiv'd, the less can they be shadow'd; hence 'tis the Poet finds his the harder task to describe your Ladyship's Vertues, than the Painter's to do you Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in your Person; yet, Madam, that Painter (if any can) who does you Justice in your Picture, plays there the Poet too; for the Sweetness of your Temper, the Sweetness of your Face displays. Instead of the rude sketches of my Pen, your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Picture, prefix'd to this Poem I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you, had been the most agreeable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, for that would give the World the truest Image of your Character: But doing your Ladyship that imagry of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, the Patroness would be read more than the Poet; the Reader would hold his Eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As Beauty is best exprest in being seen, Vertue is so too; for tho' the Original can't be equal'd, your Ladyship may by your Conversation draw fair Copies in the Minds of others; thus may your Affability, Generosity, and several other Graces, which your Ladyship is adorn'd with, and adorn, appear Conspicuous to the World, as the Splendor of the Sun (tho' all Mankind is Conscious that it shines) cannot in it self be view'd, but may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be Admir'd in those pieces of the skies it guilds.</p>

                        <l>But call you Warriour, the Name's dear to you.</l>
                        <l>Ah! then, be gen'rous to the yielding Foe,</l>

Ah! Lovely Youth, oft in my Widow'd Bed,</l>

                        <l>Admire, that War should so delightful be,</l>

                        <l>I thought my Voice Breath'd far more pleasing Ayres,</l>
                        <l>Than the shrill Trumpets could Proclaim in theirs.</l>
                        <l>Why should you rashly Combat in the Field?</l>
                        <l>And slight such spoils as I would gladly yield.</l>
                        <l>There you must hazard, and buy Conquest dear,</l>
                        <l>When all your business was to triumph here.</l>

                        <l>To comfort me, who now extreamly Mourn.</l>
                        <l>How should I Joy to hear what you have done,</l>

                        <p>A Lady, for saken by her Lover, to whom she had not deny'd even the last favours, having been newly recover'd out of a Violent Sickness, which, 'twas believ'd, he occasion'd, and hearing he was gone to be Marry'd to another, and to take Shipping soon after in the North, having with him her Fortune, which she had intrusted him withal, according to the various transports of her Passion, Writes him this following Epistle.</p>

                     <lg>
                        <l>TO you, (false Man) I make my suff'rings known,</l>
                        <l>Whom once I thought I' could have call'd my own.</l>

                        <l>Who us'd to Mourn, when I had cause to grieve.</l>
                        <l>Scarce can my Life of this sad change allow,</l>
                        <l>When you torment, who shall redress me now?</l>

Full of Despair, lay'd Prostrate at my Feet,</l>

                        <l>No, you will Titles, and their Lords receive,</l>
                        <l>An honest Love is all that I can give.</l>
                        <l>The great are false, but I sincerely true,</l>
                        <l>Ah! Treach'rous Man! Who is so false as you?</l>

                        <l>How can you live so far apart from me!</l>
                        <l>Here, my Companions think my Mourning strange,</l>
                        <l>And wonder whence proceeds the dismal change.</l>
                        <l>Hiding my Sorrows, they their cause explore,</l>
                        <l>So, by concealing, I reveal them more.</l>
                        <l>How do they rage, when they the story know;</l>
                        <l>Yet then, ev'n then, I speak excusing you.</l>
                        <l>I first Condemn you, call you false, and then</l>

                        <l>Thus arguing for you, I impeach you more,</l>
                        <l>And make your guilt seem Blacker than before.</l>
                        <l>Then, in my Soul strange wild disorders move,</l>
                        <l>With anxious struglings between grief and Love.</l>
                        <l>A new Confusion in my looks appears,</l>

It is my fate to Love my Father's Foe,</l>
                        <l>I had not known him, had he not been so.</l>
                        <l>Oft have I seen you Marching from afar,</l>
                        <l>Wielding your Sword, then resting on your Spear,</l>
                        <l>While your Cask's Noding Feathers threatned War.</l>
                        <l>Oft I beheld you in the dusty Field,</l>
                        <l>And was alas! with every Gesture kill'd.</l>
                        <l>On our High Walls oft do I wishing stand,</l>
                        <l>And bless the Launce Grasp'd in your vig'rous hand.</l>
                        <l>Your shining Arms the longing <hi>Scylla</hi> views,</l>
                        <l>And likes and praises all that <hi>Minos</hi> does.</l>
                        <l>Well might your Mother's Charms a God subdue,</l>
                        <l>If she knew ever how to Charm like you.</l>
                        <l>The Thund'rer sure had his <hi>Europa</hi> won,</l>

                        <l>By whose dear Eyes poor <hi>Scylla</hi> is undone.</l>
                        <l>Oft, as I sat on our fam'd Tow'rs on high,</l>
                        <l>Often, My Lord, has <hi>Scylla</hi> wish'd to fly</l>
                        <l>To your dear Arms, when I beheld you nigh.</l>
                        <l>How, How alas! shall I be e'er restor'd?</l>
                        <l>Or how shall <hi>Scylla</hi> e'er enjoy her Lord?</l>
                        <l>Mad with desires, I think in what disguise</l>

How meet the dear disturber of my ease,</l>

                  <p>THE Poet in Addressing your Ladyship feels all the Poet's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment and transport; Your every Charm Fires every Thought so fast, the labouring fancy struggles for a Passage. Your Youth, your Beauty, Affability and Wit, when seperately consider'd, seem each to be the greatest Excellence, 'tis impossible any Writer can determine which of those Rivals boast the Preference; but every Writer may thus far be certain, that all of them excel. Shall I say (and yet speak properly) I am lost in a Cloud of Beauty? But 'tis a Glorious, 'tis a Golden Cloud, made Lustrous by the Soul which shines within. Can I, without growing old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my task's Accomplish'd, undertake to
<pb facs="tcp:41628:67"/>
describe your Youth in its full Springing Bloom? Should I not grow proud of my own Performance, could I display you at the height to which you rise by your Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Condescending Affability? Or shall I dare to think that I have Wit enough to venture on the praise of yours? No, Madam, all my <hi>Muses</hi> can perform no <hi>Works</hi> like these. Thinking on your Grace's Endowments, I find my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilder'd in a maze of Vertues; lost, like fam'd <hi>Theseus,</hi> in a Labyrinth; a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, whence no thread of thought can free my wand'ring sense. Strange! that Perfection should seem as intricate as Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour! But Night with over-shadowing Darkness scarce blinds the Eyes so much, as an insufferable Flood of Light. With all submission, Madam, I must own I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline voluntarily, (tho' guiltless) to make a Confession, which yet no guilty Poet ever made. I would flatter your Ladyship, if possibly I could, and boast the Glory of a Work so exquisitely difficult; but 'tis impossible: All Art falls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Nature here: Were it not so, the ravishing Charms which Fire me now to think I should attempt it, would then seem less, and Consequently cool me from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize. Long may your Grace stand thus sublimely Admirable, Long may your Vertues soar beyond the tow'ring Muses reach, — Long, till at last, (and may it then be late) they mount yet higher, to their Native Skies, and shine a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation there.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>SOME Readers turn over Prefaces, as things impertinent; those few who serve not this after the like manner, I fear, will be impertinent Readers. I scribble at present, more for the sake of Fashion, than any thing else, and I think all who write Prefaces, do so. If the World is pleas'd to like a Book 'twill scarce find fault with the want of a Preface, and if the World is pleas'd not to like a Book, the best Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in the World will never recommend it. A Poem and a Preface may be liken'd to a Face, and fine Cloaths; a good Face, 'tis said, needs none, and a bad one deserves none, but some now, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may say I have set my Simile with the heels up, for they would have it, by all means, that the Preface must be the Face of the Book, but in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to such, they who will be positive in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are such as are apt to make Faces. I thought in this to have said something of the Original Occasion of writing these Poems, and so to have touch'd a little on the discovery of the real Person meant by <hi>Amasia,</hi> but I consider my Book will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Me sufficiently, without my exposing Her — and a certain Verse which I have read in honest <hi>Martial</hi> (who knew the fleering Malice of Mankind) deters me from it.</p>

                        <l>That Torch, the Burning Emblem of their Love,</l>

                        <l>Such as are usual at the Marriage Feasts.</l>
                        <l>Nor, while the Bride by her dear Lover sighs,</l>
                        <l>Impertinently vex her, where she lies.</l>
                        <l>No glaring Torches here destroy the Night,</l>
                        <l>But a still Lamp affords a glimm'ring light.</l>
                        <l>These stealths were seen but by the Stars alone,</l>
                        <l>The hasty Sun still found <hi>Leander</hi> gone.</l>
                        <l>He, with regret does from his <hi>Hero</hi> go,</l>
                        <l>How dreadful then do all the Surges show!</l>
                        <l>When her dear Arms must now no longer please,</l>
                        <l>Still with his own he seems to climb the Seas.</l>
                        <l>By day, she always led a Virgin's Life,</l>
                        <l>And was, by Night, more blest than any Wife.</l>
                        <l>So oft <hi>Leander</hi> did the Ocean Plow,</l>
                        <l>That he was known to every <hi>Dolphin</hi> now.</l>
                        <l>Thus they a while with secret Joys were Crown'd,</l>
                        <l>With all the Joys successful Love e'er found.</l>
                        <l>The changing Moon a waining visage wore,</l>
                        <l>Yet found them constant, and their Flames still more.</l>
                        <l>The flowing tides, which swell'd the rising Main,</l>
                        <l>Embrac'd those Strands, which they forsook again.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:41628:88"/>
But still no Ebb was in their Passion known,</l>
                        <l>The Sea of Love was still the greater grown.</l>
                        <l>But Oh! How faithless Fortune's gifts appear!</l>
                        <l>He's rashly fond, who values blessings here.</l>
                        <l>Now Winter hasts, and dreadful Tempests brings,</l>
                        <l>And raging Storms on it's fierce, Windy Wings,</l>
                        <l>Impetuous blasts o'er all the Surges Reign,</l>
                        <l>And wond'rous outrages infest the Main;</l>
                        <l>(The Lovers wish for <hi>Halcyon</hi> Days in vain.)</l>
                        <l>On the cold shores the Sea-men trembling stand,</l>
                        <l>And scarce believe they are secure, at land.</l>
                        <l>But Oh! no danger does <hi>Leander</hi> Mind,</l>
                        <l>Love on this score may well be counted blind.</l>
                        <l>No Jarring Seas or Winds his Soul can move,</l>
                        <l>Their discord seems but Harmony for Love.</l>
                        <l>His fierce desire does on his Mind impose,</l>
                        <l>And nearer much the fatal Turret shows.</l>
                        <l>He sees the Torch, and he must hast away,</l>
                        <l>Tho' the loud blasts seem'd to Commands his stay.</l>
                        <l>In spight of Storms, in spight of Winds, and Rain,</l>
                        <l>He forces Waves, which dash him back again.</l>
                        <l>Oft, tho' repuls'd, with all his utmost Pow'rs,</l>
                        <l>He cuts this Billow, and o'er that he Tow'rs.</l>

                           <hi>Hero,</hi> methinks, should grant some respit now,</l>
                        <l>And tedious absence for a while allow.</l>
                        <l>The tempting Torch should have more cautious been,</l>
                        <l>When not one Star dare in the Heav'ns be seen.</l>
                        <l>It's tender Mistress did no danger know,</l>
                        <l>For her hard fate alas! had order'd so.</l>
                        <l>The gloomy Night a double darkness spread,</l>
                        <l>As if it Mourn'd the black Decrees were made.</l>
                        <l>Yet oft the light'nings in swift Flashes flew,</l>
                        <l>Which did the horrors of the Night renew.</l>
                        <l>While Peals of rowling thunder loudly roar,</l>
                        <l>And the big Ocean seem'd to thunder more.</l>
                        <l>Braving Heaven's threats, the breaking Billows fly,</l>
                        <l>Like dashing Clouds, when Bolts have shook the Sky.</l>
                        <l>While the fierce Winds, and the rough Surges Jar,</l>
                        <l>Threat'ning destruction with their dreadful War.</l>
                        <l>The Poor <hi>Leander</hi> now, all hopeless, strove,</l>
                        <l>To make the <hi>Sestian</hi> shore, and reach his Love.</l>
                        <l>Here, swelling Seas, like mighty Mountains, show,</l>
                        <l>There, Vallies Gape, deep, wond'rous deep below.</l>

                        <l>To all the Pow'rs presiding o'er the Main.</l>

In vain, to Neptune, whom the Flood obeys,</l>
                        <l>In vain, to <hi>Venus,</hi> oft in vain he prays,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Venus,</hi> much deafer than her Mother Seas.</l>
                        <l>In such distress what could complaints perform?</l>
                        <l>They serv'd alas! But to encrease the storm.</l>
                        <l>Yet, the rough <hi>Boreas</hi> he did most asswage,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Orythia</hi> nam'd, he could no longer rage.</l>
                        <l>The stubb'orn <hi>Wind</hi> did mild, and gentle grow,</l>
                        <l>And but in Murmurs, and in sighs could blow.</l>
                        <l>But now the Youth, while strugling with the tide,</l>
                        <l>Fails of his strength, nor can the Waves divide.</l>
                        <l>He breaks the Seas no more with Manly toil,</l>
                        <l>In Triumph, down they bear their wretched spoil.</l>
                        <l>The Tempest still grows louder in the Sky,</l>
                        <l>While the tost Floods with angry Pride run high.</l>
                        <l>And now, a blast, an envious blast takes flight,</l>
                        <l>Prevailing still on the well guarded Light.</l>
                        <l>The storm's loud Malice, with success it Crowns,</l>
                        <l>The Torch goes out, and now <hi>Leander</hi> Drowns.</l>
                        <l>Dash'd with the Ocean's rude insulting streams,</l>
                        <l>Which fill his Throat, as he his <hi>Hero</hi> Names.</l>
                        <l>She, all the While, dreads his unusual stay,</l>
                        <l>Restless, and list'ning, as awake she lay.</l>

Oft, her Wild fears his real Dangers shew,</l>
                        <l>Then, she hopes fondly they are all untrue.</l>
                        <l>A fair pretence does oft our sense deceive,</l>
                        <l>For, what we wish, we can with ease believe.</l>
                        <l>She thinks that then he would not venture o'er,</l>
                        <l>For new delights, and Joys unknown before.</l>
                        <l>But soon she Starts, while her Thoughts strangely rove,</l>
                        <l>And rising cries, then are you come, my Love?</l>
                        <l>But disappointed, she more fearful grew,</l>
                        <l>And fancy'd dismal, hideous things anew:</l>
                        <l>What cannot fancy, help'd by Darkness, do!</l>
                        <l>Her Sickly Mind shews her <hi>Leander</hi> come,</l>
                        <l>Shews him all wet, and shiv'ring in the Room.</l>
                        <l>Dropping, and Pale, he stands beside her Bed,</l>
                        <l>With folded Arms, and with dejected Head;</l>
                        <l>To Tempt him still with Thousand Charms she tries;</l>
                        <l>The pleasing Image her Embraces flies.</l>
                        <l>She, still perplext such by delusions, lay,</l>
                        <l>Till the approach of the sad, conscious Day.</l>
                        <l>Mournful she rose, and Clouded as the Skies,</l>
                        <l>And views the dreadful Sea, with Cautious Eyes.</l>
                        <l>While her fond fancy, to divert her fear,</l>

                     <p>AFter having been a considerable time in Town, deficient all the while in my duty of waiting on your Ladyship; like a true Poet, I flatter my self, that I may make my Book my excuse; not presuming to think it worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Present. How this may pass with your Ladyship, I know not, but am apt to fear, it will, at best, be thought but a Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical excuse for so great an Omission. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb facs="tcp:41628:92"/>
if it may be allow'd to be truly Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, some hopes of your Ladyship's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don must still remain, when I consider you, as you are, a Favourer of Poetry. While the Muse introduces me to your Ladyship, I pass securely, like <hi>AEneas</hi> conducted by the <hi>Sybil,</hi> to <hi>Elyzium.</hi> The Golden Bough, that <hi>Hero</hi> brandish'd, intitled him to visit all the shady Groves, but here my Pen must fail, and I shall perhaps, be left without a Guide in Darkness, since I can hardly boast <hi>That</hi> for a Golden Branch. But to ascend more to the light; part of the Muses Works, Madam, are lay'd here at your Ladyship's Feet; and I am sensible, such is your quick, and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Penetration, you need not be at pains to stoop, to take them up; scarce can they be read so fast, as your Ladyship can both find their Beauties, (if they have any) and their faults; but so fustly your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour Rivals your Judgment, 'twill be hard to determine, whether you will see the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:41628:92"/>
more readily, than you will Wink at the latter. Your Ladyship's Father, the late Earl of <hi>Radnor,</hi> when Governour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the kind Patron to mine, he rais'd him to the first steps, by which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ascended to the Dignities he bore, to those, which render'd his Labours more conspicuous, and set, in a more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious light, those living Merits, which now make his Memory belov'd. These, and yet greater Temporal Honours, your Family heap'd on him, by making, even me, in some sort related, and ally'd to you, by his Inter-Marriage with your Sister, the Lady <hi>Araminta.</hi> How imprudent a Vanity is it in me to boasts a Father so Meritorious! How may I be asham'd to prove my self his Son, by Poetry, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualification, which he so much excell'd in, but yet esteem'd no Excellence. I bring but a bad proof of Birth, laying my claim in that only thing he would not own. These are, however, Madam, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
<pb facs="tcp:41628:93"/>
of Immaturer Years; and riper Age, may, I hope, bring forth more solid Works. In the mean time, such as they are, they Court your Ladyship's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</p>

                     <head>The Description of a Tempest, and a Fight at Sea.</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>NOW, deep in Night, the rowling Surges rise,</l>
                        <l>And swelling Seas presage Tempestuous Skies.</l>
                        <l>With angry Foam the raving Billows roar,</l>
                        <l>And, white with Chasing, make their fury more.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:41628:107"/>
Thro' the thick air each Wave his Waters hurls,</l>
                        <l>And in thick Clouds Wrap their fierce, foaming curls.</l>
                        <l>The tossing Seas now proudly mount on high,</l>
                        <l>And Tow'r still up, as if to scale the Sky.</l>
                        <l>Whilst the rough Winds encrease the boist'rous War,</l>
                        <l>And drive on Troops of Billows from afar.</l>
                        <l>Now raging less, two Rival Vessels meet,</l>
                        <l>And each, behind them, left a shatter'd Fleet.</l>
                        <l>From Mount'nous heights they were with horrour thrown,</l>
                        <l>Into a Hell of Waters tumbled down.</l>
                        <l>Now both at once, in all their danger struck,</l>
                        <l>And each believ'd that he had forc'd a Rock.</l>
                        <l>Toss'd by the storm, they both are Mounted up,</l>
                        <l>And view each other from the Billows top.</l>
                        <l>Inrag'd, they now are for the War prepar'd,</l>
                        <l>Their Foe both scorn, nor is the Tempest fear'd.</l>
                        <l>Bold Sons of Mortals, who no Laws obey!</l>
                        <l>Their rage grows fiercer than the Winds, or Sea.</l>
                        <l>Now both the Fleets are met, and louder roar</l>
                        <l>Than the mad Floods, and all the storm before.</l>
                        <l>The Voice of War thro' all the Ships had made,</l>
                        <l>A mighty Tempest, tho' the Winds were lay'd.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41628:107"/>
From their rude sides so fierce a Flame was thrown,</l>
                        <l>None dreaded now, or could expect to drown.</l>
                        <l>Each is desirous here his Life to lose,</l>
                        <l>And Deaths, far worse, than what they shunn'd they choose.</l>
                        <l>A desp'rate Courage from their danger grows,</l>
                        <l>They fall content among their slaughter'd Foes.</l>
                        <l>Just so, one Wave does o'er the former Tow'r,</l>
                        <l>And on it's Head with all his Forces pour.</l>
                        <l>Each spends it self to dash the other down,</l>
                        <l>And with his ruines, he involves his own.</l>
                        <l>Now, in vast sheets the curling light'ning flies,</l>
                        <l>As if the Guns had set on Fire the Skies.</l>
                        <l>Dread <hi>Jove</hi> storms high, and thunders loudly down,</l>
                        <l>He fears the Victors should invade his throne.</l>
                        <l>The Sons of Earth dar'd once attempt his Sky,</l>
                        <l>And these Sea-Gyants sure, are vast as they.</l>
                        <l>With all their spreading Wings they fly afar,</l>
                        <l>And every Word they utter, threatens War.</l>
                        <l>Thick Clouds of smoak from their loud Guns arise,</l>
                        <l>And in large, gloomy rolls, mount, and obscure the Skies.</l>
                        <l>So roar the Cannons on the Noisy Main,</l>
                        <l>The Thunder does but Eccho them again.</l>
                        <l>Here, the proud Seas so vastly large appear,</l>
                        <l>A Squadron Fires, and dreads a Navy there.</l>

                     <head>LETTERS <hi>of</hi> LOVE.</head>

                        <l>AS Men untry'd stand shiv'ring on the shore,</l>
                        <l>And wish, impatient, the first plunge were o'er;</l>
                        <l>Till at the last —</l>
                        <l>Boy'd up with fancy'd hopes they shall not sink,</l>
                        <l>Headlong they leap, and leaping Spurn the brink.</l>
                        <l>So, doubting long, the ruin'd <hi>Sylvius</hi> stood,</l>
                        <l>So plung'd —</l>
                        <l>But void of hope, down Love's impetuous Flood,</l>
                        <l>Others by Waters may, unskill'd, expire;</l>
                        <l>More fierce my wreck; I'm lost in Seas of Fire.</l>
                        <l>With me, as with some wretch pursu'd, it fares,</l>
                        <l>Oceans before, behind him Swords and Spears.</l>
                        <l>Bold does he plunge, or tamely yielding dies;</l>
                        <l>Easy his fate, or if he stands or slies,</l>
                        <l>But oh! what Sword —</l>
                        <l>What Spear can pierce like bright <hi>Amasia's</hi> Eyes?</l>
                        <l>

You know my fate, you know, and make it too,</l>
                        <l>All I can be, depends alone on you,</l>
                        <l>You know I Love you, too, too well I do.</l>
                        <l>Love with the humblest Passion, yet so high,</l>
                        <l>That but your scorn can with that Passion vye;</l>
                        <l>Unhappy Passion! thrice unhappy I!</l>
                        <l>Ill has the Partial hand of chance assign'd</l>
                        <l>Fortunes too slender, but too large a Mind.</l>
                        <l>By this the greatness of my Soul I prove,</l>
                        <l>I Love with more than with a Mortal Love.</l>
                        <l>Yet you, the fair, imperious Charmer, you,</l>
                        <l>Will not believe those Vows I offer true.</l>
                        <l>Too mean the Captive, and Obscure the Prize;</l>
                        <l>Under unhappy Stars that Lover lies,</l>
                        <l>Where Beauty Conquers, and where Pride denies.</l>
                        <l>In vain the proof of my pretence you shun;</l>
                        <l>You needs must see what your own Eyes have done.</l>
                        <l>But to convince you of the pangs I bear,</l>
                        <l>O do not see alone, but see, and hear.</l>
                        <l>Hear, tho' you never make the least return,</l>
                        <l>Hear me declare how I shall ever burn.</l>

                        <hi>To</hi> Amasia.</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>IN vain in slighted Numbers I complain,</l>
                        <l>In vain I write, when I have spoke in vain.</l>
                        <l>Nor Tongue, nor Pen can you, Obdurate, move,</l>
                        <l>At once disdaining either Wit or Love.</l>
                        <l>In what a maze of griefs am I perplext!</l>
                        <l>Love, the first Crime, and writing was the next.</l>
                        <l>Both Crimes, yet both yield Anguish and Delight,</l>
                        <l>For while I live —</l>
                        <l>I'm doom'd to Love, and while I Love, to Write.</l>
                        <l>Tho' sense like yours permits no soft return,</l>
                        <l>Be mild at least, ah! do not, do not scorn.</l>
                        <l>Believe I Love you, be assur'd I do,</l>
                        <l>Assurd — I Love, and could adore you too;</l>
                        <l>Why should I urge what seems a Crime to you?</l>
                        <l>Yet I'll confess, tho' so confessing die,</l>
                        <l>'Tis I who Love you most, 'tis only I.</l>
                        <l>Of this, my Crime, as of desert I boast,</l>
                        <l>Yes, I am Ravish'd here —</l>
                        <l>To think, to know, and vow I Love you most.</l>
                        <l>Love is reported blind, tho' blind he be,</l>
                        <l>I see I Love —</l>
                        <l>And thou the object, all must own I see,</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:41628:121"/>
Spight of your haughty scorn, you see it too,</l>
                        <l>Tho' you disdain to look at me, you do.</l>
                        <l>At once your Pride and Reason you display;</l>
                        <l>Why should you cast the smallest Glance away?</l>
                        <l>Others with darts from shooting Eyes are struck,</l>
                        <l>Me you confound, and Kill without a look.</l>
                        <l>Would I could Learn, O teach this Charming Skill,</l>
                        <l>Teach me to save my self, tho' not to kill.</l>
                        <l>It cannot be, here the Obstruction lies,</l>
                        <l>Unhappy, Eyes I have —</l>
                        <l>And I must look, as long as I have Eyes.</l>
                        <l>'Twas they first drew the fatal Poyson in,</l>
                        <l>Would they — or I my self had never been,</l>
                        <l>But fate is past, I am, and they have seen.</l>
                        <l>Seen? — Were that all, your Slave had still been free.</l>
                        <l>But still the Soul Admires, whene'er they see.</l>
                        <l>O my <hi>Amasia!</hi> no, oh! no, ye Pow'rs!</l>
                        <l>She is not mine —</l>
                        <l>Nor wilt thou be, tho' I am ever yours.</l>
                        <l>Would I were yours, but that, ye Pow'rs Divine!</l>
                        <l>That cannot be, for thou would'st then be mine,</l>
                        <l>Can it not be? — what can't the Pow'rs above!</l>
                        <l>To them my slighted, humble suit I'll move.</l>
                        <l>Rather, to thee — thou art the Pow'r of Love.</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>AS Men on Racks feel Tortures, and complain;</l>
                        <l>Severer far than theirs, my Mortal pain:</l>
                        <l>So, do I feel, sigh so, like them in vain.</l>
                        <l>Like them confessing dying Truths at last,</l>
                        <l>And blest that Power which Tortures me so fast.</l>
                        <l>Compar'd with mine —</l>
                        <l>Small is the greatest Malefactor's smart;</l>
                        <l>Wheels break their Limbs, Love gnaws, and Tears my Heart.</l>
                        <l>Stay, let me tell my Num'rous suff'rings o'er,</l>
                        <l>And think — O no; — no let me think no more.</l>
                        <l>Ambition vast my Airy Thoughts pursue,</l>
                        <l>Confus'd, of all things, and yet all of you.</l>
                        <l>You all my Notions, all my Sense Enthral,</l>
                        <l>Confin'd — confin'd to you? yet you are all.</l>
                        <l>Now, to <hi>Amasia's</hi> Charms alone I bow,</l>
                        <l>Then she disdains —</l>
                        <l>My own desire must be my Mistress now.</l>
                        <l>Where can my Anxious Soul at last have rest?</l>
                        <l>There is no Calm, but in <hi>Amasia's</hi> Breast.</l>

Thro' every Vein the subtile Poyson flies,</l>
                        <l>And dancing, leaps at my enlighten'd Eyes.</l>
                        <l>Thick on my Heart dashes my boiling Blood,</l>
                        <l>Wash'd like some Rock by the insulting Flood.</l>
                        <l>Yet not unmov'd; it trembles at each touch;</l>
                        <l>Mine's sure no Rock, your Heart is only such.</l>
                        <l>Believe, <hi>Amasia,</hi> could you know my Love,</l>
                        <l>Rock as it is, such Passion needs must move.</l>

                        <l>Soon would you pity him, whom now you scorn.</l>
                        <l>Whate'er the Female, rigid Pride foretels,</l>
                        <l>There must be softness, where such Beauty dwells.</l>
                        <l>O think again, think on the ills I bear,</l>
                        <l>And do not, do not drive me to despair;</l>
                        <l>Must all — must all be cruel, who are fair?</l>
                        <l>Beauty, like light'ning thus it's Pow'r maintains,</l>
                        <l>And less in Charming than in Terrour Reigns.</l>
                        <l>O that true Love should with disdain be paid!</l>
                        <l>O that my Passion should your sport be made!</l>
                        <l>Late, at your Father's Gates I saw you stand,</l>
                        <l>And Knock for Entrance with a gentle hand.</l>
                        <l>The conscious Gates (kind to my Pray'rs) were barr'd,</l>
                        <l>I saw —</l>

Long time you stood, tho' then I thought not so,</l>

                        <l>Blessings so great your harsh decree denies,</l>

                        <l>Something peculiar in your form is seen,</l>

                        <l>Yet Sense can never bid <hi>Amasia</hi> scorn.</l>
                        <l>By Fate's decree, Love rages in the Blood;</l>
                        <l>A Passion cannot be by force withstood,</l>

                        <l>Can I at once mention thy Name, and hate?</l>
                        <l>Love Choaks that Word, for Love to me is fate.</l>
                        <l>Resentment now does with soft Fondness Jar,</l>
                        <l>Reason and Love wage an Eternal War,</l>
                        <l>Love Fights — Love Conquers still —</l>
                        <l>And my own Heart is his Triumphant Car.</l>
                        <l>In vain I call my Senses to my aid,</l>

                        <l>For I am soon by ev'ry Sense betray'd.</l>
                        <l>Now, I resolve thy Beauties to despise,</l>
                        <l>And look — but look alas! with longing Eyes.</l>
                        <l>Each pointed Glance, with haughty Courage Arm'd,</l>
                        <l>Looses its Edge, and at thy sight grows Charm'd.</l>
                        <l>In all I yield, and strait, ye Pow'rs Divine!</l>
                        <l>My Heart, and Soul, as well as Eyes, are thine.</l>

Whene'er I touch thee, I transported grow,</l>
                        <l>Whene'r I touch, which but in Thought I do,</l>
                        <l>More soft thou seem'st —</l>
                        <l>Than downy Swans, or than the Fleecy Snow.</l>
                        <l>Thy Fragrant Breath —</l>
                        <l>More smelling Sweet than richest Perfumes blows,</l>
                        <l>Than Scents of Violets, or the blooming Rose.</l>
                        <l>To catch new Sweets, oft flying <hi>Zephirs</hi> stay,</l>
                        <l>Around thy Lips, and with thy Tresses play,</l>
                        <l>Then pleas'd, with Whistlings fly —</l>
                        <l>And on their Wings bear the dear spoils away.</l>
                        <l>In thee all Odours keep their Lov'd aboad,</l>
                        <l>One sigh of yours would Charm, or make, a God.</l>
                        <l>From place to place, tastless of Food, I rove,</l>
                        <l>Loathing all else — my only food is Love.</l>
                        <l>Musick, be dumb — what Musick can I hear?</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Amasia's</hi> Voice can only Charm my Ear,</l>
                        <l>All's discord else — there's only Musick there.</l>
                        <l>Thy Ayres, at once, Fann, while they raise the Fire,</l>
                        <l>Thy Words beyond all others Songs inspire,</l>
                        <l>Charming the Poet more than his <hi>Apollo's</hi> lyre.</l>
                        <l>Seraphick strains from every Accent spring,</l>
                        <l>Sing not <hi>Amasia</hi> — no —</l>
                        <l>For I should grow Immortal, should you sing.</l>

Whene'er you speak, fond of the Charming sound,</l>
                        <l>With the Lov'd Voice the Hills, and Vales rebound,</l>
                        <l>Scarce, scarce at last by repetition drown'd.</l>
                        <l>O had the Vocal Nymph such strains restor'd,</l>
                        <l>Had <hi>Eccho's</hi> Voice been such, <hi>Narcissus</hi> had ador'd.</l>
                        <l>Ravish'd like me, he had Condemn'd his choice,</l>

                        <l>For thou had'st never Lov'd, if thou had'st never seen.</l>
                        <l>Hurl, hurl the Bleeding Balls, and let them meet</l>
                        <l>Their abject Doom, spurn'd by <hi>Amasia's</hi> Feet.</l>
                        <l>What have they done? how does their Crime appear;</l>
                        <l>What could they do, but look, when she was near?</l>
                        <l>With sight Seal'd up, Men sleep, tho' Stars shine Bright,</l>
                        <l>But the Sun ris'n —</l>
                        <l>All Eyes are Open to receive the light.</l>
                        <l>O let me grow distracted with my Moan,</l>
                        <l>And roving in some desart land, unknown,</l>
                        <l>Lose my loath'd Life, and Senseless, stiffen into Stone.</l>

Ev'n then the Marks of deepest Woes I'll bear,</l>

                        <l>A frightful Wildness in my look, and Terrour in my Air.</l>
                        <l>Strange! I should wish this desp'rate State to prove,</l>

                        <l>The softest, dearest, and the tend'rest Love!</l>
                        <l>No Charm but Gold? — Oh! wilt thou then be sold?</l>

I receiv'd it, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had, by Merit, any right to keep it, but because, as all praise is her's, she has Power to give it where she pleases. Whoever this Charming <hi>Urania</hi> is, I must confess she's altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, and when I read the Panigyrick she has been pleas'd to send me, I have reason to fear I am as much unknown to her. Tho' the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she has made me in her Verses be a very great one, she may yet confer one much greater on me in permitting me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <l>Urg'd, as a proof of his continu'd Love.</l>
                        <l>If yet, my dearest consort is not cloy'd,</l>
                        <l>Nor slights those sweets he has so oft enjoy'd.</l>

                        <l>If yet, free Love springs from your Nuptial Chains,</l>

                        <l>Grant, on some Terms, I may my Sister see,</l>

                        <l>Promise my Father she shall soon return,</l>

And now, <hi>Pandion</hi> Welcomes there his Son,</l>
                        <l>Who tells him why he thro' such hazards run,</l>
                        <l>And strait, his <hi>Progne's</hi> urgent suit begun.</l>
                        <l>At first, small warmth his kind entreaties show,</l>
                        <l>But <hi>Philomela</hi> seen, more fierce they grow.</l>
                        <l>Richly Attir'd, the Charming Virgin came,</l>
                        <l>And from her Eyes, each glance is Flash'd, like Flame,</l>
                        <l>The Youthful King strait burns with fond desire,</l>
                        <l>Like Sun-dry'd Reeds, which, at each spark, take Fire,</l>
                        <l>The Lustful Passion can't be long withstood,</l>
                        <l>For now it Rages in his boiling Blood,</l>
                        <l>And, like some Rapid Torrent, swells the Flood.</l>
                        <l>His rising sighs, like Boist'rous Tempests blow,</l>
                        <l>And Passion's Seas all Reason's bounds o'erflow.</l>
                        <l>Some Thoughts, like Waves prest by the tides, are gone,</l>
                        <l>But still, full, Foaming, new desires come rolling on.</l>
                        <l>Sometimes, he thinks, to make her Maids his Friends,</l>
                        <l>And with large gifts to Bribe them to his ends,</l>
                        <l>Again, resolves to use unlawful force,</l>
                        <l>As if the safest, and the surest course.</l>
                        <l>Vows, he will soon remove each Anxious Bar;</l>
                        <l>If not by Love; possess, by bolder War,</l>

And now, perplext with long delays, he sues,</l>
                        <l>And, much more urgent, his Request renews,</l>
                        <l>Still, on his Wife's behalf he seem'd to press,</l>
                        <l>While his fond Words flew to a vast excess.</l>
                        <l>Whene'er his speech did into transports break,</l>
                        <l>He said, she weeping, charg'd me thus to speak.</l>
                        <l>So, with close Arts successfully he pleads,</l>
                        <l>And the Maid follows, as the Lover leads.</l>
                        <l>Fond of her Sister, she too wish't to go,</l>
                        <l>Kisses her Father, and intreats him so.</l>
                        <l>While <hi>Tereus</hi> Thus perceives the Virgin sue,</l>
                        <l>Pleas'd, and o'erjoy'd, he does his speech renew,</l>
                        <l>Still more, and more inflam'd, at every view.</l>
                        <l>Her soft Embraces set his Soul on Fire,</l>
                        <l>He does each Action, and each word admire,</l>
                        <l>All spreads his Loves, and raises new desire,</l>
                        <l>No longer now the good, old King denies,</l>
                        <l>But gives consent at last, with weeping Eyes.</l>
                        <l>The Night comes on, and with it, Peaceful rest,</l>
                        <l>To all alas! But to the Lover's Breast.</l>
                        <l>In Am'rous Murmurs <hi>Tereus</hi> does complain,</l>
                        <l>Bright <hi>Philomela</hi> caus'd his Anxious pain.</l>
                        <l>Sleep shuns his Soul, and it's kind ease denies;</l>
                        <l>Like a coy Maid, when courted most, it flies.</l>

The Charming fair does all his Thoughts possess,</l>
                        <l>Great was his Love, which yet he wisht not less.</l>
                        <l>His fancy brings her still before his view,</l>
                        <l>His very fancy does his Flames renew,</l>
                        <l>And as he thinks he sees her, he begins to sue.</l>

                        <l>Thus does he pass the tedious Hours of Night,</l>
                        <l>With Am'rous, painful Thoughts, which yield a Nice Delight.</l>
                        <l>Oft does he wish for the approach of Day,</l>
                        <l>That he may hast, with his Lov'd prize, away.</l>
                        <l>And now, at last, the wish'd-for Morn appears,</l>
                        <l>When old <hi>Pandion,</hi> thus with streaming Tears,</l>

                        <l>My Son, since Piety this due requires,</l>
                        <l>I yield to yours, and <hi>Progne's</hi> fond desires.</l>
                        <l>But oh! I charge you by the Gods above,</l>
                        <l>Guard, and defend her, with a Father's Love.</l>
                        <l>You, Daughter, leave me not too long alone,</l>
                        <l>How shall I live, when my last comfort's gone!</l>

There to be offer'd, Snowy Heifers come,</l>
                        <l>And the rich Altar smoaks with pretious Gum.</l>
                        <l>Among the Crowd the hopeless Lover goes,</l>

                        <l>A long, long time does he forbear to pray,</l>
                        <l>For still his doubts deny'd his Speech the way,</l>

With wond'rous longings he in hast returns,</l>

                        <l>THE Beauteous <hi>Salmacis,</hi> who Lov'd her ease,</l>
                        <l>By her own Fountain Passes happy Days.</l>
                        <l>There she delights, there do her wishes please.</l>
                        <l>This Nymph was still unpractis'd in the chace,</l>
                        <l>She ne'er contended in a painful race.</l>
                        <l>Lov'd not to mingle with <hi>Diana's</hi> Train,</l>
                        <l>Nor draw the Bow, nor Hunt upon the Plain.</l>
                        <l>Oft her laborious Sisters bid her rise,</l>
                        <l>To Join with them, and get some stately Prize.</l>
                        <l>They urg'd her oft with Words repeated o'er,</l>
                        <l>To follows Staggs, or to pursue the Boar.</l>
                        <l>All would not do, she would no Quiver seize,</l>
                        <l>Nor for their toil forgo her pleasant ease.</l>
                        <l>But in her Fountain she delights to play,</l>
                        <l>By Night rests there, and there she Bathes by Day.</l>
                        <l>Still in that liquid Glass she drest her Charms,</l>
                        <l>And her fair Eyes with Loving glances Arms.</l>
                        <l>There still she learnt what Gesture best became,</l>
                        <l>There practic'd Charms, such as could raise a Flame.</l>
                        <l>Oft from one side she to the other Swims,</l>
                        <l>Then in fine Lawn arrays her Beauteous Limbs.</l>

Oft, on soft Moss, stretcht at their length they lay,</l>
                        <l>And thro' the White, transparent Robes their Lovely shape display.</l>
                        <l>To the full view she leaves her Bosom bare,</l>
                        <l>Spreads o'er her Shoulders her loose, flowing Hair,</l>
                        <l>And shews her Face, her Neck, and Breasts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fair.</l>
                        <l>Languishing now, on blooming Banks she lies,</l>
                        <l>And plucks such Flow'rs as please her Curious Eyes.</l>
                        <l>When she perciev'd, as she was busy'd there,</l>
                        <l>The Charming Son of <hi>Hermes</hi> coming near,</l>

                        <l>His blooming Beauties she admir'd much more,</l>
                        <l>Than the fair Flow'rs for which she long'd before.</l>
                        <l>At the first sight, her wishes sill'd her Soul,</l>
                        <l>While soft Emotions in her Bosom rowl.</l>
                        <l>Her Fires grew fiercer, as he nearer came,</l>
                        <l>And now she fondly burns with glowing Flame.</l>
                        <l>Much she desir'd, yet still conceal'd she lies,</l>
                        <l>Till with soft looks she deckt her sparkling Eyes.</l>
                        <l>'Till she appear'd with all her utmost Art;</l>
                        <l>'Till all her Beauties bloom'd in every part,</l>

With all her skill she does each Feature Arm,</l>
                        <l>And sets her Dress, who of her self might Charm.</l>
                        <l>She now at last in all her Robes applies,</l>
                        <l>To the dear Youth in looks, and moving sighs,</l>
                        <l>And by her melting Words she shews him how she dies.</l>
                        <l>With gaining ways, and soft, bewitching snares,</l>
                        <l>Her Passion thus she to the Swain declares.</l>

                        <l>Still as he swims, his glitt'ring Limbs appear,</l>

                        <l>But still, to hear his Speech, she longing stay'd,</l>
                        <l>That she might Answer to whate'er he said.</l>
                        <l>His Young Companions gone, the Boy complains,</l>
                        <l>And calls, and calls them in continu'd strains.</l>
                        <l>Where do you fly? Fond Eccho hears him cry,</l>
                        <l>And straits she Answers him, <hi>where do you fly?</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Around he looks, but he can nothing see,</l>
                        <l>And much he wonders whence the Voice could be.</l>
                        <l>Is any near? He crys, she pleas'd to hear</l>
                        <l>Those Joyful Words, returns, <hi>is any near!</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Once more the Huntsman hollows o'er the plain,</l>
                        <l>And utters sounds, which she returns again.</l>
                        <l>More loud he calls, she of the Office proud,</l>
                        <l>In hasty Accents, made replies as loud.</l>

Then let us Join, he said, her Thoughts combine,</l>

                        <l>Soon as she spoke, strait from the Woods she flew,</l>
                        <l>And round his Neck her Arms, transported, threw.</l>
                        <l>With close Embraces fondly lock'd him fast,</l>

                        <l>To the ingrateful Boy for whom so much she burns.</l>
                        <l>Mean-while he flies, disdainful, from her view;</l>
                        <l>Now, so repuls'd, she will no more pursue.</l>
                        <l>With all her speed she runs to gloomy Groves,</l>
                        <l>And grieves to think he should despise her Loves.</l>
                        <l>Her Flames rejected, she Laments, and Mourns,</l>
                        <l>And Weeps, and Blushes, with the shame, by turns.</l>
                        <l>Alone she Pines with her excess of Woe,</l>
                        <l>But Loves him still, who made her Wretched so.</l>
                        <l>Her raging Passion, and her fonder grief,</l>
                        <l>Torment her so, she can have no relief.</l>
                        <l>Thoughts of her slight the Virgin waking keep,</l>
                        <l>Restless, and Languishing, for want of sleep.</l>
                        <l>Now she consumes with her continu'd care,</l>
                        <l>And all her Moisture is dissolv'd to Air.</l>

                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41628:180"/>
Nought of her now remains but empty sound,</l>
                        <l>Her Voice still heard in Caves, and Hollow ground.</l>
                        <l>Thus her the Cruel, Young <hi>Narcissus's</hi> Pride,</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>IN a deep Vale; lodg'd among Ancient Trees,</l>
                        <l>Which Shade it round, a Silver Fountain lies.</l>
                        <l>Girt with long Grass, whose Verdant Beauties show,</l>
                        <l>To whose great Bounty they their freshness owe.</l>
                        <l>No angry blasts the Spring's smooth surface moves,</l>
                        <l>A peaceful Calm the liquid Chrystal Loves,</l>
                        <l>No loose, rude leaves it's Virgin Waters stain,</l>
                        <l>From the least Mote, and every Blemish clean.</l>

So clear it shows, the Beauteous Trees appear,</l>
                        <l>As if they saw to place their branches there.</l>
                        <l>Whose lofty Tops do with such tremblings move,</l>
                        <l>As if they too were with themselves in Love.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Here, tir'd with hunting, fair <hi>Narcissus</hi> came,</l>
                        <l>Nor from such Waters fear'd a rising Flame.</l>
                        <l>Pleas'd with the Shade, upon his Face he lies,</l>
                        <l>Till Captiv'd there by his own Conquering Eyes.</l>
                        <l>He sees his Shadow in the liquid Glass,</l>
                        <l>But knew not what his Charming Shadow was.</l>
                        <l>With constant Eyes the fleeting form he views,</l>
                        <l>For fear the darling object he should lose.</l>
                        <l>So have I seen a well-Cut <hi>Parian</hi> Stone,</l>
                        <l>Appear to gaze, with admiration, down.</l>
                        <l>He Loves himself, what shall the Lover do,</l>
                        <l>Both his own Mistress, and his Suitor too?</l>
                        <l>Oft stoop'd he down to catch the pleasing Cloud,</l>
                        <l>And fill'd his Arms with the deceitful Flood.</l>
                        <l>From the sierce Lover the false image fled,</l>
                        <l>Coy, and Disdainful, as a Courted Maid.</l>
                        <l>How could he hope, or e'er expect to find</l>
                        <l>So cold a Mistress to his wishes kind?</l>
                        <l>How could her wat'ry Breast his Flames approve,</l>
                        <l>Too chill alas! to feel the warmth of Love.</l>

Raising at length, with pain, his drooping Head,</l>
                        <l>Thus, with a sigh, and folded Arms, he said.</l>
                        <l>Tell me, ye Woods, ye aged Woods declare,</l>
                        <l>Have ye yet known a Youth so Wretched here?</l>
                        <l>No Seas, nor Mountains do our Joys remove,</l>
                        <l>Nought, but a little Water, parts our Love.</l>
                        <l>As oft as I to Kiss the Flood design,</l>
                        <l>So oft his Lips ascend, to Join with mine.</l>
                        <l>Ah! Beauteous Boy! Why should you scornful flee?</l>
                        <l>I too am Young, I too have Charms, like thee.</l>
                        <l>Come forth, whate'er thou art, nor grieve me so,</l>

                        <l>You move your Lips, I see your Breath appear,</l>
                        <l>But what you utter I must never hear.</l>

                        <l>What shall I wish, what shall I further crave,</l>
                        <l>Since what I covet I already have?</l>
                        <l>Ye bounteous Gods! too much has made me Poor,</l>
                        <l>Disjoin me from my self, I ask no more.</l>
                        <l>Sure my desire may admiration move,</l>
                        <l>I would be disposses'd of all I Love,</l>

Alas! I faint, I find I cannot live,</l>
                        <l>Sure after Death I shall no longer grieve.</l>
                        <l>Would her I Love might stay when I am gone,</l>
                        <l>Two Wretched Lovers are destroy'd in one.</l>
                        <l>Then gaz'd again upon the form he made,</l>
                        <l>And view'd with Watry Eyes the false, deluding Shade.</l>
                        <l>His dropping Tears rais'd Circles, as they fell,</l>
                        <l>And sunk the Shadow which he Lov'd so well.</l>
                        <l>Weeping, methinks, should ease the pains he bore,</l>
                        <l>But ev'n his Tears made him Lament the more.</l>
                        <l>Soon as he saw the fleeting Shadow flee,</l>
                        <l>Ah! stay he cry'd, and I will die with thee.</l>
                        <l>Let me but see you in the Envious Flood,</l>
                        <l>And Feast my Passion on that empty food.</l>
                        <l>Ah! too, too Justly I deserve my pain,</l>
                        <l>The Nymphs all Lov'd me, yet they Lov'd in vain.</l>
                        <l>The Beauteous <hi>Eccho,</hi> oh! I Mourn for her,</l>
                        <l>Ungrateful I, who would not hear her Pray'r.</l>
                        <l>My harsh disdain did that fair Virgin kill,</l>
                        <l>Shame to my Sex! By me, by me she fell.</l>
                        <l>Complaining thus, he beats his Naked Breast,</l>
                        <l>But feels the Torment where the pain was least.</l>
                        <l>His Snowy skin by his rude Blows was made</l>

Which wheu he saw in his fair form appear,</l>

                        <l>Here he receiv'd the strokes, but smarted there.</l>

                        <l>None of those Charms, those fatal Charms remain,</l>

                        <l>That slighted Nymph deplores his hopeless fate,</l>
                        <l>Nor, for his scorn, did she return him hate.</l>
                        <l>From her sad Breast all Thoughts of Vengeance fled,</l>
                        <l>She living Lov'd him, and she Mourns him dead.</l>
                        <l>He dying cry'd, farewel, belov'd in vain,</l>
                        <l>She Sympathizing, so complain'd again.</l>
                        <l>The wasted Youth a Yellow Flow'r became,</l>
                        <l>A Beauteous Flow'r, which still retains the name.</l>
                        <l>The Swains bewail him, all throughout the Groves,</l>

The Am'rous Trees Bow their Officious heads,</l>

                        <l>All who behold her, are her Suitors grown,</l>

                        <l>Unhappy fair! By her own Charms betray'd,</l>

                        <l>Untouch'd, till now, she sported all abroad,</l>
                        <l>But now is Courted by the Shepherd's God.</l>
                        <l>As, Crown'd with Pines, <hi>Pan</hi> from <hi>Lycaeus</hi> came,</l>
                        <l>He saw the Nymph at her delightful game,</l>

                        <l>And with such Words as these, he urg'd her stay,</l>
                        <l>Why from a God do you thus hast away?</l>
                        <l>Sweating, and spent, he follows still the fair,</l>

                        <l>Her growing Beauties now inflame him more,</l>

Now, to smooth <hi>Ladon's</hi> Sandry Banks they flew,</l>
                        <l>She shuns him fast, who does more fast pursue,</l>

                        <l>Thus the balk'd Hound snaps at the Hare in vain,</l>
                        <l>Deceiv'd, Posts on, and is deceiv'd again.</l>
                        <l>But now the Nymph no more has Pow'r to run,</l>
                        <l>Nor knows she how the eager God to shun.</l>

                        <l>Desires their pity, and their aid implores.</l>
                        <l>Her Pray'rs are heard, and she is caught at last,</l>

                        <l>And in short Murmurs make complaints of Love.</l>
                        <l>Pleas'd with the Sound, the God, all Ravish'd, cries,</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>A Cave there is, deep in declining ground,</l>
                        <l>By Stately Pines, and <hi>Cypress</hi> Shaded round.</l>
                        <l>Tall Reeds, and Osiers at the Entrance grew,</l>
                        <l>And parted weeds with Riv'lets running through.</l>
                        <l>The rough, Arch'd Roof all form'd of Mossy Stone,</l>
                        <l>From which long Tufts of Shaggy Grass hung down.</l>
                        <l>Here, Chrystal Streams in the smooth Bottom flow,</l>
                        <l>And rise in Bubbles from their Springs below.</l>
                        <l>From it's Cleft sides in rills the Waters pour,</l>
                        <l>And in their constant Course trace one another o'er.</l>
                        <l>Here, with her Nymphs, the chast <hi>Diana</hi> came,</l>
                        <l>And, all undrest, bathes her soft Limbs with them.</l>
                        <l>Pleas'd with the grateful coolness of the Cave,</l>
                        <l>Her fatal Bow to her Lov'd Maid she gave.</l>
                        <l>When, led by fate, the tir'd <hi>Actaeon</hi> too,</l>
                        <l>With wand'ring steps, to the same Cave withdrew.</l>
                        <l>The Nymphs all Shrick'd to see a Man appear,</l>
                        <l>And stood amaz'd, and senseless with their fear,</l>
                        <l>Like Iv'ry Pales about their Goddess there.</l>

She saw him too, more Tall than all her Train,</l>
                        <l>And wish'd in hast she had her Bow again.</l>
                        <l>As a bright Cloud, by Sun-Beams pierc'd, appears,</l>
                        <l>Or a fair Morn, which Virgin Blushes wears,</l>
                        <l>So Chast <hi>Diana</hi> seem'd, for such were her's.</l>
                        <l>Dashing rude Water in his Face, she said,</l>
                        <l>Tell how you saw a Goddess dissarray'd,</l>
                        <l>Yes, tell aloud where you have boldly been,</l>
                        <l>I give you leave, speak all that you have seen.</l>

                        <l>But when his Head the next clear River shows,</l>
                        <l>And the proud Arms his Nature there bestows,</l>
                        <l>He starts with wonder, and himself he fears,</l>
                        <l>Tho' not his Form, yet his own Mind he bears,</l>
                        <l>And speaks his sorrows in his Groans and Tears.</l>
                        <l>What shall he do? Alas! He grieves, in vain,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Actaeon</hi> ne'er must be himself again.</l>

                        <l>And he must run, for his own Hounds pursue.</l>
                        <l>O'er Craggy Cliffs, o'er Rocks they force their way,</l>

Heav'n, there display'd before me, I could boast,</l>

                        <l>Ev'n Heav'n shows false, and Damns them in the view.</l>
                        <l>Strait, was the Sun o'ercast with sullen Clouds,</l>
                        <l>And gloomy Mists sat heavy on the Floods.</l>
                        <l>The Tempest gather'd, and from Pole to Pole,</l>

                        <l>On Airy Wings, the gloomy Mists were fled,</l>

                        <l>On both sides, near, I saw delightful Groves,</l>

                        <l>I heard the Swains protest, the Virgins sigh.</l>

Damp't with my fate, no wishing glance I cast,</l>
                        <l>Gay looks of Pleasure die, when Joys are past.</l>

But such my Crime, no off'ring can Attone,</l>
                        <l>Offending all, yet meant offence to none.</l>
                        <l>Disrob'd of Passions, how would Players show,</l>
                        <l>Yet, I offended, that I was not so.</l>
                        <l>Hard fate of Mortals, which impending lies,</l>
                        <l>Bearing such Tempests, in themselves to rise.</l>
                        <l>Tempests, and Oceans threaten from afar,</l>
                        <l>But O do thou protect, thou, the Auspicious Star.</l>
                        <l>By thee I guide my course, to thee I pray,</l>
                        <l>The Guardian <hi>Venus</hi> of our <hi>British</hi> Sea.</l>
                        <l>One Breath from thee would soften Storms to Gales,</l>
                        <l>Calm every Billow, and spread full the Sails.</l>
                        <l>So with my Pageant Streamers once again,</l>
                        <l>I shall beneath your Sun-shine Plow the main.</l>
                        <l>But yet, till you, Propitious Princess, smile,</l>
                        <l>I Steer, like Vessels, off, which shun the Isle.</l>
                        <l>You, who to all the height of Goodness live,</l>
                        <l>Instruct your gen'rous <hi>Brittons</hi> to forgive.</l>
                        <l>Ev'n Heav'n, it self, receives affronts from Men,</l>
                        <l>But, they repenting, it grows Calm again.</l>
                        <l>So may'st, thou Flourish long, and bless the Age,</l>
                        <l>So may thy Vertues Crown the future Stage.</l>
                        <l>So, when great <hi>William</hi> shall in Heaven be seen,</l>

                        <l>SUch are your proud, deluding ways to move,</l>
                        <l>I hate you more, than ev'n my Friend can Love.</l>
                        <l>A brave revenge inspires my swelling Soul,</l>
                        <l>While Thoughts of thee in my rais'd Bosom roll.</l>
                        <l>Be gone, yet Nine, your aid I now refuse,</l>
                        <l>For, <hi>Indignation</hi> shall be here my Muse.</l>
                        <l>Immortal hatred urge me on to think,</l>
                        <l>And stain thy Name, with everlasting Ink.</l>
                        <l>My Juster Pen shall Wound your Honour, more</l>
                        <l>Than e'er it rais'd you, to esteem before.</l>
                        <l>Gay you appear, where your false Beauties come,</l>
                        <l>But I shall Rob you of your borrow'd Plume.</l>
                        <l>My Mufe's Wings have soar'd, and born you high,</l>
                        <l>Blown by my Breath, did the vain bubble fly,</l>
                        <l>But now I laugh, to see it's glories die.</l>
                        <l>Tow'ring so lofty, you are giddy grown,</l>
                        <l>And, of necessity, must tumble down.</l>
                        <l>Such Fogs of praises have you drawn from all,</l>
                        <l>In show'rs of Tears the gather'd Mists must fall.</l>
                        <l>Now, thro' those Clouds, my light'ning fancy flies,</l>

Along the Airy confines of thy Fame,</l>
                        <l>My Verse shall roll, charg'd with thy Sultry name.</l>
                        <l>My Hand, now Arm'd, a fatal Pow'r does own,</l>
                        <l>My Pen's the Thunder-bolt to dash thee down.</l>
                        <l>My kindling Eyes with Flames so Furious move,</l>
                        <l>They can't be fancy'd to arise from Love.</l>
                        <l>My fiercer Satyr cannot so expire,</l>

                        <l>With waxen Wings to Airy heights you flew,</l>
                        <l>Which none durst ever yet attempt, but you.</l>
                        <l>As some skill'd Fowler, who the Lark descrys,</l>
                        <l>And from his Glass, darts Sun-beams in his Eyes,</l>

                        <l>In the low Net, which on the ground he spread;</l>
                        <l>So, in thy fall, I'll see thy weakness try'd,</l>
                        <l>When I glance, on thee, all thy rays of Pride.</l>

                     <lg>
                        <l>And know, proud she! The Darts your <hi>Cupid</hi> threw,</l>
                        <l>Were beardless toys, which my Friend Sporting drew.</l>
                        <l>Yet still their Poyson swells his Venom'd Mind,</l>
                        <l>The Hony Passion left a sting behind.</l>
                        <l>Poor suppliant ways you use with sordid Art,</l>
                        <l>And Cringe your self, to undermine a Heart.</l>

                           <pb n="130" facs="tcp:41628:214"/>
Yet, there are Nymphs, can with their coldness, move,</l>
                        <l>More warmth, than you with your feign'd Fires of Love.</l>
                        <l>Your Flag, all White, does innocent appear,</l>
                        <l>And the false signs of a surrender bear,</l>
                        <l>Peace it displays, and wantons with the Air.</l>
                        <l>But when Besiegers would possess the Town,</l>
                        <l>You Fire, like thunder, on the Wretches down.</l>
                        <l>Mean, fawning thing! Who to each Fop would Bow,</l>
                        <l>And flatter him, that he might flatter you.</l>
                        <l>Like Popular Knaves, a suppliant Soul you shew,</l>
                        <l>Cry up the Crowd, to make them Cry up you.</l>
                        <l>Just so, a Pebble struck on stony ground,</l>
                        <l>Falls to that place, which makes it higher bound.</l>
                        <l>'Tis but for praise, you, flatt'ring thing, have Bow'd,</l>
                        <l>And you are humble that you may be proud.</l>
                        <l>Thus, when the Cannon's Ball the highest flies,</l>
                        <l>The Gun bends back, and near the Pavement lies.</l>
                        <l>But while your baseness, and your Pride I blame,</l>
                        <l>Your Judgment Justly should be rais'd to Fame.</l>
                        <l>You know your want of Pow'rful Charms to move,</l>
                        <l>Your Gold excepted, which Commands our Love.</l>
                        <l>From Sulph'rous Mines Men still would dig the Oar,</l>
                        <l>Tho' worse than those, which brought it forth before.</l>

                        <l>'Tis beyond thought he should grow greater still.</l>

                        <l>Sincere, thy grief did his lost Charmer mourn,</l>

                        <l>Well has he Conquer'd, for he Triumphs now.</l>
                        <l>Still next his leading Monarch firm he stood,</l>

Now, with Ambitious Zeal, himself would head,</l>
                        <l>And ev'n by <hi>Nassau,</hi> cannot here be led.</l>
                        <l>Heav'n still the cause, they fought for, did maintain,</l>
                        <l>And <hi>William,</hi> ever glorious in his Reign,</l>
                        <l>With his best chief, espouses Heaven again.</l>
                        <l>Here praise, my Son, for here all praise is due,</l>
                        <l>Their glory flies, where never Mortal's flew.</l>
                        <l>Extol him far — far, as my Wings can soar,</l>
                        <l>Give almost all to him, to <hi>Nassau</hi> only, more.</l>
                        <l>Thus, as thy Fate has fixt, thy Fortune lies,</l>
                        <l>Assume thou sacred Fires, but dare, and rise.</l>
                        <l>When Heaven and <hi>Nassau</hi> raises, who can fall!</l>
                        <l>And both, with gen'rous Zeal, would Cherish all.</l>
                        <l>To Camps, to glorious Camps prepare to flee,</l>
                        <l>Fir'd by thy Patron's Actions may'st thou be,</l>
                        <l>And grow —</l>

                     <p>That Name is all; <hi>Elyzium,</hi> Paradise, and almost Heaven, are in the sound.

                     <p>How, <hi>Orpheus,</hi> shall I call to Mind thy turn of fate? O Poet happy, and accurst! You knew, when you had lost the last short sight of your <hi>Eurydice,</hi> you knew, you saw a glimpse of what I suffer. Despair and Hell are diff'rent but in Name.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:41628:221"/>
Fame might be a Sacrifice to Love! O that thy very Name and Memory might die!

Farewel — give me but leave to assure you, no second Beauty (for all Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will to your's be second) shall deface your Image from my Soul. Once more Adieu — and yet, methinks I cannot leave thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, E'en Death wants Power to part us. O <hi>Laethe!</hi> Where are now thy Streams?

                        <hi>To</hi> Mr —</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>IN vain, My Friend, your kind advice you send,</l>
                        <l>Bid me Love on, you will be more my Friend,</l>
                        <l>The Fetter'd Wretch, not strugling, feels no pain,</l>
                        <l>'Tis he's Tormented, who would stretch the Chain,</l>
                        <l>Not the Eternal links of fate can prove,</l>
                        <l>More firm and strong, than are my links of Love.</l>
                        <l>Bound to my fair <hi>Amasia</hi> I appear,</l>
                        <l>(O would to Heav'n, I were bound truly here!)</l>
                        <l>'Tis more than freedom, to be so confin'd,</l>
                        <l>She's all the Charm of her whole Beauteous kind.</l>
                        <l>Homage to her would you consinement call?</l>
                        <l>We know the Deity is every where, and all.</l>
                        <l>Confin'd to her! alas! it cannot be,</l>
                        <l>But bless me, Heaven's! Make her confin'd to me.</l>
                        <l>No more advise me to forsake my fair,</l>
                        <l>I must Love on, yet, while I Love, Despair.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:41628:223"/>
In vain you strive my Passion to remove,</l>
                        <l>For Oh! I cannot live, unless I Love.</l>
                        <l>If you are griev'd I bear <hi>Amasia's</hi> scorn,</l>
                        <l>Quench not my Fires, but make her kindly burn.</l>
                        <l>Love is a Weight to me indeed severe,</l>
                        <l>But should she help, I could the burthen bear.</l>
                        <l>Beneath the load I should no longer Bow,</l>
                        <l>For that would raise me, which depresses now.</l>
                        <l>Tho' no such hope does to your Friend remain,</l>
                        <l>I boast the freedom to embrace my Chain.</l>
                        <l>A Slave how Wretched must your <hi>Sylvius</hi> grow,</l>
                        <l>When not permitted to be longer so?</l>
                        <l>Kind tho' you are, you seem not kind to me,</l>
                        <l>For he Enthrals me, who would set me free.</l>
                        <l>By no device you can obtain your end,</l>
                        <l>I can't my Mistress lose, but may my Friend.</l>
                        <l>In vain, oft practis'd methods you devise,</l>
                        <l>'Tis all in vain, <hi>Amasia</hi> still has Eyes.</l>
                        <l>No more to me your hard addresses move,</l>
                        <l>For, I assure you, by the Gods above,</l>
                        <l>I can't — I will not part from what so dear I Love.</l>

                        <hi>To</hi> Mr —</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>MUch am I pleas'd, to hear your new design,</l>
                        <l>For, my Friend's happiness I reckon mine.</l>
                        <l>I should repine, to bid these Shades adieu,</l>
                        <l>Not fond of praise my self, but wish it you.</l>
                        <l>Still may applause your undertakings bless,</l>
                        <l>Your rising Muse be Wing'd with swift success,</l>
                        <l>Esteem'd by all, for you deserve no less.</l>
                        <l>As some young Bird, who late has taken Wing,</l>
                        <l>With fond desire in the warm Air to Sing.</l>
                        <l>When he has felt the Sun's enliv'ning Ray,</l>
                        <l>Flutt'ring sometimes around his Nest does Play,</l>
                        <l>And Chirps to call his Fellow Bird away.</l>
                        <l>So you, now Cherish'd by your Patron's Love,</l>
                        <l>With fonder hopes of a warm Season move,</l>
                        <l>And Sing to me, to meet you, in the Air above.</l>
                        <l>But more assurance than the Bird's you find,</l>
                        <l>For, trusting him, you do not beat on Wind.</l>
                        <l>Scarce can I hold, for I would fain commend</l>
                        <l>That gen'rous Man, who is the Muses Friend.</l>
                        <l>Long in full Tides may his smooth Fortunes flow,</l>
                        <l>He Merits Plenty, who bestows it so.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="150" facs="tcp:41628:224"/>
Whilst from his lasting Springs small Streams distill,</l>
                        <l>His over-flowings shall your Current fill.</l>
                        <l>Such bounty sure may be dispens'd to you,</l>
                        <l>Poets, like Kings, are Heav'n's Anointed too.</l>
                        <l>But ah! Their Art is now debas'd, and low,</l>
                        <l>It only serves to make a gawdy show.</l>
                        <l>The shining Light their <hi>Phaebus</hi> gives, they use,</l>
                        <l>But the productive, vig'rous heat, abuse.</l>
                        <l>They, whose true merits can a Patron claim,</l>
                        <l>(And such there are, who part with Gold for Fame,)</l>
                        <l>Should Honours, worthy their true greatness, raise,</l>
                        <l>The gen'rous few deserve the nobler praise.</l>
                        <l>You, to grow fam'd, must lofty'st Subjects choose,</l>
                        <l>For still applause bears up the Tow'ring Muse.</l>
                        <l>While round your Head a Crown of Laurel spreads,</l>
                        <l>Me shall my Groves content, and grateful Shades.</l>
                        <l>I on no other's greatness would depend,</l>
                        <l>But make my own Humility my Friend.</l>
                        <l>On Flow'ry Banks, in Bow'rs the Lover Lies,</l>
                        <l>He wants no Prop, who will not strive to rise.</l>
                        <l>'Tis not thro' Pride, I am thus careless grown,</l>
                        <l>And slight applause, to make it more my own.</l>
                        <l>I don't disclaim the Favours of the great,</l>
                        <l>But I can't stoop, and Cringe to meer estate.</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41628:224"/>
If from great Men to me their Favours came,</l>
                        <l>I should respect the Person, not the Name.</l>
                        <l>Thro' me, the World should his kind bounty know'</l>
                        <l>And my rais'd Muse should tell who rais'd her so.</l>
                        <l>Nay, from a Prosp'rous Friend, I could receive,</l>
                        <l>Favours, I found him truly fond to give.</l>
                        <l>This, as my highest <hi>Friendship,</hi> I may boast,</l>
                        <l>For grateful sense in this still struggles most.</l>
                        <l>To be oblig'd, costs gen'rous Souls some pain,</l>
                        <l>When in Despair to make returns again.</l>
                        <l>Your <hi>Sylvius</hi> only to his fair one sues,</l>
                        <l>Her, only her, I for my Subject choose,</l>

                           <hi>Amasia's</hi> both my Patroness, and Muse.</l>
                        <l>My Love for her no Rival Charm endures,</l>
                        <l>Were I not her's intire, I should be Yours</l>

                        <hi>To</hi> Mr —</head>
                     <lg>
                        <l>AS some blest Youth, who, led by chance, has found</l>
                        <l>A blooming Maid, that has his longings Crown'd.</l>
                        <l>Whose every Charming Beauty can surprize,</l>
                        <l>And draw soft glances, from his wishing Eyes.</l>
                        <l>Stands silent long, and in a fond amaze,</l>
                        <l>Admires, what 'tis, that thus his Soul could raise,</l>
                        <l>Above his wonder, and beyond his praise.</l>
                        <l>But when he finds the gen'rous fair inclin'd</l>
                        <l>To Love like him, like him, intirely kind,</l>
                        <l>Gush'd with the Joys, he no endearments shows,</l>
                        <l>Because, he can't express, to the vast height he owes.</l>
                        <l>So, you, dear <hi>Daphnis,</hi> I admir'd, and prais'd,</l>
                        <l>In me, long since, you have fond wishes rais'd.</l>
                        <l>I view'd you always with a Loving Eye,</l>
                        <l>Yet fear'd to Court you, for I thought you shy.</l>
                        <l>But, when I found that I had ought could move,</l>
                        <l>In you a fondness to return my Love.</l>
                        <l>I grew amaz'd, and strugling I supprest</l>
                        <l>The soft Emotions of my swelling Breast.</l>

                           <pb n="153" facs="tcp:41628:225"/>
Ev'n now I feel the Flowings of my Soul</l>
                        <l>With an Unusual, Ardent vigour roll,</l>
                        <l>I can't the risings of my Thoughts express,</l>
                        <l>Inlarging on them, does but show them less.</l>
                        <l>I, like the <hi>Sybils,</hi> by Strange heats inspir'd,</l>
                        <l>Am with a rage of Sacred Friendship Fir'd.</l>
                        <l>In Verse, like them, I my Conceptions show,</l>
                        <l>They by their God possess'd, and I by you.</l>
                        <l>But mine, not dubious as their Speech, assures</l>
                        <l>That I am certainly, and wholly yours.</l>
                        <l>As the fond Youth, who has divulg'd his pain,</l>
                        <l>Has own'd his Love, and is belov'd again.</l>
                        <l>Burns, for the dear enjoyment, of that fair</l>
                        <l>Who heard his Vows, and who receiv'd his Pray'r.</l>
                        <l>So I, who Justly may my self commend</l>
                        <l>A constant Lover, and a real Friend.</l>
                        <l>Long to enjoy you, to possess you whole,</l>
                        <l>For, he does truly so, who gains the Soul.</l>
                        <l>In your Embrace, I would my Thoughts express,</l>
                        <l>Declare my Love, and hear from you no less.</l>
                        <l>This fond desire, no hope of int'rest Frames,</l>
                        <l>For I feel earnest, and transporting Flames.</l>
                        <l>I would the dearest Friendship here improve,</l>
                        <l>Not a dull Duty like Eraternal Love.</l>

A near Alliance Nature form'd before,</l>
                        <l>Blest me with that, but you have blest me more.</l>
                        <l>Your gen'rous Temper does your greatness show,</l>
                        <l>And proves you highest, when you stoop so low.</l>
                        <l>To what excess must my vast Blessings fly,</l>
                        <l>If we grow nigher, when already nigh!</l>
                        <l>The strictest Union moves the most delight,</l>
                        <l>And that must needs be so, where Hearts and Souls Unite.</l>

                        <l>TIr'd of Mankind, I long have born in vain</l>
                        <l>With silent greatness, my encreasing pain,</l>
                        <l>But now, my Friend, I must at last complain.</l>

                        <l>And, with impetuous Tides, o'er-flow my Soul.</l>
                        <l>All my desires and wishes fly me far,</l>
                        <l>My Fortunes wreck'd in the loud Storms of War.</l>
                        <l>Happy I liv'd, while Childish Years did last,</l>
                        <l>But our best Pleasures are but Dreams, when past.</l>
                        <l>The Thoughts of those disturb my present rest,</l>
                        <l>I were not Wretched now, had I not then been blest.</l>

Born to be curst by Destiny, I stand,</l>
                        <l>And can't, so much as view the happy Land.</l>
                        <l>Friendless, and all, but Resolution lost,</l>
                        <l>A mark for Fate I seem, upon a ruin'd Coast.</l>
                        <l>Kept back by Winds, and tides which loudly roar,</l>
                        <l>I sit deserted on the Barren shore,</l>
                        <l>And view the Sea of Time, which I must yet pass o'er.</l>
                        <l>Heaven's utmost rage, and tortures here I see;</l>

                        <l>Fortune has giv'n you all, to make you great,</l>

                        <l>And had you that, the rest would useless prove,</l>
                        <l>For that alone can gain a Virgin's Love.</l>
                        <l>Then <hi>Cytherea,</hi> that proud fair, would sue,</l>
                        <l>And beg her self, to be belov'd by you.</l>

                        <l>What off'rings, Gods! Should at her Shrine be paid,</l>
                        <l>Had the dear, fatal Charmer dy'd a Maid!</l>

But ah! For Gold she gave up all her Charms,</l>
                        <l>And, meanly sold, fled to my Rival's Arms.</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Hymen</hi> incens'd, far off took speedy flight,</l>
                        <l>Death, with his Torches, did her Nuptials Light.</l>
                        <l>Oh! Had she liv'd, I might some Blessings know,</l>
                        <l>I should be Happy still, if she were so.</l>
                        <l>Her, in my Rival's Arms I could adore,</l>
                        <l>With Flames as Sacred, as I felt before,</l>
                        <l>Love her as much, and let her know it more.</l>
                        <l>But now what satisfaction can there be?</l>
                        <l>Nought but Despair is left, for Wretched me;</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Death</hi> is a Rival, more unkind than he.</l>
                        <l>You kept (False Muse) <hi>Amasia</hi> in my view,</l>
                        <l>Thy Fairy Pleasures I'll no more pursue,</l>
                        <l>To fancy'd Dreams of Happy Loves — Adieu.</l>
                        <l>All that I hop'd from Poetry to find,</l>
                        <l>Was to gain praise, to make <hi>Amasia</hi> kind.</l>
                        <l>But now, what other Mistress can I choose,</l>
                        <l>Worthy my Love, and to deserve my Muse?</l>
                        <l>Now, many shining Nymphs may Justly claim</l>
                        <l>Some small pretence to an immortal Fame,</l>
                        <l>And, who deserves it best, shall bear <hi>Amasia's</hi> Name.</l>

So, when some great, some mighty Conqu'ror dies,</l>
                        <l>Many, less noted Heroes, share the prize,</l>
                        <l>And he's Nam'd <hi>Caesar,</hi> who does highest rise.</l>

                        <l>If any fair, henceforth, has Pow'r to move,</l>
                        <l>With my <hi>Amasia's</hi> Charms she must renew my Love.</l>

                        <l>Make hast to write, and so, some ease they find,</l>

So, me as much does your short absence move,</l>
                        <l>Friendship for you is like an other's Love.</l>
                        <l>What Swain is here, and you departed hence,</l>
                        <l>Or who instructed by the Muses since?</l>
                        <l>Dull, Thoughtless Hinds, with lifeless aspects Plow,</l>
                        <l>And bleaker Groves, with furious Tempests, Bow.</l>
                        <l>These are the Scenes, which to my view appear,</l>
                        <l>The only prospects, to delight me here.</l>
                        <l>No Beauteous Maid is seen in all the plains,</l>
                        <l>To raise my vigour, or to Fire my Veins.</l>
                        <l>My Youthful Blood must in one motion roll,</l>
                        <l>None knows to Charm, or to surprise the Soul.</l>
                        <l>In vain I walk thro' any pleasing Shade,</l>
                        <l>With you the Nymphs, and tender Virgins fled.</l>
                        <l>You, who alone are still successful there,</l>
                        <l>And gain new Conquests o'er the yielding fair.</l>
                        <l>But I, whose Flames boast no engaging Pow'rs,</l>
                        <l>I, whose low Fortunes flow not smooth as yours.</l>
                        <l>Fam'd for no Arts, nor in the Field renown'd,</l>
                        <l>Must still Despair to have my Passion Crown'd.</l>
                        <l>Should now some fair one, shining in her Charms,</l>
                        <l>Prefer my Fires, and raise me to her Arms.</l>

Exalt me so, nor let me fondly die,</l>

                        <l>No Man alive could Love her, sixt, as I.</l>

                        <l>Not <hi>Daphnis</hi> self, whose Wit is vastly great,</l>
                        <l>Who Lov'd, as never any Swain Lov'd yet,</l>

                        <l>His frequent praise Fame's hundred Mouths shall fill,</l>
                        <l>Her loudest Trumpet is his lofty quill.</l>
                        <l>His latest Work his greatest glories shews,</l>
                        <l>The noblest War Sung by the noblest Muse.</l>
                        <l>Of <hi>British</hi> Arms such mighty deeds he tells,</l>
                        <l>As prove that Island the Whole World excells.</l>
                        <l>Late did his Verse the ravish'd Swains improve,</l>
                        <l>Taught them to Sing, and Blooming Maids to Love.</l>
                        <l>But now he's fled, from these Neglected Fields,</l>
                        <l>To dear delights, the grateful City yields.</l>
                        <l>Each fair one there shall be his shining prize,</l>
                        <l>He Charms all Hearts, as he bewitches Eyes.</l>
                        <l>To share such Joys, I value Groves no more,</l>

                        <l>The World's vain noise I can no longer shun.</l>
                        <l>Since my <hi>Amasia</hi> dy'd, all hopes are gone.</l>
                        <l>Perplext, curs'd Thoughts desir'd repose remove,</l>
                        <l>I find deep Sorrow worse than slighted Love.</l>

                        <l>Trust me, dear Youth, Friendship is all a cheat,</l>
                        <l>A light there is, but void of real heat.</l>
                        <l>No Swain can Passion in another move,</l>
                        <l>For Man can ne'er Love Man, with Woman's Love.</l>
                        <l>Friendship indeed bears in it some desires,</l>
                        <l>It raises wishes, but Creates no Fires.</l>

My Thoughts would still with ravish'd fondness Flow;</l>
                        <l>And from a Friend, I should a Lover grow.</l>

                        <l>This dear, imagin'd Friend no search can find.</l>

                        <l>Must find his humour, with his own, agree.</l>
                        <l>Thus far indeed may real Friendship rise,</l>
                        <l>As to stand sirm, but sure it never flies.</l>
                        <l>He that pretends it can a Passion prove,</l>
                        <l>Makes it much blinder, than we fancy Love.</l>

                        <l>But now, long Planted in the Muses Land,</l>
                        <l>I can no other Language understand.</l>
                        <l>All Worldly gains beyond my reach must prove,</l>
                        <l>For I am bent on Poetry, and Love.</l>
                        <l>Should frowning Heav'n it's usual Storms abate,</l>
                        <l>(Which I can't think, without a wrong to Fate,)</l>
                        <l>My Joys would grow, as now my Sorrows, great.</l>
                        <l>But should no Fortunes, no success attend</l>
                        <l>The bold, aspiring Fondness of your Friend.</l>

Trust me, no disappointment shall I find,</l>
                        <l>Nor be deceiv'd, unless the Gods grow kind.</l>
                        <l>In vain you move me with your Charming strain,</l>
                        <l>And tell of Fancy'd, Gen'rous Nymphs, in vain.</l>
                        <l>The <hi>British</hi> Beauties sure have noble Souls,</l>
                        <l>But still 'tis Gold, 'tis Gold, my Friend, controuls.</l>
                        <l>No Charming Fair will hear the suppliant sue,</l>
                        <l>Who speaks not Golden Words, 'tis Gold must woe,</l>
                        <l>And all Despair, who want it, all — but you.</l>
                        <l>O should some Beauty, in her Heav'nly bloom,</l>
                        <l>To the Embraces of your <hi>Sylvius</hi> come.</l>
                        <l>Some bright, dear Maid, fram'd of a nobler mould,</l>
                        <l>Who scorns to sell her Charms for sordid Gold,</l>
                        <l>Above her Sex's meanest Pride, and generously bold.</l>
                        <l>Blest by our Nuptials, sure, we both should grow,</l>
                        <l>I, tho' the Husband, still the Lover too;</l>
                        <l>A Mistress, so Divine, should be for ever so.</l>
                        <l>My loftiest Muse should Sing her Matchless Fame,</l>
                        <l>The Fires of Love should yield my fancy Flame,</l>
                        <l>She should for ever live —</l>
                        <l>Nam'd my <hi>Amasia,</hi> and adorn the Name.</l>

O Friend! O Sacred! Ever-Charming Word!</l>
                        <l>Poetick fury can no sense afford</l>
                        <l>Fit for the <hi>Ecchoes</hi> of that sound restor'd.</l>
                        <l>If e'er we meet, then shall we best commend</l>
                        <l>The Sense, the Name, the Nature of a Friend.</l>
                        <l>Sure we meet now, with thine I mix my Soul,</l>
                        <l>And all, all Friendship does my sense controul,</l>
                        <l>Exalt the Man, and high as Passion rowl.</l>
                        <l>Beyond all thought transcendent Friendship Tow'rs,</l>
                        <l>Beyond the faculties of Mortal Pow'rs,</l>
                        <l>While with Extatick Pride my ravish'd Soul grows yours.</l>
                        <l>Fain would I speak; but how can Words express</l>
                        <l>The Debt I owe? To own would make it less.</l>
                        <l>You Love with fondness, not Austere, tho' Wise,</l>
                        <l>Blind to my Faults, yet still with sense advise.</l>
                        <l>Believe me, Friend, since you the Name will own,</l>
                        <l>And since my welfare so much yours is grown,</l>
                        <l>When ever Heaven shall the blest change permit,</l>
                        <l>The Muse, your Rival long, at last I'll quit.</l>
                        <l>I'll make no Poet's unsuccessful vow,</l>
                        <l>The Friend protests, and 'tis to <hi>Martin</hi> now.</l>
                        <l>But if by wit, the worst of Follies, curst,</l>
                        <l>I must write on, still wretched as at worst.</l>

To you I'll still appeal, to you who know</l>
                        <l>I never thought that Verse was fated so.</l>
                        <l>Who only errs, his errour may excuse;</l>
                        <l>I own the Folly, and condemn the Muse.</l>
                        <l>What's past the World forgive — forgive me Friend,</l>
                        <l>And, if a Poet ever can — I'll mend.</l>
                        <l>No more shall Verse delude with hopes of Fame,</l>
                        <l>No more the Muse my Senses Empire claim,</l>
                        <l>No more shall numbers Charm —</l>
                        <l>Nor with <hi>Amasia's,</hi> nor with <hi>Martin's</hi> Name.</l>
                        <l>No more shall Love be as an Art display'd,</l>
                        <l>Only I'll cure those Wounds my Verse has made.</l>
                        <l>To every Name, to all, but Heaven and you,</l>
                        <l>The best-good Man, <hi>Martin,</hi> my Friend — Adieu.</l>
