            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On the tenth day in the morning, they cast an other Trench for small shotte, within an hundreth, and thrée score paces of the Forte, and began a freshe batterie, and espying cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Péeces within the Forte, that were lyke to annoy the Campe, planted theyr Ordinaunce against them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting two of theyr Demicanons, brake and defeated the rest, to the number of fouretéene or fiftéene great Péeces.

But by the good prouidence and assistaunce of God (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their great aduantage) the Lord Deputie with his worthy endeuor by land, and our ships (through their fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ariuall) by water did so coupe them vp on euery side, that they could no way escape.

For at their first ariuall, there came syxe sayle of them, being of men in number about 800. who so soone as they beheld the barrennesse of the Countrey, and the brutishnes of the people, two of the greatest Shippes departed home againe, with about 300. men in them, and left the rest to taste of the good entertainement that they looked for there: which (thanks be to God) they found not so satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theyr wicked expectacion, as agreeable to their iust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts, which would be incited by a blasphemous Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prelate, against a true zealous Christian Prince, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to inuade her rightfull inheritaunce and possessions, and to assist her disobedient and rebellious Subiects, against their most gracious renowmed Soueraigne. Wherein, although the Popes holines forsoothe followed the footesteps and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Predecessors, which haue béene euer sowers of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raisers of Rebellion, maineteyners of disobedience, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of infinite bloudshedding, which is euen growne to be the Badge of their <hi>Catholike</hi> (or rather <hi>Cacolike)</hi> profession, and the true Cognisance of their holinesse: yet these Gallants should haue had more wit, to haue looked or they had l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But as theyr gréedynes of gaine, or superstitious deuocion towardes an infamous Idole, hath brought them to the Shipwracke of theyr lyues (at the least) so hath their vnaduised rashnes vtterly sunck, all excuse of theyr guiltines, and pittie of theyr miscarying. They confessed vnto my Lord Deputie, that the Pope theyr paymaister, whose Ensignes they spread on theyr Fort, with

his Crownes, Miters, Croskeyes, and other lyke trumperie, promised to send them a greater power, for which cause they brought much Treasure with them, béeing appoynted to stay for that supplie, for which our Englishmen were not greatly sorie. It is reported that eyther they or other, were already comming at that tyme: for the fowretéenth of Nouember, there was escried a Pynnis, towardes the coast of <hi>Irelande:</hi> but I take it to be rather an opinion or imagination of some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, conceyued through that former report: then any true apparaunce of the verie persons approching. Howsoeuer it be, it is no great matter, for our Soldiers stay there, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of our Ships this winter, to welcome them.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi> and his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming towards the reskew of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> &amp; <hi>Italians:</hi> but hearing how the Forte was taken, and what was become of theyr as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistaunts, they thought it wisdome to beware by theyr exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and to kéepe them selues out of such sharpe clawes, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred them backe, &amp; are fled into the Mountaynes. Our good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tryma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Deuils owne dubbing, Doctor <hi>Saunders</hi> (an Apostata towards his Sauiour, an Archtraytor to his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne) is there in the countrey, but where, it is vnknowen. One of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Fort, &amp; a Préest of that order, who were hanged &amp; quartered in the Forte. Thus much hath bene certified out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of what was doone there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fiftéene day of Nouember last past. For which ioyfull and happy newes, let vs render harty thankes vnto our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty protector, attributing the whole prayse thereof vnto his omnipotencie, beséeching him to preserue our most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes, vnder whose prosperous gouernment we haue receyued bothe this &amp; other infinite blessings at his hands: to strengthen our good Captaines and Soldiors, with force and power to ouercome our bodily foes, and vs al with his grace, to withstand the assaultes of the Deuill, and the tyranny of Antichrist his dearling (our spirituall enemy) &amp; to serue our Redéemer in true feare and holynesse, and his true Ministers with due looue and reuerence, to be faithfull vnto him, loyall to her Maiestie, lyke minded and charitable one to an other, to the glorie of his name: vnto whome all glorie, power, and dominion belongeth.</p>
