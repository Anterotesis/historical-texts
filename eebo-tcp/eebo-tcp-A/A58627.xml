            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Context is thus. <hi>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wiſe Maſter-builder, I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon: but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. For other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, Jeſus Chriſt. Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, wood, hay, ſtubble, every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it; becauſe it ſhall be revealed by fire; and the fire ſhall try every mans work of what ſort it is. If any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon, he ſhall receive a reward. If any mans work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs; but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Words the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a ſort
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42332:3"/>
of perſons, who held indeed the foundation of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but built upon it ſuch <hi>doctrines</hi> or <hi>practices</hi> as would not bear the <hi>trial</hi>; which he expreſſes to us by <hi>wood, hay,</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> which are not <hi>proof</hi> againſt the <hi>fire.</hi> Such a perſon, the Apoſtle tells us, hath brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a very dangerous ſtate, tho he would not deny the poſſibility of his ſalvation: <hi>He himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by <hi>fire</hi> here is not meant the fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> as ſome pretend (who would be glad of any ſhadow of a Text of Scripture to countenance their own dreams) I ſhall neither trouble you nor my ſelf to manifeſt; ſince the <hi>particle</hi> of ſimilitude [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] plainly ſhews that the Apoſtle did not intend an eſcape out of the fire <hi>literally,</hi> but like to that which men make out of a Houſe or Town that is on fire. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince very learned perſons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do acknowledg that <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> cannot be concluded from this <hi>Text,</hi> nay all that <hi>Eſtius</hi> contends for from this <hi>place</hi> is, that it cannot be concluded from hence that there is no <hi>Purgatory</hi>; which we never pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but only that this Text does not prove it.</p>
            <p>It is very well known that this is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial phraſe uſed not only in Scripture, but in prophane Authors to ſignifie <hi>a narrow eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out of a great danger.</hi> He ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>
they eſcaped <hi>out of the water.</hi> So here this phraſe is to be rendred in the Text, <hi>he himſelf ſhall eſcape, yet ſo as out of the fire.</hi> The like expreſſion you have, <hi>Am.</hi> 4.11. <hi>I have pluckt them as a firebrand out of the fire.</hi> And <hi>Jude</hi> 23. <hi>Others ſave with fear, plucking them out of the fire.</hi> All which expreſſions ſignifie the greatneſs of the danger and the difficulty of eſcaping it; <hi>as one who when his houſe at midnight is ſet on fire, and being ſuddenly wak'd leaps out of his bed, and runs naked out of the doors, taking nothing that is within along with him, but imploying his whole care to ſave his body from the flames, as</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon another occaſion expreſſeth it. And ſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tully.</hi>
               </note> (who, it is likely did not think of <hi>Purgatory</hi>) uſeth this phraſe; <hi>Quo ex judicio, velut ex incendio, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus effugit</hi>; From which Judgment or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he eſcaped naked, as it were out of a burning. And one of the <hi>Greek</hi> Orators <note n="⸫" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
               </note> tells us, That <hi>to ſave a man out of the fire, was a common proverbial ſpeech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that naturally ariſeth is this, <hi>That men may hold all the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and yet may ſuperadd other things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may greatly endanger their ſalvation.</hi> What thoſe things were which ſome among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> built upon the foundation of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42332:4"/>
Chriſtianity, whereby they endanger'd their Salvation, we may probably conjecture by what the Apoſtle reproves in this Epiſtle, as the tolerating of <hi>inceſtuous marriages,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in <hi>Idol-feaſts,</hi> &amp;c. And eſpecially by the doctrine of the falſe Apoſtles, who at that time did ſo much diſturb the peace of moſt Chriſtian Churches, and who are ſo often and ſo ſeverely reflected upon in this Epiſtle. And what their <hi>Doctrine</hi> was, we have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>viz.</hi> that they impoſed upon the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians <hi>Circumciſion, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Jewiſh Law,</hi> teaching that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were circumciſed, and kept the Law of Moſes, they could not be ſaved.</hi> So that they did not only build theſe doctrines upon <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> but they made them equal with the <hi>Foundation,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>unleſs men believed and practiſed ſuch things they could not be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I ſhall reduce my diſcourſe to theſe two Heads.</p>

               <hi>Rome</hi> for a determination of the many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which even in thoſe times happen'd among them: And it is ſtrange they ſhould be ſo ſilent in this matter, when there were ſo many <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42332:5"/>
to ſpeak of it, if our Saviour had plainly appointed ſuch an <hi>infallible Judge</hi> of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies for this very end to decide the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that ſhould happen among Chriſtians. It is ſtrange that the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes with Hereticks ſhould never appeal to this <hi>Judg</hi>; nay, it is ſtrange they ſhould not conſtantly do it in all caſes, it being ſo ſhort and expedite a way for the ending of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. And this very conſideration to a wiſe man is inſtead of a thouſand arguments to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him, that in thoſe times no ſuch thing was believed in the world.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Doctrine of infallibility,</hi> if it be not true, is of ſo much the more pernicious conſequence to Chriſtianity, becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it does confirm them that think they have it in all their other errors; and gives them a pretence of aſſuming an Authority to themſelves to impoſe their own fancies and miſtakes upon the whole Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> about <hi>Repentance,</hi> which conſiſts in confeſſing their ſins to the Prieſt; which if it be but accompanied with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>contrition</hi> does upon <hi>abſolution</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Prieſt, put them into a ſtate of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> tho they have lived the moſt lewd and debauched lives that can be imagin'd; than which nothing can be more plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of a good life. For if this be true, all the hazard that the moſt wicked man runs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42332:6"/>
of his ſalvation is only the danger of ſo <hi>ſudden a death</hi> as gives him no ſpace for confeſſion and abſolution. A caſe that happens ſo rarely, that any man that is ſtrongly addicted to his luſts will be content to venture his ſalvation upon this hazard; and all the arguments to a good life will be very inſignificant to a man that hath a mind to be wicked, when remiſſion of ſins may be had upon ſuch cheap terms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Doctrine of Purgatory</hi>; By which they mean an eſtate of temporary puniſhments after this life, from which men may be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and tranſlated into Heaven by the prayers of the living, and the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſs.</hi> That this Doctrine was not known in the primitive Church, nor can be proved from Scripture, we have the free acknowledgment of as learned and eminent men as any of that Church; which is to acknowledg that it is a ſuperſtructure upon the Chriſtian Religion. And though in one ſenſe it be indeed a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity, conſidering the vaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues which this Doctrine (and that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, which depends upon it) brings into that Church; yet I doubt not, but in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſenſe, it will be found to be <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> But how groundleſs ſoever it be, it is too gainful a Doctrine to be eaſily parted withall.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> A hard <hi>word,</hi> but I would to God that were the

               </gap>igions that have been in the world, and I muſt freely declare, that I never yet in any of them met with any Article or Propoſition, impoſed upon the belief of men, half ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and hard to be believed as this is: And yet this in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is eſteemed one of the moſt principal Articles of the Chriſtian Faith; though there is no more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foundation for it in Scripture, than for our Saviour's being ſubſtantially changed into all thoſe things which are ſaid of him, as that he is a <hi>rock,</hi> a <hi>vine,</hi> a <hi>door,</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other things.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. This Doctrine hath not onely <hi>no certain Foundation</hi> in Scripture, but I have a far heavier charge againſt it, namely, that it undermines the very foundation of Chriſtianity it ſelf. And ſurely nothing ought to be admitted to be a part of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> which deſtroys the reaſon of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the whole. And that this Doctrine does ſo, will appear evidently, if we conſider what was the main argument which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles uſed to convince the world of the <hi>truth of Chriſtianity</hi>; and that was this, <hi>That our bleſſed Saviour, the Author of this Doctrine, wrought ſuch and ſuch miracles, and particularly that he roſe again from the dead</hi>: And this they proved becauſe they were eye-witneſſes

The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are many of them ſo far from pretending this, that in ſome times and places, when it is not ſeaſonable and for their purpoſe, we have much a-do to perſwade them that ever it was their Doctrine. But if <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be their Doctrine, <hi>this</hi> is; for they came both out of the ſame Forge, I mean the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. And if (as they tell us) <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was then eſtabliſh'd, ſo was <hi>this.</hi> And indeed one would think they were Twins and brought forth at the ſame time, they are ſo like one another, both of them ſo moſtrouſly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſome <hi>Practices</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I am afraid will prove as bad as her <hi>Doctrines.</hi> I ſhall inſtance in theſe five.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their celebrating of their Divine ſervice <hi>in an unknown Tongue.</hi> And that not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of the Primitive Church, and to the great end and deſign of Religious Worſhip, which is the Edification of thoſe who are concerned in it, (and it is hard to imagine how men can be edified by what they do not underſtand) but likewiſe in direct
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42332:9"/>
Contradiction to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath no leſs than a whole Chapter wherein he confutes this Practice as fully, and condemns it as plainly as any thing is condemned in the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And they that can have the face to maintain that this Practice was not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or that it was allowed and uſed in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, need not be aſhamed to ſet up for the defence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Paradox in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Communion <hi>in one kind.</hi> And that notwithſtanding that even by their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment our Saviour inſtituted it in both kinds, and the Primitive Church admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred it in both kinds. This I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is no <hi>addition</hi> to Chriſtianity, but a <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious taking away</hi> of an eſſential part of the Sacrament. For the <hi>Cup</hi> is as eſſential a part of the Inſtitution as the <hi>Bread</hi>; and they might as well, and by the ſame Authority, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the one as the other, and both as well as either.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their worſhipping of <hi>Images.</hi> Which practice (notwithſtanding all their Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about it, which are no other but what the <hi>Heathens</hi> uſed in the ſame caſe) is as point-blank againſt the <hi>ſecond Commandment,</hi> as a <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>malicious killing</hi> of a man is againſt the <hi>ſixth.</hi> But if the caſe be ſo plain, a man would think that at leaſt the Teachers and Guides of that Church ſhould be ſenſible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42332:9"/>
of it. Why, they are ſo, and afraid the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be ſo too, and therefore in their ordinary <hi>Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Manuals</hi> of Devotion they leave out the <hi>ſecond Commandment,</hi> and divide the <hi>tenth</hi> into two to make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; leſt if the common people ſhould know <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>t their Conſciences ſhould ſtart at the doing of a thing ſo directly contrary to the plain command of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The worſhipping of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> in the Euchariſt, out of a falſe and groundleſs perſwaſion, <hi>that they are ſubſtantially changed into the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> Which if it be not true (and it hath good fortune if it be, for certainly it is one of the moſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible things in the whole World) then by the confeſſion of ſeveral of their own learned Writers, they are guilty of <hi>groſs Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The worſhip and invocation of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>; and particularly of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which hath now for ſome Ages been a principal part of their Religion. Now a man may juſtly wonder that ſo conſiderable a part of Religion as they make this to be ſhould have no manner of foundation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Does our Saviour any where ſpeak one word concerning the worſhipping of Her? Nay, does he not take all occaſions to reſtrain all extravagant apprehenſions and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning honour due to Her, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the degeneracy of the Church in this

thing? When he was told that his Mother and Brethren were without; <hi>Who</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are my mother and my brethren?

And can any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if this had been the <hi>practice</hi> of the Church from the beginning, our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his Apoſtles would have been ſo ſilent about ſo conſiderable a part of Religion; inſomuch that in all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that her Name is ſo much as once mentioned? And yet the worſhip of her is at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath been ſo for ſeveral Ages, a main part of their publick worſhip, yea and of their private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions too; in which it is uſual with them to ſay <hi>ten Ave Maries</hi> for <hi>one Pater Noſter</hi>; that is, for one Prayer they make to Almighty God they make ten addreſſes to the bleſſed

Virgin; for that is the proportion obſerved in their <hi>Roſaries.</hi> He that conſiders <hi>this,</hi> and had never ſeen the <hi>Bible,</hi> would have been apt to think that there had been more ſaid concerning <hi>Her</hi> in Scripture, than either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>God,</hi> or our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>; and that the New Teſtament were full from one end to the other of precepts and exhortations to the worſhipping of Her; and yet when all is done, I challenge any man to ſhew me ſo much as one ſentence in the whole Bible that ſounds that way. And there is as little in the Chriſtian Writers of the firſt three hundred years. The truth is, <hi>this practice</hi> began to creep in among ſome ſuperſtitious people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the <hi>fourth Century</hi>: And I remember particularly, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who lived about that time calls it the <hi>Hereſie of the Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given you ſome Inſtances of ſeveral <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have built upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Much more might have been ſaid of them, but from what hath been ſaid any man may eaſily diſcern how dangerous they are to the ſalvation of men.</p>
            <p>I proceed now in the ſecond place,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider, whether our granting a <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſalvation,</hi> tho with great hazard to thoſe in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42332:11"/>
and their denying it to us, be a ſufficient ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument and encouragement to any man to quit our Church and go to theirs. And there is the more need to conſider this, becauſe thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is the great <hi>popular argument</hi> wherewith th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>emiſſaries</hi> and <hi>agents</hi> of that Church are won<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to aſſault our people. <hi>Your Church</hi> (ſay they) <hi>grants that a Papiſt may be ſaved; Ours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that a Proteſtant can be ſaved; therefore it is ſafeſt to be of our Church, in which ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the acknowledgment of both ſides is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that this is ſo far from being a <hi>good argument</hi> that it is ſo intolerably <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſophiſtica<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> that any conſiderate man ought to be aſham'd to be catch'd by it. For either it is good of it ſelf and ſufficient to perſwade a man to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh our Church, and to paſs over to theirs, without entring into the merits of the cauſe on either ſide, and without comparing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices of both the Churches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or it is not. If it be not ſufficient <hi>of it ſelf</hi> to perſwade a man to leave our Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparing the Doctrines on both ſides, then it is to no purpoſe, and there is nothing got by it. For if upon examination and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of Doctrines the one appear to be <hi>true</hi> and the other <hi>falſe,</hi> this alone is a ſufficient inducement to any man to cleave to that Church where the true Doctrine is found
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42332:11"/>
and then there is no need of this argument.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that this argument is good in it ſelf without the examination of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of both Churches; this ſeems a very ſtrange thing for any man to affirm, <hi>That it is reaſon enough to a man to be of any Church, whatever her Doctrines and Practices be, if ſhe do but damn thoſe that differ from her, and if the Church that differs from her do but allow a poſſibility of ſalvation in her Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they who uſe this <hi>argument,</hi> pretend that it is ſufficient of it ſelf; and therefore I ſhall apply my ſelf to ſhew, as briefly and plainly as I can, the miſerable <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency</hi> of it to ſatisfie any mans conſcience or prudence to change his Religion. And to this end I ſhall,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shew the weakneſs of the <hi>principle</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which this <hi>argument</hi> relies.</p>
