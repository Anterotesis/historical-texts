            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>; as <hi>Mallolous Rogue, ill-natur'd Raskal, Lay-Dog,</hi> and <hi>spightful Thief:</hi> I say, setting aside all these, they have travell'd me almost quite through the <hi>Map.</hi> For in a moment, I got to the <hi>Streights,</hi> shot the <hi>Gulph,</hi> cut the <hi>Line,</hi> and was presently, <hi>Barbarian, Indian, Turk</hi> and <hi>Jew.</hi> And,
<pb facs="tcp:49011:3"/>
notwithstanding this, the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness went on at home all the while besides; for there I was <hi>Rebel, Traytor, Scot, Sadducee,</hi> and <hi>Socinian:</hi> and then, you know, I had but a little way to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>I thought it therefore the best and most honest way, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal these things; that you being fully satisfied, of that pernicious poyson that was in the <hi>former,</hi> you may carefully avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of being infected by this <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;</hi> but if you are so bold as to venture a blowing up; look closely to it: For the Plot lies deadly deep, and twill be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb facs="tcp:49011:4"/>
your Legs before you be aware of it; for this is full out as <hi>Jesuitically</hi> contriv'd as the other was said, and thought to be. But, of all things, have a care of putting it into your <hi>poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> for fear it takes Fire; or runs away with your <hi>Breeches.</hi> And if you can shun it, read it not when you are alone; or, at least, not late in the Evening: For the Venom is strongest about Midnight; and seizes most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the Head, when the Party is by himself. And if you happen of any doubtful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, be sure you take it for the present, in the worst sense;
<pb facs="tcp:49011:4"/>
for you may abate again, after the heat of the Weather be over. And if at any time you find the <hi>Viper</hi> begin to creep upon you; run instantly out of your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and get into any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and fall to rayling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as hard as ever you can (nay, say somewhat to your self as you go along in the Streets) for fury and passion whets the Blood, and keeps the <hi>Enemy</hi> at a distance: and is found to be as good against any <hi>Bookish</hi> Infection, as a Glass of <hi>Sack</hi> is against the <hi>Plague.</hi> I shall not tell you one Line of what is in it. And therefore
<pb facs="tcp:49011:5"/>
consider well what you do, and look to your self. But, if you be resolv'd to meddle, be sure have a care of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold: and keep to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate diet, for there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and jeopardy in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p>And I must desire, that when you come at a <hi>Neighbouring Minister</hi> of the <hi>Answerers, looking over his five hundred Sermons,</hi> that you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me: For I find, that he did not look them all over with his outward Eye, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call'd them over in his mind. And I desire also, that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49011:5"/>
would believe himself, and not me: For I would not, by any means, have him write a <hi>Book</hi> only about that Mistake. And, indeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he says in his first page, that <hi>one design of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was to make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that a great part of what I writ was true:</hi> I wish that either he would have let my <hi>Truth</hi> have shifted for it self, without the help of his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for, I profess, he has prevented me killing I know not how many <hi>Otters)</hi> or else that he would have divided his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:49011:6"/>
into two parts: and have plac'd the <hi>Answer</hi> by it self, and the <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> by it self: Which if he had done, and pick'd them duely and carefully; he might have written all that, which he calls <hi>Answer,</hi> upon very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than his Thumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nayle.</p>
            <p>And I must particularly beg of the Scripture Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, that they be not too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon a small Lay-mistake: For my Bible not lying just un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Elbow, I find, I have in one place made our Saviour say that, which indeed <hi>John
<pb facs="tcp:49011:6"/>
Baptist</hi> spoke before hand for him.</p>
            <p>And, because I am in the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging humour, I must crave fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if any of you hear of a <hi>second Answer</hi> coming out against my <hi>former Letter,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my putting the <hi>Tarts</hi> before the <hi>Chickens</hi> (for I am given to unders<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49011:8"/>
Friend, and Acquaintance <hi>W. S.</hi> advises us, rather than to disturb the world with idle wishes, and dangerous endeavours of doing any good. For, although what I sent you in my last, may possibly be most of it true, and might in the opinion of some hasty men, be counted useful; yet there be others of a more wary, and deliberate Judgement, that say it must not be true, neither shall it be true, because there is an ancient, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Axiome amongst Statesmen; <hi>That all things that are true are not fit to be said at all times;</hi> as the <hi>Answerer</hi> to my first Letter most politically observes.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, this same <hi>Friend</hi> of ours does not tell me plainly, whether he expects to hear from me again; and if he does, for my part, I know no more what to write, than he knows me. For his Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness towards me, is so very great, that it will suffer him to answer but to very little of my Letter (as you know, Sir, Friends, if they be dear indeed and indeed, are very loth to cross, and contradict one another) and therefore he troubles not himself much about that; but only he assignes me over to, God knows, how many further Answerers: as, first of all, I am to be quarrell'd with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49011:8"/>
by all the <hi>School-Masters</hi> of the Nation, for undervaluing the great <hi>Ordinance-days of Humiliation and Repetition.</hi> Next o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>icularly by the <hi>Westminster Scholars;</hi> who are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute me severely with <hi>Poetical Squibs, and Crackers.</hi> If these do not effect the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then <hi>Cowley</hi> is to be raised from the Grave, on purpose to make a <hi>Pindarique</hi> upon me. After all this, the <hi>Convocation</hi> is to meet, and have a <hi>Session</hi> on purpose, to pick out one of a <hi>nimble Pen, and a ready Wit, to recover the reputation of the meanen Clergy.</hi> But, if these all fail, and should not humble me, then by way of <hi>Pigeons</hi> and a <hi>Postscript,</hi> he advises the <hi>Gentry</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> to raise all the <hi>Traind Bands,</hi> and <hi>County-Troops,</hi> to be in Arms against me; and having well whetted <hi>their Swords,</hi> to make <hi>sharp Thrusts</hi> at me, and to <hi>wound my reputation,</hi> in order to the Redemption of their <hi>Cozen Hellen,</hi> who was carried Captive to a small <hi>Vicarage.</hi> In short, Sir, it is very plainly the opinion of the <hi>Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> that if some body does not <hi>take me in hand,</hi> and (as he says, <hi>p.</hi> 22.) <hi>do not seek to lessen the value of my Letter,</hi> and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry speedily, the <hi>Church</hi> will certainly be all

Lastly, That those little Sentences, <hi>viz.</hi> as it were, if I may so say, and with reverence be it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, are very mollifying Sentences; and may with as much reason be used, as <hi>si ita loqui li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat,</hi> or <hi>detur verbo venia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These, Sir, as far as I can perceive, are the most knocking and destroying Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against my <hi>Book.</hi> As for the rest, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most plainly, and grossely mistakes me; or else he tries to do it, but says the same that I do (only he does not know of it) when he thinks he contradicts me: All which will appear aftenwards in their due places: for I would willingly be as careful to observe his Method, as he has been industrious to mistake my Meaning.</p>
            <p>The first thing, wherein I am so shamefully and horribly out, is, that <hi>I have not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reckoned up the Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy.</hi> For that I

            <p>Well; and do you think, Sir, that our old <hi>Friend</hi> is in good earnest, or does he <hi>droll?</hi> Does he in his Conscience believe that the <hi>Papists</hi> do slight and undervalue our Clergy? Do they lay their Plots, and Stratagems to make us dayly more and more despised? and does he think that they are really, at the very bottom of their hearts, Adversaries, and Enemies to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Well, suppose they be; what would he have me to do in this case? Must I set sail presently for <hi>Rome,</hi> or dispatch a Letter forthwith to the <hi>Pope,</hi> desiring him out of all love, to tie up all his <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits;</hi> and not to suffer any one of them to cross our <hi>Seas:</hi> and furthermore to let his <hi>Holiness</hi> know, that in good truth, he does not do at all like a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> to let his <hi>Agents,</hi> and <hi>Emissaries</hi> ramble up and

Do you not think, Sir, that he would listen to this, as he did to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> that went over to convert him. Surely the <hi>Answerer</hi> cannot be so ignorant of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> as not to see, that so long as the <hi>Pope</hi> believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Supreme, and <hi>Infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

they come out of their <hi>Dressing Rooms?</hi> or that they will take our advice what street they shall walk in; about what Corner they shall ply; what Company they shall keep, and whom they shall dipute with? Now, Sir, because I thought it next to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, to hinder altogether their contriving our contempt (it being in a manner in the Body of their Religion so to do) as also that there be several wise and wholsom <hi>Statutes</hi> of this Realm, with all care and prudence at first made, and since often renewed (and now lately inforc'd by strict <hi>Proclamation</hi>) to prevent their bad intentions towards us, and to defeat, as much as may be, their plots against us; if the <hi>Answerer</hi> would but have considered of these things, and had he but had that same <hi>gratifying Master</hi> of his, who used, as he sayes, so to <hi>open his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Case of</hi> Juvenal <hi>and</hi> Florus; perhaps he might begin to ghess, why I did not particularly insist upon the <hi>Papists,</hi> as great occasions of the Contempt of our <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> but left them, and many such things, to be treated of by him: In doing of which (although I am not apt to boast of good works) I think I did very <hi>frie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49011:13"/>
untouch'd, he would have been hard put to it (as far as I perceive) to have found Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for his <hi>Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet for all that, If I were very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased with my own <hi>Model;</hi> and were resolved to hale, and fetch in all to my two chosen words of <hi>Ignorance and Poverty,</hi> and stifly to defend the same; I could then, Sir, for a need, tell him, that many have been tempted to turn <hi>Catholicks</hi> (as they call them) for want of preferment; and many have been abused and slighted by them, and brought themselves and others of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession into Contempt, for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Now, though I never expected, that all the <hi>Clergy of England</hi> should be <hi>so subtil in</hi> Logick, <hi>so cunning at untwisting a Complex Theme, so experimentally skill'd in Subject and Praedicate, so accurate at forming a Verb, and at hunting out an</hi> Etimology <hi>to the first Original</hi> (as I perceive the <hi>Answerer</hi> is, by what he so earnestly recommends in several places) but that here and there one in a <hi>County</hi> might possibly be worsted by a keen and pinching <hi>Jesuite;</hi> yet certainly, if the <hi>Clergy</hi> in general, were better furnished with all sorts, and advantages of Learning,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49011:14"/>
it would be more difficult for those diligent <hi>Enemies</hi> of ours, to meet with so many frequent opportunities of Victory and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: and thereby, you know, Sir, the Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the <hi>Clergy</hi> would be much lessen'd, though not altogether removed: For I hope, that no body counts me so extravagantly mad, and doting, as to think that I should believe, that it might possibly be so contriv'd, that there should not be any Living Creature in <hi>Orders</hi> in the whole Land, but should be so rich, and Learned, as that he should never tempt any man to disesteem him; or that he should behave himself so worthily, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, that it were impossible for the vilest <hi>Raskal, Varlet,</hi> or <hi>Insidel</hi> in the world not to respect him, and attend to his Doctrine; (which is a thing that the <hi>Answerer</hi> has a great mind that I should say, because he can contradict it) seeing that I had said several times in my <hi>Letter,</hi> as also in the <hi>Preface,</hi> that I would propound nothing, as near as I could, but <hi>what was hopeful, and practicable.</hi> Which thing, if he had been at leisure to have minded, he need not then have held up his hands so high, and repeat it ten or twelve tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I am very loth, Sir, to go about to abate the <hi>Answerer</hi>'s prizing himself, for discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring so many other several occasions of the Contempt of the <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Truly, Sir, you know pretty well my temper; and I believe, would vouch for me, that I had no malice in my heart, when I said <hi>Whatever.</hi> But I much wonder that the <hi>Answerer,</hi> who did so often, and solicitously wish, that that same offensive word <hi>Whatever</hi> had been left out, should overlook those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are in the same Sentence; <hi>viz. than might be reasonably hoped;</hi> or if he did not, what did he think they meant? he may believe me, that those words were not put in by chance, and (being slow to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) now made use of to deliver me from a dreadful Mistake: But I intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to signifie two things; first, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And had we an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that were in as good force, against the <hi>Poverty</hi> of the

            <p>Another thing that I intended by those words, was, that I would meddle with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was almost impossible to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoided: and therefore, at that time, I did not think it convenient (though perhaps af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I may) to tell the people, that there are a great many very <hi>wicked ones</hi> in the world, and always will be. Such I mean, who defying <hi>Heaven,</hi> and even <hi>God</hi> himself; it is no wonder that they are not sparing to a <hi>Clergy-man;</hi> although he has a very large <hi>Parsonage,</hi> and although he has all those <hi>same Books,</hi> that the <hi>Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> says (p. 46.) he has <hi>heard of:</hi> nay, though he be one of his <hi>neighbouring Doctors;</hi> with his <hi>ratling Coach:</hi> For we have those

that can <hi>curse</hi> and <hi>swear,</hi> as loud as that can <hi>rattle,</hi> and <hi>rumble,</hi> let the road be never so uneven, and the <hi>Coachman</hi> drive never so hard; and so they will, so long as they give themselves up to the <hi>Devil.</hi> But I thought it not fit to write a Letter to <hi>Him,</hi> to chain up his busie spirits of darkness, from intermedling with affairs on Earth; nor to insert <hi>him</hi> for one Ground or Occasion of the <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> But this, I think, may conveniently be said, that whatever number we have of those that are despisers not only of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but of all that is good; and that were I to write my first <hi>Letter</hi> again; I cannot (by the blessing of <hi>God)</hi> think of any more proper way, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to recover them from perpetual ruine, or to abate their infecting of others, than with all earnestness to wish that their might be dayly additions of such to our <hi>Worthy Clergy,</hi> whose Counsel, Value, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample might win them by degrees into some sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> and better opinion of those that are more peculiarly the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers</hi> of the same.</p>

against what I writ before, by saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I was very silent as to the <hi>carriage,</hi> and <hi>conversation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy:</hi> which may be pattly true, and yet no great omission; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thought with my self, that if there were any want of advice, and exhortation to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> it might be more proper to be performed by such as had <hi>Authority</hi> over them, and power to mind them of <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical censures:</hi> but, for my part, I know very little Service that I could do in that kind, unless I should have rid up and down the <hi>Country,</hi> and turned <hi>Parrettor,</hi> or <hi>Informer;</hi> and so bring in a <hi>Roll</hi> of such as are idle and negligent in their Profession: An employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I must con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And perhaps this may in part satisfy what the <hi>Answerer</hi> thought he said against me (<hi>p.</hi> 10.) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Integrity,</hi> together with <hi>Learning,</hi> and an <hi>Estate,</hi> is more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

to hope to do (from any thing that I said) as to try to perswade me, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in my first <hi>Letter to cut my own throat;</hi> and, for that purpose, he has so ordered the business, that in the <hi>Mercurius Libràrius,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Title</hi> of his <hi>Answer,</hi> these words are added, <hi>viz Wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, a sober Vindication of the Clergy of</hi> England <hi>from the imputation of Folly and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</hi> Now, Sir, although I did not spend much time in contriving a set commendation of our <hi>wise</hi> &amp; <hi>honourable Clergy,</hi> yet in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places I said so much, &amp; acknowledged it so far, that I thought that no body, that would but at all attend to what I writ, and were not very humoursome, and peevish besides, could possibly mistake my meaning; my design being not to make a needless, and solemn commemoration of the Learning and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our <hi>Clergy</hi> (which the whole world has always admired, and have reason still to do, and our <hi>Adversarries</hi> to dread) but still to increase the number of our Admirers, and that we may become a greater terrour to the <hi>Enemies</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi> Neither, Sir, was I altogether ignorant, how much the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sort of our <hi>English Clergy</hi> do far excel in Learning, the common <hi>Priests</hi> of the

have an odd kind of Phansie to enquire, to improve, and in their way and proportion to grow in knowledge also; then a little improvement in the <hi>Clergy</hi> will not possibly be so hugely wondered at, as the <hi>Answerer</hi> expects it should be, unless he could procure an Order to have all that are now living in the world, to be presently knock'd on the head, and to fetch from the grave the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sheriff,</hi> and his <hi>ignorant Halberteers</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the growth and increase of Learning, that is now to be found in the present <hi>Clergy.</hi> But, for my part, I must confess, I know no reason to deny, that the <hi>Clergy of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Philosopher</hi> so long; that two or three of his Phrases are got through his <hi>pocket,</hi> and at least have insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated themselves into his temper: He proves presently a <hi>Chair-man</hi> in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and if he lucks but upon a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> he is as great a <hi>Prince,</hi> as ever <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> gave power to. Then, come Sir, says he, Come now for your <hi>Immaterial substances:</hi> have you ever a one about you, Sir? I hear that you are nuch acquainted with them: you live by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Sir, it is a wonder that you should not have one in your pocket: I have got <hi>honest Material Mr. Hobbs</hi> in mine. I could shew you for a need, Sir, <hi>Spirit of Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ess. Indeed we have had a very curious time of it: a company of very seeing <hi>Priests</hi> and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Philosophers:</hi> that should go on, and on, and teach one another such plain, palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and manifest contradictions. Ask them, how such an Effect come to pass: it is done, say they, by an incorporeal Substance: wonderfully acute indeed! that is, by <hi>no body:</hi> or by a <hi>no body body:</hi> or by a <hi>no thing thing.</hi> It was very well for this <hi>Nation,</hi> that <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi> was born at last; and <hi>half a dozen of us</hi> of willingness, and parts, to understand him; otherwise the <hi>world</hi> had continued in a brave blind condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not, Sir, to my purpose, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to meddle with, or examine their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Principles:</hi> but I much wonder, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may be dayly convinc'd, how much he has been mistaken in his <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical attempts;</hi> that they should take his bare word, and believe him not to be fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his other Writings; because he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidently says, <hi>he proceeds by evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, and demonstration.</hi> And whereas heretofore it was a work of many years stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and seriousness: that could entitle one but
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49011:102"/>
to be suspected of <hi>Atheism:</hi> now he that has but seen <hi>Mr. Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Boots,</hi> and can make but a <hi>Mouse-trap,</hi> is as fully <hi>priviledg'd,</hi> as if he could <hi>pluck up the Earth by the roots,</hi> or <hi>make a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe, Sir, there may be several others that without any reason at all are ill affected towards the <hi>Clergy.</hi> One thinks that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Episcopacy</hi> be, yet the <hi>Lands</hi> thereunto belonging are not <hi>jure divino:</hi> another is of opinion that the <hi>Clergy</hi> must by no means <hi>ride,</hi> because they are to <hi>go, and teach all Nations.</hi> And others there be, who are therefore against <hi>Tythes,</hi> because they think they <hi>give</hi> them. But these were partly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in my <hi>former:</hi> and if they were not, it is all one; for I can say no more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, being suddenly sent for into <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire:</hi> where I expect to find such employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as will certainly secure the world, from me being ever troublesome in this kind again. I am once more,</p>
