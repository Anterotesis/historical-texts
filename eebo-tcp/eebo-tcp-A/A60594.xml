            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the proceed of the Flect on our Irish Voyage, you may be pleased to take notice, that on the 18. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1643. we set saile in Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Sound, and after much fowle weather and contrary winds beating about the Lands end, it pleased God to bring part of the Fleet safe to Anchor in <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> on the 23. of the same, <hi>viz.</hi> the Leopard Regent, the Swallow, the Leopard Merchant, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Merchant, and Crescent Frigot, and within three dayes after the Prosperous and the two Lerpoole Vessels came to <hi>Milford.</hi> But through the neglect of Captaine <hi>Plunket</hi> and Captaine <hi>Williams,</hi> the said Vessels were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to continue for the space of seven weeks at <hi>Milford,</hi> it being their charge to have conveyed them to their desired Port. And at our arrivall we found at Anchor in the Haven the Globe of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and a small ship which arrived at <hi>Milford</hi> eight dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came in, and had brought from <hi>Bristoll</hi> Ammunition to fortifie the Harbour, as great Guns, Powder, Bullet, and other Provisions, and had landed them at <hi>Prickspill,</hi> which lyeth on the North side of the Harbour, where the enemy had made a Fort and fortified it; into which Pill the Globe and the other Ship having made us from the mouth of the Harbour let slip and run. And my Admirall in pursuit came before the Pill, where were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed divers Shots, but no hurt done on either side: The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall perceiving no considerable service or execution could be performed on the Fort or Ships, they being drawne about a neck of Land behinde the Fort, he came to Anchor before it within
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50349:3"/>
shot, and the Swallow a head of him, and the rest of the Fleet a head of the Swallow inclining to the Southside. Some three dayes after in the night the enemy drew a Gun out of the Fort to the Westward of the Pill, and at breake of the day began a morning salute to the Swallow, who to gratifie their courtesie answered them; and after many shot their Gun split, and so they withdrew it away. At that time it proved very stormy weather, in so much that our Ships hauled home their Anchors, wherefore upon the first opportunity the Leopard and Swallow were inforced to weigh and come to Anchor on the South-side before Angle, a Birth where usually the Kings Ships ride when they come into that Harbour. But shortly after the Admirall sent the Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and the Leopard Merchant, to ride before the Pill, to hinder (if it were possible) the strengthning of their Worke, which dayly the enemy assaid to doe: From the Ships were divers shots made daily at their Works, as also from the Fort at the Ships, but no considerable dammage received, only the Leopard Merchant received a shot in her quarter, which dropt into the Masters bed. And to annoy the Fort the more, the Admirall (with the joynt consent of the Commanders) built a Fort on the South side over against the Pill, and placed therein a Demy-Cannon, wherewith we played into their Works, which was a great incouragement unto many in the County to adhere unto the well-affected party (who at that time were very weake.)</p>
            <p>Thus having presented to your Lordship with our proceedings at Sea, in and about the Harbour, you may be pleased to take a view of the correspondence we held ashore, both with the ill and well affected. After our happy arivall, I call it happy, in respect of the great deliverance it pleased the most mighty Preserver of all things to afford to the distressed Inhabitants of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> and the well-affected Gentlemen of that County. The next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we came to Anchor in the Haven, Colonell <hi>Langborne</hi> and the Major of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> came aboard the Leopard, and informed my Admirall with the feeble condition the well-affected party was in, as also of the strength, power, and insolency of the adverse party: For after the enemy had fortified the North side of the Harbour, and intending to fortifie the South side within a day or two, had not our arrivall frustrated that designe. The Enemy presuming on their strength, cast off their sheeps cloathing, in which they had so long deluded the people, and demonstrated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50349:3"/>
themselves to be like unto the rest of their Consederates (Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wolves:) The Earle of <hi>Carbery</hi> having voted that after the Harbour was fortified, hee would plunder the Towne of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi> and the Houses of the Gentlemen who had adhered to that party, and that their persons should be put to death by cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the Maior of <hi>Pembrooke;</hi> they said, should be put into a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of nailes and brought to <hi>Prickspili,</hi> and from the top of a hill should be rolled downe into the Sea. This report so terrified the Gentlemen, that they fled from their houses and hid themselves in obscure places (in disguise) and sent their wives and children to <hi>Tinbie,</hi> where his Lordship then lay, humbly to supplicate his Lordship to grant them protections that their Houses might not be plundered nor their persons abused by the rude Souldiers, among whom there was a reverent aged Gentlewoman, the wife of one Master <hi>Griffith White,</hi> who had in her house eight sonnes and eight daughters who were Virgins, and foure small grand Children in all number 20. with divers servants both Male and Female: This Gentlewoman pressing his Lordship to commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate her sad estate in case her house should be plundered, desired his protection, assuring his Lordship that whensoever he would be pleased to give her husband leave to wait on him, she did not doubt but that her husband would give his Lordship ample satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in all his lawfull demands. His Lordship replied, Hee would finde a time to speake with her husband, but as for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection he would grant her none. The Gentlewoman, with teares in her eyes, desired his Lordship to look on her children, who in point of honour hee stood ingaged to protect, as also the chastity of Matrons and Virgins, the which (without his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships protection) she said must undoubtedly be violated, and her family perish. To which his Lordship answered with divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and some Jeasts among, That it were better her children and Family should perish, then that the King should want means to perfect his designe. To which she said, The King could not want, if His Majestie would be graciously pleased to be content with what God and the Laws of the Land have provided. At which his Lordship flung out of the roome, leaving the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman with teares in her eyes, and so she departed to her house full of griefe and pensive thoughts. A passage from his Lordship of so barbarous a deportment, that I beleeve History can scarce parallel to have proceeded from any Heathen: And if these be the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50349:4"/>
loyall Subjects who fight for the Gospell, the Kings Honour, and the Subjects Liberty, I leave it to every mans judgement to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>The lamentable condition of the well-affected, being by the Admirall and Commanders disputed; It was demanded of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Langborne</hi> and the Major, what force the well-affected party was able to rayse, to oppose his Lordship: It was by them reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they could not rayse above 40 Horse, and about 60 Foot; Then it was demanded, in case there should be 200 Sea-men landed well armed, whether they would joyne with them in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to drive his Lordship out of the County, for unlesse they would be active, they must resolve to prepaire to goe away with the Fleet, in regard a consumption of Victualls would force us to depart that harhour; The Colonell and Major, with the well-affected Gentry, like gallant men, who had rather dye then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the honour of their Country, or to see the ruine thereof, by a Jesuiticall &amp; Popish Faction, resolved to put themselves under the providence of the Almightie, and with the helpe of our Sea-men to affront the Enemy, the which was without delay put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And on the 13 of <hi>February</hi> we fell on a Garrison of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in a strong hold called <hi>(Stackpoole)</hi> the Mannor house of one Master <hi>Roger Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> one which with our great Guns, having made a breach after 8 houres assault, we tooke with the losse of two men, and many wounded on both sides; shortly after they fell on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Garrison of the Enemies, called <hi>(Troyffloine)</hi> lying within a mile of <hi>Tinbye,</hi> out of which Towne his Lorship issued with about 100 Horse and Foot, intending to have relieved <hi>Troyffloine,</hi> and faced our Forces, on whom we let flye a peece of Ordnance, whereat his Lordship wheeled about with all his Forces, and ran into the Towne; Our Forces persecuting there assault upon the Garrison, tooke it, and therein 40 Horse, and 150 Armes, with the losse of two men on our side, and six on the Enemies. God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our small Forces this good successe, they retired to <hi>Pembrooke</hi> to refresh their men, and to inable themselves for a more potent designe on the Enemy, intending to oppose their whole bodie which consisted 1200 men, foot and horse, which lay in and about <hi>Haverford-West,</hi> then his Lordships Rendezvouze; but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hearing of this designe, having fortyfied <hi>Haverford-West,</hi> and placed most of his strength there; his Lordship like a valiant Commander with 20. Horse, some foot, and 4. feild peecs (ranne
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50349:4"/>
away) telling the rest of the Commanders that he road unto the adjacent County to raise more forces, and that he would suddenly returne. Now when our men were refreshed and 6. field pieecs mounted on Carriages, with Wagons to convey there Amuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Victualls, they resolved to fall on the fort at the Pill, and on the 22. of Feb. Colonell <hi>Langborne</hi> and the Major of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> sent aboard the Admirall, to desire that our boates might be sent to the passage to convey over on the enemies side there Artillery, Wagons, and Provisions, the which was done on Fryday the 23. And about three of the clocke in the morning they were all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, consisting of about 300. Horse and Foot, with sixe field Pieces of Ordnance, who proceeding on their march, their Horse in the front, advanced before the Pill; about twelve a clocke at noone our Ships also were at Anchor before the Fort, the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard Regent and the Swallow road to the Westward, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous and the Leopard Merchant road to the Eastward, plying our Ordinance into the Fort, and when our land forces had drawne up their Artillery, they played into the Fort from a hill which lay to the Eastward of it, and were answered againe; The Horse and Foot did skirmish from their Ambuscodoes, but on this day no man was either slaine or hurt on either side, night comming on, caused a Cessation: Our land Forces quartering about their Artillery, lay in the field before the Fort, it being a bitter cold night. The next morning being Saturday, the 24. by breake of the day, from our Ships and land Forces, we began to plye our Ordnance, from the <hi>Swallow</hi> was a shot made into the Fort which tooke off the head of one man, and the posteriours of another, of which he dyed the next day; our Horse and Foot behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves valiantly that day, and beat the Enemy from their Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes, and with the Enemy entred their Fort; and then the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cryed quarter, the which our Commanders in Immitation of their Heavenly Father, who is the God of mercy, granted farre above their deserts and spared their lives, who had formerly voted that if they should prove Conquerours, they would kill the Dogs, and ravish the Bitches, and drowne the Whelpes; most inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine language! did it not proceed from those that adheare to the Beast? And therefore proper for them to speake diabolicall and beastiall language. In the Fort were taken. Armes 160. peecs of Ordnance 18. Souldiers 240. Commanders 26. their names and qualities are expressed in the Schedule annexed. In the <hi>Pill</hi> were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50349:5"/>
taken two Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Globe</hi> of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> in her 12 peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and by a shot from the <hi>Globe,</hi> was one of the <hi>Swallow</hi> men slaine on the shoare by his owne folly, the (other Ship called the <hi>Providence,</hi> had belonging to her 10 great Guns, but the enemy had carried them to <hi>Haverford-West;</hi> In the taking of this Fort, the protecting power of the Almightie, I hope by us shall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, for it was his owne arme that got the Victory, to whom be ascribed, all honour and glory for ever and ever; for in taking thereof, there was not one man slaine either by Sword or small shot. When the Enemy was routed, some of their Souldiers sed to <hi>Haverford-West,</hi> and informed the Commanders there, of the losse of the Fort, and that all their Commanders and Souldiers therein were taken Prisoners: At which newes, it is reported Sir <hi>Henry Vaughan,</hi> with the rest of the Commanders, began to rage and sweare, (like mad-men) and as a Beare robbed of her whelpes, ran up and downe the streets, (crying) beat up our Drums, gather our Horse and Foot together, for we will out this night and be revenged of the Round-headed Parliament Dogs; and having with this bravado drawne their Forces into a bodie, being about 450. Sir <hi>Iohn Stepney</hi> the Governour of that Towne, like a prudent Overseer went into the Churchyard to see if he could discerne our Forces to approach towards <hi>Haverford-West;</hi> about halfe a mile from the Towne he discovered a heard of young black Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks comming towards him; those horned beasts so amuzed the Knight, that being afraid of his owne shadow, his Worship ran to the head of their Forees, and swore (Gods wounds) the Round-headed Dogs were comming; at which report they marched out of the Towne, and calling to minde the valiant example of their Lieutenent-Generall <hi>Carbery,</hi> they wheeled about and ranne away: The Boyes of the Towne perceiving them to run, fell on their Rear, and tooke from them 60. Muskets. This disorder in the Rear made those in the Front beleeve that the Round-heads were at their heels indeed, the feare thereof metamorphosed all her couzen Taffies into Mercuries, and with winged speed every man fled for his life, some threw away their Armes, and those that had the charge of the Powder flung it into the River; and in this manner was the Towne of <hi>Haverford-West</hi> surrendered, verifying that saying of the Kingly Prophet <hi>David, The wicked flyeth when no man pursueth them:</hi> when the enemy fled, they left behinde them in <hi>Haverford-West</hi> 100. red Coats which were never

worne, a quantity of Victuals, &amp; 10. peeces of Ordnance, all which argued, they wanting nothing but a good Cause to maintaine.</p>
            <p>Now our Forces being againe refreshed, having a Demy-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and a Demy-culverine mounted on field Carriages and being supplyed from our Ships, with Powder and all other Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they marched towards <hi>Tinbye</hi> the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> on the same day the <hi>Swallow</hi> and <hi>Crescent</hi> Frygot, with the <hi>Prosperous Merchant,</hi> set sayle from <hi>Milford,</hi> and came to anchor before <hi>Tinbye,</hi> where I summoned the Governour and Major, to surrender the Towne for the service of King and Parliament, but receiving a negative answer, I desired the Governour and Major, to send out of the Towne all the women and children, for unlesse they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, I must in discharge of my dutie use my utmost endeavours to force them thereunto: The same night our land Forces came within two mile of the Towne, from whence Colonell <hi>Langhorne</hi> sent aboard the <hi>Swallow,</hi> and desired me to summon the Towne, the which I had done before his Letter came, and returned the Colonell their answer, and receiving no satisfaction from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour or Major, the next morning about eight of the clocke we began to play into the Town with our Ordnance from our ships, &amp; about one a clocke in the afternoone our land Forces came before the Towne, and having placed the; r Demy-cannon within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a mile of the Towne they fell to battery, and so we continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three dayes; the small shot on both sides performed well, the Towne was maintained with brave resolution, and more bravely assaulted by our Sea-men and Land-men, presenting their naked bodies even in the face of danger; Commissary <hi>Gwine</hi> Governour of that Towne, shewed himselfe to be a man of undaunted spirit, issuing out of the Towne bringing up his small shot to make good their Ambuscadoes, and his valour exposed that Towne to una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable misery, in voting he would neither give nor take quarter; but I may say of his valour as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said in another case, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Christians in his time; <hi>Shall I praise him for this, no, I praise him not;</hi> for all our actions that tend not to the glory of God, lead us to our destructions; to which indeed this resolution of his had almost brought him, for leading on his men to face our small shot, who plyed their Musquets so fast, that his men forsooke him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe received a shot under his right pap, which inforced him to retreat alone in a orderly pace; he was no sooner entred the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50349:6"/>
Towne, but the Master Gunner thereof was also slaine, in which we must not omit to manifest Gods providence towards us; for our small shot having forced the Enemy out of their Ambuscadees, pursued them also to the Towne-gate, their Gunner having loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a peece of Ordnance with case shot, and watching for such an opportunitie, having travysed the Gun, said to those that stood by. <hi>You shall see me make a slaughter of these Round-beads:</hi> At which words, a small shot from our Forts hit him in the head, after which he he never spake more; whose fall so daunted the Enemy, Commanders, &amp; Souldiers, that forthwith they cried out for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The first that forced their entry into the Town was C. <hi>Peter Whittie,</hi> with his company of Sea-men and sub-ordinate Officers, Lieutenant <hi>Greene</hi> and Ensigne <hi>Dodson,</hi> with Lieutenant <hi>Colte,</hi> who led on the <hi>Swallow</hi> men, and immediately after them Colonell <hi>Langhorne</hi> with his Troopes of Horse. This Towne of <hi>Tinbie</hi> was held by the judgement of the most Judicious almost impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being not to be entred but by single foyle, wherein were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken betweene three or 400 Prisoners, as many Armes, 7 peeces of Ordnance, all which were taken on Saturday the 9 of <hi>March,</hi> and on Sunday the 10. <hi>Carew-Castle</hi> was surrendered, in which was consummated the totall subduing of that Malignant &amp; insulting Partie. In the County of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> wherein the Lord of Hosts gave his servants the Victory over his and their Enemies, which gives us just cause to put our confidence in him, and in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Ejaculation expressed by holy <hi>David,</hi> to cry and say, by this we know, <hi>That thou Lord favourest us, in that thou hast not suffered our Enemies to triumph over us.</hi>

No, be comforted, God and the State hath presented unto you a more probable meanes of deliverance in sending this Fleet to your preservation, consisting of twelve warlike Ships, with store of Ammunition and Land Forces, the major part whereof is not yet come in, occasioned by foule weather at Sea; but upon the
