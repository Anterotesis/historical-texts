            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen the <hi>Israelites</hi> were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of ever getting free from
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Yoak, because the Red Sea
seemed to be an Invincible Stoppage to their
Flight; God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Lift up
his Rod,</hi> and That instrumentally divided
the Waters and made Them room to escape.
In this appointment of Providence <hi>Moses
his Rod</hi> was the Complete Emblem of the
Magistrates Coercive Power; which is the
only Competent Means under God to recover
Men from the Bondage of Reigning Vice,
and to force a passage thro their opposing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
without which it is morally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should ever get Free. What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

towards the publick Reformation of
Manners; and how Hopeless all other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods

You having honoured with a liberal Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I cannot but send it amongst You to be
a farther Remembrance of what is therein
offered. To <hi>give</hi> Advice is a familiar and
Easie Task, and That was Mine; but to
<hi>take</hi> Advice of this Nature, as You appear
to have done, indicates so much both of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness, that I hope the Honour of
it will always accompany You in this Life, and
follow You to the Future. To be Able to
assist publick Vertue is a glorious Power; and
This is in Your Hands: To assist it, is a
more glorious Act, and This is in Your
Choice: God invigorate and prosper and Crown
Your just Endeavours to do so. Thus humbly

            <epigraph>
               <q>—For all that are in Authority; that we
may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all
Godliness and Honesty.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the foregoing Verse the Apostle gives Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
concerning Prayer; He requires us
to pray (in entire Charity) <hi>for All Men;</hi>
and his Choice of Words points out what it
is we are to pray <hi>for,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: overwritten" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the behalf of all Men:
For, First (he says) there must be <hi>Supplications,</hi> i.e.
we must pray for all, that God would bestow upon
them such Blessings as are needful: Next, There
must be <hi>Prayers,</hi> to render the Word more distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Deprecations,</hi> i.e. we must pray for all, that God
would take away his displeasure, and avert his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from them: Then, There must be <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
i.e. we must pray, that God would apply the
Means of Salvation to all that sit in darkness; and
of Conversion to all that walk contrary to the Light
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101894:4"/>
that is afforded them: and Lastly, There must be
<hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> i.e. we must Thank God for all the
Blessings we see bestow'd on Others; to signify that
we have a feeling Complacency in the Comforts
that Others enjoy thro God's good Providence;
whether it be his Pleasure that We enjoy the same,
or no.</p>
            <p>Having given this Direction to pray for All Men
in general, he comes, in the Verse of the Text, to
require our Prayers for some particular Orders of
Men in a more especial manner; and that is, <hi>For
Kings, and for all that are in Authority:</hi> Now there
is Room for the Question, What it is we are to pray
for in behalf of These? And some would have it
meant by the Apostle that we should pray for Those
in the following Form of Words, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That we
may live</hi> (under them) <hi>a quiet and peaceable Life in
all Godliness and Honesty:</hi> But this Interpretation, as
it is Wanting in Respect to the Governing Powers,
so it is in itself a formal Absurdity; For that to
pray on this manner, would be to pray not at all for
Them, but purely for Ourselves; the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Words extending no farther than our
Own advantage. I know it is Lawful to pray that
we may <hi>so</hi> live under the Governing Powers; But
the Question is, Whether such a Prayer be a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of that Duty towards Them which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
is here insisting upon? It is Lawful for me to
pray that any private Man may do me a good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101894:4"/>
but would any interpret that such a Prayer
were a Prayer for that Man, or did discharge any
part of my Duty of Charity towards Him? And if
such a Prayer could not acquit me of my Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Private Man; much less can it acquit me
towards <hi>Those that are in Authority;</hi> whose Care and
Character extends our Duty to larger measures.</p>
            <p>We may conclude therefore that This Form of
Words was not at all intended for the Matter, but
only for the Motive of our Prayer.</p>
            <p>To determine then What we are able to pray for
in the behalf of <hi>Kings, and all that are in Authority,</hi>
This may be the Rule (<hi>viz.</hi>) We are to pray for
them, in their Personal Capacities, with the same
prospects of Charity that we do for other Men; but
in their Relative Capacities, <hi>i.e.</hi> as they are Kings
and Magistrates, we are to pray for all such Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
upon Them as are suitable to their Relations:
All which (in short) may be included in This;
That God would dispose them to, and furnish them
for, and prosper them in a due discharge of their
Respective Offices. Now This, as it will be the
greatest Blessing to Themselves; so (the Text tells
us that) it will be Consequentially the greatest
Blessing to Us: For This will be the Fruit and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of such an Administration, That we shall be
able <hi>to live</hi> under it <hi>a quiet and peaceable life in all
Godliness and Honesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101894:5"/>
From the Words therefore I shall draw These
Two Heads of Consideration.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> The Magistrates Influence upon the publick Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
<hi>And,</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> The Proper Matter of the Magistrates Charge.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As for the Magistrates Influence upon the publick
Welfare; It appears evidently from the Hypothesis
of the Text; which is This, That if Magistrates
rule Well, Peace, Godliness and Honesty will be
the natural Fruits of their Administration.</p>
            <p>And as for the Proper Matter of the Magistrates
Charge, It appears as evidently from the same; For
since God has made Magistrates a Competent Means
to procure such great Blessings to humane Society,
Who can doubt but that it is the Proper Business of
Magistrates to intend and take care of the same Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
that they are designed to procure?</p>
            <p>I begin with the First Consideration; The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Influence upon the publick Welfare.</p>
            <p>It is the known Method of God to draw Good
out of Evil; And accordingly we may observe that
there were <hi>Three</hi> remarkably Good Consequences
which followed upon Sin; For, <hi>It brought forth
Sorrow; It Occasioned a Redeemer;</hi> and <hi>It made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
necessary:</hi> Whereof
<table>
                  <row>
                     <cell>The First is the <hi>Natural</hi>

                     <cell>The Second is the <hi>Federal</hi>
                     </cell>
                  </row>
                  <row>
                     <cell>And the Third is the <hi>Political</hi>
                     </cell>
                  </row>
               </table>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101894:5"/>And thus the same Wise Providence that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Vipers and other Venomous Creatures to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in themselves Antidotes against their Own Poyson,
has made these Consequences of Sin to be Sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Recovering, as much as Sin itself is
Poysonous and Deadly.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>Sin brought forth Sorrow;</hi> Which, without sin,
Man had never known: But since he knows Sin, It
is Happy for him to know Sorrow; Because (as One
of the Antients expresses himself upon the matter of
this Observation) <q>Peccatum peperit Tristitiam, &amp; Filia
destruit Matrem. Sin brought forth Sorrow, and the
Daughter destroys the Mother.</q>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>Sin occasioned a Redeemer;</hi> Of Whom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, there had been no need: But since a Redeemer
was needful, <q>Faelix Culpa! quae tantum meruit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptorem;
Even Happy Sin! that met with such a
Redeemer;</q> a Redeemer, in Vertue of whose Purchase,
greater Beatitude is derived to Penitent Sinners, than
ever was offered or hoped for in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But the <hi>Third</hi> Observation (which I am to insist
upon, as being only pertinent to the Subject in hand)
is This: <hi>That Sin made Government Necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be perhaps too Curious to dispute Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there would have been any Government in the
World, if so be Man had not sinned. We know there
is a Government of Order among the Angels that
are Sinless; And such there might have been among
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101894:6"/>
Men; Especially considering that even <hi>Then</hi> the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Superiour and Inferiour, and consequently
the Right of Rule and Subjection, would have been
founded by Nature itself in the ordinary Course of
humane Geniture: But This we are sure of: There
would have been no need of any Coercive Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
No need of Laws, which (the Apostle says)
<q>are set not for the Iust, but for the Unjust;</q> Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd
with Penal Sanctions, and asserted with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Whips and Gibbets; There would have been
no need of These. Now This is the Government
that Sin has made Necessary, and therewithal made
Necessary its Own Restraint and Cure.</p>
            <p>The present state of humane Pravity, Man's proud
Appetites and Injurious Passions, has made Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
necessary with all its Arts and Instruments of
Coercion: <hi>So</hi> Necessary, that humane Society can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly subsist without it: <hi>So</hi> Necessary, that
the most Tyrannous Government that ever was in
the World, is more Eligible than <hi>No</hi> Government:
Because, while the Government is never so Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
that Tyranny can only express it self in the
Enormities of a Few; the Multitude must in the
mean time be kept within the bounds of Right and
Reason: Whereas in Case of <hi>No</hi> Government, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one is let loose to act the same Insolencies and
Wrongs. The Tyranny of Government may Cut
men short in some desirable Commodities of Life, as
Ease and Plenty; but it cannot in the mean time but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101894:6"/>
assert them to the enjoyment of those which are far
Greater; I mean those mentioned in the Text, <hi>Peace
Godliness and Honesty:</hi> For should not These be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
the Government it self would moulder and go
to ruin: When the Magistrate takes not Care of these
Best of things, he is Perfidious to Himself, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants
his own Dignity, and cuts down the Bough
he sits upon.</p>
            <p>For as Society cannot subsist without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
so neither can Government subsist without
Peace; Nor Peace without Honesty; Nor Honesty
without Godliness: So that if we do but consider the
necessary Dependence that these things have one upon
another, we shall see the Reason, why every Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that will be Just to itself, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
provide for the Maintenance of them All: And
Magistrates, tho we should suppose them to be in
themselves neither Peaceable, Godly, nor Honest;
yet must they take care that the Publick be <hi>so,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their own Interest, which must unavoidably
sink without it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Government cannot subsist without Peace; And
this secures that Peace must be provided for by Law:
<q>A Kingdom divided against itself cannot stand:</q> and a
Kingdom is divided against itself not only by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tumults and Rebellions; but likewise by the
neglect of Private Injustices and Wrongs. Rebellion
beats down the Fabrick of Government at Once;
but every private Outrage, if encouraged by Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101894:7"/>
pulls out a Stone; and so renders the Fabrick
loose and weak: Nor will Rebellion stay long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
so fair a Pretext as is the Want of Particular
Justice and Protection.</item>
               <item>II. Neither can Peace subsist without Honesty.
Honesty is sometimes taken in simple Opposition to
those Vices that are Injurious, as Fraud, Violence,
Breach of Contract, and the like; All which are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
disturbers of Peace: But This is a Restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sense of the Word; For Honesty, in its proper
latitude, is opposed to all manner of Vice, and so it
is in the Text; And we may affirm, that Peace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
subsist without Honesty, even in this Latitude
of signification: Because, There is no Kind of Vice
but what is in effect an Enemy to Publick Peace.
<hi>Ex. gr.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Neither Idleness nor Luxury seem to have any
malignant Aspect upon Others; they seem to threaten
none with ill Consequences but the personally Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
The Idle man seems to propose the enjoyment
of his Ease, and the Luxurious man of his Pleasure,
without the design of troubling or molesting any
one Else: And yet when These Vices have reduced
men to Poverty (as thither they necessarily tend) they
certainly lead on to Sourness and Discontent, and
a consequent Desire of publick Disturbance and
Change. Some Vices are destructive to Peace Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and at hand; some only at a Distance, and
by remoter Influence; But These are no less to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101894:7"/>
apprehended by the Government: For that Poyson
that is longer working, and more by Circuit, does
the same mischief; It kills, and with this only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that men are less aware of the danger. Some
Vices embroil at Home, by Invading Rights, or
grounding Animosities, or gathering Factions; and
some expose to Enemies from abroad, by enervating
mens Bodies, or effeminating their Minds, or
rendring them purely selfish and regardless of the
Common welfare; whereby the State must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
become weak and defenceless. And thus Every
Vice, if propagated, as it will be by Licence and
Impunity, is destructive to Peace in its own ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;
which Governours, tho Ill men, cannot but
be aware of; Abstracting from the Judgment of
Gods Displeasure, which Governours, when Good
men, will chiefly fear. And therefore whoever are
concerned for publick Peace, they are in prudence
equally concerned to provide for publick Honesty.</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, Neither can Honesty subsist without
Godliness, that is, without a true sense of Religion.</p>
            <p>For Humane Laws, and the Fear of them can
only bind the Outward Man; which as he will be
always seeking to Get loose, so he will not Long
want an Occasion: But when the Inward Man (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
the Conscience, is bound by the power of Religion to
Good Behaviour, the Publick needs no farther secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
because Occasion, when offering, will not
tempt Such a one to transgress. And therefore the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101894:8"/>
Etymology is well enough Guest at by Those who
say that <hi>Religio</hi> comes <hi>à Religando,</hi> from Binding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
For Humane Laws are the First Bond of
publick Quiet, but Religion is the Second and the
Stronger. And hence it is that Even Atheistical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
advise their Princes to take especial care of
Religion, and to see it rooted as firmly as possible
in the hearts of their People, how slender hold so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it has of their Own.</p>
            <p>This being the Natural Connexion between these
Three chief Blessings of humane Society; It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that Each of them must fall under the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Care by Force of Interest: And how happily
the proper Care of Magistrates will be able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
those Blessings, I shall choose to shew in an
Instance drawn from that Government to which my
Text relates; I mean the <hi>Roman,</hi> altho Heathen,
as it Then was.</p>
            <p>The First Colony of Men that gave beginning to
that Empire, were not more commendable for their
Vertues than the Rest of their Neighbours; Indeed
they had nothing Commendable in Them but only
This; That they put themselves under Government
with a firm Resolution to observe whatsoever their
Princes and their Laws should require from them:
And from This bare Principle they grew to be the
fairest Instance that ever was in the World, How
far Humane Nature may be improv'd and elevated
by the simple assistance of Institution and Discipline.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101894:8"/>
As for Civil Peace, to shew how inviolably it
was preserved among them, I will only give This
Instance; That altho they were a People martial
and brave, yet they esteemed it infamous to fight a
Fellow Citizen: Insomuch that Duelling was a way
of Vindication perfectly scandalous among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
and when the Point of Honour engaged any
of them to resent a particular Indignity, Their only
Challenge was, To shew Who was the Best Man
at the Head of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>As for their Honesty (in the whole Latitude of
the Word) begin where we will, and we shall find
Them Exemplary. So did the Reputation of their
Integrity obtain in the World, that to speak or act
<hi>More Romano,</hi> was taken in the Common Stile, as
signifying to speak or act Fairly and Sincerely. So
remarkable was their Justice, that all the World ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd
to their Arbitration; as wherein they were
secure that Right should not be born down either
by Fear or Corruption. So strict were They in the
Observance of their Promises, that having promised
to send Succour to their Allies upon Occasion, they
would not fail to send it, tho at a time when Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
lay under the straitest Siege. For as they
had always an Eye to the Assistance of Heaven for
the Issue of their Undertakings, so they thought
themselves stronger by their Justice, than by their
Numbers, because more ally'd to that Assistance:
And thus keeping awake the Consciences of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101894:9"/>
People, and always acting such things as were Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Conscience, tho of apparent hazard, it raised
their minds to confide in their Gods, and made
them consequently Fearless, and their Courage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible.
So Wonderful was their Conjugal Love
and Chastity, that a Divorce was not heard of at
<hi>Rome</hi> in 500 Years, tho there was nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
it but only this Consideration, That it would
be look'd on as an Act of Ill Fame. The like I
might say of their Industry, Temperance, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimony;
and yet withal they had such an absolute
contempt of all dishonest Gain, that Ill Men
could not find room for their Briberies amongst
them: Their chief Aim being universally not Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
but Publick Good; and their <q>Glory <hi>(as one
of their Generals said upon Occasion)</hi> not so much
to be Rich, as to Command those that were so.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Source and Bond of all these
Vertues was their studious Regard of Religion,
which their Second King had with all industrious
care planted and fixt amongst them.</p>
            <p>And such a Regard they had to the Sincerity of
Religion, that while any man was observed to live
loosly and viciously, he fell under a Civil Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication;
For that Law of their Twelve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<hi>Impius ne audeto, &amp;c.</hi> prohibited all such from
joyning in the Publick Worship, till such time as
they could bring Testimony of their better beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
And such an entire Veneration did they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101894:9"/>
pay to their Reputed Gods, that in the distress of
Sieges, and fear of Sacking, Private Men shew'd
more concern for their Temples and their Images,
than for their Own Houses, Families and Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Now this Glorious Advance both of Vertue and
Piety amongst them proceeded from the direct Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Government; Which had provided
Laws extending to all Instances of Good Manners;
and, for a fence to These, Laws Enforcing Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and Regulating Expences; and, for a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
of all the Rest, The First Law in their Tables
was, <hi>Divos castè adeunto,</hi> Which in their Own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
is This, <hi>Let Men worship the Gods with
Temperance of body and Purity of mind.</hi> Nor were
These Laws contented with a bare Promulgation,
they were reverenc'd and made venerable by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Institution; It being the Custom (as <hi>Cicero</hi> says
it was to the beginning of His days) that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should be instructed in their Laws, and learn
an Abridgment of them <hi>memoriter,</hi> as a part of their
necessary Education.</p>
            <p>And yet the Happiness of Their State did not owe
itself so much to Their Laws, as to Their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
            <q>Most of their Laws they borrowed from the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
upon whom This Reproach had been cast;
<hi>That the</hi> Athenians <hi>shewed their Wisdom in making
Good Laws, but their Folly in not observing them:</hi> And
therefore They of <hi>Rome</hi> being aware of this Rock,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101894:10"/>
took especial Care that the Execution of their Laws
should be committed to Grave, Honest and Active
Men; and that such Men should be charged with a
vigilant Inspection into the publick Manners. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which Magistrates the Law provided This
Caution; <q>Is Ordo vitio careto; Caeteris Specimen esto;
Let that Order be Men of unstained Probity, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of that Behaviour which they require from Others:</q>
Upon which <hi>Cicero</hi> makes This Reflection, <q>Quod si
est, tenemus omnia; <hi>If </hi>that be observed, we have all we
can wish. </q>Nay to prevent their Magistrates from
Supineness and Neglect in the Execution of their
Charge, There was another Ordinance, That all
Inferiour Magistrates should be obliged to justify
their Administration by bringing in to the Publick
Censors, from time to time, an Account of what
particular Acts they had done in order to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and asserting of their Laws. A most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Constitution! and which our Own Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
seem to have had some Eye upon in their Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
annex'd to the late Act concerning Swearing.</q>
            <p>Thus were the great Blessings of the Text, <hi>Peace,
Godliness</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> planted and establish'd in
that Commonwealth for several Centuries of Years,
by the pure Wisdom of the Government, exerting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thro the Care and Diligence of the Magistrates.</p>
            <p>Indeed one cannot contemplate the State and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that People, for so long as the Reins of
their Government were held in steady hands, (for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101894:10"/>
we may take notice, That as it was the Vigilance of
the Magistrates which rais'd that People to this pitch
of Glory; so it was Their succeeding Remissness
that sunk them from it again) I say, One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contemplate the State and Manners of that
People without seeing occasion to reproach the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the present World; Which, altho Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and under the Influence of greater Light, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
Encouragements, and Assistances, does yet
fall far short of their Common Vertue; and run to
a Dissoluteness mischievous both to the Particular
and to the Publick; such as Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> for many
Ages neither admitted nor saw within her District.
A matter fitter for our Humiliation, than our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses!</p>
            <p>But there is One Argument which the Dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Age usually defends itself withal, which
I cannot but reflect upon from this Occasion.</p>
            <p>Let a Man be demanded Why he did any thing
Ill, and answer naturally upon it; he answers, That
he did it for his Pleasure; And This is the Truth:
But a Truth so reproachful that upon Second
Thoughts he will not own it; And therefore let
him be charged Conscienciously for the same thing,
and he takes Refuge in the blaming of Nature; and
seeks to discharge himself from the Scandal by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it upon that Corruption with which he was
Born; not upon that which he has Contracted. But
unless we could alledge That the <hi>Roman</hi> People
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101894:11"/>
(I have been speaking of) were born Exempt from
the Propensions of Common Nature, It appears that
the Charging Nature with this Issue of Corruption,
is no other than a Calumny; For we Impute that
to Nature, which is owing purely to want of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
Nor is it that Corruption we Derive, but
that which we Nurse up and Cultivate by Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
practice, which produces such a common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation
of Manners; The Remissness of Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Concurring in the mean time to the Effect.</p>
            <p>I proceed to my Second Head, which is, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Proper Matter of the Magistrates Charge.</p>
            <p>By Magistrates (in this place) I mean the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Magistrates, to Whom the Execution of the
Laws is committed; with Whom my present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
lyes, and upon Whom our Hope of procuring
the forementioned Blessings chiefly depends. For
altho Kings are joyned with Them in the Text, yet
my Argument will not be weak, if I impute the
Whole effect to Those of This Order: Because
whatsoever Good is derivable to the Publick from
good Constitutions, it can be derived Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by none but the Subordinate Powers: The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
being as the Head, whose Office it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe;
the Subordinate as the Hands, whose Office
it is to apply; and it is the Application only that
brings the benefit, or works the Cure. So that the
Remissness of Inferiour Magistrates will at any time
absolutely Void all the Care and Wisdom of Kings
and Legislators.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101894:11"/>
Concerning These Magistrates therefore I assert,
That their Charge requires them to take respective
and distinct Care of <hi>Peace, Godliness</hi> and <hi>Honesty:</hi>
And who can doubt it when he reflects That these
are the Blessings which by a sedulous Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they may procure; and that God's Providence
designs no less in their very Institution than that they
should procure them?</p>
            <p>They that consider Least what is the Charge of
a Magistrate, will pronounce him obliged to take
care of <hi>Peace,</hi> and to protect Men from Acts of
Violence and Injustice: And if the Magistrate be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
in This part of his Province, he shall be
awaken'd by the Complaints of those that suffer.
But in the mean time There are Other Acts against
<hi>Godliness</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> as much Criminal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as much Mischievous to the Publick, and as
much Prohibited by the Laws as the Former; which
yet usually pass without either Complaint or Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and in respect of which it seems to be the
common Vote That the Magistrates Authority should
lye asleep and be passive. Whether it be That, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
men would have their Properties guarded, yet
they would not have their Vertues guarded, they
would be at Liberty to loose These when they think
fit: Or whether it be That, if Property be guarded,
Men think Themselves sufficient for the Guard of
their own Manners and Consciences: For Man is
an over-weening Creature, and full of obstinate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101894:12"/>
Conceit; Insomuch that scarce any among the loose
and vicious but think themselves Wise enough, and
Able enough to make themselves as Good as they
please, without any other's Help. And therefore as
He in the Poet says of <hi>Iupiter</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Det Vitam, det Opes, sanam mihi animam Ipse parabo,
Let God give me Life and Fortunes, I will give my self a
Good mind;</q> So most are ready to say of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
<q>Let Him take care of my Safety and my Rights,
I will take care of my Manners and my Religion:</q> But
Both are equal Mistakes; For as Human Nature
cannot be made truly Good without the Assistance of
God; so neither can it be restrain'd from the utmost
extravagance of Ill without the awful Vigilance and
Animadversion of the Magistrate.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore the Laws of our Government
have made a due Provision not only against Felonies,
Treasons, Larcenies, Batteries and the like, which are
usually prosecuted; but likewise against other Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
which are as usually over-look'd; such as Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Intemperance, Debauchery, Wizardism, Sorcery,
Fortune-telling, Swearing, Profaneness, Neglect of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Offices, and all wild Opinions in Religion that
either blaspheme or subvert the establish'd Truth;
It may be opportune to Enquire Whether these
Crimes may possibly be restrained by any Other
Means than that of the Magistrates Coercive power?
For, if <hi>so;</hi> This may (so far) excuse the Magistrates
Care in these matters: But, if <hi>not;</hi> Their not being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101894:12"/>
restrained will affect the Magistrates Conscience more
than all are aware of.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be thought That <hi>the Power of the
Gospel,</hi> and <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> and <hi>the Vigilance of the
Church</hi> may be a sufficient Means to restrain these
Crimes in a Christian State: Let us see then what
Issue may reasonably be expected from These several
Means. And (1.) From the Power of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>If Laws could do the Work, none certainly were
needful but These of Christ; which tye all men so
expresly to the Offices of their respective Stations, that
the Observance of These would void all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
both for the Vertue, and the Tranquillity of
the World: Or could simple Sanctions enforce Laws,
none can be so moving as the Two Interminable
states of Heaven and Hell, wherewith the Precepts
of the Gospel recommend themselves to our Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance:
But alas! we find that men make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to trample upon the Laws of Christ, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Venerableness of their Author, and the
Moment of their Sanctions, as well as upon those of
human Constitution: For altho their Sanctions are
so Important, yet the Execution of them is Remote;
And men are made so Shortsighted by the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of their present Appetites, that Threatnings at
such a distance affect them no more, than the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Our Laws would do, should they not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
at all. And therefore <hi>Solomon's</hi> Determination
may <hi>still</hi> hold, That sin is restrainable by no possible
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101894:13"/>
means but that of a <hi>Speedy Execution,</hi> Eccl. 8. 11.</p>
            <p>Indeed some have pretended to be of Opinion, That
the Gospel is the only Law, and Christ the only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
that is either Needful or Lawful among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
For this was the Reason why the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>
held Magistracy to be Unlawful, because it was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Laws and Government of Christ to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that Christians had need of any Other. But
never was Doctrine more effectually confuted than
This of Theirs was from their Own Example; For
never did Magistracy appear to be more necessary in
the World, than it did at that time, to suppress the
Impieties of those Men, who had decry'd it as Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Unlawful.</p>
            <p>The Convictions and Precepts and Motives of the
Gospel (which is all we can mean by its <hi>Internal</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
we see daily over-born by the Tide of human Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
But then It is True, (2.) That the Gospel
has an <hi>Assisting</hi> Power (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Grace of</hi> God: And
where That takes place, we may not doubt of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Issue.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time we ought well to consider
What it is we mean by the Grace of God: Mean we
a power that will ravish men from the bosom of their
corrupt Inclinations, and force them to be Good in
spite of their Reluctancy? This indeed would void
both Laws and Magistrates, and render them Useless.
But if we will speak true Sense we can mean no other
by the Grace of God than a Sanctifying Principle,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101894:13"/>
that joyns it self to, and cooperates with the Series
of Ordinary Means; of which Means the Coercive
power of the Magistrate is one of the Chief. It is
an usual Expression concerning flagitious and loose
living men that <hi>They want the Grace of God;</hi> Now if
we mean thereby that God had debarr'd such men
from the distributions of his Grace, Our Judgment
is Contumelious to God; Or if we mean that the
Grace of God would Forcibly make such men Good,
Our Judgment is Erroneous and False: All the Truth
therefore that can be couched under that Expression
is only this; That such Men for want of those
purging Fears, which ought to be wrought in them
by their Own Consideration, or (for want of that)
by the wholsome Coercion of the Magistrate, do
extinguish and make void that Grace of God, which
has been offered to them In and With the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Gospel; <hi>Offered</hi> to them (I say) equally as
to others, but wanted success, because Discipline
was wanting to concur with the Operation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
therefore in Scripture the <hi>Ordinary Means to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
are called the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> as well as that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Energy</hi> which cooperates with these Means; So
we ought to look upon a Good Magistracy, and a
Due Execution of the Laws, to be a great part of the
Grace of God to any people: As on the contrary,
a Remiss Administration is no other than a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which makes all Gods other Grace to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in vain upon the generality of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101894:14"/>
Let us see (3.) In what measure the <hi>Vigilance of
the Church</hi> may be hoped to supply the Defect in this
Case.</p>
            <p>What Influence the Church can have upon the
Manners of Men consists in the Methods of Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Rebuking and Censuring: All which after once
men have wasted their Consciences, or taken a loose
beyond the Decency of Behaviour, become the most
Despisable things in the World. How weak was that
Voice of Old <hi>Eli</hi> and how Incompetent to restrain a
<hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> when he cryed, <q>Why do you such
things? Nay my Sons! for it is no good Report that I hear
of You.</q> Now the Voice of an Ecclesiastick in its
proper Elevation, scarce amounts to be Louder than
This; or if it be heightned with the thunder of Gods
Menaces, yet it will be contemned by a hardy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as easily as that of <hi>Eli</hi> was; But it cannot be so
<hi>Criminal</hi> as that of <hi>Eli</hi> was; because <hi>Eli</hi> was a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
as well as a Priest, and therefore could have
spoke with a more Effectual voice, and such as would
have reached more sensibly home.</p>
            <p>The Power of the Ministry is no more than Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive;
But stubborn Nature will not often be
persuaded, there is need of Force: And say not
that Vertue or Religion, when Forc'd, are nothing
worth; What is begun in Force, may end in Choice;
What is begun in Fear, may end in Love; altho
without Force and Fear it would have begun. But
supposing that Vertue thus <hi>Forced</hi> should never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101894:14"/>
to the State of Choice and Love; yet still This
Good would follow, that the Magistrate had done his
Part; Besides that, it is no small advantage to the
common Cause of Virtue That men can be
brought to be at least <hi>Good Hypocrites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know the Pastors Exemplary Care and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
is always necessary (Contempt be upon him
that makes Apology for the Defective,) But still
This is a Means insufficient to Reform: For where
Sense comes to govern more than Conscience, there
He that comes armed with Mulcts and Corrections
is the only Edifying Man.</p>
            <p>To say how Ineffectual the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Church
would be towards this Purpose, were only to bring
under Your Contemplation a deplorable Scandal:
Who would care for being <hi>turned out of the Church,</hi>
of those who seem Careless whether they are ever
In? And as for the Farther Process in that Case,
we have seen enough of its Consequences, to make
us wish for Any, rather than That Invidious and
Successless Method.</p>
            <p>As therefore the Publick Cry is for Reformation
of Manners, to see Godliness and Honesty advanced
in common practice, and the Fruit of Peace spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out happily from that stable root; So we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but turn our Eyes upon You that are the
Magistrates; I mean Expresly You that are the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
of Peace,</hi> as being invested above all other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
with the most competent Means and Power
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101894:15"/>
of procuring this End. No other Hand can cure
our Sore; No other hand can reach it but only
Yours. Without You, all our wholsome Laws are
like a Box of Medicines well prepared, but then
locked up, while the Diseases spread and reign for
want of Application. Without You, Majesty it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is made Impotent, and can only deplore our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
but not possibly redress them. And what is
it we may expect from Judges and their Circuits?
They are necessary indeed so far as their Business ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends;
but utterly unable to reach the Root of our
Evil: For to what Purpose of Reformation is the
Cutting off some Few, Signal, overgrown Weeds;
while such multitudes are still growing up in the
Nurseries of Idleness, Debauchery and Profaneness?
<hi>Here</hi> it is, in These Nurseries that Vice is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest;
and Greater Crimes mercifully prevented by
Animadversion upon the first Buddings of them in
their Remoter Causes.</p>
            <p>'Tis You we pray for in our Common Liturgy;
<q>That you may have Grace to execute Iustice, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Truth:</q> And again, <q>That You may truly and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
minister Iustice to the Punishment of Wickedness
and Vice, and to the Maintenance of Gods true Religion
and Vertue:</q> What we pray that You <hi>may</hi> do, suffer
us to pray <hi>to do.</hi> Lend Your best Assistance to this
Cause of Vertue and Religion; Which is God's
Service, and Your Charge, and Every man's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101894:15"/>
As for Vertue, You are able to serve it in the
whole latitude of its Province; Because the Laws
have made Every Vice obnoxious to Your Censure:
All formal Crimes have their punishment assigned;
and all smaller Misdemeanours are submitted to your
Discretion; Insomuch that the first Seeds of Crimes,
whether they appear in Laziness, Lavishness, Petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy,
Sauciness, Lying, Contumely, or any other
kind of Offensive Behaviour, may stand in just awe
of Your Authority. It is not simply from Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(Pecuniary or Corporal) that we expect the
Success; Your very Frowns and Rebukes, as on the
other hand Your Countenance and Favour, when
distributed respectively, and joyned with Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Steadiness, will do the greatest part of the
Work.</p>
            <q>Religion implores your Care especially in This,
That there be no Mockers of holy things, no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Religious Worship, no bold Profanation
of the Lords Name or Day: Which are Crimes that
necessarily wast and harden Mens Consciences, and
take off all Awe and respect of Duty from their
minds. In my mention of Religious Worship, I
spoke not restrainedly to That of our Established
Church, because there are other Allowances by Law;
But yet I am not blamable if I chiefly intended That.
I hope You are all of Opinion that there is no false
Reasoning in his Majesty's Preface to his Late Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
where he says; <q>We are sensible that nothing can
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101894:16"/>
more effectually conduce to the Honour and Glory of God,
and to the support of the Protestant Religion, than the
Protecting and Maintaining of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
as it is by Law established; which we are (therefore) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to do to the utmost of our Power.</q> This Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is certainly sound, as well as it is Authoritative:
Nor yet could any Magistrate, tho he were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
persuaded, be less than Perfidious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
if he did not shew more regard to that which
is Established, than to that which is barely Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
Nevertheless, since, whatsoever be the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of Preference between the particular Ways
of Worship, the Main Point is to be Religious;
Whosoever is not so (<hi>Tros, Tyriúsve</hi>) let him be made
sensible of Your Displeasure.</q>
            <p>And (if there be any Love of Christ) have a
Watch upon the <hi>Socinian</hi> Poyson: Suffer it not <hi>to
creep into Houses, and lead Captive</hi> (should I say <hi>Silly
Women,</hi> it would be too much beneath the haughty
pretences of their Scheme; and therefore I shall
choose to say) <hi>Silly Wits;</hi> And if there seem to be
any Contradiction in the Terms let Them answer
for it, who think there be Wit in Blaspheming. For
so it is that the Wits (such of them as are Profligate)
run into this Hypothesis, as well as the Ignorant and
Unstable: Not that They can have any Concern
for Religion; but because they look upon this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
as a Battery raised to beat down all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For what Article is there in Religion wherein
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101894:16"/>
we may not deny the Sense or Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
with as much Reason as we can deny the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of Christ? Which, I desire You to observe
that it carries in it a Double Blasphemy; the First in
<hi>Asserting that Christ is not God,</hi> and The Second in
Implying, <hi>That though he be not God, yet he had an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
to be Thought to be so.</hi> (For, since the whole
Stile of the Scripture points plainly as it does, This
is a Consequence which the <hi>Socinians</hi> can never evade
by all their boasted Happiness of Interpretation, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the more Happy their Interpretations are, the
more they demonstrate This Consequence.) And
now laying These Two Imputations together, let
any one tell me how they <hi>can</hi> be Tolerable; How
the First, when charged upon Him, <hi>who thought it
not Robbery to be Equal with God;</hi> or How the Second,
when charged upon Him, <hi>Who made himself of no
Reputation,</hi> and was the Humblest of Men.</p>
            <p>But if You will serve either Vertue or Religion,
It is necessary that You be Vigilant and Active.
However Justice ought to be Blind, the Justitiary
ought (like those Ministring Spirits about the
Throne of God) to be <hi>Full of Eyes; i.e.</hi> he ought
to be sedulous in Inspection and Enquiry into the
Matters of his Charge. In Offences that happen
betwixt Man and Man, it is Rational and fit to stay
for a Complaint; Because the Offended Party is so
much a Friend to himself, that he will be sure either
to Complain, or to Forgive; which (generally
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101894:17"/>
speaking) is the Better Issue: But in Offences, where God
and Piety are barely concerned, there, be the Facts never
so Notorious, 'tis possible the Complaints may be none at
all: And therefore He who will not proceed upon Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in these Cases, without the Formality of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant,
will leave himself very little Opportunity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his Trust.</p>
            <p>Some there are that deliberate; Whether a Magistrate
should Choose to be <hi>Loved,</hi> or to be <hi>Feared;</hi> But let not
That come under Your deliberation; For he that Chooses
Either, has given himself a Byass, that will certainly
draw him from being Just. A Magistrate ought to have
no other Prospect than simply That of doing Justice;
And He that does <hi>So,</hi> may be contented with what will
follow; For he shall be Feared by Ill men, as he should
Wish to be; And he shall be Loved by God and Good
men, Which is all the Love that is Desirable.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Noble Work that I presume to admonish You
of: and the Incitement is no Less <hi>So,</hi> which offers itself to
You from the Conscience of serving God, from the Glory
of serving Your Country, and from the Felicity of serving
Your selves; when You consider what That great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
and Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> has told us <q>
                  <bibl>(Chap. xii. 3.)</bibl>
They that turn many to Righteousness shall shine like the
Stars for ever and ever.</q>
            </p>
            <closer>Grant O Lord we beseech Thee, that the Course of this
World may be so peaceably ordered by thy Governance,
that thy Church may joyfully serve Thee in all Godly
Quietness; through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
