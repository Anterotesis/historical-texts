            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>John Langham</hi> Baronet, and to his eldeſt Son Sir <hi>James Langham</hi> Knight, the one, my much honoured Patron, both, my worthy and much valued Friends.</head>

            </opener>
            <p>THeſe enſuing <hi>Meditations,</hi> which were firſt <hi>Preached,</hi> at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, upon occaſion of your ſad parting with that <hi>ſweet and hopeful Little one,</hi> in <hi>whoſe life</hi> ſo much of your Comfort <hi>and life were</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen 44. 30.</note> 
               <hi>bound up,</hi> I make bold, now again, to offer to you, from the <hi>Preſs.</hi> Not out of any ambition that I have to be in <hi>Print:</hi> For I know there are ſo many excellent Sermons, and other Treatiſes, already extant, in Engliſh, upon almoſt every Subject in Divinity, that (with many Readers) the <hi>great choice</hi> they have, doth even <hi>hinder choice,</hi> and makes them uncertain what to read. Beſides, I am a little acquainted with the Genius of this Age, which is hardly taken with any thing but what is <hi>new,</hi> or at the leaſt, trim'd up after the <hi>new Mode and Dreſs;</hi> an humor, which as I have not learned, ſo neither do I much care to learn the Art of pleaſing. All that I have aimed at in this ſmall Piece (how far I have attained it, I am no competent Judge) is to clear up, and handle <hi>known and practical</hi> truths, in a <hi>plain and convincing</hi> way, ſo as to work upon the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> with which we Miniſters are chiefly to deal: to ſhew what <hi>Reaſon</hi> there is, why we ſhould <hi>take all well</hi> that God doth: and how the Soul may be framed to <hi>Silence and Submiſſion</hi> under Gods correcting hand, in his ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſpenſations. You will (I doubt not) accept of what I here do offer you, as in other reſpects, ſo becauſe you ſhall here find mention of that <hi>Dear One</hi> of yours, who, when alive, was accounted by you <hi>as your Crown;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 6.</note> and had ſo much room in all your hearts; and who, though he be gone hence <hi>out of ſight,</hi> (to be ſeen no more by you in this World) will not (I believe) in haſt, be out <hi>of your minds.</hi> I know, you meet, every day, with ſomething or other that ſtill repreſents him to your thoughts; and your ſores being often rubb'd, by thoſe Remembrances, are apt to bleed a freſh. But here (I hope) you ſhall find not only what may occaſion your rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating upon your loſs, but that alſo which (by the bleſſing of God) may conduce to quiet and compoſe your Spirits, to aſſwage your grief, and by degrees to raiſe you above it, if not to make you forget your ſorrow alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The truth is, the <hi>Conſiderations</hi> here ſuggeſted are of unſpeakable uſe to ſupport the Soul, not only under ſuch a croſs as this of yours (which yet I confeſs is heavy) but under all griefs and troubles whatſoever. In which reſpect, theſe Cordials, which were (in the firſt place) prepared for you, may ſerve for others of Gods Sons and Daughters of affliction, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and chear them alſo in their ſufferings.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:101280:3"/>
Of my Addreſs, at this time, to you (if any deſire a further Reaſon) this is the account. There being ſome neceſſity of printing this Sermon, I was very willing to take the opportunity of preſenting you with it, as a Teſtimonial (little things, you know, do often ſignifie great matters) of my very great obligations to you. The truth is, this piece (I would it were more worthy for your ſakes) is yours upon a double account; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was preached at your deſires, and with reference principally, to comfort you under the ſad affliction before-mentioned: and becauſe you have made the Author himſelf yours by your manifold favours to him. To the Right Worſhipful Sir <hi>John;</hi> my honoured Patron, I owe my preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this place, which (though I had alſo a concurrent, and unanimous call from the people, without any contradiction) he freely conferred upon me, being moved to it by that good opinion of me, which he was pleaſed to entertain, without any ſuit of mine, or ſolicitation of any other in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. Here I do (I bleſs God for it) by his means enjoy a comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and eat not the bread, either of direct or indirect Simony: a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <note place="margin">Epiſt. Ded. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Book of his reverend Father, called <hi>The Doctrine of Faſting, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> which (Reverend Mr. <hi>Samuil Hilderſam</hi> tells me) many of our Cloth do not (the more is the pity) through the corruption of the times enjoy. Since that, I, and mine have, from you and yours, upon all occaſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very many favours, and real kindneſſes; among which, I account that reſpect you have alwayes ſhewed, and the countenance you have given to my Miniſtry, not the leaſt. So that I have had cauſe, and ſtill have to bleſs God for you, who hath (by you) freed me from much oppoſition, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of my Brethren have (in the late times) met with, and vouchſafed me much encouragement in my work, they have wanted. This I (here) willingly do, and upon all occaſions ſhall make a thankful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, and having no better way to expreſs my gratitude, ſhall do it by my prayers for you, and ſerviceableneſs (as I am able) to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>The God of Heaven requite all your love, and multiply his mercies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you and yours, his diſtinguiſhing mercies ſpecially; make up your late ſad loſs by giving to you, and continuing with you other Sons (as hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) in the room of that dear one, whom he hath taken to himſelf: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vouchſafe you a name better <hi>than that of Sons and Daughters,</hi> teach you to live by Faith, give you more and more to know what belongs to <note place="margin">Eſa 56. 5. 1 Joh. 1. 3.</note> Communion with <hi>the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (a favour, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of which no outward mercy is worth the mentioning) and take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to uſe you, and yours after you, as bleſſed Inſtruments of his Honor.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S touching the Author, and Pen-man of this Pſalm, there is no queſtion. But if I were asked, at what time, and upon what particular occaſion, it was written, I could not ſo eaſily give an anſwer. Nor is it much material to our purpoſe. This is enough, and may certainly be gathered from the centext, that the Pſalm relates to ſome very ſore, and heart-piercing affliction under which the Prophet groan'd. It may be it was the rebellion of that ungracious Son of his, <hi>Abſalom:</hi> ſome paſſages in the Pſalm ſeem to look that way. Haply it might be ſome other croſs: for he was <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs</hi> of all kinds, like as <note place="margin">Eſa. 53. 13.</note> the Lord Jeſus, of whom he was an eminent Type. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was ailed him, 'tis ſure, it was ſuch an affliction, as he thought would have killed him, ſuch an one, that if God ſhould not ſpeedily put an end to his miſery, he made no other account, but that his miſery would quickly make an end of him. This may be collected from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and 13. It was ſuch an one, that the grief and ſorrow it had cauſed, <hi>did eat, and conſume him like a moth, ver.</hi> 13. There was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101280:4"/>
ſuch a tempeſt of paſſion raiſed in his ſoul, by reaſon of his preſent affliction, that his faith and patience were put to it to the uttermoſt, and all the grace he had was but little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to keep him from daſhing, and being ſplit upon the rocks. In this ſad caſe, what it was relieved, and eaſed his ſoul, what it was quieted, and ſtilled the tempeſt, is more worth our inquiry; and herein, the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed not to leave us at a loſs, but hath ordered that it ſhould be recorded, for the good of all the ſons and daughters of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the worlds end, that they may learn what they have to do when they are <note n="a" place="margin">Eſa. 54. 11.</note>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101280:5"/>
that God doth ſuperviſe, and act, and order all in all. To inſtance in the caſe of ſickneſs; it is Gods doing that <hi>this diſeaſe,</hi> finds out <hi>this perſon,</hi> juſt <hi>at this time,</hi> in <hi>this very place,</hi> holds him <hi>ſo long,</hi> handles him <hi>thus and thus,</hi> that he is now <hi>better,</hi> and now <hi>worſe,</hi> and that at laſt, he either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, or dies. There is nothing of fortune or meet chance in any of theſe things. And it is ſo in all other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Afflictions in Scripture are compared to <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 91. 5. Lam. 3. 12.</note> 
               <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> but they are not like that, <note n="m" place="margin">1 King. 22. 24.</note> which I know not who, ſhot at, he could not tell whom, and hit him he could not tell where, and hurt him he knew not how much, or how little, but did all at a venture.

            <p>If you demand how this may be proved, I ſhall evidence it by two ſorts of Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Teſtimony of the beſt, and moſt holy perſons <note place="margin">1. The Teſtimony of the godly.</note> that ye read of in Scripture. Let the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> plunder <hi>Job</hi> of his eſtate, let the Devil himſelf raiſe a wind to blow down the houſe upon his childrens heads, and ſlay them all; <hi>Job</hi> will tell you, <note n="n" place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> It <hi>was God from whom he had received ſo much</hi> good, that now ſent upon him all this <hi>evil;</hi> It was God, <hi>who first gave</hi> him that eſtate, that now took it away again; It was God who had <hi>given</hi> him thoſe children, that did now bereave him of them: <hi>God hath given, God hath taken, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> Let <hi>Shimei</hi> come out, and throw ſtones at <hi>David</hi> as he paſſeth along, let him curſe and ſpit venome at him, according to his pleaſure; the holy man looks upward, and both ſees, and owns Gods hand in this, <note n="o" place="margin">2 Sum. 16. 11</note> 
               <hi>God hath bidden him curſe David.</hi> Let wicked perſons rage and perſecute, as if they thought not only their <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 12. 4.</note>

hear what he ſaith, Whom our bleſſed Saviour commends for a faith that was greater than any he found in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> They come and go, ſeize upon a perſon, and depart from him, juſt as God gives them Commiſſion to go or come; <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 8. 9.</note>

               <hi>This people turns not to him that ſmites them.</hi> Who is that? the next words tell you, <hi>Neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Hearken once more, <note n="u" place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Shall there be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, It is not poſſible there ſhould. And there is the ſame reaſon for the Countrey too. There is no evil at all (that is of affliction) either in City or Countrey, but ye ſee God owneth it as his doing; and if he own it as his doing, we may boldly ſay it is ſo. And to ſpeak to the point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; Hence it is that God <note n="w" place="margin">Deut. 28. 21, 22. &amp; 7. 15.</note> threatneth to ſend ſickneſſes, and promiſeth to remove them, according as he ſhall be pleaſed or diſpleaſed with a people, to ſhew that his hand doth all theſe things: And the truth is, he that denieth him this providence, doth in effect, deny him to be God.</p>
            <p>To clear this point a little (for I muſt not dwell upon it) and to prevent ſome objections which our carnal and fooliſh hearts will be making againſt it, take theſe three Rules.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101280:6"/>
providence? But alas! What is the World and all that is in it unto God? <note n="x" place="margin">Eſa. 40. 15.</note>

            <p n="2">2. That things fall out otherwiſe than we think they <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>2</label> ſhould, or good men could wiſh, is no argument to prove they are not ordered by God. That afflictions light upon ſuch, as we conceive were fitteſt of all others to be ſpared, will not prove they come not from Gods hand. We think it pity, ſuch a tender bud ſhould ſo quickly be nipt by death, we think it might have been better, if he had been ſuffered to grow ſtill. What a deal of ſervice might he (in time) have done for God? What an inſtrument might he have been of Gods glory? But who made your thought the rules that God muſt go by in the ways of his providence? Muſt things either be ordered as we judge fit, or elſe will we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or doubt of Gods having any hand in them?

That inſtance, which I hinted before, is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, among many.

But all this while, there is no ſuch thing as <hi>meer chance. Meer chance,</hi> I call that, when things come to paſs, not only in ſuch a way, of which we are able to give no account, and by ſuch means as we are not aware of, but in ſuch a way alſo, that God hath nothing, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to do in the ordering or diſpoſing of them. This to think is blaſphemous. For ſtill in the moſt caſual events, and greateſt contingencies, there is an inviſible hand of the infinitely-wiſe God, that linketh one thing to another, though in ſuch a way, that we know not, nor that is fit we ſhould know how.</p>

That I ſhall ſhew you in the next place. But this I muſt firſt premiſe in the general, that the ſilence in my Text is not of the voice and tongue alone, but of the heart and ſoul alſo. For though men hear only thoſe words which come out of our lips, yet with God, even the moſt retired thoughts and motions of our ſouls do go forwards, and he takes cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance and knowledge of them.

            <p n="1">1. He was dumb ſo as neither to complain of, nor quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Gods providence, nor to entertain any hard thoughts againſt him; complain <hi>to God</hi> he did, but <hi>againſt

No doubt he had ſinful riſings and motions in his heart (who doth not feel them?) but by prayer and meditation he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quell and ſtifle them, as faſt as they bubled up.

            <p n="5">5.

               <hi>unto him men gave ear, and waited and kept ſilence at his counſel;</hi> the meaning is, by their ſilence, they gave conſent to what he ſaid; they ſhewed, by holding their peace, their approbation of what he ſpake, confeſt better counſel could not be given; and that therefore it was to no purpoſe to ſay any more, ſeeing his advice and counſel could not be mended.

               <hi>doth all things well.</hi> Thus ye read of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when ſore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities had been threatned from God by the Prophet, he ſaith no more, but <note n="a" place="margin">Eſa. 39. 8.</note>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101280:10"/>
ſilence ſubſcribing to Gods wiſdome and goodneſs in all his providence.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid; we may conceive, what this dumbneſs of the Prophet was, wherein he is by the Holy Ghoſt propounded to us, for an example to imitate, when ever we ſhall feel Gods hand lye heavy upon us in any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>How fit and meet it is, that we ſhould lay hands upon our mouth, and impoſe a Law of ſilence upon our ſelves, in the manner ſpecified; what motives there be to perſwade to it, and by what means ſuch a frame of ſpirit may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, will appear farther in the next Doctrine, to which I haſten.</p>
            <p>There is no ſuch way to make us <hi>dumb,</hi> when God ſtrikes <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> us, as this very conſideration, that <hi>it is Gods hand that</hi> is upon us. Ye ſee this was it that turned <hi>the ſtorm,</hi> in the Pſalmiſts ſoul, into <hi>a calm,</hi> and made all the tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous riſings in his heart to vaniſh. When he bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this ſeriouſly, that it was Gods doing, the uproar among his affections ceaſed. Juſt as the appearing of ſome grave perſon, or man of Authority, is enough to ſcatter an <note place="margin">Ac veluti mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no in populo cum ſaepe coorta eſt Seditio—Tum pietate gravem—Virg.</note> unruly rout, and to reduce them to ſome good behaviour, though they were all in a combuſtion before: ſuch an effect will the preſenting of God to our ſouls, by faith, work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our diſcompoſed affections. <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 14. 27.</note> 
               <hi>It is I</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>be not afraid.</hi> The ſame argument will ſerve to ſtifle any other ſinful motions of the heart. It is God, be not impatient, do not fret; It is God, do not murmure, nor repine.</p>
            <p>There are three great duties of a Chriſtian (yea, all Chriſtianity is comprized in theſe three) Faith in God, Obedience to him, and Patience under his hand. And by one and the ſame way the ſoul is framed, and bowed to the practice and performance of them all. Look as there is no way to work the ſoul to faith, but the conſideration of this; <hi>That it is God that ſpeaks;</hi> And no way to bow it to obedience, but this conſideration; <hi>It is God that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:101280:10"/>
So there is no way to frame the ſoul to a patient ſubmiſſion (the dumbneſs we ſpeak of) under affliction, but this conſideration, <hi>'Tis God that doth it.</hi> The looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a promiſe as made by God, will ſtrengthen the ſoul to believe it, againſt all arguings and objections of fleſh and blood: The looking upon a command as given by God, will frame the ſoul to the obedience of it, fall back, fall edge. The looking upon an affliction as coming from God, and laid on by his hand, will make a man dumb and ſilent, will make him patient and calm; able to give up himſelf to be done with, as God ſhall think fit. Though there were nothing but tumults in the ſoul before, though his heart were like a troubled ſea, as ſoon as he comes to eye Gods hand, and to take due notice of it, all will be huſht and quiet; there will be a calm, as there was in the <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 14. 32.</note> ſhip, after our Saviours coming into it. When God but appears to the believing ſoul, and by the eye of Faith a diſcovery is made that <hi>it is he,</hi> darkneſs, and ſadneſs, and diſcontent, and diſmayedneſs, and drooping, and deſpondency do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at his preſence, and are no more.</p>
            <p>Many of the ſons of men, and they who have been the wiſeſt of all others in their generation, have ſpent much <note place="margin">Quemadmodum in domo Jairi tibicines carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſunebria qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem canebant, Chriſtus autem ſolus mortuum excitabat: ſic ſcientiae humanae multa quidem utiliter monent, &amp;c. at Theole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia ſolus, &amp;c.</note> time, and made it their work to find out the right <hi>Cure</hi> of grief and diſcontent, and ſome of them have pitcht upon one way, and ſome upon another, but going to work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the light of Scripture to guide them, could never hit upon the true Remedy, but have all become <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note>

And here ye have, in my Text, a remedy againſt all kind of grief, of Gods own preſcribing, and therefore an approved one it muſt needs be.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only give you a few inſtances of the admirable
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101280:11"/>
Cures, that have been wrought by this Remedy alone, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome whoſe afflictions have been moſt heavy, and whoſe caſes in appearance moſt deſperate, and then come to a word of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Whoſe heart would not have been ſtruck dead within <note place="margin">1. Eli.</note> him, by thoſe tidings wherewith <hi>Samuel</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam 3. 11, 12, 13.</note> acquainted <hi>Eli</hi> from God? How could <hi>Elie's</hi> heart chuſe but break at the apprehenſion of thoſe dreadful judgements denounced againſt his family, the very mention whereof was enough <hi>to make the ears</hi> of ſtrangers <hi>to tingle</hi> at the hearing? And yet with what admirable patience doth he take it? How calm is he? How far from murmuring? And what wrought him to this paſs? even this conſideration, <note n="h" place="margin">Verſe 18. 2. Job.</note> 
               <hi>It is the Lord, let him do as ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard of the ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> yea, I am ſure you never heard of any meer mans ſufferings like his. He was ſo afflicted in his eſtate, in his ſervants, in his children, in his wife, in his friends, in his body from head to foot, in his ſoul, that there ſeemed to be no place left, wherein to inflict a new wound. How doth he take all this? Doth he not ſtorm, and rage? doth he not deſpond, and deſpair? No, he kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the rod, is dumb, and holds his peace, though provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to impatience by the inſtigation of his wife, and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her, for ſerving a God that uſed him no better. What was it, that could poſſibly make a man take all this ſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently? This very conſideration in my Text wrought him to this compoſedneſs; <note n="i" place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>God hath given, God hath taken.</hi> And when afterward he had a little forgotten himſelf, and ſpoken unadviſedly, God was pleaſed but to remember him, whoſe <note n="k" place="margin">Job 38.</note> hand his afflictions came from, and that preſently reduced his ſoul to his firſt calmneſs. <note n="l" place="margin">Job 40. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer, yea, twice, but I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might tell you how the Prophet <hi>David</hi> found the rare <note place="margin">3. David.</note> effect of this Conſideration, for the quieting of his heart, many a time and oft, and in many a ſad caſe he was in, and not when he penned this Pſalm only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101280:11"/>
But I will give an inſtance in one greater by far than <hi>Eli,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4. Chriſt.</note> or <hi>Job,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> and one whoſe ſufferings did far ſurpaſs all theirs put together, who, by this very conſideration in the Text, comforted himſelf in the bearing of them. The perſon I mean was the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> the ſufferings I ſpeak of was that wrath and curſe of God, which he was to undergo for them whoſe Surety and Mediator he was, that Cup, which made him <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 22. 44.</note> 
               <hi>ſweat, as it were drops of blood falling down to the ground.</hi> This <hi>Cup</hi> (dreadful though it was) he took it into his hand, and drank it up, with this very Conſideration in his mind: <note n="n" place="margin">Joh. 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The Cup which my father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> And again, <hi>Not</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> 
               <hi>as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> This may ſuffice to ſhew what an effectual Remedy this is to work us, in our afflictions, to ſuch a dumbneſs and ſilence, as the Prophet in my Text is commended for.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now make uſe of this, and the precedent point <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> both together, and that only by way of Exhortation. All ye ſons and daughters of affliction (therefore) into whoſe hands God hath put any bitter Cup, drink it, and hold your peace, though the ingredients be Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; <hi>Be dumb, do not open your mouths.</hi> If you ſay, I may as well bid one in a cold fit of an Ague, that he ſhould not be chill: How can I be patient under ſuch ſufferings as mine are? ſo great, ſo ſuddain, ſo unexpected, ſo irrepair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Know, you are allowed to mourn, ſo you do not murmure; you are not forbidden to grieve, ſo ye be not dejected. He is an unreaſonable man that thinks one ſhould feel no pain, when one limb is torn and pulled from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All that I drive at is, that you would labour for ſuch a dumbneſs under Gods afflicting hand, as was before deſcribed; that is, <q>Take heed of quarrelling with Gods providence, take heed of falling out with wayes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſtand not juſtifying your ſelves and your own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; by prayer and meditation do your endeavour to quell all tumultuous riſings in your hearts: hold your peace, and hearken that you may take out theſe leſſons,

God is now reading to you in his School of affliction; <hi>acquieſce</hi> and reſt ſatisfied with Gods diſpenſations: ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his Wiſdome, Juſtice, Holineſs, Goodneſs, and Truth.</q> This is, that you are to be exhorted to; This is the work that now lies before you. But you will ſay to me, Do you think you can perſwade us to all this? I anſwer, The truth is, God muſt perſwade; yea, and he muſt bleſs the Phyſick, elſe all is in vain. But this I am ſure of, I can tell you, what it is that Gods people have found to be the moſt Soveraign Remedy, for the curing of the moſt heart-aking griefs; and that is this in my Text.</p>

               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Epiſt. 12 Proinde ad hibe ſolatia mihi: non haec, ſenex erat, infirmus erat (hoc enim novi) ſed nova aliqua, ſed magna quae audierim nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, legerim nunquam. Nam quae audivi, quae legi, ſponte ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currunt, ſed tanto dolore ſuperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> an aged perſon, one whom he exceedingly loved and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; wiſht his friend to ſuggeſt ſomething, that might comfort him. But ſaith he, Do not think to do it by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me he was an old man, and infirm, and one that in the courſe of Nature could not live long. Theſe things I know, tell me ſomething that is new, ſomething that is great, ſomething I never read, ſomething I never heard before; for thoſe things which I have heard, I often think of, but my grief is too ſtrong and vehement to be qualified, and allayed by them. Now if any of you ſhould impoſe ſuch a Law upon me, and bid me either tell you ſome new thing to comfort you, that you never heard of before, or elſe your ſorrow is ſuch, that it will ſcorn all that I can ſay, (as <note n="p" place="margin">Job 41. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Leviathan doth the ſhaking of a ſpear)</hi> and the ſpirit of impatience, that is in you, will not be laid: Though the task be hard, yet thus much, by Gods grace, I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſuggeſt ſuch Arguments to calm your ſpirits, as neither <hi>Pliny,</hi> nor any Heathen of them all ever heard, or dream't of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To tell you ſome things, which (if you do know) it is to be feared you have forgot, or to be ſure, do not mind <note place="margin">Tantum quiſque ſcit, quantum memoria tenet.</note> and take ſufficiently to heart. And it is no ſmall mercy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101280:12"/>
to have known truths brought unto our remembrance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion. It is a courteſie any of us would thank a man for, if he do but help us to our purſe again, when we have loſt it, though he give us nothing but what we had before. But peradventure ſome may hear that, of which till now, they were utterly ignorant: This I dare ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Remedy I am now giving you the receipt of, it is the beſt in the world; it hath, by the bleſſing of God, done admirable Cures upon the moſt ſad ſouls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt heavy afflictions. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s Sword, may be affirmed of it; <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 21. 9.</note> 
               <hi>There is none like it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall reduce all that I have to ſay farther about this point to theſe two Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. How, and after what manner the conſideration of <hi>Gods hand,</hi> works the heart to ſuch <hi>a dumbneſs</hi> and ſilence, as hath been ſpoken of.</item>
               <item>2. What there is contained in this <hi>conſideration,</hi> for ſuch a purpoſe; or what the <hi>Ingredients</hi> of this <hi>Medicine</hi> be.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now for the way and manner, how this <hi>Conſideration</hi> of Gods hand, worketh ſuch an effect in the afflicted ſoul, as hath been ſpoken of: It is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Partly by frighting us out of our impatience and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content. One paſſion is often cured, or (at leaſt) repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by another. The apprehenſion of <hi>Gods hand</hi> in our ſufferings ſtirs up fear, and fear drives away ſinful diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. <hi>Saul</hi>s thirſt after <hi>David</hi>'s blood was frighted away, (at leaſt for the preſent) by an apprehenſion of the danger he was in from the <hi>Philistims.</hi> If by the Eye of Faith, we do but once ſee God, it will ſo terrifie us, as <hi>to</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Job 42. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>make us abhor our ſelves, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Partly by furniſhing us with matter of Conſolation, ſomething to put into the other Scale, to weigh againſt our ſorrow. Conſolation is properly a kind of reaſoning, whereby we lay one thing againſt, and compare it with another, that by the conſideration of the one, we may be able to bear the other better. When you would make both
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101280:13"/>
ends of the ballance even, ye ſtill put more and more into the one end, till ye get the other up. Now this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods hand, doth furniſh us (as we ſhall hear anon) with ſundry weighty Arguments of Conſolation, enough to raiſe the ſoul that is ſunk deepeſt in deſpondency, and ſo muſt needs be effectual to quiet and compoſe the heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Partly it turns one ſorrow into another; <hi>a</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> 
               <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that cauſeth death, into a ſorrow that brings repentance never to be repented of:</hi> a ſorrow for ſuffering, into a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſin: and ſo it worketh a tranquility in the ſoul by diverting our paſſions into another channel, where they may take their courſe without any danger. Thus Phyſicians to ſtop bleeding in one place, do uſe the way of Revulſion, and open a vein ſome other where. The conſideration of <hi>Gods hand,</hi> will raiſe in our hearts a ſorrow <hi>according</hi> to God, and that (as <hi>Moſes</hi> his Serpent did with thoſe of the Magicians) will eat up our ſorrows of other kinds.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It works (laſtly) a calmneſs in our ſpirits, by turning our ſorrow at length into joy, converting our Wormwood and Gall into Wine, and inabling us by degrees to ſay, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſa. 119. 71.</note> 
               <hi>It is good for me.</hi> The due apprehenſion of <hi>Gods hand</hi> in all our loſſes and ſufferings, will firſt ſtrike <hi>us dumb,</hi> and make us ſilent; but thoſe who are thus <hi>dumb</hi> (as hath been ſhewed) ſhall in due ſeaſon find that promiſe verified to them, <note n="u" place="margin">Eſa. 35. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The lame man ſhall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing.</hi> And thus it was with our Prophet at laſt. <note n="w" place="margin">Pſa. 94. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (as he ſings ſweetly) <hi>whom thou chaſtneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy Law.</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Pſa. 119. 71.</note> 
               <hi>It is good for me, that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only you muſt know; that theſe effects will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on a ſuddain; it is not to be expected, that in an hour, or a day, ſuch an alteration ſhould be made; There muſt be frequent application of the Remedy, and the ſoul muſt dwell in theſe meditations and thoughts; <note n="y" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>Be in them</hi> (as the Apoſtles phraſe is) chaſe them therein by often and much muſing upon them, and hearty prayer to God, withall, for the ſetting them home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101280:13"/>
We proceed now to acquaint you, what there is in this Conſideration <hi>of Gods hand</hi> in our afflictions, to produce ſuch effects upon the ſoul, that is duly poſſeſſed with it.</p>
            <p>This only I muſt premiſe, that though it be a Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very uſeful for all men, in all their miſeries, yet, that one may receive the full benefit of this Truth, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary he be a Child of God, one that hath an intereſt in him, as <hi>David</hi> had: For alas! otherwiſe a mans caſe is ſo forlorn, that nothing can be ſaid to comfort him, and keep him from deſpair, farther than he is willing, and labours to be in ſuch a condition as may make him a ſubject capable of the comfort.</p>
            <p>Now there are 24 Arguments, comprized in theſe words <hi>[Thou didſt it]</hi> the conſideration of which, by the bleſſing of God, will be very effectual, to allay our ſorrow, to quiet our ſpirits; in a word, to make us dumb under Gods correcting hand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall divide them in three ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of them concern all people in general, that be in any kind of miſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others of them belong in a peculiar manner to ſuch as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>[viz.</hi> the children of God] in all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third ſort have a ſpecial reference to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too, but ſuch of them, as ſuffer under the loſs of a dear and hopeful Child, ſuch a loſs as hath occaſioned our ſad meeting here to day.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For thoſe Arguments that may be fetcht from this meditation <hi>['Tis Gods doing]</hi> to induce all whoſoever to lay <note place="margin">1.</note> a Law of ſilence upon their hearts and mouths, when they are afflicted; They are nine.</p>
            <p>It is He afflicts you, who is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do whatſoever he will. <note n="z" place="margin">Job 9. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>He is mighty in strength: he removeth the mountains, and they know it not; he over-turneth them in his anger. Which ſhaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> 
               <hi>Behold he taketh away, who can hinder him?</hi> Power alone, and of it ſelf, is very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101280:14"/>
dreadful, and carries a great awe along with it. <note n="b" place="margin">Eccl. 8. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Where the word of a King is</hi> (though he be but a mortal man) <hi>there is power, and who may ſay to him, what doſt thou?</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 20. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The fear of a King</hi> (whoſe breath is in his noſtrils) <hi>is as the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Lion; he that provokes him to anger ſinneth againſt his own ſoul.</hi> If Power be ſo formidable in an earthly Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; how ſhall any of us dare to murmure againſt his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in compariſon of whom the moſt potent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the earth are no better then ſo many impotent and ſilly worms?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember your ſufferings come from the hand of him, who <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 66. 5.</note> 
               <hi>is terrible in his doings to the children of men;</hi> yea, to the greateſt of them; who brings down <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 1. 52.</note> the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from their Thrones, and makes <note n="f" place="margin">Lam. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ſuch as were bred up in ſcarlet, to imbrace dung-hills;</hi> ruines them and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, when they ſeemed to be ſetled paſt danger of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The other Argument was taken from Gods Power to do what he pleaſeth, this from thoſe dreadful effects of his power which are to be ſeen. He not only can do, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually doth that which may well make us <hi>dumb,</hi> when he meddles with us, or any thing that is ours. How oft doth he deſtroy whole Kingdomes, and lay them waſt, and not make breaches in private families only?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Think of this; your afflictions come from his hand, who is Lord of all; I told you what he can do; and what he doth: Now we ſpeak of the <hi>right</hi> he hath to do what he pleaſeth. Such is his Dominion and Soveraignty, that he may do <hi>by right,</hi> what ever he can do <hi>by might:</hi> He is not accountable to any for his proceedings, nor tyed to any Rule to go by, but his own will. The Potter hath not ſo much power and right, to do what he liſt with his clay, as God hath over us and ours. When men meddle with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and buſineſſes, that they have nothing to do with, it is unſufferable, and who can bear it? But when God med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with us and ours, even the deareſt things we have, it is only in what he hath to do, and more to do than we, as being <hi>Lord of all.</hi> He is not therefore to ask our leave, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101280:14"/>
to ſtay for our good will, but may ſave us, or deſtroy us, build us, or pluck us down, ſettle us, or root us up, as he thinks good. He hath an abſolute, unlimited and arbitrary <note place="margin">Job 33. 13.</note> power, and therefore uncontroulable. And if God do but what he may, what are we, that we ſhould complain? It will not be amiſs a little to conſider, whence this Dominion of God comes, and what right he hath to it, the more to calm our hearts under his Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>Dominion among men is founded upon one or more of theſe ſix Titles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Occupation;</hi> He that firſt finds or lights upon any <note place="margin">Azor. Inſt. Mor. pars. 3. p. 47. &amp;c</note> thing, of which none can give any tidings who is the owner, doth thereby become the Lord and Owner of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Donation;</hi> This and that men come to be poſſeſſed of as theirs, by gift from ſuch, to whom thoſe things once of right appertained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> So children come to inherit after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death, that which was their fathers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Purchaſe;</hi> If a man can ſay, This is mine, and I am Lord of it, I bought it with my money, or made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for it, 'tis accounted a good Title.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Uſurpation;</hi> So ſome attain that Dominion they have, invading the right of others, and wreſting it from them by force; by their <hi>might</hi> overcoming the others <hi>Right.</hi> This is as bad a Title as may be.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Preſcription;</hi> That which a man hath ſo many years quietly enjoyed (no great matter how he came by it) he is judged among men to have a Title to.</p>
            <p>But none of all theſe wayes comes God by his Dominion and Lordſhip over us; no, his Soveraignty is founded upon infinitely better Titles than any of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. His Creating of all things by his own power, out of <note place="margin">Leſſius de At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trib. p. 126.</note> nothing, His making all, gives him the Kingdome over All.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His preſerving and upholding all things in the being he gave them at firſt. For all creatures would return to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as ice doth to water, when the cold ceaſeth) if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101280:15"/>
they were not ſupported <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>by the word</hi> of his power.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His being the laſt end of all, for whoſe ſake all things were made. <note n="g" place="margin">Joh. 11. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Of him, through him, and to him are all things.</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Rev. 4. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He</hi> [not only] <hi>hath created all things,</hi> [but] <hi>for his pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> What exception then can any man make againſt his Dominion, and abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty? What ſhadow of an objection can there lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Title? And therefore what can be more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fitting than to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in his Diſpenſations, and by our dumbneſs to teſtifie our conſent to what he doth? If God had nothing to do with us and ours, or if he were to ask our leave firſt, and yet ſhould, without craving our good will, meddle and do with us as he pleaſeth, there were ſome ground for murmuring. But whoſe mouth muſt not preſently be ſtopt, if God ſhould ſay to us in our impatiency, what? Shall not I (for all you) do what I think fit with mine own? Shall I make Creatures for mine own ſake, and ſhall not I (without your leave) diſpoſe of them as I pleaſe?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take notice your afflictions come from his hand, who is infinitely wiſe, <note n="i" place="margin">Mar. 17. 37.</note> 
               <hi>and doth all things well.</hi> Do we not all ſtand amazed at that Wiſdome, by which the Heavens and Earth, and all Creatures in both were made? And can we think God doth not order his Creatures, and govern, and diſpoſe of them, with as much wiſdome as he made them? Doubtleſs, there is nothing amiſs in his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He cannot be ſubject to any errour. <note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 32. 4.</note> 
               <hi>His work is perfect.</hi> If we could tell how to mend any thing that he doth, we might be born with in our complaining and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fault. But dare any of you undertake that? Muſt you not confeſs your ſelves to be fools, and unfit to be of his Counſel? Why then do you not lay your hands upon your mouth, and <hi>acquieſce</hi> in what he doth as beſt of all? Who could chuſe but be ſtruck dumb, if God ſhould ſay, <hi>Where's</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Job 38. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the man that darkneth counſel, by words without knowledge?</hi> Muſt I come and ask your advice, and take your direction for what I am to do? Muſt my Wiſdome be taught by your
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101280:15"/>
folly? Muſt I do nothing before I have firſt called you to counſel? If God ſhould challenge us thus, it would make us be in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe; <hi>I</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Job 42. 6.</note> 
               <hi>abhor my ſelf,</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Job 40. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I have ſpoken once, but I will not anſwer, yea twice, but I will proceed no farther, I repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When you are afflicted (to keep you from impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) do not forget your ſufferings come from his hand, of whoſe meer indulgence it is, that you have the comfort you yet enjoy: yea by whoſe goodneſs you yet enjoy more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, than you have loſt, as you might ſoon ſee, if you would ſet your ſelves to adjuſt the account. When people have loſt ſo much, that they think they can loſe no more, nor be any worſe than they are, then they grow deſperate, ſpeak and do they care not what. But while men have ſomething to loſe, it keeps them in awe, ſpecially, if they hold what they have, at the courteſie of him who hath taken away what they have loſt. This is our caſe; all our loſſes and ſufferings are inflicted by him, of whoſe meer grace we hold the reſt of our Comforts, and therefore it is beſt for us to be dumb, <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain?</hi> If our <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39.</note> own lives be ſpared, it is an unreaſonable thing to repine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Bethink your ſelves; Is not he who now afflicts you, one whoſe will you have often croſſed? One to whom you have walked contrary? will you not take the coyn you pay? Muſt you have a liberty to croſs God, and God none to croſs you? May you (think you) ſet light by his will, and muſt he, mean while, do nothing to diſpleaſe, or thwart yours? Who made this Law? Or do you think it equal? <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Do ye reap any thing, but what ye have ſown?</hi>

               <hi>May not God walk contrary to you, as well as you walk contrary to him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider, Doth not be afflict you, whom you have provoked to deal a great deal worſe with you? Have not you deſerved (let Conſcience ſpeak) to be puniſhed, not only thus, but <note n="q" place="margin">Lev. 26. 24.</note>

ſhould of right be whipt with Scorpions, grumble when he is but corrected with rods? There is ſo little reaſon for that, that he may rather bleſs God, if he ſcape ſo well.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But what ſpeak I of our deſerving more evils from God in this life: If we conſider it ſeriouſly, we ſhall find our afflictions are laid on by his hand, of whoſe infinite mercy it is, we are yet on this ſide hell.

Think therefore with your ſelves, let your condition be as bad as it will, it is better with you, than it would be in hell, whither you have deſerved he ſhould diſpatch you, that hath laid this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction on you.</p>

II. Secondly, There are (yet) other Arguments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to this <hi>dumbneſs</hi> under Gods hand, couched in theſe words <hi>[Thou didſt it]</hi> which do peculiarly concern Gods people, though thoſe before-mentioned do concern them alſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are the people of God, may well take pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently any blows that are reached them by <hi>his hand,</hi> He being their God in Covenant, through Chriſt, One that hath made them his children by adoption. An ingenuous and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſon will bear and put up a great deal at a Fathers hand, without ſullenneſs and pouting, though he could not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it from any other; <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 12. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>We have had</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>fathers of our fleſh, who have corrected us after their own pleaſure, and yet we have ſhewed them reverence;</hi> perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our duty and obſervance of them. <hi>Shall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the father of ſpirits?</hi> This was the Conſideration with which our bleſſed Saviour drank up that dreadful Cup mentioned before, <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Shall not I drink the Cup, that my Father gives me to drink?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as are the Saints of God may be aſſured all their evils of ſufferings are laid upon them, by one that intends them no hurt at all. Afflictions (indeed) look with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible aſpect to fleſh and blood, they have the appearance of Serpents and Scorpions, and the like baneful things, but they are ſent by him that means them no ill: Theſe <note place="margin">Mar. 16. 18.</note> ſufferings of theirs, though they ſeem to be deadly (and ſo indeed they are to unbelievers) and to tend to their undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are but Serpents without ſtings, and ſhall not ſo much as <note n="b" place="margin">Pſa. 91. 10.</note> touch them to do them any real prejudice; but are like unto the Viper on <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, which he ſhaked off, and received no harm, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 13. This which I ſay, cannot ſeem ſtrange to a child of God, when even the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man could tell his adverſaries that threatned his <note place="margin">Socrates, ut ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Epictet. cap. 79.</note> death; <hi>Ye may kill me, if you will, but you cannot hurt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Did I ſay, the afflictions of Gods Saints come from one that intends them no hurt? That is but a ſmall matter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101280:17"/>
in compariſon. He that afflicts them intends their good, <note place="margin">Mala paenalia non ſuat vere mala, quia flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt à ſummo bono, erant in ſummo bono, &amp; ducunt ad ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum donum.</note> and will work them much good by it. <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note>

            <p n="4">4. But this is not all; Gods peoples ſufferings are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by one, who hath already beſtowed upon them, that which may counter-ballance and weigh againſt all their ſorrows; God hath given them thoſe things which are more than enough and enough again, to fetch up their hearts when they are ſunk loweſt in deſpondency becauſe of any outward croſs.

To have part in Chriſt, to have Union and Communion with him, is there any thing in the World worth the talking of the ſame day with it? All theſe things (and yet theſe are not all) God hath conferred upon thoſe that are his. Now take your calamities, (you people of God) and <note n="o" place="margin">Job 6. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>weigh them in a ballance,</hi> and admit them <hi>to be heavier than the ſand;</hi> yet is not here enough to weigh againſt them? Will none of thoſe things, will not all of them countervail thoſe loſſes and afflictions you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Is the Cup God hath given you to drink ſo bitter, that all thoſe things are as good as nothing to ſweeten it? Can ye have more cauſe to be dejected either for one thing or another, than ye have to be cheered in the apprehenſion of your intereſt in ſuch things as theſe?

               <hi>conſolations of God be ſmall</hi> in your eyes, aſſure your ſelves it is long of your unbelief, for which you have infinite cauſe to be humbled.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yet farther: your afflictions come (I ſpeak of the godly) from the hand of him, who hath (as if what he hath <note place="margin">Sermo non valet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And doubtleſs, if our hopes of heaven were more firm and ſtedfaſt, though they could not priviledge us from affliction, yet they would arm our hearts ſo, that it would not be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any affliction to pierce them through.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, The godly may reſt aſſured that their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſent from no other but him, who hath (in the mean ſeaſon, till they come to heaven) engaged <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 13. 6.</note>

If God ſhould caſt us into the water, and there leave us to ſhift for our ſelves, and take no farther care of us, whether we ſink or ſwim, our caſe would be ſad: and it would be hard to find any thing that might yield us comfort. But that mans unbelief is his greateſt miſery, that thinks his miſery to be greater, than to be allayed with a promiſe of Gods preſence with him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Conſider, Is not this affliction of yours his doing, to whom ye have vowed and ſworn Obedience; Obedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, to do that which may pleaſe him; Obedience paſſive, to be pleaſed with what he doth? And is there not reaſon then for you to be dumb, and to hold your peace? Will you make vows to God, and break them when ye have done? Bind your ſelves to God by Covenant, as by bonds and cords, and will you, when you are put upon the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, how you will take any thing at Gods hand, carry your ſelves, as if you never meant (for all your vows) he ſhould either meddle with you or yours, farther than you your ſelves ſhould think fit? Is not this mocking of God? Nay, God will not be mocked, but this will prove bitterneſs in the latter end.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Is not this God who afflicts you, he whoſe will ye have prayed <hi>may be done on earth, as it is done in heaven?</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101280:18"/>
Have ye not often made this your petition unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty? <note place="margin">Nos imperaro volumus, nobis imperari nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Said</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſ. <hi>to</hi> Hormiſd.</note> And will ye now be angry, and impatient, that God ſhould rather have his will done, than you yours? Will you take on, as if it were more meet God ſhould ſubmit to your will, than you to his?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Laſtly, let not this be forgotten; you ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of affliction are under his hand, who doth <note n="u" place="margin">Lam. 3. 33.</note> 
               <hi>not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly correct;</hi> he would not do it, if you needed it not, and therefore <note n="w" place="margin">Pſa. 119 75.</note>

               <hi>heavy, but when need requires;</hi> as wiſe and loving parents correct their children, leſt otherwiſe they ſhould be ſpoiled.

               <hi>away the folly, that is bound up in his heart.</hi> Hence is that pathetical expreſſion, <note n="z" place="margin">Jer. 9. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Behold I will melt them and try them, for how ſhall I do for the daughter of my people?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, There is no other remedy. If other warning would ſerve the turn, God would not teach us by bryers and thorns. But better weep here, than gnaſh our teeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And as God corrects, but only when need requires, ſo he corrects no more, nor no longer. There is not one ingredient, not one jot of gall put into our Cup, more than he judgeth neceſſary for us. All theſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, what cauſe have any of Gods people to be impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? How fit and meet is it they ſhould be dumb under his afflicting hand?</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, I now proceed to thoſe arguments of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which may be fetcht from theſe words <hi>[Thou didſt it]</hi> that concern ſpecially ſuch ſervants of God, as ſuffer in the loſs of a dear and hopeful Child, ſuch a loſs as hath, to day, occaſioned our ſad meeting here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is he afflicts you thus, to whoſe indulgence you are thankfully to aſcribe it, that your <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
               <hi>tentation is but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and ordinary. It is a ſad thing for one to be afflicted in an exemplary way, ſuch an one, as either cannot at all, or not eaſily be parallelled. Some of Gods people have been
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101280:19"/>
ſo afflicted, that they might ſay, <note n="b" place="margin">Lam. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Is there any bodies ſorrow like unto my ſorrow?</hi> And God owes you no more than he did them: Yet even in ſuch a caſe, though very ſad, ye have ſeen how <hi>Job</hi> did bear up his ſpirit by this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note n="c" place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that all was Gods doing,</hi> when he could not find, or hear of any in the world, whoſe ſufferings were compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his. Now to loſe a Child that we dearly loved, one that was hopeful, and that we had ground to think God had made his by Adoption, what affliction is it more than thouſands of Gods people have had tryal of?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, I pray conſider, it is he hath taken him, who hath ſhewed you more favour, in taking one that came out of your loyns to wait upon himſelf, and ſee his face in glory, than he hath done you injury in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him from you. Was it not your ambition he might go to heaven, and will you be troubled overmuch now he is gone? Did <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 19</note> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> do <hi>Jeſſe</hi> any wrong, or did he think it would be ſo interpreted, when he ſent for his ſon <hi>David</hi> to come and wait upon him at Court? But you would not have had him gone ſo ſoon: you would ſtill have enjoyed him a little, and a little longer, and have had him to have lingred here. It ſeems then all the difference betwixt God and you, is only in point of a little time more or leſs: That which God hath done now, you would have had him done hereafter. But can there be any good reaſon why you ſhould be <hi>tormented,</hi> becauſe God hath made one of yours happy ſo ſoon?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tell me, Is not God who hath taken your Child, he whoſe your Child was, infinitely more than he was yours? Did you frame him, and faſhion him? Did you either make his Soul, or ſo much as one part or member of his Body? Or if any one had been wanting, could you have made up that defect? Though you might challenge more intereſt in him, than any upon earth, yet what was your intereſt in him, if compared with Gods? Do not you know, that in reſpect of that intereſt God had in him, you (though his Parents) were no more than perſons only intruſted to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101280:19"/>
breed him, and bring him up for his heavenly Father? And muſt he not go, or will you be troubled if he go, when his Father and yours ſends for him? Our bleſſed Saviour is propounded to us for a pattern of obedience, and <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 2. 49. <hi>cum.</hi> 51.</note> 
               <hi>ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to earthly parents: but he muſt go, and be, whither, and where his heavenly Father called him, and enjoyned him, for all them: and they muſt ſubmit, and talk no more of their intereſt, when God challengeth his.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is he hath taken him, who is wiſer than you, and only knows from how many evils and miſeries, he, by death, is freed, that we who are left behind may live to ſee and ſuffer; who can tell what ſad times are coming? and is it not then a mercy to us, and ought we not, not only to be patient but thankful (though it is an hard leſſon) when we have cauſe to hope that any of ours are got ſafe to heaven, where fleſh, and devil, and world, ſhall not be able any more to annoy them, to all eternity?</p>
            <p n="5">5. When you think who it is hath taken him from you, remember it is he to whom when he was baptized you did voluntarily dedicate and devote him. We and all ours are at Gods diſpoſal, whether we will or no (as we heard before) and there is no help for it; yet God loves that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould freely make a ſurrender to him of what is his own, (which elſe he will diſtrain for, and have at his pleaſure, do we what we can to the contrary) and he accepts in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly when we do ſo, as an act of our ſervice and homage to him. But ſhall we give and take? Surrender up ours to God, and pretend to do it cordially, and when it comes to the point, ſtruggle, and hold back as far as we are able, and part with that, which we have by our own act given to God grudgingly, and with an ill will? If we do not mean to give up our ſelves, and ours to God, why do we play the hypocrites, and pretend it? If we do it really and in good earneſt, why do we repine when God takes but that, which is not only his own, but which we have freely given him?</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſhall adde but one Conſideration more; which was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101280:20"/>
ſuggeſted by a Reverend and worthy Man, 'Tis he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken your Son, who did ſo freely give you his. God ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>A.</hi>
               </note> not his only Son for you, but was willing to give him up even to the death, and thought not much to part with him; and while you think of what God hath done in this kind, it cannot but ſeem a poor thing, (in your own eyes) for you to part with yours when he will have it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>All theſe things ſaid together, I ſuppoſe you will ſay, the conſideration of <hi>Gods hand</hi> in all our afflictions hath enough in it to make us ſubmiſs and calm, to make us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and contented, in a word, to make us <hi>dumb and ſilent</hi> under his ſharpeſt Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall adventure to open and ſearch the wound of thoſe our worthy friends who are moſt concerned (and with whom we ſympathize) in this ſad loſs: and for whoſe ſake (ſpecially) I have provided the plaiſter, the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of which I have been ſo long giving you the account of. And though I ſhall (I believe) make the wound bleed afreſh, by telling you, in their hearing, what it is they mourn thus for; yet having a Remedy at hand ſo ſoveraign, and ſo approved, I hope by the application of it, their ſorrow will, in ſome good ſort, be allayed.</p>
            <p>I had thought to have reduced what I have to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſweet Child that is gone (and ſo I eaſily might) to three heads; his parts, which appeared in him very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: his piety, of which he gave good evidence; and his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs to his Parents, which was as remarkable as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two. But I my ſelf was ſo affected with ſundry paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages concerning him (which I have to tell you) as they came ſuddenly to my mind, that I ſhall even repreſent them to you, in the ſame order, wherein mine own thoughts at firſt met with them, not ſtanding upon any method.</p>
            <p>This ſweet Child was five years and an half old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, within two or three dayes, when God took him: But he had arrived to that in five years, and a little more, that ſome which are here (I am afraid) have not arrived to in ten times that ſpace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101280:20"/>
He had learn'd his <note n="†" place="margin">The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ſhorter Catechiſm.</note> Catechiſm throughout, and began to learn it over again, with the proofs out of the Scripture at large, wherein he had made ſome progreſs. Yet did he not learn theſe things as a Parrot by rote, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what he ſaid, but could give a good account (much beyond what might be expected in one of his years) of the ſenſe and meaning of what he learn'd. Of this, both others, and I my ſelf have made ſome experience.</p>
            <p>Neither did he look upon his Catechiſm only as a task impoſed upon him by his Parents, which he was to learn, for fear of the rod; but took a great deal of pleaſure in it, and would often have it at night to bed with him. Some good acquaintance alſo he had gotten with the Scripture ſtory. Theſe things argue both parts, and ſomething of a pious diſpoſition likewiſe. How few ſuch of his age are to be found?</p>
            <p>He met one day (in a Gentlewomans Chamber, who lives in the houſe) with a book that treated of the paſſion of Chriſt, and reading a little in it, ſaid he liked the Book well, and that he would read it over. So he began and read ſome few pages, then turned the leaf down, and the next day came again and began where he left, and ſo from day to day, till he had read a conſiderable part of it.</p>
            <p>He was a very dutiful Child to his Parents, and would exceedingly rejoyce, when he had done any thing, or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſo, as to pleaſe them.</p>
            <p>He was taken with the Book called, <hi>The Practice of Piety,</hi> and delighted to be reading in it.</p>
            <p>His Father ſpeaking to him one day about the Devil and Hell, and things of that nature, asked him if he were not afraid to be alone? He anſwered no: for God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. His Father asked him, why he thought ſo? He replyed, that he loved God, and that he hoped God loved him. But (ſaith his Father) you have been a ſinner, and God loves not ſinners. But I am ſorry for my ſins (ſaith he) and do repent. Repent (replyed his Father) do you know what repentance means, and what belongs unto it?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101280:21"/>
And he gave him a good account of the apprehenſion he had of the nature of that Grace, according to what he had learn'd in his Catechiſm, but yet in his own words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>He would oft ask his Siſter (who was ſomewhat younger than himſelf) whether ſhe truſted in God, and loved God? and would tell her, that if ſhe ſought God, God would be found of her, but if ſhe forſook God, God would caſt her off for ever.</p>
            <p>He took that delight in his book, that his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſeen cauſe ſometimes to hide away his book from him.</p>
            <p>He was never obſerved to diſcover any pouting or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, when upon any occaſion he was corrected. And you muſt not think I am telling you the ſtory of one, in whom <hi>Adam</hi> (as they feign of <hi>Bonaventure)</hi> never ſinned. There is <hi>that fooliſhneſs bound up in all childrens hearts, that will ſometimes need the rod of correction;</hi> though there be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 15.</note> few in whom there appeared leſs than in him.</p>
            <p>The day before he died, he deſired me to pray for him: I told him, if he would have me to pray for him, he muſt tell me, what I ſhould pray for; and what he would have God to do for him! He anſwered, <hi>To pardon my ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oft upon his ſick-bed he would be repeating to himſelf the 55 Chapter of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and other pieces of Scripture, which in the time of his health he had learn'd by heart.</p>
            <p>But that paſſage in the forementioned Chapter was moſt frequently in his mouth, and uttered by him with much affection: <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my wayes your wayes, ſaith the Lord: For as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my wayes higher than your wayes, and my thoughts than your thoughts:</hi> as if God (out of this ſweet <hi>Babes mouth)</hi> had, in theſe words, read to his Parents a Lecture of ſilence and ſubmiſſion under <hi>his hand,</hi> and taught them that he muſt be dealt with and diſpoſed of, not as they, but as his heavenly Father (whoſe thoughts were far different) ſhould think fitting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:101280:21"/>
One time he brake out into this expreſſion, My God, my God, deliver me out of this miſery, and from the pains of hell for ever.</p>
            <p>A little before his death he brake out into theſe words, My ſins pardon, my ſoul ſave for Chriſt his ſake.</p>
            <p>I cannot blame thoſe worthy perſons ſo neerly related to him, though they mourn at parting with ſuch a ſweet and hopeful Child; any more than I could blame them for feeling pain, if one of their limbs were torn from another. Only they muſt not mourn to deſpondency; and I hope I gave them ſufficient reaſon why, before.</p>
            <p>What an inſtrument of Gods glory might he have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? What a deal of ſervice might he have done to God (in all likelihood) had he lived to old age? But it was Gods doing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only make two or three Animadverſions upon the whole, and conclude all with five words of application.</p>
            <p>How many are there that live to fifty or threeſcore years, of whoſe life ſo good an account cannot be given as of this little one, of five years of age and an half?</p>
            <p>How many Gentlemen be there, of whom when they die, all that can be ſaid is this, They were born, they did eat, and drink, and play, and hunt, and hawk, and lived like ſo many wild <hi>Aſs-colts,</hi> never minding any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd <note place="margin">Job 11. 12.</note> Gods glory, or their own ſalvation, either when they were children, or after they came to mans eſtate, and ſo died, and dropt into hell?</p>
            <p>How many others be there, of whom when they die, all that can be ſaid is this; They were born, they did eat and drink, and moil and labour for the bread that periſheth with all their might, but neither knew, nor cared to know what they were born for, like bruit creatures, only minding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, and thus ſpent fifty or threeſcore years, and ſo died, and went down to hell?</p>
            <p>How much more comfortably might a Miniſter of the Goſpel admit to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ſuch a Child as this, notwithſtanding his years, than thoſe of ten
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101280:22"/>
times his age that are children (would to God they were like ſome children) in underſtanding?</p>
            <p>I ſhall make Application of what hath been ſaid touching him, in five words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To all in general, to admire and adore Gods Grace, which doth ſhew it ſelf, and work thus in little ones. Do not ſay, All this was nothing but his education. Bleſſed <note place="margin">—Laudes ſive tuas in Chriſto, ſive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis in te laudes Chriſti. Aug. ad Valer. Com.</note> be God for his education: and thoſe children have cauſe to bleſs God, whoſe Parents have been careful to bring them up in his fear. But ſure it was ſomething elſe, for we ſee how different wayes thoſe take, that have one and the ſame education. If education would have done the thing (without Gods bleſſing) doubtleſs <hi>Eli,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of Gods Saints, had never had their hearts bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the ungraciouſneſs of their children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To Parents, to encourage them to be dropping prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion into their little ones, and to be doing it betime; to ſeaſon the Veſſel firſt, if poſſible, with the fear of God. We know not how ſoon God may be pleaſed to work upon the hearts of our children, even the youngeſt of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To young ones, that they would learn to imitate and follow this example, that hath been ſet before them. Learn to know God, and remember your Creator betimes: Learn to pay the duty and obſervance you owe unto your Parents. This is a thing well-pleaſing unto God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To old ones, that come ſhort of this ſweet Child; Bluſh and be aſhamed (man!) to be forty or fifty years of age (it may be more) and yet out-ſtripped by a Child of five years and an half, not to have attained ſo much knowledge of God, and the things that concern your ſouls, in all theſe years, as he had attained in ſo ſhort a ſpace. Learn to know God at laſt, get acquaintance with the principles of Religion, while you have yet a day, while ye have yet an hour left, before ye go hence, and be ſeen no more. You will ſay, would you have us old folks, (as this age) go learn <note place="margin">Object.</note> the Catechiſm like children?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:101280:22"/>
If you do not know thoſe things already, why not? I <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 8.</note> am ſure you were better do ſo, <hi>Than have Chriſt come in flaming fire to take vengeance on you becauſe you know not God.</hi> It is better by far to ſet your ſelves to the learning of the points in the Catechiſm, than to go to hell for your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To thoſe worthy perſons, the neer Relations of this ſweet Babe that is gone; God hath but taken up this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lamb to heaven, to make you, in your hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to follow after. There is a part of you in heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: He muſt not come again to you, make ſure that you meet him there. And when you think how dearly you miſs him, remember but who hath taken him. Submit to, and <hi>acquieſce</hi> in Gods Diſpenſation. Remember it is his hand. Some do think there is no ſuch Remedy for the Diſeaſe called the <hi>Kings-Evil,</hi> as a touch with the Kings Hand: but this I am ſure of, there is no ſuch way to abate the anguiſh of our ſouls under any ſmarting blow from Gods Hand, as the ſerious conſideration of Gods Hand, from whence the pain comes. Do not forget the Text, <hi>Be dumb, open not your mouths:</hi> not one word: <hi>It is Gods doing.</hi>
