         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> muſt confeſſe 'tis no way pleaſing
to mee to diſpute the power of a
KING, for had I fortunes of my
owne, ſo far as thoſe would reach,
I would nere urge property againſt
my Soveraignes Commands, and
no man ought to complaine of my grievance but
my ſelfe, and if I were content to loſe that
which the Subjects Liberty calls <hi>Meum,</hi> I hope
'tis no prejudice to that it calls <hi>Tuum:</hi> But when
I looke upon the generall cauſe (as at this time)
tis otherwiſe; therefore now I hold every man
bound to lay particular caſes aſide, and ſacrifice
his beſt endeavours, for a timely compoſure of
theſe generall and unſeaſonable diſtractions, and
the beſt way I could think on is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for private ends on the one ſide, to flatter the
King, by giving him more power then the Law
hath ſettled in him; nor for by-reſpects on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, to abate of the Kings due, and give
it to the Parliament; but with Allegiance to the
one, and ſubmiſſion to the other (as neer as I
can) give both their right.</p>
            <p>And truely I cannot be made ſenſible that I
have done otherwiſe, onely 'twas my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to fall under the miſapprehenſion of divers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29829:4"/>
who (from an Argument I uſed in the former
Impreſſure) have raifed a conſequence as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as the Subject of diſcourſe was nice.</p>
            <p>The Accuſation againſt me is, that I did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
hold it lawfull to Depoſe a KING: the
ground of their Accuſation is this:</p>
            <p>In the former Impreſſion, <hi>Fol.</hi> 13. this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was urged, <hi>viz.</hi> The KING hath the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by way of Truſt, now by Law a Truſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Countermanded; therefore Sir <hi>John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thams</hi>
keeping of Hull againſt the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was illegall.</p>
            <p>To which my Anſwer was thus, <hi>viz.</hi> I doe
confeſſe that by Law a Truſt cannot be Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
but yet I ſhall take a difference between
the Truſt of a private mans eſtate, and the truſt of
a Kingdome, and if that difference ſhould not hold,
I ſhewed the miſchiefe that would enſue, for
then our caſe were in ſhort but thus:</p>
            <p>We have intruſted the King with the whole
Kingdome, and this truſt cannot be in any part
countermanded by us againe, and if ſo, then the
Kings eſtate is as good as abſolutly his owne (I
meane) for his commanding power, though not
for his diſpoſing power; and if ſo, then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make uſe of our own ſtaff, when we are in feare
of being beaten by a forraigne Force, becauſe by
that means, that is, by the Kings Commanding
Power, the Parliament; that is, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
may be bound to the peace.</p>
            <p>But now ſome will here object that we ought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29829:4"/>
not to have ſuch a thought of the King, as to
thinke that he would by his commanding power
bind us to the peace, when a forraigne Force is
comming againſt us.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that 'twere poor policy for him
to do it, but that tis no diſhonour to the King for
me to ſuppoſe, that ſome Traiterouſly minded Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite,
may at ſuch a time perſwade him to uſe his
Commanding power, pretending ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Crowne (as all Traytors doe) when
nothing is more intended then their own Trayter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ends; therefore twas the wiſdome of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters
the Law makers, to keepe the power out
of his hands, not ſo much for feare what he would
do of himſelf, as what others might poſſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him to do.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe I might have anſwered the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
with the authority of Parliament who did
imploy Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> but not imagining any
would draw that conſequence (they accuſe me
with) from the differenc I anſwered with, I wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that anſwer I might have given from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which the Parliament have above the Law, If
the Law had bin ſo, that in caſe of the truſt of
the Kingdom, it could not be in any part counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>But truely I cannot have any ground in that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
for that concluſion: For I took the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in anſwer of an objection, concerning a
particular place, as Hull, not concerning the whole
Kingdom; and though it may be lawfull in that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29829:5"/>
particular caſe (by reaſon of ſome great miſchiefe
or inconvenience which might otherwiſe enſue)
yet it may not be lawfull in the generall; for who
knowes not but the Law will rather ſuffer a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
inconvenience then a generall miſchief.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I meant not an abſolute and perpetuall
Countermand of that particular place neither;
for that were utterly to extinguiſh and take away
the Kings Right for ever; but I meant a temporary
Countermand onely, that was, as long as (in the
judgement of that Great Counſell the PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT)
the urgency of the neceſſity did require it:
and many things we find are and may be done for
a certain time, which cannot be done for ever; as
in caſe of the Peers of the Realme, 'tis the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
of a Baron to Vote in the Houſe of Lords in
time of Parliament; yet we ſee and find it adjudged,
that a Baron or an Earl or any Peer of the Land,
may be diſabled to ſit during his life, or during ſuch
a time, but yet his heirs cannot be diſabled ſo long
as their veines are filled with Noble blood.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I meant that that temporary Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
can never be done but by the Parliament nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if they ſhould not have power to do it
being the Kingdom repreſentative, then the King
had more power then the Kingdom, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
ſaith <hi>Fox, Vol. primum. Fol.</hi> 879.</p>
            <p>And thus I have explained my ſelf, ſufficiently I
hope to prevent farther miſtakes, and to ſhew that
for my part, I ſhall for ever pray that the Crown
may ſtand as firm upon His Majeſties Head as ever
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29829:5"/>
'twas, and may it long continue there, and for ever
to his Poſterity after him.</p>
            <p>And yet I fear there are many fiery zealous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
who imbrace the tenet, and are glad to find any
premiſſes from whence they may but with ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
draw their concluſion: nay and ſuch as may
have honeſt hearts too, and be earneſtly deſirous of
a Reformation, only the zeal of their houſes may
eat them up; but for ſuch as do hold the opinion, I
am ſure they have no incouragement from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
neither can any thing that the Parliament
hath done be any ground for their uulawfull hopes,
and from me they ſhall have no more fuell to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their flames then this, <hi>viz.</hi> 'Tis againſt the
Common Lawes of <hi>England</hi> to Depoſe a King, a
thing that was held damnable by no leſſe then two
Acts of Parliament, the one in <hi>Edward</hi> the ſeconds
time, the other in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time.</p>
            <p>Had I had the gift of foretelling the divers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
and concluſions, that would have been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(by the ſeverall Readers) from my Arguments,
I would have laid them ſo, that no Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling
Tubman ſhould have made my words his text,
raiſing from thence ſo damn'd a Doctrine; but that
was impoſſible, and therefore ſeeing I could not
then avoyd it, let me now labour to cleer my ſelfe
by ſtriving to convince others that hugg the tenet,
which I ſhall do by two Arguments:</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> which
ſayes the KING can do no wrong, the reaſon is
good, becauſe all his active Offices are diſpoſed of,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29829:6"/>
and he never executes none of them Himſelf, and
therefore what ever wrong is done, 'tis done by
his Officers, and they are to anſwer for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament layes the fault upon his Evill
Councellors, not upon the King himſelf: now then
I ſay, if the King can do no wrong, then you muſt
allow that he does none; and if ſo, how then can
any man hold it lawfull to Depoſe him; ſurely you
will not be ſo unjuſt as to hold that he may be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
without a cauſe, and ſuppoſe a cauſe you cannot,
for the Law will not allow of ſuch a ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis a rule in Law, that <hi>unumquod<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
eo ligamine diſolvitur quo ligatum fuit,</hi> now that
<hi>Ligamen</hi> of inſtitution or ordinance of Royall Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
(as you ſay your ſelf) was not only humane but
partly divine, for as you ſay <hi>jure Coronae,</hi> the King
was mans appointed, ſo you likewiſe ſay, that <hi>jure
perſonae,</hi> he was God Anointed; now if it be ſo that
he be as well Divine as Humane, how then can Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws undoe any more then what human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
did at firſt inſtitute? now according to this
argument if you Depoſe a King, you muſt thwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that rule in Law, and <hi>contra principium negantem non
eſt diſputandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next argument is from Gods Law, which is
the better way for weak man, either to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
under the affliction God layes upon him, or
ſtoutly to his power oppoſe him; ſurely you will
grant that to ſtand on tiptoes againſt God, is not the
ſafeſt way; why then for arguments ſake, let us <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponere
quod non eſt ſupponendum,</hi> admit that a King
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29829:6"/>
himſelf be as bad as bad may be; or which is moſt
uſuall, admit that he be drawne and perſwaded by
his Councellors to do that which is illegall, and to
the great prejudice of his Subjects, why now is not
this a ſcourge layed by God upon the Kingdom, to
ſuffer the King to be thus perſwaded and poſſeſt?
Surely yes, why then do you think it the beſt way
to Depoſe that King preſently, as if you would have
the Land flow with milke and hony in deſpight of
God? or as if God did not know whether he ſent
him when he firſt beſtowed him upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at his Birth; or whoſe child he ſhould be when
he firſt fram'd him in the womb; in my opinion (I
am ſure I my ſelf am) you may be zealous againſt
the Cavaliers, and yet not envy the King, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
you may worſhip God aright without cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his Son, you may honour God and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
the King.</p>
            <p>Again, if God puniſh a Son with a ſharpe and
cruell father, were it fit for that ſon (thinking to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
a greater liberty then before) to kill his father,
and ſo Depoſe him as I may ſay (for every man is a
King in his own family) as if God could not whipp
him with another laſh: apply it to your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Yet miſtake me not, I blame you not for your
good affections, and for being aſſiſtant to the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,
but rather for commendation tell you, that
if any thing can be meritorons (in my opinion)
that is, onely this caveat I give to the vulgars (for
knowing and learned men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope will not entertain
a thought of it) that their private hopes or inward
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29829:7"/>
thought reach not beyond the intent of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for feare leſt their honeſt endeavoures ſhould
faile (notwithſtanding your large contributions)
by reaſon of your unjuſt intents. You do well to
ſtand for your Mother Englands right, yet take
heed you deſtroy not your Fathers the Kings; for
Gods command of obedience to your Parents, doth
not except againſt the honour you owe your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And thus I have diſcharged my owne conſcience
concerning that point, whether I have pleaſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
or not I know not, and indeed care not; I
could never yet ſtudie to pleaſe the roving fancies
of the giddy multitude any farther then truth and
that little knowledge I have would guide me; no,
though the greateſt recompence of a glorious, but
fading world, were by my own thoughts preſented
to me.</p>
            <p>And now ſeeing I am upon publiſhing an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I ſhall correct ſome of the chiefeſt faults of the
laſt impreſſion, ſo paſſe by the reſt being but faults of
the preſſe.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt was indeed occaſioned by my own
neglect in leaving a whole leafe out of the Printers
copy, and it was this:</p>
            <p>In the 7. leafe of the firſt impreſſion there was an
objection raiſed; but the anſwer was omitted, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was this:</p>
            <p>Some that endeavour to deſtroy the truſt, and
maintaine that the King hath his right to Hull, <hi>et per
conſequens,</hi> to all the Kingdome by diſcent, do urge
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29829:7"/>
the place in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe, where tis ſaid the King
holds the Kingdome of England by Birth-right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
by diſcent from the blood Royall, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſucceſſion doth attend.</p>
            <p>To which objection I anſwer, that thoſe words
whereupon ſucceſsion doth attend, is a direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon that place; for the King is the Heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
of King <hi>James</hi> his Father, now being ſo,
he is <hi>capax coronae,</hi> that is, he is his Fathers ſucceſſor
too; and ſo he holds the Kingdome by ſucceſsion:
now the ſucceſſor is the Heir of the Kingdom, <hi>Dan.
fol.</hi> 28. not the heire of the King onely, and that is
the reaſon tis uſually ſaid, To the King, his heirs and
ſucceſſors, where the word heirs is firſt named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is firſt heire to the King, by title of diſcent
before he can be heir to the Kingdome, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can be his ſucceſſor; ſo that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>Haereditas</hi> and <hi>ſucceſsio,</hi> for they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
two ſeverall capacities, the firſt ſignifie his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
capacity as he is King <hi>jure perſonae,</hi> that is, as
Gods Anointed, the other ſignifying his politique
capacity, or his <hi>jus corona,</hi> that is, as he is mans
appointed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bracton</hi> ſpeaking of the King and his Oath, and
how that he ſwears to adminiſter Juſtice to all his
Subjects, to the utmoſt of his power; goe; forward
and ſayes, <hi>Et ad hoc creatus eſt &amp; electus,</hi> which two
words, <hi>creatus &amp; electus,</hi> do fully prove the former
Diſtinction; that is, they prove him to be Gods
Anointed, <hi>jure perſonae,</hi> and Mans appointed, <hi>jure co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronae;
Bracton, cap. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:29829:8"/>
I finde the ſame Diſtinction made good too, out
of holy Writ; <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were both Anointed
by <hi>Samuel,</hi> but yet the peoples conſent was ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
that they had not the Crown till they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to it, for <hi>David</hi> was twenty yeers without
the Crown after he was anointed, and the text ſaith,
<hi>Saul</hi> fought a Battle before his creation, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.
5. and yet he was anointed before the Battle: ſo
that the word creation in that text, juſtifies what
<hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſayes, <hi>Fol.</hi> 31. the intent of the people is
the <hi>primum vivens,</hi> having within it blood, that is
to ſay, politique proviſion for the utility and wealth
of the ſame people, which it imparteth aſwell to the
head (that is) the King, as to the Members.</p>
            <p>There are ſome that have gotten a new objection,
which is not without ſome ground I muſt confeſſe,
and 'tis this; 'Tis ſaid in <hi>Calvins</hi> caſe, <hi>Cook Lib.</hi> 7.
<hi>Fol. 13. A.</hi> that before any judiciall or municipall
Laws were, Kings did <hi>dare jura</hi> of themſelves, and
decide cauſes according to naturall equity, and were
not ty'd to any rule; or formality of Law, and yet
they were Kings, and then ſay they could not have
any politique capacity, for that being but <hi>fictio ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
can be no ancienter then the Law whoſe fiction
it was.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that the very place my
Lo:<hi>Cook</hi> there cites for his proof is a ſufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon that place, for he there quotes <hi>Fort. cap.</hi>
12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. which very places are quoted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
impreſſion of this book, <hi>Fol</hi> 10. by which you
may ſee that he ſpake of other Kingdomes, not of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29829:8"/>
Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> who raiſed themſelves into a
Body, and ſo got the ſtart of other Nations.</p>
            <p>Many other things I ſhould alſo correct of the
former impreſsions, but I cannot in regard I am
forced to print this addition by it ſelfe; otherwayes
I ſhould have corrected them all, and have brought
the additions in their right places; but that Printers
muſt now be pleaſed, who like Players touch
nought but what will take: <hi>Newly revived,</hi> is quite
forgoten with them, nay and with the Stationers
too, but when they cheat a Puiſne with a new cover
upon an old book, with leafes paſted together to
conceal an aged blott, never Printed but once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
is not for their turn, they abhorre the beaſt,
yet <hi>eſt natura hominum novitatis avida</hi> is their Creed
though the Beaſts language: An ingenious Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
told me 'twould not ſell without a new Title,
(which made me change the dreſſe of this addition)
yet he may be none of thoſe that can find no eares
for a Sermon at the ſecond preaching unleſſe the
text be changed.</p>
            <p>And thus I am willing to ſubmit to an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
for their profits, rather then my words
ſhould be made the ground of Arguments ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
as to ſhake a Crown, and ſo maliciouſly envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and irreligous, as to ſtrike at Royall Dignity.</p>
