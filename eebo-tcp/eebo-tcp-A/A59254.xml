            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

made, as well in writing as by verball Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
inviting the Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> or
ſome of them, to meet with the Officers
of the Army, in their conſultations about
matters of Religion; We, Miniſters of the
Goſpel within the Province of <hi>London,</hi>
hold it our Dutie, as then to refuſe any ſuch meeting as was

the Reaſons of that Refuſall, leaſt by our ſilence we ſhould
ſeem to be wanting in that ingenuity and Candor which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
all, but eſpecially the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. And
underſtanding that ſome of our Brethren, at one Conference
before your Lordſhip and ſome of your Councell,<note n="a" place="margin">Mr. Marſhall, Mr. Calamy. Mr. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers. Mr. Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, &amp;c.</note> and at

manifeſted their diſlike, both of your late Actions towards
many of the Worthy Members of the Honourable Houſe of
Commons, and what likewiſe you have publiſhed in your late
Remonſtrance and Declaration, as your intention for ſetling
the Affairs of the Kingdom, (as we were informed by ſome of
them, and willed thus to ſignifie,) We thought fit hereby to
manifeſt our Concurrence with thoſe our Reverend Brethern;
Humbly deſiring, That while we uſe that Plainneſſe and
Freedom which becometh the Abaſſadors of Chriſt, this our
performance may not be miſinterpreted, either as a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Law of Chriſtian meekneſſe, or an exceeding the
Bounds of Miniſteriall liberty; We being commanded to cry
aloud, and to lift up our voices as Trumpets, to ſhew the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
their Tranſgreſsions, and the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> their ſins.</p>
            <p>Had a Conference been deſired with us onely to have given
you reſolution, whether the wayes wherein at the preſent you
are walking, are agreeable to the Word of God, (which Caſe
indeed had been ſutable for private perſons to have propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and for Miniſters of the Goſpel to have reſolved) We
ſhould moſt willingly and freely have delivered our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(as our forementioned Brethren have done) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe your practiſes; and have given you this our Advice,
grounded upon Scripture; Namely, That in ſtead of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further in ſuch unwarrantable courſes, you ſhould have
teſtified your timely and godly ſorrow for what (ſo clearly
againſt the direct Rule of the Word) you have already acted.</p>
            <p>And if onely for the clearing of this Caſe, a Conference had
been deſired, It was from the firſt profeſſed that we ſhould be
ready and willing to meet, where and with whomſoever, to
aſſert and maintain our Judgemnet therein. But as if the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of your way were already granted by us; We were onely
invited to contribute our aſsiſtance in proſecution of what you
had undertaken, which we conceive to be out of your Sphere;
And for us to have joyned in any conſultation of this nature,
would have made us acceſſary unto them; guilty of the evill
which is in them, and even <hi>partakers of other mens ſinnes,</hi>
contrary to the Apoſtles rule,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22 2. Theſ. 5.22</note> who bids us <hi>abſtain</hi> even <hi>from

            </p>
            <p>It is already ſufficiently known (beſides all former miſcarriages)
what Attempts of late have been put in practice againſt lawfull
Authority: Eſpecially by your late Remonſtrance, and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
publiſhed in oppoſition to the proceedings of Parliament; As
alſo by ſeizing and impriſoning the Kings perſon, without the
knowledge and conſent of Parliament, and by that late unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
violence offered to the Members of it, forcibly hindering above
one hundred of them (if we miſtake not the number) from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Parliament, Impriſoning many of their Perſons; though
many of them are known to us to be men of eminent Worth and
Intergrity, and who have given moſt ample Teſtimony of their
reall Affections to the good of the Kingdom; and beſides all this,
there is an intent of Framing and contriving a new module, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of the Laws and Government of the Kingdom, as of the
Conſtitution of a new kinde of <hi>Repreſentative</hi> (as you call it)
in ſtead of this and all future Parliaments; and this to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
throughout the Kingdom, under the notion of an <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the People;</hi> as is Declared in your late Remonſtrance, of
<hi>November, 16. 1648. page</hi> 67. All which practices we cannot
but judge, to be manifeſtly oppoſite to the lawfull Authority of
thoſe Magiſtrates, which God hath ſet over us, and to the Duty
and Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which by the Lawes of God and Man, and by our
manifold Oathes and Covenants, we ſtand obliged to render to
them. And therefore we judge it our Duty, rather to teſtifie our
utter diſlike, and deteſtation, then to give any (though but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite
and interpretative) approbation of them.</p>
            <p>We remember the advice of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

meerly upon the preſumption of Strength, ſhall attempt ſuch
Changes as theſe are. A<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> We cannot but be deeply affected with
grief and aſtoniſhment, to ſee that an Army, raiſed by Authority
of Parliament, for the preſervation of the Priviledges thereof, and
of our Religion, Laws and Liberties, ſhould contrary to their
Truſt, and many Ingagements, do that which tends to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
ſubverſion of them all.</p>
            <p>We have not forgotten thoſe declared Grounds and Principles,
upon which the Parliament firſt took up Arms, and upon which
We were induced to joyn with them; (from which We have not
hitherto declined, and We truſt through Gods grace never ſhall.)
We remember, That when the King, with a multitude of Armed
men, demanded but a ſmall number (in compariſon of thoſe now
ſecluded by you) of the Members of Parliament: It was deemed
ſuch an horrid violation of their Priviledges, and an act ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and deſtructive to the good of the Kingdom, as had not
(then) any precedent or parallel; And of what nature it was
judged to be, by a Parliament then free and full, may appear by
the Order of the Houſe of Commons of <hi>January</hi> 3. 1641. When,
hearing but of a purpoſe in the King to ſeize upon ſome of their
Members, they Declared, 
  <q>If any Perſon whatſoever, ſhall offer
to Arreſt, or Detain, the Perſon of any Member of this Houſe,
without firſt acquainting this Houſe therewith, and receiving
further Order from this Houſe, That it is lawfull for ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or any Perſon to aſſiſt him, and to ſtand upon his or their
Guard of Defence, and to make reſiſtance, according to the
Proteſtation taken to Defend the Priviledges of Parliament; and
by the Declaration of <hi>January</hi> 17. 1641. That the Arreſting
of any Member of Parliament, by any Warrant whatſoever,
without a Legall proceeding againſt them, and without conſent
of that Houſe, whereof ſuch Perſon is a Member, is againſt
the Liberty of the Subject, and a breach of Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And the Perſon which ſhall Arreſt any of theſe Perſons,
or any other Member of the Parliament, is Declared a publick
Enemy of the Common-wealth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this violation of their Priviledges, was that which did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105371:4"/>
firſt a Guard, and was afterwards one Reaſon of raiſing
an Army: But that an Army thus raiſed by their Authority, and
for their Preſervation, ſhould now ſo far exceed that Act which
was then eſteemed without parallel, could hardly have been ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
by us, had not our eyes been Witneſſes of it.</p>
            <p>And although both Houſes of Parliament (who are joyntly
together with the King, intruſted with the Supream Authority of
the Kingdom) ſaw cauſe to take up Armes for their own Defence,
againſt the attempts made upon them by the King and his evil
Councellours; and for the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
eſtabliſhed (which was then indangered by the growth of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Errours and Innovations;) and for the ſecuring of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Laws and Conſtitutions of the Kingdom, which they
apprehended then to be undermined by ſeverall illegall incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Yet this cannot be pleaded as any juſtification or precedent
for you (who, in reference to the Power of Magiſtracy, are but
private perſons) to uſurp an Authority over King and Parliament,
and to intermeddle with affairs which belong not to you. For the
Laws of God, Nature, and Nations, together with the Dictates
of Reaſon, and the common conſent of all Caſuiſts allow that to
thoſe which are intruſted with managing the Supream Authority
of a State or Kingdom, which they do not allow to a multitude of
private perſons, though they have ſtrength in their hands to
effect it.</p>
            <p>And moreover, although the Parliament thus took up Arms for
the defence of their Perſons and Priviledges, and the Preſervation
of Religion, Laws, and Liberties; Yet was it not their intention
thereby to do violence to the Perſon of the King, or deveſt him of
his Regall Authority, and what of right belongeth to him, (as
appears by their many Declarations in that behalf:) Much leſſe was
it their purpoſe to ſubvert and overthrow the whole frame and
fundamentall conſtitution of the Government of the Kingdbm, or
to give power and authority to any perſons whatſoever ſo
to do.</p>
            <p>And therefore we apprehend our ſelves obliged thus to appear
for the maintenance of our Religion, Laws and Liberties, together
with the Conſtitution, Power and Priviledges of Parliament, and
the ſetled Government of the Kingdom; both, on the one hand,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105371:5"/>
againſt all Malignant Counſells and Deſignes for the introduction
of an Arbitrary and Tyrannical power in the King; and, on the
other hand, againſt all irregular licentious proceedings of private

of Anarchy, Confuſion, Prophaneſſe, and Irreligion.</p>
            <p>And we are the more ſtrongly engaged thus to adhere firmly to
theſe our former juſt Principles, by reaſon of the ſeverall Oaths
and Covenants generally taken throughout the Kingdom, as by the
<hi>Proteſtation</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 5. 1641. wherein 

  <q>we do in the preſence of
Almighty God promiſe, vow and proteſt, according to the duty
of our Allegiance to maintain and defend with our lives, power
and eſtates, His Majeſties Royall Perſon, Honour and Eſtate, and
the Power and Priviledges of Parliament. As alſo by the <hi>Vow</hi> and
<hi>Covenant,</hi> wherein the Lords and Commons have declared, that
there had been a treacherous and horrid deſign to ſurprize the
Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with the Suburbs, and by
Arms to force the Parliament: And finding by conſtant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that many wayes of force and treachery are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
attempted, &amp;c. <hi>Required,</hi> That all that are true-hearted
and lovers of their Country ſhould binde themſelves each to
other in that ſacred Vow and Covenant, wherein we declare our
abhorring and deteſting the ſaid wicked and treacherous deſigne,
and that we would according to our power and vocation op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and reſiſt the ſame, and all other of the like nature.</q>

And likewiſe by the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant for the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and defence of Religion, the Honour and Happineſſe of the
King, the Peace and Safety of the Kingdomes, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein
we have Covenanted, 

  <q>That we will ſincerely, really and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
in our ſeverall Vocations, endeavour to preſerve the
Rights and Priviledges of the Parliaments, and Preſerve and
Defend the Kings Majeſties Perſon and Authority, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and defence of the true Religion, and Liberties of the
Kingdoms; that the World may bear witneſſe with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
of our Loyalty, aud that we have no thoughts or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to diminiſh His Majeſties juſt power and greatneſſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In all which obligations, though the matter of them may be
in part, of Civil concernment, yet the bond and tye of an Oath and
Covenant is Religious, ſacred, and inviolable. Which though ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105371:5"/>
may eſteem no more then an <hi>Almanack out of date,</hi> yet we look
upon it as the Oath of GOD, in whoſe Name we have ſworn, and
who will certainly require it at our hands.</p>
            <p>We know with what a jealous eye, and ſevere hand, the LORD
avenged the quarrel of his Covenant made by <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to the
King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> though extorted from him, and prejudiciall to
him.<note place="margin">Ezek. 17. 14. 15, 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Shall he proſper</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>ſhall he eſcape, that doth ſuch
things? Or ſhall he break the Covenant, and be delivered? As
I live, ſaith the Lord, ſeeing he deſpiſed the Oath by breaking the
Covenant (when ſo, he had given his hand) he ſhall not eſcape.
Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, As I live, ſurely mine Oath
that he hath deſpiſed, and my Covenant that he hath broken, even
it will I recompenſe upon his own head.</hi> We dare not therefore
(when we have lift up our hands to the moſt High God) by the
violation of a more righteous Oath, provoke the wrath of the
LORD againſt us, who is the ſearcher of all hearts, and to whom
we muſt give an Accompt at the Great Day.</p>
            <p>Inſtead therefore of joyning in Conſultation with you; We do
earneſtly intreat you in the name of our Lord and Maſter Jeſus
Chriſt, whoſe Ambaſſadors we are, That you would commune

Nor is it ſafe to be guided by Impulſes of Spirit, or pretended
